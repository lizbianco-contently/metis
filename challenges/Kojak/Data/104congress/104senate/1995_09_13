The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President under the previous order, there is \nto be a final 10 minutes of debate on two pending amendments which I \noffered. The vote is to occur at 9:10 this morning. Therefore, in light \nof the fact that we have about 7 minutes left, I will be very brief and \nsuccinct in describing the two amendments.\n  At the outset, I would like to submit for the Record an article in \nthe Washington Post yesterday by Judith Gueron, which talks about the \nway out of the welfare bind. There is one line in particular that I \ncall to the attention of my colleagues, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, who is on the floor and working this legislation. She \ntalks about time limits and she concludes that they should be tested. \nThen she goes on to say:\n\n       But given the public expectations, we cannot afford to base \n     national policies on hope rather than knowledge. The risk of \n     unintended consequences is too great.\n\n  Now, the point of these amendments is to at least provide us with \nsome security against unintended consequences. I believe the two \namendments pending will go to the heart of the debate about welfare \nreform. Are we, as a national community, going to maintain a national \ncommitment to poor children, or are we going to gamble with the future \nof millions of children?\n  I remind my colleagues, in the discussion that we have had that there \nare \n\n[[Page S 13482]]\nsome 14 million AFDC welfare recipients; 5 million of those people are \nadults, but 9.6 million--almost 10 million of them--are children. Work \nis important and certainly we all support work for adults. But it is \nthe children who have been forgotten, I think, in this debate and who \nare the unintended targets of this debate and who will suffer if there \nare any unintended consequences of our policymaking.\n  Some 60 percent of the children of the AFDC recipients are children \nunder the age of 6. So the first amendment suggests, or asserts, \nreally, that these 9 million children, 60 percent of whom are under the \nage of 6, are too precious to take a gamble that the States will \nconstruct programs that will, in fact, work, and that we, therefore, \nmake a national commitment by allowing for the child vouchers. We can \nmake a commitment that we will not allow children to go hungry or to \nbecome homeless; nor will we allow a child to become subject to the \nvicissitudes of misfortune or accidents of geography. As a nation with \na $7 trillion economy and $1.5 trillion Federal budget, I believe that \nwe can provide a minimum safety net for poor children.\n  This amendment provides for that safety net by requiring the States \nto provide vouchers for poor children who live in families that may be \nineligible or kicked off, or somehow or another not eligible for \nassistance because of rental circumstances.\n  This amendment seeks to hold the child harmless, to protect the child \neven from the behavior of their parents. If anything, Mr. President, it \nseems to me that we ought to provide some basic level of protection for \nthese children for whom all of our decisionmaking will have grave and \ndramatic impact.\n  The second amendment goes to the parents. Essentially, it says that \nof those 5 million parents who are being called on to work in this \nwelfare reform, as to those individuals--parenthetically, all of us \nagree that anybody who can work should work--but the State, in the \nlegislation, is required to set forth a work plan for those individuals \nthat they deem needed. But if the State does not live up to its part of \nthe bargain, that State does not provide jobs assistance, job training, \ndoes not follow its own plan--not a plan we are imposing from \nWashington, but if the State does not do what it needs to do with \nregard to job training and placement of the adult, then this amendment \nsays that the State should not eliminate assistance for those \nindividuals who they have themselves failed.\n  Again, I want to bring to the attention the second part of the \narticle called ``A Way Out of the Welfare Bind.'' She says:\n\n       States, in any case, are concluding that time limits do not \n     alleviate the need for effective welfare-to-work programs. In \n     a current study of states that are testing time-limit \n     programs, we have found that state and local administrators \n     are seeking to expand and strengthen activities meant to help \n     recipients prepare for and find jobs before reaching the time \n     limit. Otherwise, too many will ``hit the cliff'' and either \n     require public jobs, which will cost more than welfare, or \n     face dramatic loss of income with unknown effects on families \n     and children and, ultimately, public budgets.\n\n  That goes to the heart of the debate here, that in the event there \nare unintended consequences of our decisionmaking, we should assure \nthat the unintended consequences do not impact the children--again, 60 \npercent of whom are under the age of 6, or alternatively, that people \nare not penalized for circumstances beyond their control.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                     A Way Out of the Welfare Bind\n\n                         (By Judith M. Gueron)\n\n       Much of this year's debate over welfare reform in \n     Washington has focused on two broad issues: which level of \n     government--state or federal--should be responsible for \n     designing welfare programs, and how much money the federal \n     government should be spending.\n       The debate has strayed from the more critical issue of how \n     to create a welfare system that does what the public wants it \n     to do. Numerous public opinion polls have identified three \n     clear objectives for welfare reform: putting recipients to \n     work, protecting their children from severe poverty and \n     controlling costs.\n       Unfortunately, these goals are often in conflict--progress \n     toward one or two often pulls us further from the others. And \n     when the dust settles in Washington, real-life welfare \n     administrators and staff in states, counties and cities will \n     still face the fundamental question of how to balance this \n     triad of conflicting public expectations.\n       Because welfare is such an emotional issue, it is a magnet \n     for easy answers and inflated promises. But the reality is \n     not so simple. Some say we should end welfare. That might \n     indeed force many recipients to find jobs, but it could also \n     cause increased suffering for children, who account for two-\n     thirds of welfare recipients. Some parents on welfare face \n     real obstacles to employment or can find only unstable or \n     part-time jobs.\n       Others say we should put welfare recipients to work in \n     community service jobs--workfare. This is a popular approach \n     that seems to offer a way to reduce dependency and protect \n     children. But, when done on a large scale, especially with \n     single parents, this would likely cost substantially more \n     than sending out welfare checks every month. To date, we \n     haven't been willing to make the investment.\n       During the past two decades, reform efforts, shaped by the \n     triad of public goals, have gradually defined a bargain \n     between government and welfare recipients: The government \n     provides income support and a range of services to help \n     recipients prepare for and find jobs. Recipients must \n     participate in these activities or have their checks reduced.\n       We now know conclusively that, when it is done right, the \n     welfare-to-work approach offers a way out of the bind. \n     Careful evaluations have shown that tough, adequately funded \n     welfare-to-work programs can be four-fold winners: They can \n     get parents off welfare and into jobs, support children (and, \n     in some cases, make them better off), save money for \n     taxpayers and make welfare more consistent with public \n     values.\n       A recent study looked at three such programs in Atlanta, \n     Grand Rapids, Mich., and Riverside, Calif. It found that the \n     programs reduced the number of people on welfare by 16 \n     percent, decreased welfare spending by 22 percent and \n     increased participants' earnings by 26 percent. Other data on \n     the Riverside program showed that, over time, it saved almost \n     $3 for every $1 it cost to run the program. This means that \n     ultimately it would have cost the government more--far more--\n     had it not run the program.\n       In order to achieve results of this magnitude, it is \n     necessary to dramatically change the tone and message of \n     welfare. When you walk in the door of a high-performance, \n     employment-focused program, it is clear that you are there\n      for one purpose--to get a job. Staff continually announce \n     job openings and convey an upbeat message about the value \n     of work and people's potential to succeed. You--and \n     everybody else subject to the mandate--are required to \n     search for a job, and if you don't find one, to \n     participate in short-term education, training or community \n     work experience.\n       You cannot just mark time; if you do not make progress in \n     the education program, for example, the staff will insist \n     that you look for a job. Attendance is tightly monitored, and \n     recipients who miss activities without a good reason face \n     swift penalties.\n       If welfare looked like this everywhere, we probably \n     wouldn't be debating this issue again today.\n       Are these programs a panacea? No. We could do better. \n     Although the Atlanta, Grand Rapids, and Riverside programs \n     are not the only strong ones, most welfare offices around the \n     country do not look like the one I just described.\n       In the past, the ``bargain''--the mutual obligation of \n     welfare recipients and government--has received broad \n     support, but reformers have succumbed to the temptation to \n     promise more than they have been willing to pay for. Broader \n     change will require a substantial up-front investment of \n     funds and serious, sustained efforts to change local welfare \n     offices. This may seem mundane, but changing a law is only \n     the first step toward changing reality.\n       It's possible that more radical approaches--such as time \n     limits--will do an even better job. They should be tested. \n     But given the public expectations, we cannot afford to base \n     national policies on hope rather than knowledge. The risk of \n     unintended consequences is too great.\n       States, in any case, are concluding that time limits do not \n     alleviate the need for effective welfare-to-work programs. In \n     a current study of states that are testing time-limit \n     programs, we have found that state and local administrators \n     are seeking to expand and strengthen activities meant to help \n     recipients prepare for and find jobs before reaching the time \n     limit. Otherwise, too many will ``hit the cliff'' and either \n     require public jobs, which will cost more than welfare, or \n     face a dramatic loss of income with unknown effects on \n     families and children and, ultimately, public budgets.\n       Welfare-to-work programs are uniquely suited to meeting the \n     public's demand for policies that promote work, protect \n     children and control costs. But despite the demonstrated \n     effectiveness of this approach, the proposals currently under \n     debate in Washington may make it more difficult for states to \n     build an employment-focused welfare system. Everyone claims \n     to favor ``work,'' but this is only talk unless there's an \n     adequate initial investment and clear incentives for states \n     to transform welfare while continuing to support children.\n\n[[Page S 13483]]\n\n       Many of the current proposals promise easy answers where \n     none exist. In the past, welfare reform has generated much \n     heat but little light. We are now starting to see some light. \n     We should move toward it.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I see my time has expired. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I think the Senator from Illinois hit \nthe nail right on the head in talking about the issue of unintended \nconsequences. How can we risk to do this, to put a time limit on people \non welfare? I wish we would have had that same discussion back when we \ninstituted all these welfare programs in the sixties, because when we \ndid that we had absolutely no idea what was going to happen. We had no \nidea of the unintended consequences. We had no idea that the harm that \nhas been caused by all of these programs, the dependency that exists in \nthis country because of these programs, had we thought about these \nunintended consequences, we may have not have done that, but we did it \nanyway, without any proof that what we were passing was going to be \nbeneficial to the American citizens. We had no proof at all. In fact, \nin the thirties when these were initially realized they were \nreplacements for private charity systems that were networks of \ncharities that are all over the country.\n  We said, no, the Government will take more responsibility. Franklin \nRoosevelt warned us about the subtle narcotic being delivered to the \nmasses on welfare. We ignored a lot of the naysayers out there at the \ntime, saying big Government programs and unlimited welfare were going \nto be a real problem for this country, were going to be a \ndisintegration of community, family, and the support that we have seen \nin communities. We ignored all that and just plowed ahead.\n  Now we are saying, ``Oh my goodness, we cannot change that because we \ndo not know what will happen.'' Well, we changed it in the 1930's and \nthe 1960's without knowing what would happen. We found out what has \nhappened, and it is a big problem.\n  To suggest now we cannot find some moderation, we are not talking \nabout pulling the Government out of welfare, we are talking about \nputting a limit on the amount of assistance that we are going to give \npeople, and changing the system from one of a maintenance and \ndependency system to one that is a dynamic transitional system.\n  I think that is a good middle ground that we have established with \nthis piece of legislation.\n  What the amendment of the Senator from Illinois will do is perpetuate \na system of dependency, of maintenance of poverty. I think it hopefully \nwill be rejected by the Senate.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment \nnumbered 2471.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2472\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to be able to vote \nintelligently on this amendment. I hope the Senate will give its \nattention to Members who are attempting to explain briefly these \namendments. I hope the Chair will insist on order in the Senate, and I \nfor one will applaud the Chair for the effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Chair can name names if that becomes necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senators take their conversations off the \nfloor.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair very much. I will be brief.\n  Essentially, the second amendment also deals with unintended \nconsequences. But unlike the amendment that applied, or was directed at \nalmost 10 million children who are presently on welfare, this one \napplies, or is directed, to the approximately 5 million adults who are \nrecipients under the various programs in the States.\n  Essentially, what it says is that the State will do what it says it \nis going to do. It is intended to address the issue of unintended \nconsequences where a State has not provided job assistance, where the \neconomy in the State has pockets of high unemployment, where a \nrecession occurs or plants leave and individuals cannot work because \nthere are no jobs. Then the State will not in that situation throw an \nindividual off of welfare who wants to work, who needs to work, who \nwants to support their family and has no other way of providing for \ntheir children.\n  I had introduced earlier an article out of the Washington Post \nregarding welfare-to-work programs. Certainly, we all agree that \nanybody who can work should work. There is no debate, I think, about \nthat. But in the event there are no jobs, in the event there is high \nunemployment, in the event there is some economic downturn over which \nan individual has no control, the question is, are we prepared to \naccept the consequences, the unintended consequences of an able-bodied \nperson who wants to work, who is unable to work, being unable to \nprovide anything for their children.\n  Many States are such as my own. In Illinois, 64 percent of the \ncaseload resides in one county. In that instance, it seems to me that a \nState should be called on to do what the State says it is going to do. \nThis is not imposing anything on the States other than the States have \nimposed on themselves. This, it seems to me, is a reasonable moderation \nof our approach in turning this issue over to the States, letting the \nStates create their plan. It simply says the State will do what the \nState says it will do in regard to job assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nIn my opinion, this amendment really is a back-door effort to have a \ncontinued entitlement. This creates a new entitlement which requires \nthe States to provide services. It tries to get around the idea of \nhaving a time limit, a limitation on welfare.\n  I remember President Clinton's statement that we want to end welfare \n\n[[Page S 13484]]\n  as we know it. This amendment basically is an effort to exempt the 5-\nyear time limit to keep an open-ended entitlement. This opens up States \nalso to lawsuits from recipients who do not get the type of training \nthey want rather than what the State thinks they need.\n  I might mention we had a similar type provision that was earlier \ndefeated.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues would vote ``no'' on this \namendment.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2565\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes for debate equally divided on the Graham amendment No. 2565, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, under the Dole bill, we are fundamentally \nchanging the covenants of welfare. It seems to me and other supporters \nof this amendment that we should be fundamentally changing the way we \ndesign our formulas. Instead, under the Dole bill, we continue to use a \nformula that is based upon an older system.\n  Instead, what the Graham-Bumpers amendment does is provides a formula \nthat is based on fairness and guided by three principles: First, that \nthe block grant should be based on need; second, the funding level \nshould respond to changes in the poverty level; and third, the States \nshould not be permanently disadvantaged based upon their policy choices \nand circumstances made in 1994.\n  Mr. President, the Graham-Bumpers children's fair share proposal \nmeets the test that I have just described by allocating funding based \nupon the number of poor children in each State, a formula just for \nchanges in the population of children in poverty, so it does not lock \nStates into an outdated funding level.\n  I point out to my colleagues something I suspect they already know, \nand that is, child poverty has enormous economic costs. It has huge \nhuman costs as well. Low-income children are twice as likely to suffer \nfrom stunted growth, twice as likely as other children to die from \nbirth defects, and three times more likely to die from all causes \ncombined.\n  It has been estimated that there are $36 to $177 billion in lower \nproductivity coming from the American economy as a consequence of child \npoverty. It has enormous future costs as well. There is a University of \nMichigan study that those children under age 5 who experience at least \n1 year of poverty have significantly lower IQ scores. If we are going \nto change our welfare system to a block grant, we need to change our \nfunding formula to address child poverty. I cannot imagine--except for \nStates that lose money, and some will under this formula. Unless your \nStates lose money, I do not know how you can do anything other than to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Texas [Mrs. \nHutchison] is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes from our 10 minutes \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nis recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I find \nit interesting that the Senator from Nebraska is standing up here \narguing for this amendment. It is very magnanimous of him. I know \noriginally his State gains. I am not too sure he is aware that after 5 \nyears, the State of Nebraska goes from $100 million down to $23 \nmillion, which is actually less money than they are getting now under \nthe current formula. They will get less money.\n  The Senator from Nevada spoke on this amendment yesterday. They will \nget less money under this formula. There is no hold harmless here.\n  You should look at the formula not just in the first year, but over 5 \nyears. Your numbers come down. Nevada is one. Actually, your \nmaintenance of effort in Nebraska and Nevada, under the 80 percent \nmaintenance-of-effort provision, will be required to pay more than what \nthe Federal share will be, because you will be required to maintain 80 \npercent, but your number is going to come down below that.\n  Look at the numbers over the 5 years and you will see States like \nCalifornia, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, \nNevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington all will \nhave higher maintenance-of-effort requirements than Federal \ncontributions under the Graham amendment.\n  Throw away parochialism. This is bad public policy. We are going to \nsay on the floor of the Senate that we are going to make you pay more \nthan what the Federal share will be to your States. That is wrong.\n  Hawaii is one of the big losers. I see the Senator from Hawaii here. \nThey are going to have to pay more out of their own State coffers than \nwill come from the Federal Government over a period of time. Some of \nthese States get a little bump at the beginning, but what you do not \nsee is they do not hold the small States harmless, and, over time, \ntheir number comes down and comes down dramatically.\n  In fact, if you look at the States that lose over time--I will go \nthrough them quickly--other than the States I just mentioned, because \nall the States I mentioned lose over time. In addition to those States, \nyou have Alaska, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New \nHampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont. I mentioned \nWashington State before. You may think you are getting a boost under \nthis, because if you look at it in the first year, you do, but with a \nlot of those States, over time their allocation, according to the \nformula, goes down.\n  So do not look at the first year and be suckered into a vote in favor \nof this amendment because you get a little bump at the start. Over \ntime, the big winners--and I give a lot of credit to the Senator from \nTexas for standing up--Florida and Texas are the two big States that \nare going to be the big, big winners under this and the rest of the \nother States, particularly the small States in the West, the Midwest, \nand Northeast, are going to get hammered over the next 5 years.\n  Again, throw parochialism aside. To suggest that we are going to make \n12 States maintain a higher effort of State dollars than we will give \nthem \n\n[[Page S 13485]]\nFederal dollars is wrong. It is absolutely wrong, I do not care where \nyou come from. That is what this amendment does. It is misguided, it is \nunfair, not just to the States involved, but I think unfair to children \nin general.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me start by asking the Senator from \nPennsylvania, before he leaves the floor, if he thinks this country is \nfair to the children, when the District of Columbia, under this bill, \nis going to get $4,222 per child, and the State of Arkansas is going to \nget $390.\n  Do you know why a child in the District of Columbia is worth $4,200, \n11 times more than the child in Arkansas? Because for years, the \nFederal Government says whatever you put in, we will match it. So they \nhave matched it over the years. And now we are institutionalizing a \ngross inequity.\n  What we are saying in this bill is, if you happen to come from a poor \nState, no matter how hard you try, no matter how much money you did \nyour very best to put in AFDC, you could not match Pennsylvania, New \nYork, Massachusetts. Those States made a monumental effort, and we \nshould congratulate them for it. But to say now 1994 is the be-all and \nend-all, whatever you contributed in 1994 is what you are going to get \nforever?\n  In short, if you are poor, you stay poor. If you are affluent, you \nstay affluent. There are Governors in this country--the Republicans got \na lot of Governorships last year, and I guarantee you that a lot of \nthem have already cut their contribution. No matter, it is 1994 that \ncounts.\n  I cannot believe we are doing this. I could not vote for this bill in \n100 years with this formula in it. How will I go home and tell the \npeople of my State that a child in New York is worth $2,200 and their \npoor children are worth $400, or a child in the District of Columbia is \nworth $4,200 and our children worth $400?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I rise \nto oppose this Graham-Bumpers formula. I must say--and I say it \nrespectfully--this formula is sudden death for California. It will cost \nCalifornia about $1 billion. It is enormous in its impact.\n  There is no fiscal year in which California comes close to what is \noffered in the Dole bill, and I think the Dole bill formula is bad for \nCalifornia. So that is why I say this is sudden death.\n  Frankly, I respect the Senator from Arkansas very much, but how a \nformula can be justified, which essentially says we will reward States \nwho do very little for their poor people and we will seriously \ndisadvantage States that are willing to do more for their poor people, \nI have a hard time understanding that logic.\n  This is a Government that has practiced devolution. This is a \nGovernment that has said more and more that it is the responsibility of \nthe State. Yet, in this bill, they seek to punish those who have a high \nmaintenance of effort.\n  For California, over the 5-year period, this bill will cost $1 \nbillion. The impact is enormous. There is no amendment that has been \nproposed that has a greater negative impact on the State of California \nthan does this.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We will reserve our 6 minutes to close.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the senior \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Texas.\n  Mr. President, last evening, we debated this matter in greater \nlength. I took the liberty to go over the historical provision of the \nentitlement by States to a matching share of their expenditures on \nchildren. From the first, it has been a formula designed to move more \nFederal funds to the South and West, out of the North and East. The \nratio is determined by the square of the difference between the State's \nper capita income and national per capita income. States have received \nas much as an 83 percent Federal match. New York and California get the \nlowest Federal match rate: 50 percent.\n  We have since recalculated our poverty data to account for cost of \nliving. Mr. President, may I make this point? Adjusted for the CPI, New \nYork State has the sixth highest incidence of poverty in the country. \nFlorida has the 20th highest. Arkansas has the 19th highest. New York \nis a poorer State than Arkansas. A new idea, I grant; new data, I \nassert. But truth as well.\n  This amendment would cost California $5.4 billion and New York $4.6 \nbillion. Not because we have had an advantage in the Federal formula. \nTo the contrary. It is because we have had a civic policy that has \nsought caring for children to be a higher priority than perhaps some \nothers have done, or we felt we had the capacity, even in the face of \nthe data that suggests we have not.\n  This is an elemental injustice. I am openly conflicted. If this \namendment passes, the bill dies. But in the first instance, I will \nremain loyal to the principle of the last 60 years.\n  My time has expired. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the junior \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York, who are opposing this \namendment.\n  This amendment is not about welfare reform. It is about pitting \nregion against region, about enriching certain States at the expense of \nothers, about taking money from States which have made an effort to \ndeal with the plight of poor children and poor adults and just \nidentifying 15 States and saying we are going to give you more money so \nwe can buy your votes. That is wrong.\n  Let me tell you what it does to our State of New York. It costs us, \nas Senator Moynihan has indicated, $4.5 billion over 5 years. It will \ncost us nearly $1 billion in the first year alone.\n  Let us talk about maintenance of effort. Senator Santorum has spoken \nto it. We have to maintain an effort at 80 percent. Under this \namendment, the State of New York will spend $600 million a year more \nthan it gets from the Federal side. Let us talk about rich and poor, \nabout poverty, and what people are worth and are not worth, as it \nrelates to the Northeast and Midwest. We sent $690 billion more in \ntaxes to Washington than we received in the past 14 years. I thank my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from New York, because \nunder his stewardship, the coalition put these numbers together.\n  Let us talk about the State of New York. In the last 14 years, during \nthe same period of time, we sent $142.3 billion more to Washington in \ntaxes than we have received in what we call ``allocable spending.'' Let \nus look at the State of Florida. They have gotten back from Washington \n$38.5 billion more during that same period of time than they sent down \nto Washington in taxes. Now we see nothing other than a raid on New \nYork, and its poor children in particular. Maybe what we should do is \ndiscuss an amendment to reallocate some of the Federal funds that flow \nto States such as Florida to give relief to those disadvantaged States \nin the Northeast and Midwest--New York, Pennsylvania and others--that \nalready get less than their fair share of Federal allocable spending. \nInstead we have before us an amendment that would transfer more money \nto Florida at the expense of poor children in New York.\n  So I urge defeat of this amendment. It is a bad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Has our time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to close on this amendment, we have \n\n[[Page S 13486]]\n  heard a lot about the phrase that ``we want to change welfare as we \nhave known it'' and that it is a failed system. There are many \ncitations as so what those failures are. If one of the objectives of \nthe welfare system was, as the senior Senator from New York has stated, \nto move resources from the Northeast to the South and West, we will add \nthat as an additional failure of the welfare system.\n  How can you say that a system has accomplished that objective of \nassisting the poorest States in America when Texas receives one-fifth \nthe amount of funds for its poor children as does New York and when \nArkansas receives one-eleventh of the funds per poor child as does the \nDistrict of Columbia?\n Another example of the failed system.\n\n  Assume that we were to start this process with a blank piece of \npaper. Assume we had never distributed Federal money for the purposes \nof assisting poor children and assisting the guardians--particularly \nthe single, female heads of households--of those poor children to get \noff welfare and on to work and thus independence. How would we go about \nallocating the money?\n  First, I think we want to allocate it in a manner that would, in \nfact, make the system work, that would provide a sufficient amount of \nresources into each of the communities of America to allow the kinds of \ntraining programs and child care to be functional, to accomplish the \nobjective of moving from dependence to independence through work.\n  Second, we want to have elemental fairness in how those funds are \ndistributed. That is the essence of the amendment that is before us \ntoday, Mr. President.\n  This amendment follows the simple principle, take the total number of \npoor children in America--they are America's poor children. They are \nnot Florida's poor children or California's poor children, they are \nAmerica's poor children. The funds will come from all Americans through \nthe Federal Treasury. Take the number of poor children in the country, \ndivide that into the funds we have available, approximately $17 billion \na year, and distribute the money wherever the poor children are. That \nseems to me to be an imminently reasonable approach and a fair approach \nin terms of achieving the objective.\n  The amendment that has been offered by Senator Dole would distribute \n99 percent of the Federal dollars to the status quo. However, the money \nwhich was distributed in 1994 will be distributed in the year 2000, \nwithout regard to any changes. There can be a depression in Colorado, \nyou can have enormous growth in Arizona, you can have a depopulated \nMichigan, and yet you will get the same money in the year 2000 that you \ngot in the year 1994. That does not sound like a fair, reasonable plan, \nor a plan which will accomplish the objective of this legislation.\n  Much has been made by the Senator from Pennsylvania about maintenance \nof effort. Frankly, maintenance of effort has been a moving target \nthroughout this debate. We had no maintenance of effort when we started \nthis debate. We defeated an amendment yesterday to require a \ncontinuation of maintenance of effort. Whatever final position we take \non this formula, obviously, we will have to readdress the issue of \nmaintenance of effort.\n  Mr. President, I believe there are a number of considerations that \nMembers of this Senate ought to take into account as they decide \nwhether to vote on this amendment. First, the Dole amendment does not \nrespond to economic or demographic changes. Second, the Dole amendment \nrewards inefficiency. New York State spends over $100 per welfare case \nfor administration. West Virginia spends $13. Yet, those inefficiencies \nare going to be rewarded in that New York State will get a higher \nproportion of the money, in part because it has been more inefficient \nin utilizing the funds available.\n  The mandates that we are imposing, heavy mandates in training and in \nchild care, will be much more difficult to meet in a State like Texas, \nwhere 84 percent of the money Texas gets from the Federal Government \nwill have to be spent to meet the mandates of training and child care. \nIn Mississippi, 88 percent of the money will have to be used, whereas \nin more affluent States, less than 40 percent of their Federal funds \nwill be required in order to meet these mandates.\n  Much has been said about the fact, Mr. President, that we are going \nto be moving toward parity under the Dole amendment, that eventually we \nwill get to the goal that all children will be fairly and equally \ntreated. How long will that trail take? Let me give some examples.\n  How long will it take from today, using the Dole formula, for the \nState of Alabama's poor children to have the same worth in terms of the \ndistribution of Federal funds as do the poor children of the rest of \nAmerica? Mr. President, 74 years is how long it will take Alabama; \nDelaware, 39 years; Louisiana, 79 years; Idaho, 42 years; Mississippi, \n100 years before the poor children of Mississippi reach the average of \nthe Nation; Florida, 29; Nevada, 29; Illinois, 13; South Carolina, 78 \nyears before South Carolina's poor children reach the average of the \nNation in terms of the distribution of the Nation's resources for poor \nchildren; South Dakota, 27 years; Texas, 75 years.\n  How, in 1995, do we support a formula which has that degree of \ninequity and unfairness, and the fundamental undermining of the ability \nof this legislation to achieve its intended result, to change welfare \nas we have known it by giving people a chance, a chance to move from \ndependency to independence through work.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2565, offered by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order there will now be 20 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Domenici amendment, No. 2575, \nto be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The time will be divided four ways--5 minutes each to Senators \nDomenici, Gramm, Daschle, and Dole.\n\n\n         Postponement of Vote on Amendments Nos. 2672 and 2608\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Regular order, Mr. President. What is the regular \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the consideration of the \nDomenici amendment with 5 minutes to each to be allocated to Senators \nDomenici, Daschle, Gramm, and Dole.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it was my understanding that there was \nto be 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. It totals 20 minutes \ndivided four ways.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, [Mr. Domenici], \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Moynihan, on the minority side, \nand I have decided that I will control 10 minutes with him using part \nof that. That means there are 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nDole, 5 minutes, and Senator Gramm, 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak for 2 minutes, and if you will \ntell me when I have used the 2 minutes I would appreciate it.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Specter be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Governor Engler testified before the \nBudget Committee that conservative strings to block grants were no \nbetter than liberal strings to block grants. A man saying that was not \njust an ordinary Governor but a Governor who is advocating no strings \non the block grants in welfare. He said leave this issue that is before \nus--the family cap--up to the States. Give them the option to decide \namongst a myriad of approaches to the very difficult problem of welfare \nteenagers and welfare mothers having children. He said let us \nexperiment in the great democratic tradition in the sovereign States, \nand we are apt to do a better job.\n  What I propose is very simple. It mandates nothing. So nobody should \nthink I am mandating that there be no family cap. I am merely saying \neach State in its plan decides this issue for itself. If they want a \ncap, they can have a cap. If they want to decide to try something \ndifferent, they try something different.\n  It seems to me that is in the best tradition of what Republicans and \nconservative Democrats have been saying when they say send these \nprograms to the States so they can manage them properly and let those \nwho are closest to the grassroots--the State legislatures and \nGovernors--decide how to do it.\n  There is nothing complicated about it. Again, I do not mandate \nanything. What my amendment says is the States can do it however they \nwant with reference to the family cap or using cash payments for \nchildren who are part of a welfare situation where there is already one \nchild, another one is born, and the States can decide how to handle \nthat. We do not have all the wisdom here in Washington. That is the \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Bradley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Domenici \namendment.\n  New Jersey is the only State that has actually implemented a family \ncap. It took effect almost 2 years ago as part of a comprehensive \nreform of welfare which combines such disincentives as the family cap \nalong with strong positive incentives for welfare recipients to work, \nand to marry. Almost from the day the family cap took effect we have \nbeen bombarded with people declaring absolutely that it works, and \nabsolutely that it does not work. We have heard that there is a 1-\npercent reduction in birth rates to parents on welfare. We have also \nthen, based on an evaluation by Rutgers, heard that there was no \ndifference in births. We heard there was an increase in abortions. Then \nwe heard that there was but it was not statistically significant. Never \nhave such dramatic conclusions be drawn from such shaky and preliminary \nnumbers.\n  Let me simply reiterate that from New Jersey's perspective--what \neveryone involved in the program has said--it is an experiment. I \nrepeat, it is an experiment. We only have a year of data. We know only \nthat a total of 1,500 fewer children were born to welfare recipients \nthan over the previous 12 months. But births overall are down, and a \ndifference of 1,500 births does not mean at all much compared to \n125,000 total births in the State in the same period. At the same time, \nwe penalize 6,000 families on welfare in which children were born.\n  Is the tradeoff of 6,000 children denied benefits worth the 1,500 \nhypothetical children whose mothers thought twice before becoming \npregnant, or, on the other hand, who had abortions? I do not know. Will \nthese numbers change? Will the message sink in? I do not know.\n  The basic point is that it is an experiment. We have inconclusive \ndata.\n  We should not mandate something when we do not know what we are \ndoing. States should be able to experiment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized to speak for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, but I rise in opposition to his amendment.\n  So let me tell you that we have been trying to craft a bill here and \nmaintain a balance to get enough people on board to pass a very strong \nwelfare reform bill. And I believe we are on the verge of accomplishing \nthat. In fact, I hope we can do it by tomorrow. In fact, we need to do \nit by tomorrow.\n  I understand precisely what the Domenici amendment does. It simply \nstrikes a provision in our bill that prohibits additional cash to \nchildren born to families receiving assistance.\n  I know the Catholic bishops feel very strongly about this, and the \nCatholic charities, because they deal with a lot of these families. \nThey understand some of the problems.\n  As I have suggested, I think our bill has structured the right \nbalance on the important issue of out-of-wedlock births.\n  I am committed to supporting a provision in our bill which allows \nStates to provide vouchers in lieu of cash assistance. We think that \ngoes a step in the direction that we think the bishops and others who \nsupport the Domenici amendment want to go.\n  Under this provision, I believe the children in need will be provided \nsupport. They are going to have vouchers, not going to have cash but \nvouchers, and the important thing is that these vouchers may be used \nfor goods and services to provide for the care of the children \ninvolved. In addition, we all know that other forms of Federal and \nState aid remain available.\n  This has been one of the most difficult issues. The family cap and \nwhether you have cash payments for teenage moms are probably the two \nmost difficult issues we have faced, two of the most difficult issues \nwe have faced in putting a welfare reform package together.\n  I understand the concerns that Senator Domenici expressed. I have \ntalked with the Catholic bishops. They have been in my office. I have \ntalked with Catholic Charities. They have been in my office. But I have \ntalked to others who feel just as strongly on the other side. I also \nhave talked with the Governors, and they do not want any strings. They \ndo not want conservative or liberal strings. But they know in some \ncases they are going to have strings. I do not know of any objection by \nthe Governors with reference to the family cap. I think they would \naccept that. They may not like it, but they would accept it. So I would \nhope that we also give flexibility in the family cap provision. If we \ndo not deal with out-of-wedlock births, then we are really not dealing \nwith welfare reform.\n  We have had a number of Governors--12 States--who have currently \nreceived waivers from the Federal Government to experiment with some \nversion of the family cap. However, our proposal also maintains \nconsiderable flexibility for \n\n[[Page S 13488]]\nthese States and addresses the crisis of out-of-wedlock births.\n  The crisis in our country must be faced. Thirty percent of America's \nchildren today are born out of wedlock. And many believe we, at the \nFederal level, must send a clear signal. We believe the underlying \nproposal which is identical to the one agreed to by the House does just \nthat. We are going to be in conference in any event.\n  Let me emphasize again that we have tried to keep everybody together \nin this proposal. I am not certain what happens if this Domenici \namendment is adopted. We will still have an opportunity in conference. \nBut we have crafted a very careful bill here to respond to the needs of \nmany. Unlike the situation of single teenage mothers in poverty, this \nprovision mostly affects families.\n  It seems to many of us the time has come when these families must \nface more directly whether they are ready to care for the children they \nbring into the world. That is the reason for the family cap.\n  So somebody has to make some decision out there--the families \nthemselves, the parents, the mother. We believe the family cap will \ncertainly encourage someone to make that decision and that if you \ncontinue cash payments, there is no restraint at all.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, it is hard for me to take this argument about States \nrights seriously when Senator Domenici has another amendment, amendment \n2573, that mandates how much States pay on welfare. So let us make it \nclear. This is not an issue about flexibility. This is not an issue \nabout strings. This is an issue about reform.\n  The Domenici amendment preserves the status quo. And what is the \nstatus quo? The status quo is that one out of every three babies born \nin America today is born out of wedlock. The status quo is if we \ncontinue to give people more and more money to have more and more \nchildren on welfare, by the end of this century illegitimacy will be \nthe norm and not the exception in America. No great civilization has \never risen that was not built on strong families. No great civilization \nhas ever survived the destruction of its families, and I fear the \nUnited States of America will not be the first.\n  Under existing law, States can do exactly what Senator Domenici's \namendment allows them to do. What his amendment will do is perpetuate a \nsystem which subsidizes illegitimacy, which gives cash bonuses to \npeople who have more and more people on welfare.\n  The compromise we have hammered out helps children. It provides \nvouchers. It provides them the ability to take care of them. But it \ndoes not provide cash incentives for people to have children that they \ncannot support.\n  What a great paradox it is that while families across America are \npulling the wagon, both husband and wife working every day to save \nenough money to have a baby, they are paying taxes to support programs \nlike this one which is subsidizing people to have babies that they \ncannot support.\n  I think if we are going to deal with welfare reform, if we are going \nto have a bill worthy of the name, we have to defeat this amendment.\n  I do not know what is going to happen on this amendment. Obviously, I \nam concerned about it. It breaks the deal that we have negotiated. It \nbasically eliminates the glue that held a compromise together.\n  I am very concerned about the fate of welfare reform if this \namendment is adopted. In the end, whether we have to do it in \nconference or whether it is not done, I am not going to support a bill \nthat does not deal with illegitimacy. There is no way you can solve the \nwelfare problem and not deal with illegitimacy. It is the basic cause \nof the problem, and I think we are running away from it with this \namendment. I hope my colleagues will oppose it.\n  This is a crisis in America. It is a crisis that has got to be dealt \nwith. I think to assume that the problem is simply going to go away is \na bad mistake. Then he opposes even a modest limitation on the use of \nFederal funds turned over to the States.\n  My position is different. Do not tell the States how to spend their \nown money but set a few basic moral principles for the use of Federal \nfunds. I believe that Federal funds should not subsidize illegitimacy.\n  This amendment is a complete reversal of the agreement we reached on \nthis bill. It is time we take our commitment seriously and defeat this \namendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we pool the 10, how much do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, Senator Moynihan \nhas 5 minutes given to him by Senator Daschle, and Senator Nickles has \none-half yielded by Senator Dole.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield--how much time does the Senator want to use?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two minutes to Senator Moynihan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Moynihan is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in the current issue of the Economist, \nthe cover story is ``The Disappearing Family,'' and it speaks of the \nproblem of out-of-wedlock births. It says of this Senator that I have \ntaken this problem seriously for 30 years. It quotes an earlier \nstatement that ``a community without fathers asks for and gets chaos.''\n  I am not new to this subject, and I am very much opposed to a family \ncap of any kind. This is not the way to deal with this baffling and \nprofoundly serious subject. When my friend from Texas cites the \nprojections of where we will be at the end of the century, those, sir, \nare my projections. It has been a field I have worked in as he has \nworked in his field. But the dictum of the Catholic Charities is that \nthe first principle in welfare reform must be ``do no harm.''\n  These children have not asked to be conceived, and they have not \nasked to come into the world. We have an elemental responsibility to \nthem. And so I hope, regarding the most fundamentally moral issue we \nwill face on this floor, that we will not have the State deny benefits \nto children because of the mistakes, or what else you will say, of \ntheir parents.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield Senator Breaux 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Domenici amendment. \nThere is no disagreement in this body by either Republicans or \nDemocrats on the question of illegitimacy. We oppose it very strongly \nand are looking for ways to help curtail it in this country. My State \nhas the second highest illegitimacy rate in the country; 40 percent of \nall children born are illegitimate.\n  The question is, how do you solve it? Do you solve it by punishing \nthe children or do you solve it by requiring work requirements for the \nparents, by requiring them to live under adult supervision, by \nrequiring them to take work training, by requiring them to live in a \nfamily setting? I suggest that the way to do it is by those types of \nrequirements. Do not penalize the child.\n  The current bill says absolutely a new child that is born will get no \nhelp. That is a mandate. It is says, well, the States have the option \nif they want to give a voucher they can. They do not have to. The \nDomenici bill changes that and the Domenici bill says that, if a child \nis born, we are going to look at that child as an innocent victim. And \nthat is the proper approach. States that have had mandatory caps have \nnot seen illegitimacy birth rates go down. But they have seen abortion \nrates go up. I do not think that is what this Senate wants to stand \nfor. I urge the strong support of the Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Could I say that the Senator from New York is a \ncosponsor, and on both sides there is support.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Domenici-Moynihan amendment. And I have strong \nsupport for it.\n\n[[Page S 13489]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, everyone I heard speak on this issue said \nillegitimacy is a very serious problem. There is no question that it \nis. Illegitimacy has been exploding in this country, and, as a result, \nwe have increased crime, we have increased welfare.\n  We need to break that cycle. The present system is we subsidize \nillegitimacy, the more children born out of wedlock the more Federal \nmoney they received. That is the present system. A lot of us think that \nis wrong. This bill says that there will be no additional under the \nDole bill--not the Domenici amendment, the Dole bill says we are not \ngoing to give additional Federal cash payments for welfare families if \nthey have additional children.\n  It does not say the States. If the States are really adamant and say \nthey want to help and do it in the form of cash, they can use their own \nmoney. The bill allows them to give noncash benefits, so they can take \nsome of the block grant money and use noncash benefits in the form of \nvouchers and give. But we do not want to have cash incentives for \nadditional children born out of wedlock. So I think Senator Dole has a \ngood provision, and it is with regret that I oppose my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Domenici's amendment.\n  One final comment. I heard New Jersey mentioned. The Heritage \nFoundation did a report. I will capsulize.\n  New Jersey is the only State in the Nation that instituted a family \ncap policy, denying an increase in cash welfare benefits to mothers who \nhave additional children while already receiving welfare. The evidence \ncurrently available from New Jersey indicates that a family cap has \nresulted in a decline in births to women on AFDC, but not an increase \nin the abortion rate.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from Oklahoma has \nexpired.\n  The only Senator that still controls time is the Senator from New \nYork, who has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I had previously arranged to make sure \nthat Senator Chafee spoke.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes. I ask the Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Because of some of the things that were said, I need to \nhave at least a minute.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask that 1 minute be yielded to the Senator from New \nMexico and the other minute to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the Domenici amendment. There \nhas been a lot of talk about inconsistency and about flexibility. I \nthink that applies on both sides. None of us have been totally \nconsistent. But with regard to this, the whole thrust of this bill is \nmeant to be for flexibility. And with a mandatory family cap, as is \nsuggested by the opponents of this bill, certainly that is not in \nkeeping with flexibility.\n  Now, the suggestion is that, ``Do not worry. There are no cash \npayments provided in this bill, but vouchers are provided.'' That is \nnot quite accurate. The underlying bill does not provide for vouchers. \nIt says vouchers may be provided.\n  I would also point out that this is a nightmare of administration \nwhen you are dealing with vouchers for children. So it seems to me, as \nhas been pointed out here, under the underlying bill, the people that \nsuffer under this proposal to get at illegitimacy as the target, the \npeople that suffer are the children. I just do not think that is the \nway to proceed. As has been pointed out by the Senator from New Jersey, \nthere is no definiteness about the family cap having reduced \nillegitimacy.\n  I want to thank the Senator for the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say to all my friends, especially some of the \nRepublicans who talked about breaking an agreement, I do not break \nagreements. I was not part of any agreement. I was not in attendance. I \nhad one meeting where we went over the whole bill. But I was not there. \nIf I were there, I would have said I did not agree. And so I am \nbringing my disagreement here to the floor to let you decide.\n  Frankly, I am absolutely convinced the New Jersey experience is \nmeaningless with reference to whether or not there will be less welfare \nmothers having children if there is a family cap. The study I see says \nthat there is no evidence that it has succeeded. If there is evidence \nof that, there is equally as good evidence that abortions have \nincreased. I do not believe either one.\n  But my argument is, why make a mistake? Why not let the Governors and \nthe States decide as they put a big plan together. Let them do \ninnovative things to make this system work better. Do we really know \nthat if we say no cash for second children of a welfare mother, that \nthe others are going to stop having children? I mean, I do not believe \nthat. And if you believe that--I do not want to make it so mundane--but \nyou believe in the tooth fairy. It just is not going to happen.\n  I think we ought to adopt this and go to conference. We have a good \nbill. And I, frankly, am trying my best to be helpful in this bill. And \nto say I am inconsistent--most Senators are for maintenance of effort--\nthat is the inconsistency; I am for maintenance of effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question occurs on amendment No. 2575.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 34, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 416 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--34\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the amendment (No. 2575), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2671\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes debate, equally divided, on the Daschle amendment No. 2671, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to that amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take 3 minutes of my time and then \nyield 1 minute to the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, and 1 minute to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the hope that we can find \nsome resolution to what we all understand to be a very serious problem \non reservations. My amendment would simply \n\n[[Page S 13490]]\nchange the funding mechanism in the bill to ensure that adequate \nfunding is provided to tribes across the country. It would establish a \n3 percent national set-aside, and tribal grants would be allotted from \nthe set-aside based on a formula to be determined by the Secretary. \nTribes, in both the pending legislation as well as in this amendment, \nwould receive direct funding from the Federal Government to administer \ntheir own programs.\n  The difference between the pending bill and our amendment is that, \nunder the pending legislation, tribes would receive money based on the \namount the State spent on them in fiscal year 1994. The State grant \nwould be reduced by the amount of the tribal grant. Under our \namendment, tribes would be allocated funds directly from the national \nset-aside. The funding for the tribes would be taken out of that 3 \npercent set-aside, even before the money is allocated to the States.\n  So it is simply a different mechanism for ensuring that funds are \nallocated in an appropriate way. Why 3 percent? Mr. President, the \npoverty rate for Indian children on reservations is 60.3 percent--three \ntimes the national average. I know that the percentage of the AFDC \npopulation that is represented by native Americans is less than 3 \npercent, but the problems tribes face are far greater than that \nstatistic would dictate.\n  Clearly, when you have a poverty rate of 60 percent, we have to do \nmore than what at first glance might appear to be necessary. Per capita \nincome in the United States is $14,000. Per capita income on the \nreservations is $4,000. Unemployment rates range, in South Dakota, from \n29 percent all the way up to 89 percent. Nationwide, unemployment on \nreservations is four to seven times the national average.\n  So we face some extraordinary circumstances on the reservations, Mr. \nPresident, and there is very little infrastructure in existence to \naddress these problems today. We need reform. We need to recognize that \nreform has to mean more than just resources. We need the mechanism and \ninfrastructure to create new opportunities to provide the services that \nare so needed on reservations today. For all these reasons, tribes \ndeserve the 3 percent. I hope that the amendment will be supported.\n  I yield a minute to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak on \nbehalf of the Daschle amendment. I do think it is very important that \nwe try, as we are going through this legislation, to assist Indian \ntribes in pueblos around the country in helping their own people.\n  We talk a lot about empowerment. Here is a chance for us to do just \nthat. At the same time that we are talking about empowering people, we \nare in fact cutting funds for Indian education, cutting funds for \ntribal justice programs, for housing operations, for tribal law \nenforcement, tribal social services, and a number of other vital \nprograms.\n  We should not shortchange the Indian children of this country and \ntheir families in this bill. The Daschle amendment helps to ensure that \nwe do not do that. I very much urge my colleagues to support the \nDaschle amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has 1 minute 18 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield that to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as we prepare to vote on this measure, we \nshould remind ourselves that, first, Indians are sovereign. Second, \nthere is a unique relationship existing between Indian nations and the \nFederal Government of the United States, a trust relationship. There is \nno special relationship existing between States and Indian country. The \nConstitution sets forth this relationship. The Supreme Court has upheld \nit on numerous occasions.\n  I support the Daschle amendment. I hope we will continue to maintain \nthe unique relationship that exists between Indians and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Arizona 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from South Dakota points \nout, there are more poor Indians in America than reflected in the \nnational average. The Senator's amendment calls for a 3-percent set-\naside, even in States where there is no Indian population. I began this \nprocess several months ago, working with the with Senator Dole and with \nthe Finance Committee, in attempting to achieve some way of providing \nnative Americans with direct block grants to pay for their welfare \nprograms.\n  As part of the bill, no off-the-top lump sum is dedicated for tribes. \nIndeed, the Dole bill targets Federal funding on a tribe-by-tribe \nbasis, scaled to the actual need, supported by the fiscal year 1994 \ndata, not some overall national estimate of need of 3 percent or 2 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I have worked very hard with the Finance Committee in \ncrafting a compromise that will provide direct welfare block grants to \nthe Indian tribes, separate from the States. In response to that, Mr. \nPresident, I have received from Indian tribes all over the country, \nincluding from the National Indian Child Welfare Association, complete \nsatisfaction with the compromise that was worked out with Senator Dole.\n  If Senator Daschle can, in the name of politics, get Senators from \nWest Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, and other States that have no Indian \npopulation to support this, fine. But I would like to point out to the \nSenator from South Dakota that he voted against an amendment by Senator \nDomenici that was going so restore 200-some million dollars in \ndraconian cuts that are going to triple and destroy the social programs \nin his State and in my State. I hope that he will devote some of his \nefforts to restoring those draconian measures which have brought 300 \ntribal leaders to the Nation's Capital in the most vociferous process I \nhave ever seen in my 13 years in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I support the Dole part of the bill which provides \ndirect welfare block grants to Indian tribes, which the Indian tribes \nthemselves support.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator McCain as \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. I think he has provided a \nvery valuable service because he does put some good language in this \nbill.\n  The bill that we have before us--not the amendment, the bill we have \nbefore us--allows direct funding to Indian tribes based on actual AFDC \npopulation.\n  Now, Indian AFDC population I heard is 1.3 percent, and I heard \nsomebody say it is 1.7 percent of the population. Why would it be right \nto say they should receive 3 percent of the funding set aside? I think \nthat is arbitrary. I also think it is maybe double what they are now \nreceiving.\n  Indian tribes should be able to receive the block grant and be able \nto manage that, but it should be based on the population receiving AFDC \npayments. It should not be some arbitrary figure that is pulled out of \nthe sky.\n  I compliment Senator McCain for the language he has inserted in the \nbill. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daschle amendment because \nI think it sets up an arbitrary level that happens to be about double \nwhat the current Indian population of AFDC is, and that is not called \nfor.\n  I do not think it is a good way to manage our welfare program. I \nthink Senator Dole has good language in the bill. Hopefully, it will be \nsustained.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daschle amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. My query is this, to the distinguished sponsor of the \namendment. It seems to me that, as I understand it, Indians make up 1.5 \npercent of the AFDC caseload. There are different figures given here, \nbut I heard no figure more than 2 percent.\n  Therefore, it is hard to understand why 3 percent should be set aside \nfor this group that makes up 1.5 or 2 percent--whatever it is--of the \ncaseload.\n  I would appreciate if the distinguished Senator could give us some \nhelp on that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use whatever time I may consume \nout of leader time to respond.\n  Mr. President, the point I made in the short remarks that I have just \n\n\n[[Page S 13491]]\ncompleted is that the circumstances affecting Indian tribes are vastly \ndifferent than those affecting any other cross-section of the \npopulation.\n  We have unemployment rates in South Dakota close to 90 percent. \nIndian tribes nationwide have unemployment rates of up to seven times \nwhat they are for the rest of the population. Not only are we dealing \nwith an extremely high level of unemployment, there is also little \ninfrastructure to deliver social services on many reservations. \nClearly, we have circumstances on many reservations that is far \ndifferent from other areas.\n  That is really what we are trying to do, to recognize the \nextraordinary difficulties that we face in a very concentrated area: \nReservations where there are really no resources; reservations where \nthere is no employment. We cannot locate businesses on reservations \ntoday.\n  We are simply saying that if we are going to do this right, if we are \ngoing to allow tribes to do this right, we should allocate a 3 percent \nset-aside for tribes to allow them to begin solving these problems.\n  Other requirements of the welfare bill before the Senate are required \non the reservation. They have to work. Workfare is going to be an \nessential part of the requirement for the tribes, as it is for \neverybody else.\n  Clearly, given the problems, given the requirements, and given the \ncircumstances, I think this is the nominal amount of effort that we \nought to put forth to do this job right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 35 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not doubt--as a matter of fact, I \nthink I know probably almost as well as anybody on this floor--that we \nhave very significant problems in the Indian community. Welfare is part \nof it. It may be part of the problem.\n  I am not sure that doubling the money going into AFDC for Indian \ntribes will solve that problem. It would provide greater cash \nassistance, no doubt. But I do not think that is necessarily right.\n  If they have 1.5 percent of the population, we will say they get 3 \npercent of the money--that is not going to make their problems go away. \nIf I really thought that would make their problems go away, I might \nsupport the amendment.\n  We have lots and lots of problems on reservations and in the Indian \ncommunity, but I do not think just by increasing cash payments, that \nthat is a solution. I think the solution is in the Dole bill.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nDaschle amendment No. 2671.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 38, nays 62, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 417 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--38\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--62\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the amendment (No. 2671) was rejected.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2518\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the DeWine amendment, No. 2518, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the amendment which Senator Kohl and I have proposed \nreally is a very simple one. It encourages States to work to keep \npeople off of welfare before they ever go on welfare.\n  I think this is not only the right thing to do from a humanitarian \npoint of view but it is also the most cost effective thing to do. In \nfact, we have seen several States make great progress with their \nprograms to do this--Utah, Wisconsin, and there are many other States \nthat are now just starting this type of a program.\n  I believe that without this amendment the underlying bill would have \nthe unintended consequence and resolve of discouraging States from this \ntype of early intervention. And I think everyone agrees we should be \nencouraging States to do so.\n  Our amendment would give States credit towards their work requirement \nfor reducing their caseload by helping people before they ever go on \nwelfare.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I think it is a very simple amendment. But \nI think it is an amendment that will in fact make a difference and will \nin fact encourage the States to do what everyone agrees needs to be \ndone; that is, keep people from getting on welfare.\n  I might add, Mr. President, that it does not give the States credit \ntowards their work requirement if, in fact, the reduction in caseload \nis achieved merely by changing the requirements for being on welfare. \nThese have to be actually meaningful reductions that are achieved in \nother ways. Of course, one of the ways to achieve those is, in fact, by \nhaving that very, very early intervention.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator from \nOhio, Senator DeWine, who explained this amendment last night. We \nreviewed the amendment. We have no objection to it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as one who dearly loves Federal \nregulations imposed on States in minute, indecipherable detail, I \naccept this amendment with great gusto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do all Senators yield the time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2518) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2668\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate on the Mikulski amendment, No. 2668, to be followed \nby a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes on this \namendment, and then I will yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Wellstone be a cosponsor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I correct myself. I yield myself 3 \nminutes, and then I will yield to the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], \n2 minutes. \n\n[[Page S 13492]]\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to save the Senior Community Service \nEmployment Program of title V of the Older Americans Act.\n  I do this to preserve over 100,000 senior citizen jobs. Title V \nprovides part-time, minimum wage employment, and community service to \nlow-income workers as well as training for placement in unsubsidized \nemployment.\n  Its participants provide millions of dollars of community service at \non-the-job sites making a critical difference in care centers, \nhospitals, senior centers, libraries, and so on.\n  The Dole substitute now before us repeals the Senior Community \nService Employment Program. My amendment strikes this repeal. It saves \nthe Senior Community Service Employment Program of title V of the Older \nAmericans Act.\n  If title V is not removed from the welfare reform bill, it will be \nrepealed, along with 100 Federal job training programs, and rolled into \na block grant. This will have a devastating consequence on these older \nworkers. It serves directly in the communities across the Nation that \nbenefits from these.\n  My amendment is supported by senior organizations across this \ncountry, including AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens, and \nothers.\n  Mr. President, there are so many good reasons to support the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program. Title V is our country's only \nwork force development program designed to maximize the productive \ncontributions of a rapidly growing older population. It does this \nthrough training, retraining, and community service.\n  We should leave title V in the Older Americans Act. It does not \nbelong in welfare reform, and it does not belong in the reform of the \njob training bills.\n  Title V is primarily operated by private nonprofit national aging \norganizations. This is not big bureaucracy.\n  It is a critical part of that Older Americans Act and has \nconsistently exceeded all goals established by Congress and the \nDepartment of Labor, surpassing a 20 percent placement goal for the \npast 6 years and achieving a record of 135 percent in the last year.\n  Title V, this Senior Community Service Employment Program, provides a \npositive return on taxpayer investment, returning $1.47 for every $1 \ninvested. It is means tested, and it also serves the oldest and the \npoorest in our society; 40 percent are minorities, 70 percent are \nwomen, 30 percent are over the age of 70, 81 percent are age 60 and \nolder, and 9 percent have disabilities.\n  Surely they deserve to have their own protection.\n  Title V ensures national responsiveness to local needs by directly \ninvolving participants in meeting critical human needs in their \ncommunities, from child and elder care to public safety and \nenvironmental preservation.\n  Title V has demonstrated high standards of performance and fiscal \naccountability unique to Government programs.\n  Less than 15 percent of funding is spent on administrative costs.\n  Title V historically has enjoyed strong public support because it is \nbased on the principles of personal responsibility, lifelong learning, \nand service to community.\n  I urge your support for my amendment.\n  Is the Chair tapping?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I did not hear the tap, but having heard the tap I now \nyield 2 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, a supporter of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I support Senator Mikulski's amendment because there \nare a unique group of older Americans who will not be properly served \nby Senator Kassebaum's new program, as well-intentioned as it is.\n  Title V provides community service employment. In my State of Iowa, \nthe program provided a total of 402,480 hours of service just in this \nyear.\n  These workers serve in public schools, child care centers, city \nmuseums and parks, as child care workers, library aides, kitchen \nworkers; they work for Head Start, YMCA, YWCA, the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, the Salvation Army, the Easter Seal Society, and the \nAmerican Red Cross.\n  They work in activities that support as well the other Older \nAmericans Act programs like senior centers, congregate meal sites, and \nhome-delivered meals.\n  I think this is a good use of taxpayers' money because it leverages \nprivate funds and other public funds. Senator Kassebaum's bill will not \nlead to programs providing such employment.\n  The Senator's legislation will help individuals find gainful private \nsector employment, and there is nothing wrong with that. That is a \nproper focus. But it is not a focus which is going to assist the kind \nof individuals currently enrolled in title V programs--people 55 years \nand older, less than 115 percent of poverty. We are talking about low-\nincome older Americans. Thirty percent of these workers are over 70 \nyears of age. Eighty-one percent are over 60 years of age. They will \nnot benefit from the training programs and education programs that \nwould be established under Senator Kassebaum's bill. Title V provides \nsubsidized employment in community service jobs for workers who are \nhighly unlikely to be the focus of programs under Senator Kassebaum's \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today as a supporter \nof the amendment of my friend from Maryland. Her proposal would remove \nthe Senior Community Service Employment Program, or title V, from this \nbill. This amendment is important for several reasons: First, the Title \nV Program is not job training and should not be considered as part of \nthis block grant; second, it fills an important role within the Older \nAmericans Act; and third, it effectively serves a population that is \ndifficult to reach with traditional job training programs.\n  The State of Michigan has had a long and successful relationship with \nthis program. Thousands of people participate in it each year. These \nindividuals work in hundreds of different occupations. The unifying \nfactor in all this work is that older workers are contributing to their \ncommunities. In most cases, they are coming out of retirement to \nreenter the labor force.\n  I have received hundreds of constituent letters asking me to support \nthis provision. In explaining their involvement with the Title V \nProgram, almost all the participants mention ``giving something back to \nthe community.'' It is imperative that Congress capitalize on this \nfeeling. Now more than ever we need to hold onto and support our sense \nof communities and this can be done by following the examples set by \nour elders. In many communities, title V programs provide the link \nbetween senior citizens and the younger generations. The SCSEP gives \nolder workers an opportunity to become engaged with their neighbors in \na direct and meaningful way.\n  Many of my colleagues know of the emphasis I place on community \nservice. Usually, however, when we talk about this issue, our concern \nis about mobilizing young people to become involved. By contrast, the \nTitle V Program is in operation. Its participants are active in \ncommunities now. If we repeal the Title V Program, many of these \npositions will be eliminated. One study estimates that 30,000 to 45,000 \npositions will be eliminated by 1998. This will deprive neighborhoods \nand towns of one of their most valuable resources.\n  Removing title V from this bill will provide us with the opportunity \nto discuss the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act in its \nentirety. I am aware that the Aging Subcommittee of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee has already begun hearings on this issue. I look \nforward to seeing the recommendations that they produce on the act as a \nwhole. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her leadership on this \nissue and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, in offering this amendment to save title V \nof the Older Americans Act. As you are aware, title V authorizes the \nSenior Community Service Employment Program [SCSEP] which provides \nsenior citizens valuable opportunities to serve their communities by \ncontributing their valuable insight and experience.\n  As a strong supporter and past cosponsor of the Older Americans Act, \nit is my view that the future of the \n\n[[Page S 13493]]\nSCSEP should be determined during the reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act, and should not be considered as part of the welfare \nreform debate. This successful employment program which serves our \nNation's senior citizen is not part of the welfare system and does not \nbelong in this bill.\n  The SCSEP is one the most important programs authorized under the \nOlder Americans Act which have been successful in the organization and \ndelivery of support services for senior citizens. For almost 30 years \nthis program has offered low-income persons aged 55 or older part-time \npaid community service assignments with the goal of eventually \nobtaining unsubsidized jobs.\n  The only work force development program specifically designed to \nmaximize the potential of senior citizens, the SCSEP has consistently \nexceeded placement goals established by Congress and the Department of \nLabor. This clearly illustrates what I have always believed--older \nAmericans want to contribute. They want to work, to volunteer, to \nparticipate in their community. It is critical that we recognize this \ninterest and tap the valuable wisdom, insight, and experience that \nsenior citizens bring to all aspects of life.\n  There are several successful SCSEP programs here in Maryland, one of \nwhich serves my home community of Wicomico County. The Senior AIDES \nProgram--in cooperation with State employment offices, community \ncolleges, and other federally funded employment and training programs--\nhelps seniors get the skills necessary to become part of the work \nforce.\n  Let me share with you one of the program's many success stories. \nSarah Maxfield of Salisbury finished high school, got married, and \nraised a family. She had the occasional odd job or part-time work, but \nnever really worked full-time until she had to go back to work to \nsupport herself. At age 57, she entered the Senior AIDES Program in \nWicomico County. While receiving training in office skills, she also \nworked with the volunteer office delivering meals to elderly shut-ins.\n  In September 1994, after having received training, she was placed in \na subsidized job at Shore Up, Inc., a local community action agency. \nShore Up was so impressed with her that I am pleased to report that she \nwas subsequently hired full time.\n  Mr. President, by including the SCSEP in the job training block grant \nportion of this welfare bill, the program will be forced to compete \nwith other, unrelated programs for a limited amount of funding. The end \nresult will be fewer seniors working and fewer communities benefiting \nfrom the contributions of these older Americans.\n  One of the central recommendations of the recent 1995 White House \nConference on Aging with respect to seniors in the work force was to \nmake available educational programs to provide skilled trained, job \ncounseling, and job placement for older men and women. This enhances \nsenior citizens' ability to stay in or rejoin the work force or to \nprepare them for second careers.\n  In my view, Mr. President, it is clear that the proper legislative \nvehicle for consideration of this important program is not a welfare \nreform bill. The SCSEP deserves to be debated fully as part of the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nproposed by my colleague from Maryland concerning the Senior Community \nService Employment Program, also known as the title V program. This \namendment would remove title V from the job training block grant \ncontained in the welfare reform bill we are considering.\n  Mr. President, this program is unique among employment programs. It \nserves people whose needs are not met by the more traditional job \nprograms. The program also has a unique character which I believe would \nbe destroyed by the block grant approach.\n  Title V serves seniors who are often difficult to reach. The \nindividuals who participate in this program have very low incomes, and \noften they have little or no formal job experience. Most participants \nare over 65, many are widows, and any job experience they have may have \noccurred decades ago. These individuals need this program because it is \nthe safety net separating them from extreme poverty and welfare \ndependency.\n  Title V also differs from other job training programs because of its \nunique nature as a community service program. The jobs occupied by \ntitle V participants are in organizations which serve other seniors, \nchildren, and the community at large. Organizations which sponsor title \nV enrollees are those which are most likely to feel the pain of budget \ncuts and economic downturns, and they simply could not get the job done \nwithout the help of the title V program.\n  Mr. President, if the job training block grant includes title V, the \nlosses will be felt throughout our social fabric. Who will lose? Well, \nfirst of all, the individuals who participate in title V will lose. By \nthe time the block grant is fully implemented in 1998, between 30,000 \nand 45,000 older people will be given pink slips. Do we really want to \ntell 45,000 poor people, most of whom are aged 65 and older, that they \ncan no longer work to supplement their meager income? Do we want to \ntell these proud people that we would rather have them on welfare?\n  Communities will also lose under this block grant. There will be \nmoney lost from local economies as we squeeze more people into poverty. \nLocal communities across America will also lose vital human services \nwhich are made possible through title V--services like tutoring of \ndisadvantaged children and meals for the poor. In this social climate, \nthese are services we cannot do without.\n  Another big loser will be government. We will lose tax revenue from \npeople who are no longer employed. We will also lose because the title \nV participants who are forced out of jobs will be forced to go onto the \nwelfare rolls, causing us to spend more money on the very programs in \nwhich we are trying to find savings. Mr. President, this just does not \nmake sense to me.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that I am not standing before you \nsaying that this program should not be changed in any way. I \nacknowledge that the time has come to subject title V to a thorough \nexamination. As you know, concerns have been raised about this program, \nand these are concerns which deserve to be addressed. There also comes \na time in every program when it is appropriate to take a few steps \nback, take stock of where we are, and make whatever changes are \nnecessary to ensure that the program is fulfilling its central mission. \nBut Mr. President, the last thing we need to be doing is combining this \nprogram with other employment programs with which it has very little in \ncommon.\n  Let us act decisively today to save this program--for the sake of our \nlocal communities and the many organizations which benefit from the \nprogram, and most of all, for the sake of the tens of thousands of \nolder people who participate in title V. Over the years, this \nworthwhile program has freed countless senior citizens from a prison \nwhose bars are poverty, dependency, isolation, poor self-confidence, \nand lack of experience. Let us not slam the doors shut on them.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to save the Senior \nCommunity Service Employment Program--title V of the Older Americans \nAct--and preserve over 100,000 senior citizens' jobs.\n  Title V provides part-time, minimum wage employment in community \nservices to low-income older workers, as well as training for placement \nin unsubsidized employment.\n  Its participants provide millions of hours of community service work \nat their on-the-job sites, making a critical difference at day care \ncenters, hospitals, senior centers, libraries, and so on.\n  The Dole substitute now before us repeals the Senior Community \nService Employment Program.\n  My amendment strikes this repeal and saves the Senior Community \nService Employment Program, title V of the Older Americans Act.\n  If title V is not removed from the welfare reform bill, it will be \nrepealed along with over 100 Federal job training programs and rolled \ninto a block grant.\n  This will have devastating consequences on over 100,000 low-income \nolder workers it serves directly, and \n\n[[Page S 13494]]\nthe many communities across the Nation that benefit from these workers' \njob activities.\n  My amendment is supported by senior organizations across this country \nincluding the American Association of Retired Persons, Green Thumb, the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, National Council of Black Aged, \nNational Council on Aging, and the Urban League.\n  The purpose of title V is to assure resources reach low-income older \nworkers.\n  The special needs of low-income seniors are often ignored or \nneglected by other employment and training programs: Seniors with \nlimited education; seniors with outmoded work skills; seniors with \nlimited English-speaking ability; and seniors with a long-term \ndetachment from the workforce, such as widows.\n  The purpose of having a separate title V of the Older Americans Act \nis to assure that funds are actually used to serve low-income persons \n55 and older.\n  Title V merges two important concepts: Community service employment \nfor seniors who would otherwise have a difficult time locating \nemployment in the private sector, and the delivery of services in their \ncommunities.\n  Eliminating title V places seniors at-risk on winding up on welfare.\n  Title V enables low-income seniors to be economically self-\nsufficient, rather than depend upon welfare.\n  How ironic as we debate the welfare reform bill, that the result of \nrepealing title V could swell the welfare rolls for seniors. Many title \nV participants are now self-sufficient. If this program is repealed and \nseniors lose their community service employment positions, these \nseniors may be forced to accept SSI, Medicaid, food stamps, and housing \nassistance.\n  Title V seniors would rather have a hand-up not a hand-out.\n  There are 10 good reasons to support the Senior Community Service \nEmployment Program.\n  First, title V is our country's only work force development program \ndesigned to maximize the productive contributions of a radidly growing \nolder population through training, retraining, and community service.\n  Second, title V is primarily operated by private, nonprofit national \naging organizations that are customer-focused, mission driven, and \nexperienced in serving older, low-income people.\n  Third, title V is a critical part of the Older Americans Act, \nbalancing the dual goals of community service and employment and \ntraining for low-income seniors.\n  Fourth, title V has consistently exceeded all goals established by \nCongress and the Department of Labor, surpassing the 20 percent \nplacement goal for the past 6 years and achieving a record 135 percent \nof goal in 1993-94.\n  Fifth, title V provides a positive return on taxpayer investment, \nreturning $1.47 for every $1 invested.\n  Sixth, title V is a means-tested program, serving Americans age 55+ \nwith income at or below 125 percent of the poverty level, or $9,200 for \na family of one.\n  Seventh, title V serves the oldest and poorest in our society, and \nthose most in need--39 percent are minorities; 72 percent are women; 32 \npercent are age 70 and older; 81 percent are age 60 and older; 9 \npercent have disabilities.\n  Eighth, title V ensures national responsiveness to local needs by \ndirectly involving participants in meeting critical human needs in \ntheir communities, from child and elder care to public safety and \nenvironmental preservation.\n  Ninth, title V has demonstrated high standards of performance and \nfiscal accountability unique to Government programs. Less than 15 \npercent of funding is spent on administrative costs.\n  Tenth, title V historically has enjoyed strong public support because \nit is based on the principles of personal responsibility, lifelong \nlearning, and service to community.\n  I urge your support for my amendment.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. How much time do I have, 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield myself 3 minutes and would yield the rest of \nthe time to the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg].\n  I know how much the Senator from Maryland cares about older workers, \nas does the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley]. But I must oppose the \nSenator's amendment to remove the Senior Community Service Employment \nProgram from the job training consolidation bill, which has been \nincorporated into the legislation before us, for the following reasons.\n  First, older workers are already protected in the bill. Each State \nmust meet benchmarks that show how well they are providing jobs for \nneedy older workers. Their funds may be cut if they do not do an \nadequate job.\n  Second, successful grassroots programs like Green Thumb--and it has \nbeen a very successful program in Kansas--will be able to continue. \nThis does not mean that that program is going to end. It simply means \nthat it will be part of the training initiatives in the State, and its \nvoice will be heard at that level. Older workers will have a very \nstrong voice with Governors, and States will hear that voice when they \ndevelop their statewide training system. I have no doubt but that such \nstrong programs will prevail.\n  Third, older workers will be better served under the current bill \nbecause we will eliminate the middleman. Right now, most of the older \nworker funds go to 10 national contractors. The Senator from Maryland \nmentioned that fact. Let me just say, Mr. President, something I think \nit is important for my colleagues to recognize. The GAO will soon \nrelease a report showing that there is a great deal of waste in these \nnational contracts, overhead that will be eliminated if the funds go \ndirectly to the States.\n  For example, the GAO found that one contractor spent about 24 percent \nof its contract on administrative expenses, well above the amount that \nis currently permitted. Over $2 million was spent on personnel and $1 \nmillion was spent on fringe benefits. None of these funds went to older \nworkers. It is an important group to reach, and I think the Senator \nfrom Iowa made that point. But I strongly feel there is a better way in \nwhich to deal with this. This training program is just one of 90 \nprograms we have consolidated into a single system that will hold \nStates accountable.\n  Finally, and I think this is an exceptionally important point to take \ninto account, if we make an exception for this program, other programs \nwill want out as well, and we will only perpetuate a system of \nduplication and overlap.\n  I must oppose the motion to strike. I would like to yield the \nremainder of the time to Senator Gregg, who cares a great deal also \nabout the Older Americans Act. He is the ranking member of the Labor \nand Human Resources Subcommittee dealing with this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Kansas. I wish to associate \nmyself with her remarks. The point she is making is that it is not a \nquestion of whether or not the money will be spent on senior citizens' \njobs programs. Under the proposal of the Senator from Kansas, the same \namount will be spent on senior citizens' jobs programs as will be spent \nas it is presently structured. It is a question of whether or not those \ndollars actually get to senior citizens or whether they stay here in \nWashington and are administered by a group of unrepresentative, in my \nopinion, or at least by people who have not competed for the grants and \nthat receive the grants.\n  There are nine organizations that receive funds under this proposal. \nThey receive them without competition. They simply are earmarked funds. \nThese organizations, GAO tells us, are spending more than the law \nallows them to spend on administrative costs. Of the $320 million that \nis supposed to go to help senior citizens with jobs, $64 million of \nthat $320 million is presently going to administration.\n  The proposal Senator Kassebaum has brought forward and which is \nincluded in this bill would allow that full $320 million to go back to \nthe States. We would no longer see that money skimmed off here in \nWashington for the purposes of lunches and funding large buildings that \nare leased or driving around the city or coming up here \n\n[[Page S 13495]]\nand lobbying us. Rather, it would go back to the States and the States \nwould have the ability through their councils on aging to administer \nthese programs and as a result the dollars would actually flow to the \nseniors who need the jobs, which is the basic bottom-line goal here.\n  So if you want to vote against what basically amounts to a designated \nprogram where nine organizations benefit and put the money instead into \nthe seniors' hands where the seniors can benefit, you will stay with \nthe Kassebaum approach in this bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and yeas were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Maryland. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes, equally divided, on the Boxer amendment No. 2592, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I ask that the Senator from \nMassachusetts be recognized for a unanimous-consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to Omer Waddles, a legislative fellow \nin my office, during the consideration of H.R. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that request?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, is this the last amendment that time has \nbeen reserved for?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I notice there was a Faircloth amendment intervening. Is \nthat withdrawn?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It was temporarily set aside.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So following the Boxer amendment, we will then go to \nother amendments that are called up. Is there any time agreement \nfollowing the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The floor is open and other Senators may call \nup their amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Boxer \namendment be temporarily laid aside so that I might proceed with a \nmodification to the underlying Dole amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2280, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send a modification of Senator Dole's \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, beginning on line 7, strike all through page \n     24, line 18, and insert the following:\n       ``(5) Welfare partnership.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The amount of the grant otherwise \n     determined under paragraph (1) for fiscal year 1997, 1998, \n     1999, or 2000 shall be reduced by the amount by which State \n     expenditures under the State program funded under this part \n     for the preceding fiscal year is less than 80 percent of \n     historic State expenditures.\n       ``(B) Historic state expenditures.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `historic State expenditures' \n     means expenditures by a State under parts A and F of title IV \n     for fiscal year 1994, as in effect during such fiscal year.\n       ``(ii) Hold harmless.--In no event shall the historic State \n     expenditures applicable to any fiscal year exceed the amount \n     which bears the same ratio to the amount determined under \n     clause (i) as--\n       ``(I) the grant amount otherwise determined under paragraph \n     (1) for the preceding fiscal year (without regard to section \n     407), bears to\n       ``(II) the total amount of Federal payments to the State \n     under section 403 for fiscal year 1994 (as in effect during \n     such fiscal year).\n       ``(C) Determination of state expenditures for preceding \n     fiscal year.--\n       ``(i) In general.--For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     expenditures of a State under the State program funded under \n     this part for a preceding fiscal year shall be equal to the \n     sum of the State's expenditures under the program in the \n     preceding fiscal year for--\n       ``(I) cash assistance;\n       ``(II) child care assistance;\n       ``(III) education, job training, and work;\n       ``(IV) administrative costs; and\n       ``(V) any other use of funds allowable under section \n     403(b)(1).\n       ``(ii) Transfers from other state and local programs.--In \n     determining State expenditures under clause (i), such \n     expenditures shall not include funding supplanted by \n     transfers from other State and local programs.\n       ``(D) Exclusion of federal amounts.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, State expenditures shall not include any \n     expenditures from amounts made available by the Federal \n     Government.''.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. What does the modification do?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it provides that there shall be a \nmaintenance of effort at the 80 percent level, with the tight \ndefinitions that we have previously been discussing.\n  Furthermore, it provides that should there be the effort below 80 \npercent, then the reduction will be a dollar-for-dollar reduction \nbetween the State funds and Federal funds.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that we have discussed, I believe \nbroadly, that has been cleared by both sides.\n  Senator Dole is a supporter of this amendment on this side. Mr. \nPresident, I am glad that the amendment is acceptable. I want to thank \neverybody for this. I especially thank the senior Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, for his outstanding work. He was key in the \nwhole effort. Indeed, it was he who suggested to the majority leader \nthat we have the 80 percent maintenance of effort.\n  This gets us through a difficult spot. We have been tied up on the \n90-percent, 75-percent maintenance of effort. This is a compromise that \nhas been worked out.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Louisiana has been very, very \nactive in this area, and I am happy to hear any comments he might have.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will be brief, Mr. President. \n\n[[Page S 13496]]\n\n  We attempted, as our colleagues know, to offer an amendment that \nwould require that States to maintain an effort of 90 percent of what \nthey were doing in 1994 in order to assure that the States and the \nFederal Government had a true partnership in this effort.\n  That amendment lost by only one vote. I think this effort of the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, is a good effort. It is a \nbig improvement over the current bill that is before the Senate. It is \nnot 90 percent, but it does at least maintain an 80-percent effort on \nbehalf of the States. That is better than the current underlying bill.\n  The concern I have--and I ask the Senator to comment on this--is that \nthe other body has no maintenance of effort at all in their bill and \nultimately we will have to go to conference with the other body. I am \nconcerned about the ability that the Senate will have to come out with \na figure that is reasonable.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Rhode Island could comment on whether \nthere would be united support for the Senator's effort on behalf of his \nRepublican colleagues, and could he shed light on what he thinks may or \nmay not happen as a result of a conference?\n  I conclude by saying I do congratulate him in this effort and I think \nit is a step in the right direction. Could he comment on what is likely \nto occur?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I want to start off by commending \nthe Senator from Louisiana because but for his amendment yesterday on \nthe 90 percent, I do not think we would have reached the compromise \nthat we have on the 80-percent maintenance-of-effort level.\n  The Senator is exactly right in pointing out that the House is at \nzero. All I can say is, obviously I cannot guarantee what will come out \nof the conference. Nobody can. All I can assure him is that speaking \nfor this Senator, who I presume will be a conferee, plus the other \nRepublican Senators who I presume will be conferees, including the \nmajority leader, all have indicated that they are strongly in support \nof this effort and this percentage.\n  Now, I do not think we expect that this percentage is what will \nemerge from the conference. But it is going to be a lot better than \nzero, I can assure everybody of that.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Obviously, I hope that it would be the 75-percent level, \nbut I see the distinguished ranking member of the committee, and we \nhave all been through conference many times and all we can say is we \nwill do our best.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I simply would like to be recorded as \nsaying the best of the Senator from Rhode Island is very good, indeed, \nsemper fi, in my view.\n  I will be on that conference. I do not know to what consequence, but \nI will be there applauding.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the mere presence of the Senator from New \nYork at the conference is a big plus to our side.\n  Again, I want to thank him for his support of this amendment and \nthank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for everything he has \ndone, including previous to today as I mentioned before.\n  Mr. President, the amendment has been adopted. I want to thank all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment was a modification of the \namendment which was modified by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I asked for a copy of the amendment, and \nit was not available, so would the Senator from Rhode Island yield for \ntwo questions relative to the amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am familiar with the amendment we voted on yesterday \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana as it relates to what categories \na State can allocate funds which will count towards the 80-percent \nmaintenance-of-effort requirement.\n  Could the Senator indicate if there are any variations from the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana? And, if so, what are those \nvariations?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding this gets a little bit arcane, and \nI am not trying to avoid the Senator's question in any fashion. We can \nsafely say, basically the same as the amendment of the Senator from \nLouisiana. That is, the Senator is talking about--it is the title I \nblock grants which fits into the definitions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There had been concern about the definition under the \noriginal 75-percent maintenance of effort that it would have allowed, \nfor instance, a State's contribution to Medicaid and Head Start \nprograms to count toward maintenance of effort.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to assure the Senator, because I was disturbed by \nthat provision likewise, that there cannot be that kind--a contribution \nto Medicaid does not count. It has to be basically the AFDC existing \ncategories. It cannot be something for food stamps or Medicaid or an \nautomobile or something like that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The second question: We had earlier debate about what \nhappens if a State's allocation of Federal funds declines, what occurs \nto that State's continuing maintenance of effort?\n  For instance, there is a very high probability that many States are \ngoing to end up being sanctioned under this bill because they will have \nsuch a limited amount of Federal funds that they would be unable to \nmeet the work requirements and therefore would become subject to the 5-\npercent sanction, reduction.\n  If that were to occur, what, if any, effect under your amendment will \nthat reduction in Federal funds, for whatever reason, have on their \nmaintenance-of-effort obligation?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the Senator can hold for a moment.\n  I know if the State goes down in its contribution, as I previously \nmentioned, then the Federal goes down dollar for dollar if the State \nshould go below the 80 percent.\n  If your question is, what happens if the Federal goes down, under a \nsanction, for example--if I might get the answer to that.\n  If they are sanctioned, the answer is, I am informed, if they are \nsanctioned, the State still has to do its 80 percent. In other words, \nyou cannot be so-called punished and be relieved of a burden at the \nsame time, which is my understanding of the existing law today.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Are there any instances in which, if the Federal funds \nare reduced below what they were in the base year 1994, that there \nwould be adjustment to the maintenance of effort?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am not sure I understand.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If for any reason--sanction or for other reason--\nsufficient that we do not appropriate the full $17 billion in the year \n2000 and States get less than is currently projected, if for that or \nany other reason--sanction, political, economic, or otherwise--Federal \nfunds should fall below the 1994 level, does your amendment provide for \nany adjustment to the maintenance-of-effort provision?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We do not address that, nor did the Breaux amendment \naddress it.\n  The question really is, should the Federal Government not make its \nappropriation, for the 1994 level, in the year 1998, or, as you said, \n2000--we do not address that here. But I cannot believe that, with 100 \nSenators, all representing States here, that they are going to permit \ntheir State in some way to be punished, or lack funds, or have to \ncontinue their effort at 80 percent when the Federal Government does \nnot do its matching share. But we do not specifically address that \nproblem. We address the sanction problem.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish I could be as sanguine as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. Having seen how many Senators voted to punish the poor children \non an earlier vote, I cannot be so sanguine.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  When we altered the 90-percent maintenance of effort, it was based on \n90 percent of what the State received. So if the State received less \nfrom the Federal Government because of cutbacks or whatever reason, \nthey would have a 90-percent requirement, to spend 90 percent of the \nfunds that they had received. Take that into consideration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Am I correct--this is a question of the Senator from \nRhode Island--this 80 percent is based on what was received in 1994? \nThe Senator from Louisiana explained that in his amendment the 90 \npercent was 90 percent of the Federal funds in the year of receipt. So \nif in 1998 a State received $100 million, it would have a required \nmaintenance of effort of $90 million. \n\n[[Page S 13497]]\n\n  I understand under the amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island--or \nam I correct that the 80 percent is 80 percent of what the State's \nrequired effort was in 1994? Is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Our bill--I cannot speak for the Breaux amendment because \nI am not familiar with that particular portion. Under our bill, the 80 \npercent is related to 80 percent of what the State paid in 1994.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. And that would be constant over the 5-year period, \nwithout regard to changes in the levels of Federal support?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask the Chair now the parliamentary situation.\n  I urge the adoption of the modification. Has that taken place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification has been made in the \namendment, made by unanimous consent.\n  The pending question will be the Boxer amendment. There has been time \nreserved of 10 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank everybody for their help in this, \nand particularly I want to thank the majority leader, the distinguished \nranking member of the Finance Committee, and others who have been very, \nvery helpful on this. And of course the Senator from Louisiana. The \nSenator from Florida had some excellent questions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n            unanimous consent agreement--amendment no. 2592\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that debate time \nand the rollcall vote scheduled with respect to the Boxer amendment No. \n2592 be postponed to occur at a time later today, before the cloture \nvote, to be determined by the majority leader after consultation with \nthe Democratic leader.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I shall not \nobject. I support it. I just want to use this time to thank Senator \nSimpson, the majority leader's staff, Senator Santorum, and Senator \nNickles. We are working out some technical changes that will assure \nthat this amendment does what we all want it to do. I just wanted to \nput that on the record. I look forward to the vote later in the day.\n  It has been set aside. I am not objecting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we do not have any unanimous consent to \nwork from at this point. We will take up, at this point, the Coats \namendment.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2539\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2539 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, that will be the pending \nquestion.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think it is easy for us to be overly \nconsumed by some of the details of this welfare debate, arguing numbers \nand formulas--portions of the legislation that are all important but \ncan tend to mire us down and take our attention away from some of the \nbroader implications of the debate we have been engaged in for the past \nseveral days. A great deal is at stake here, and I think we need to \nremind ourselves that this is the case.\n  If we as a Nation accept the existence of a permanent underclass, we \nwill become a very different Nation indeed. Social and economic \nmobility has always been part of our national creed. It has been an \noutgrowth of our belief in equality. If we abandon that goal for \nmillions of our citizens, through either indifference or through \ndespair, giving up, we will do a number of, I think, socially very \ndisadvantageous things. We will divide class from class. We will foster \na future of suspicion and of resentment. And, while this may be a \ntemptation to accept, I believe it is something we as a nation cannot \naccept.\n  On the left, it seems there are those who are so accustomed to the \nstatus quo that the best they can offer is some kind of maintenance of \na permanent underclass as wards of the State, providing cash benefits \nto, hopefully, anesthetize some of their suffering, food stamps to \nrelieve their hunger. But all hope for social and economic advancement \nseems to be set aside or abandoned.\n  On the right, it seems that there are some who simply want to wash \ntheir hands of all of this, who view the underclass as beyond our help \nand beyond any degree of sympathy or empathy. The only realistic \nresponse, they suspect, is probably more police and more prisons to \ndeal with the tragic consequences of this breakdown in civil society.\n  The effect, I believe, of both of these approaches is to accept that \npoverty is permanent; that the underclass is going to be a fixture of \nurban life to be fed, feared, and forgotten. In doing so, we will \ncondemn, in our minds, a whole class of Americans to be either wards or \ninmates. And I believe the American ideal will be diminished in that \nprocess.\n  I understand those temptations. The problems we face seem so \nintractable. Those who listened to Senator Moynihan's initial \ndiscussion on the welfare bill last week had to understand both the \nbrilliance and the sobering nature of that debate. We face a crisis, he \nsaid, and he outlined in graphic detail a crisis of illegitimacy that \nthreatens not just the well-being of the children but the existence of \nour social order.\n  To quote Charles Murray, he said, ``Once in a while the sky is really \nfalling.'' And I believe, in this instance, as Senator Moynihan has \npointed out to us, that the sky is falling and that our Nation faces a \ncrisis of a proportion that we have seldom faced before.\n  I also understand that any reform that we undertake, particularly any \nradical reform that we undertake of the system, is undertaken with a \ndegree of uncertainty. Senator Moynihan has reminded us of the law of \nunintended consequences.\n  Nathan Glazer has talked about ``the limits of social policy,'' \narguing that whatever great actions we undertake today involve such an \nincrease in complexity that we act generally with less knowledge than \nwe would like to have even if with more than we once had.\n  But I think we also need to understand that there is another law at \nwork. That would be the ``law of unacceptable suffering.'' Because as \nthe cost of our welfare system mounts the human cost mounts, the risk \nof change is diminished, and I believe there is a point beyond which \ninaction becomes complicity. I think we have reached that point. I \nthink this is a principle that ought to organize and direct our debate, \nto try to find a source of hope so that we will not have an endless \nclass of underrepresented, underprivileged citizens with which we have \nnothing to offer--hope that our divisions, class divisions, that appear \nto be so intractable in our society are not permanent and hope that \nsuffering will not be endless.\n  Mr. President, I think one source of that hope is found in devolution \nof power to the State. I know there is disagreement on that. But I \nthink there is a compelling logic to the proposal. States are closer to \nthe problems. Generally, State solutions are more acceptable to their \npublic, and they are more flexible. We do not have a one-size-fits-all \nFederal mandate. Federal officials do not have a monopoly on \ncompassion. I think that belies the lack of accomplishment over the \nlast few decades.\n  So I support the devolution as an element of the Republican reform. \nBut I believe also there are limits to the approach of devolution. The \nfact is most States have already engaged in some flexibility \nexperiments and some devolution, some welfare experiments through \ndevolution. Some reforms have been in place for years, and while the \nresults show some good results there are several cases that have been \ngood. Often progress is marginal, and sometimes incremental.\n  I do not offer this as a criticism. I offer it as a caution. \nDevolution I believe is necessary. But I do not believe it is all \nsufficient because, as we all know, State officials are fully capable \nof repeating the same mistakes as Federal officials, and State welfare \nbureaucracies can be just as strong and just as wrong as Federal \nprograms. \n\n[[Page S 13498]]\n\n  So I think the limitations of devolution come down to this: The \nproblem with welfare for the last 30 years is not the level of \ngovernment at which money has been spent. Our difficulty is more than \nprocedural. It is substantive. We need to make fundamental choices on \nthe direction that our system is going, not just about its funding \nmechanisms.\n  Mr. President, I think a second source of hope is found in the \nstrengthened work requirements of the legislation that we have been \ndiscussing. Requiring work for welfare makes entry-level jobs more \nattractive and discourages many from entering the welfare system in the \nfirst place. I think it is also an expression of our values as a \nnation. Work, as we know, is the evidence of an internal discipline. It \norders and directs or lives. I believe no child should be without the \nmoral example of a parent who is employed, if at all possible.\n  So I support this element of welfare reform. But, as we all know, \nwork requirements are expensive. They are often difficult to enforce. \nThey represent the problem of what to do with the mothers of young \nchildren. Again, while not arguing that they are useless but that their \neffect is limited, they should be supported but they should not be \noversold.\n  I think a third source of hope is the removal of incentives to fail. \nWe have been discussing that in detail today with these amendments. I \nthink it is a mistake for Government to pay cash for a 14-year-old girl \non the condition that they have children out of wedlock and never marry \nthe father. We cannot justify, Mr. President, public policy that \npenalize marriage and provide illegitimacy its economic lifeline. I \nthink Government violates its most fundamental responsibilities when it \ntempts people into self-destructive behavior.\n  So I support the elements in the Republican plan. But the destructive \nincentives in our welfare system are only part of the problem. The \ndecline of marriage, the rise of illegitimacy are rooted clearly in \nbroader cultural trends that affect everyone, rich and poor. Without a \nwelfare system, these trends would still exist and still threaten our \nsociety.\n  Let me repeat that statement. Without a welfare system, the trends of \nillegitimacy, the decline of marriage, would still exist and still \nthreaten at the rate of their growth, and would still threaten our \nsociety.\n  James Q. Wilson recently authored and article called ``Culture, \nIncentives in the Underclass.'' He accepts the figure that less than 15 \npercent of rising illegitimacy between 1960 and 1974 was due to \nincreased Government benefits. ``Some significant part of what is \npopularly called the `underclass problem' '' he argues, ``exists not \nsimply because members of this group face perverse incentives but \nbecause they have been habituated in ways that weaken their self-\ncontrol and their concern for others.''\n  In other words, I think what Wilson was trying to say is that the \nbasic problem lies in the realm of values and character, and those \nvalues are shaped, particularly in early childhood, by certain cultural \nstandards. ``I do not wish,'' Wilson adds, ``to deny the importance of \nincentives such as jobs, penalties, or opportunities, but I do wish to \ncall attention to the fact that people facing the same incentives often \nbehave in characteristically different ways because they have been \nhabituated to do so.''\n  People are not purely economic beings analyzing costs and benefits. \nWe are moral beings. We make choices that reflect our values. \nIncentives are not irrelevant but it is ultimately our beliefs and \nhabits I think that determine our future.\n  So I support these measures: Devolution, work requirements, changing \nincentives. Each one should be part of the package that the Senate \npasses. But even if they were all adopted in the form that I would like \nI believe that our problems and our divisions would still persist.\n  It is important to work at the margins because those margins are \nbroad. A 15 percent reduction in illegitimacy would be a dramatic and \npositive social change. A similar increase in work participation could \nbe labeled a major victory. But I would suggest, Mr. President, that \nour greatest single problem lies beyond the changes that we are \ndebating in this welfare discussion. That problem I would suggest is a \nbreakdown in the institutions that direct and have humanized our lives \nthroughout history, institutions of family, institutions of \nneighborhood, community associations, charities, and religious-based \ngroups.\n  Sociologists call this the ``civil society.'' They talk about \n``mediating structures.'' They say that these institutions build \n``social capital'' and ``positive externalities.'' But this point I \nthink can be reduced to some simple facts.\n  A child will never find an adequate substitute for a father who loves \nhim or her. The mantle of government, the assistance of government, \nwill never replace the warm hand of a neighbor. The directions of a \ngovernment bureaucrat will never replace the counsel of a friend. Any \nsociety is a cold, lonely, and confusing place without the warmth of \nfamily, community, and faith.\n  So it is interesting that this is precisely the reason that Nathan \nGlazer warns of the ``unintended consequences'' in social policy. \n``Aside from these problems of expectations, cost, competency and \nlimitations of knowledge,'' he argues, ``there is the simple reality \nthat every piece of social policy substitutes for some traditional \narrangement, a new arrangement in which public authorities take over, \nat least in part, the role of the family, of the ethnic and \nneighborhood group, of voluntary associations [of the church]. In doing \nso, social policy weakens the position of these traditional agents and \nfurther encourages needy people to depend on the government for help \nrather than on the traditional structures,'' according to Glazer, and I \nagree with him.\n I believe this concern is real, and I think it ought to reorient our \nthinking and our efforts. Our central goal in this debate ought to be \nto try to find a way to respect and reinvigorate these traditional \nstructures--families, schools and neighborhoods, voluntary \nassociations--that provide training in citizenship and pass on morality \nand civility to future generations.\n\n  Listen again to James Wilson. I quote.\n\n       Today we expect ``government programs'' to accomplish what \n     families, villages and churches once accomplished. This \n     expectation leads to disappointment, if not frustration. \n     Government programs, whether aimed at farmers, professors or \n     welfare mothers, tend to produce dependence, not self-\n     reliance. If this is true, then our policy ought to be to \n     identify, evaluate and encourage those local private efforts \n     that seem to do the best job at reducing drug abuse, inducing \n     people to marry, persuading parents, especially fathers, to \n     take responsibility for their children and exercising \n     informal social control over neighborhood streets.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we should adopt this approach because the \nalternative, centralized bureaucratic control, has failed. And because, \nsecond, the proposal of strict devolution has, as I indicated earlier, \nlimitations. But I think there is a third reason we ought to adopt this \napproach, and I think that is the most central reason, that is because \nthis is the only hopeful approach that we face.\n  These institutions--family, neighborhood, schools, church, charitable \norganizations, voluntary associations--do not just feed and house the \nbody but reach in and touch the soul. They have the power to transform \nindividuals and the power to renew our society. There is no other \nalternative that offers and holds out such promise.\n  So I believe we ought to ask one question of every social policy \npassed to every level of government, and that question is: Does it work \nthrough these mediating, traditional, historical institutions, does it \nwork through families, neighborhoods, or religious or community \norganizations, or does it simply replace them?\n  Our primary objective should not be to substitute bureaucrats from \nWashington with bureaucrats from Columbus or Sacramento or Bismarck. It \nshould be to encourage and support private and religious, neighborhood-\nbased, nonreligious efforts without corrupting them with intrusive \ngovernmental rules. Our goal should not only be to redistribute power \nwithin government but to spread power beyond government.\n  This I believe, Mr. President, is the next step in the welfare \ndebate, the \n\n[[Page S 13499]]\nnext stage of reform, the next frontier of compassion in America. \nAccepting this priority would focus our attention on possibly three \nareas: Emphasizing the role of family and particularly the role of \nfathers and mentors where fathers are not present in the lives of \nchildren; rebuilding community institutions; and promoting private \ncharities and religious institutions in the work of compassion.\n  The next stage of welfare reform has to start with the family. The \nabandonment of children mainly by fathers is not a lifestyle choice. It \nis a form of adult behavior with disastrous consequences for children, \nfor communities, for society as a whole. When young boys are deprived \nof a model of responsible male behavior, they become prone to violence \nand sexual aggression. Sociologists will prove to you over and over \nagain these are irrefutable facts. When young girls are placed in the \nsame situation, they are far more likely to have children out of \nwedlock. There is a growing consensus that families are not expendable \nand fathers are not optional.\n  The next step in welfare reform will reestablish a preference for \nmarriage at the center of social policy in America. Wilson again \nobserves that:\n\n       Of all the institutions through which people may pass--\n     schools, employers, the military--marriage has the largest \n     effect. For every race and at every age, married men live \n     longer than unmarried men and have lower rates of homicide, \n     suicide, accidents and mental illness. Crime rates are lower \n     for married men and incomes are higher. Infant mortality \n     rates are higher for unmarried than for married women, \n     whether black or white, and these differences cannot be \n     explained by differences in income or availability of medical \n     care. So substantial is this difference that an unmarried \n     woman with a college education is more likely to have her \n     infant die than is a married woman with less than a high \n     school diploma.\n\n  An astounding statement.\n  Now, for those of us who have been married for a long time--and I \njust celebrated my 30th wedding anniversary--there are probably moments \nand days when that does not quite ring true.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I heard him say he just celebrated his 30th wedding \nanniversary. Can I not assume that Mrs. Coats is also celebrating?\n  Mr. COATS. Mrs. Coats would be delighted and will be delighted when I \nexplain what the Senator from New York has said about her. She was a \nchild bride, and I was privileged to marry her. And she has retained \nthe vibrancy of her youth. I claim no credit for that. She has done \nthat in spite of her husband.\n  As Wilson has said, there are some great advantages to the \ninstitution of marriage; and I think that has been proven out over \ntime, actually from the beginning of time.\n  As I said, while there may be moments that each of us can point to \nwhere we might question that fact, it is undeniable in terms of the \nstatistics that are now in relative to life expectancy, rates of \nhomicide, suicide, accidents, and mental illness. And as a nation, it \nought to be our policy to promote that and not have policies in place, \nalthough maybe well intended, that often serve as a disincentive.\n  I also think that the next stage of welfare reform should find new \nways of rebuilding economic and educational infrastructure, spreading \nownership, housing, assets, educational opportunities. Successful \nbusinesses, active churches, effective schools, and strong \nneighborhoods have always been the backbone of community. To the extent \nthat we can once again, through policy, where appropriate--in many \nplaces it is not appropriate and not effective--to the extent that we \ncan emphasize and nurture this rebuilding, this renewal, we should do \nso.\n  We should also, I believe, focus our attention and resources on \nprivate charities and religious institutions, and that is the reason \nSenator Ashcroft and I rise today to offer this amendment. We offer it \nprimarily for discussion purposes, but we believe that a debate should, \nif it has not already, begin relative to the role of these institutions \nin dealing with some of our social problems.\n  We suggest that a charity tax credit, which we introduced last \nFriday, can answer some very important questions, the most important of \nwhich is how can we get resources into the hands of these private and \nreligious institutions where individuals are actually being \ntransformed, renewed, and provided both external as well as internal \nhelp, and how can we do this without either undermining their work with \nour Federal and State and governmental restrictions or offending the \nfirst amendment.\n  We think this amendment accomplishes that purpose. We respond by \noffering a $500-per-person tax credit for charitable contributions to \npoverty alleviating, poverty preventing, poverty relief organizations. \nWe also require that individuals volunteer their time as well as donate \ntheir money to qualify for the credit,\n because we think it is necessary to do more than simply write a check.\n\n  We think there are a couple very important things that can be \naccomplished by personal involvement: First, the obvious connection \nthat comes with bringing together those that are seeking to provide \nassistance with those that need the assistance and the benefits that \nflow both ways from that effort. But, second, it is an accountability \nfactor, a factor that allows individuals to see how their money is \nbeing used and to ensure that the agency, the church, the association, \nthe group that is utilizing the dollars that are contributed, that they \nare utilized in the most effective and most efficient way.\n  We would like to take a small portion of welfare spending in \nAmerica--estimates are that roughly about 8 percent of what total \nwelfare spending is in terms of what the reduction in revenue to the \nFederal Treasury would be through the charity tax credit--and give it \nthrough the Tax Code to private institutions that provide individuals \nwith hope, with dignity, help and independence.\n  We do not eliminate the public safety net, but we want to focus \nattention on resources where we think they will make a substantial \ndifference.\n  Second, we would like to utilize this in a way of promoting an ethic \nof giving in America. Because when individuals make these contributions \nto effective charities, it is a form of involvement beyond writing a \ncheck to the Federal Government. It encourages a new definition of \ncitizenship and responsibility, one in which men and women examine and \nsupport the programs in their own communities.\n  Marvin Olasky has written about all this. He comments:\n\n       Within a few miles of Capitol Hill there are several places \n     that we could visit today which solve social problems more \n     effectively and efficiently than any measure we will pass in \n     this welfare debate.\n\n  I took him up on that challenge, and one of the organizations I \nvisited was a shelter operated by the Gospel Mission, just within the \nshadow of the Capitol, about 5 blocks from here, that takes homeless, \nhopelessly drug-addicted men off the streets and literally has \ntransformed them into responsible, productive citizens. Their \nrehabilitation rate is 66 percent over a 1-year period of time.\n  The same program, or something similar to that program, is run by the \nFederal Government, called the John Young Center. I drive by it every \nevening on my way home from work. That center has been in and out of \nthe newspapers. Drugs are regularly dealt. And it has been a place of \ndespair, not a place of hope. They claim a rehabilitation rate of 10 \npercent. They spend 20 times the amount of the Gospel Mission.\n  Now, we ought to be visiting these institutions and asking ourselves \nthe question, what are they doing at the Gospel Mission that they are \nnot doing at the Federal center? Or, conversely, what are they doing at \nthe Federal center that is not being done--that we ought to avoid doing \nelsewhere?\n  This is just one example, one example of examples that exist in \nalmost every community in America, where because of frustration with a \ngovernment-run program, with a government attempt, citizens have \nundertaken, either through religious charities, faith-based or not, \nreligious-based, Big Sisters, Salvation Army, the medical volunteers, \nthe local Matthew 25 clinic that exists in Fort Wayne, IN, where \nmedical doctors volunteer their time to the poor--they exist \neverywhere, but not to the degree to which it is making a substantial \ndifference in the macrosense in our Nation. \n\n[[Page S 13500]]\n\n  So Senator Ashcroft and I are trying to highlight these \norganizations, show how they provide a measure of hope, how they can \nrenew lives, renew communities and, hopefully, nurture them through \nacquainting our citizens with their work and giving them the means with \nwhich to contribute to them.\n  Robert Woodson said, for virtually every social program we face \ntoday, somewhere a community group has found the solution that works.\n  I believe, Mr. President, this is the greatest source of hope in this \nwelfare debate. And the primary reason why I am not pessimistic is--\nbecause it is easy to be pessimistic--that many of these groups, as \nWoodson points out, are faith-based, not a particular faith, not a \nparticular denomination. In some, the faith is contrary to my own \nfaith, but they gain their authority and their success by serving their \nneighbors as a form of service to their God. And their ministry \nincludes an element of spiritual challenge and moral transformation.\n  Government should not view this as a problem to be overcome, but as a \nresource that we ought to welcome with open arms because, in serving \nthe poor, we ought to look at religious efforts as allies and not \nrejected as rivals to our program. That power of religious values and \nsocial change can no longer be ignored. It is one of the common \ndenominators of a successful compass.\n  Let me wrap up here by quoting from Robert Woodson again. Bill \nRaspberry wrote a fascinating article on this some time ago in the \nWashington Post.\n  Woodson said:\n\n       People, including me, would check out the successful social \n     programs--I'm talking about the neighborhood-based healers \n     who manage to turn people around--and we would report on such \n     things as size, funding, leadership, technique.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Only recently has it crystallized for me that the one thing \n     virtually all these programs had in common was a leader with \n     a strong element of spirituality. . . .\n\n  He said:\n\n       We don't yet have the scales to weight the ability some \n     people have to supply meaning [in other people's lives]--to \n     provide the spiritual element I'm talking about.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I don't know how the details might work themselves out, but \n     I know it makes as much sense to empower those who have the \n     spiritual wherewithal to turn lives around as to empower \n     those whose only qualification is credentials.\n\n  Mr. President, the failure of our current approach has resulted among \nAmericans in ``compassion fatigue.'' That is understandable, but that \nis not healthy for our society. Compassion for the poor is a valuable \npart of the American tradition, and it is also a central part of our \nmoral tradition. At the very deepest level, we show compassion for \nothers because we are all equally dependent upon the compassion of our \nMaker.\n  But a renewal of compassion will ultimately be frustrated if we act \non a definition of that virtue which has failed. The problem we face is \nnot only that welfare is too expensive, which it is; the problem is \nthat it is too stingy with the things that matter the most--\nresponsibility, moral values, human dignity and the warmth of \ncommunity.\n  This Nation, I suggest, Mr. President, requires a new definition of \ncompassion, a definition which mobilizes the resources of civil society \nto reach our deepest needs. This is going to be a challenge to our \ncreativity. Our response, I suggest, will determine much more about the \nAmerican experiment and the limits that we place on its promise.\n  So the amendment that Senator Ashcroft and I are offering is simply a \nstep, a suggestion, a step toward providing a way to expand that \ncompassion in America, to enlist our citizens in the act of \ncitizenship, and to go beyond government to return to those \ninstitutions which historically, traditionally, and effectively have \nmediated some of our deepest social concerns--the family, the \nneighborhood, the schools, charitable organizations, religious and \nnonreligous voluntary associations.\n  I hope that we can move beyond the details of the welfare debate. \nMuch of this will be discussions for future days. But I hope that this \namendment we are offering at least offers a start and this debate in \nwhich we are engaging will take us to the place where we can step back \nand take a broader view of the problems we face and a more creative \nview of the solutions to address those problems.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am going to have to be away from the \nfloor for awhile now, but I want to say that the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Indiana are the most compelling and thoughtful and, in a certain \nsense, I hope, perfecting of any I have heard in 19 years on this floor \ndebating this subject. I can scarce summon the language to express my \nadmiration.\n  I acknowledge the persuasion that comes from citing dear friends of \n40 years and more, such as Nathan Glazer and James Q. Wilson, with whom \nI have been associated. But the growing perception of the nature of our \nproblem--I could have wished this debate had never taken place in the \nSenate.\n  The proposal to disengage the Federal Government from the care of \ndependent children is not something I can welcome. The address of the \nSenator from Indiana almost makes it worthwhile.\n  The other evening, Monday evening, at the American Enterprise \nInstitute, Robert Fogel of the University of Chicago presented a superb \nhistorical perspective on the cycles of moral and religious awakening \nthat have taken place in the United States since the 1740's, such as \nduring the American Revolution, when we came to judge that the British \nGovernment was not sufficient ethically and morally as an institution. \nAbolition, slavery, temperance--we have had this experience before, and \nit may be we are beginning it again, because what the Senator says is \nso very clear that in the end, these are issues of community, issues of \nrelationships, issues of moral understandings and persuasion.\n  I have said that however much we may be taking a retrograde measure \nwith respect to a Government program, for the first time ever, we are \nbeginning to talk about the problems of family structure. President \nBush began this in an address at Notre Dame in 1992. President Clinton \nbrought it up in a State of the Union Message when he rather casually \ncited projections which had been made in our office about where we may \nbe heading. This week's issue of the the Economist discusses it as a \nworldwide phenomenon but uses the United States as the most advanced \nand desperate case.\n  I just will make one final caveat if you like, caution if you will. \nWe are finally asking the right questions. I do not think we have \nanswers. None will assert this more with greater conviction than such \nas Nathan Glazer or James Q. Wilson. Wilson gave the Walter Wriston \nlecture at the Manhattan Institute in New York City last November \nentitled ``From Welfare Reform to Character Development.'' His new book \nis on character.\n  He has this passage. He says:\n\n       Moreover, it is fathers whose behavior we most want to \n     change, and nobody has explained how cutting off welfare to \n     mothers will make biological fathers act like real fathers. \n     We are told that ending AFDC will reduce illegitimacy, but we \n     don't know that. It is, at best, an informed guess. Some \n     people produced illegitimate children in large numbers long \n     before welfare existed and others in similar circumstances \n     now produce none, even though welfare has become quite \n     generous.\n\n  We have to accept that. We will not get the right answers until we \nask the right questions, but we are not there yet.\n  Without going into detail, we do have some early returns on a program \nof counseling and education with respect to teenage births, and we find \nno effect; a very intensive effort now 4 years in place with nothing to \nshow. But that is all right, the effort has begun. Eight years ago, it \nwould not have come.\n  So I just want to express my admiration and my thanks to the \neloquent, persuasive Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Missouri has risen. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to join the senior Senator from \nNew York in commending the Senator from Indiana for an outstanding, \ninsightful, and dispassionate analysis of \n\n[[Page S 13501]]\na very, very difficult problem. Too often in this Chamber, we view this \nproblem as a financial problem or a governmental problem or a \nbureaucratic problem. But I think the Senator from Indiana has clearly \nalerted us to the fact that this is a problem for individuals, and it \nis a problem for families, and it is a problem for our culture.\n  I believe the measure which he and I are proposing is a measure which \ntakes into account our understanding that we do not believe that \ngovernment is the complete answer to the challenges we face. As a \nmatter of fact, the Senator from Indiana has noted with clarity that \nthere are many, many efforts by government which have been attended by \nonly modest success, if it can be described as success at all.\n  When those enterprises are compared with the efforts that have been \nmade by a number of private groups, including faith-based \norganizations, it is clear that the success rate, sort of the change \nrate, the therapy rate, the healing rate in those organizations is \ndramatically higher.\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity to cooperate with him to try to \nthink of ways we could address our problems that go, as he puts it, \ningeniously beyond government.\n  So often, it is in the role and nature of government to establish the \nminimums: If you do not follow these rules or these regulations, you \nend up in jail. You have to pay this much or you have to do this much \nin order to remain free. Government does not really call us to our \nhighest and best, frequently. That job is the job of other \ninstitutions.\n  In order for us to solve this very substantial challenge, the \ncritical challenge and a crisis in terms of our human resources, we are \ngoing to have to do more than minimums, the kind of thing government \nfrequently deals with. We are going to have to get into the arena of \nmaximums, and we have to find ways of calling on people to be at their \nhighest and their best, rather than just participating in the \nfundamental threshold of what it takes to be a member of the club we \ncall our society.\n  So beyond government, to expect to do more than government would do, \nto try to elicit responses from individuals who literally accept \nresponsibility for helping in this circumstance, we have come up with \nthis idea to provide incentives for individuals to invest their \nresources and themselves in private charitable enterprises which have a \ntrack record of doing what we have failed to do so miserably in our \nwelfare program.\n  None of us have to recount the failure of the welfare program. We \nknow that there are more people in poverty now than there were when we \nstarted the war on poverty. We know that the number of children in \npoverty is a higher percentage than it was when we started this assault \non poverty by government. We can only conclude that the prisoners of \nthe war, the POW's of the war on poverty, have been the children of \nAmerica, the future of this great country.\n  What can we do to try to break this cycle of dependency, to slow the \nproblem instead of grow the problem, because it occurs to me that as we \nhave sought to remedy this situation, to bring therapy to this wound \nthrough government, we have exacerbated the problem; the hemorrhage has \nincreased rather than been stemmed.\n  Perhaps it is instructive for us to look into our past to find out \nwhat might be helpful to us in the future.\n  Our current crisis in the cities is not singular, not unique, not \nsomething that never happened before. We have had crises in our cities \nbefore. Scholars have studied them, and they can point to ways in which \nwe might remediate them. And Professor Marvin Olasky, from Texas, has \nwritten eloquently, and Gertrude Himmelfarb has written, as well, about \nthe same crisis that, 100 years ago, gripped American cities. One of \nthe interesting things about those crises is that they were attended by \na social outpouring, a civic commitment to deal with the problem.\n  The distinguished junior Senator from Illinois, yesterday, had a \npicture on the floor of the Senate. It showed youths huddled against a \nbuilding, semi-clothed, barefooted, sleeping one upon the other, in \nChicago 100 years ago. It was a tragedy then, and what is happening to \nour young people is a tragedy now. She had several suggestions that we \ncould remedy the tragedy with governmental guarantees today. It is \ninteresting to me that the tragedy was not remedied 100 years ago with \ngovernmental guarantees--and I am not against Government and against \nhaving the right kind of safety net and the right kind of transitional \nwelfare; but when welfare moves from being transitional to vocational, \nand the Government becomes the keeper of the poor, and as the keeper of \nthe poor, the Government keeps people poor, we have missed part of the \nequation.\n  One hundred years ago, a substantial component of the equation was \nsimply that citizens cared, and they volunteered and worked with one \nanother compassionately to meet the needs. We need to signal, state, \nand we need to, as the Government, develop an understanding in this \nculture, in our communities, in our cities across this country that we \ncannot get this job done and expect and want people to participate as \nvolunteers.\n  There are interesting data that in the crisis of 100 years ago in New \nYork, there were two volunteers for every needy person. We have \nsubstituted Government for volunteers, and now we have 200 needy people \nfor every social worker. That is just not a problem with the numerics, \nbecause 200-to-1 is an incredible load. It is also a problem with the \ncharacter, not just the quantity. I am not impugning the character of \nsocial workers. They are wonderful people that are devoting their \nlives. But it is different to be administered to by a paid social \nworker than by an individual who says, ``I love you and this community \nenough to accept responsibility, and I want to be part of improving \nyour lot. I want to help you move from where you are to a place that is \ncloser to where I am. I want to help you elevate yourself from \ndependency to industry, from despair to hope.''\n  We need to do what can be done to send a strong signal that we want \nthe desperate and needy of America to be a part of the devoted \naspiration and contribution of our communities and cities and citizens. \nThis modest proposal says to people that if you will give to charitable \norganizations that meet the needs of the needy, you will get your \nnormal tax break. But if, in addition to giving your money, you will \nalso get involved--and the Senator from Indiana said it very clearly, \nthat we want the extra impact of citizen involvement, but we want the \nextra accountability of citizen involvement, citizens who do not just \nwrite a check as a means of shedding the consciousness and excusing \nthemselves from the challenge, but we want citizens who want the check \nas a way of propelling themselves into the challenge, to meet the \nchallenge.\n  So if you will contribute to these charitable organizations and you \nwill match your contribution with an hour a week, on the average, \nthrough the year--50 hours--we will say as a Government that we honor \nthis, that we respect it, and we want to encourage this, we want to \nteach this as a value and virtue in American life, and we care for each \nother to the extent--to use the phrase of the Senator from Indiana--\nthat we go beyond Government and that we get into the involvement, one \nwith another, and we have an interface between those in need and those \nwho can meet the need. That would carry us forward.\n  It is with that in mind that we have raised this proposal for debate \nin the U.S. Senate. I believe that I could stand here and go through a \nlitany of these kinds of nongovernmental organizations, and I have \npages of them and their examples and success rates and their success \nstories. The Senator from Indiana has appropriately indicated that they \noperated about one-twentieth of the cost that normally attends the \ngovernmental function.\n  I could talk about the experience of certain Governors, like Governor \nEngler, who has a program that is successful. He says the reason is \nthat because he has been able to get the Lutheran Services to be a \nparty to it, because they care at a different level. There is a \ndifferent character about the helping hand of a volunteer than there is \nabout the heavy hand of Government. He says that the reason the program \nworks is that this caring, loving, helping hand is available 24 hours a \n\n\n[[Page S 13502]]\nday, 7 days a week. He says that in order to get certain of the \nGovernment programs to work, he has to ask people to have their \nproblems between 9 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon, Monday \nthrough Friday. The truth of the matter is that needs arise in ways \nthat require caring and help and healing, rather than bureaucracy.\n  So it is with this in mind that we have suggested to this U.S. Senate \nfor its consideration, as it ponders what we do to meet the challenges \nof lives that are in despair, that we would consider making a statement \nthat we want to revalue the work of volunteers. We want to say to \nindividuals: Do not just write a check, but make a contribution with \nyour life. And that could help us on the track to the solution that \nhelped when, 100 years ago, volunteers overwhelmed the problems and \nbegan to move us on a track toward recovery.\n  While we are continuing in a mode of intensifying the problem, we \nneed to be switching to a mode of mitigating the challenge. I think we \ncan do that by encouraging the citizens to be the caring hand of the \ncommunity and doing it in a way that expresses the care that healthy \ncommunities must have in order to be surviving communities.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana for his outstanding statement of \nthe opportunity for us to move beyond Government. I think we should \ntake the small steps that are available to us and ultimately take \nlarger steps to make sure that we move beyond Government so that we get \ninto the category of success and remediation and we avoid what we have \nexperienced to date, which is despair and aggravation of the problem.\n  I am grateful to the Senator and I thank him.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask whether or not the Senator from \nConnecticut is here to offer an amendment. Senator Ashcroft and I \nintend to withdraw our amendment. But if there are others who want to \nspeak on it, we obviously would encourage that. I have gotten some \nindication that the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to speak on it. At \nthe appropriate time, we will withdraw that.\n  Before I yield, let me commend my colleague for his articulate, \npassionate statement on behalf of a concept that I believe is critical \nto the future of this country, something that we must embody, embrace, \nand something that we must advance if we are to address this crisis \nthat exists in our society.\n  He brings his experience as a Governor. He has had the opportunity \nthat many of us have not had in dealing with this on a day-to-day basis \nfrom an executive position and as someone who was charged with the \nresponsibility of carrying out policy instead of just making policy. He \nbrings the experience of someone with a deep heritage of service to \nothers, and his commitment to this concept is commendable.\n  I want to thank him not just for his support but for his initiation \nand his leadership on this effort. We have been going along parallel \ntracks and discovered that we were attempting to advance the same \nideas, so we merged our efforts.\n  His thoughts about involving individuals as volunteers, as well as \njust the writing of a check for the tax credit, was instrumental to \nthis package. His work and efforts and writings and speaking about it \nhave been very, very important to this.\n  I thank him and I want to tell him what a privilege it is to go \nforward together and hopefully have others join us as we attempt to \naddress this next stage in the welfare debate.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Indiana. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his patience. \nI know the Senator has an amendment to follow this. My understanding is \nthis is an amendment we can accept on this side of the aisle. I will \nnot make him wait unduly.\n  I wanted to speak on this issue because, like the Senator from \nMissouri and the Senator from Indiana, I, too, had a piece of \nlegislation I introduced that provided a tax credit for charities that \ndo work for the poor. It is a tax credit for people who give to \ncharities, who do work for the poor.\n  I, too, like the Senator from Indiana, see this as the next logical \nstep in the devolution of welfare. We had an experiment in the 1960's \nthat tried welfare as a grand social scheme that, in fact, should be a \nnational problem solved on a national level by national bureaucrats and \nnational policy. I think what we have seen is that has been a dangerous \nand, in fact, a very destructive way of approaching this problem.\n  What is being offered here on the floor is, in my opinion, sort of a \nsteppingstone to what the final solution should be to solving the \nwelfare problem. What we are doing here is a block grant back to the \nStates, saying we need States to have more flexibility. We need to get \nit back down to the local level.\n  What Senator Coats, Senator Ashcroft, and I have put forward is \nreally this next logical step, which is why do we have the Government \ndirectly involved in setting policy on poverty at all? Why do we not \nenable, empower the people who are most concerned about the people who \nare poor, and that is people in their community, family members, \nneighbors, and people living down the street?\n  Those we have found over time are the most effective poverty-fighting \ntools that we have in our society--people who actually care about their \nneighbors and their friends and their family members.\n  What we need to do is take all this money that gets channeled through \nWashington and instead of having it channeled through here, take that \nmoney and directly send it to the nonprofit churches, in many cases, or \ncommunity organizations that are directly involved on the front line of \nsolving the issue of poverty in the communities.\n  I know the Senator from Indiana represents large cities like \nIndianapolis that have communities in them in those cities where there \nare no jobs, there is no nothing, there is no institution left. The \nonly thing left is a church that holds the whole community together.\n  Why would it not be proper for those people who are paying taxes in \nthat community to be able to take a tax credit to help that church \nwhich has dedicated their mission to helping people in poverty, instead \nof sending their tax dollars here so we can pay a bunch of people to \ntell them how to run their lives?\n  Get people who actually care about that next-door neighbor, who know \nthe young girl who got pregnant and has to raise that child in a \ndestructive home environment who lives next door. Get people who know \ntheir names, who care about them not because they are a number in the \ncomputer but because they are the next-door neighbor they have known \nfor years.\n  That is what this is all about. This is not a devolution in the sense \nwe are throwing away a responsibility and giving it to somebody else. \nWhat we are suggesting is there are logical people to handle these \nproblems and it is not us. It is people who truly care.\n  What the Coats amendment, the Ashcroft, and my amendment would have \ndone is just to take a small portion of the money that we spend on \nwelfare and have that money be used to directly support communities.\n  The question here is not whether or not we should address the issue \nof poverty. It is who is best able to deal with the issue of poverty. \nGo home and ask folks as I have, and talk to people who are in the \nwelfare system or who are poor, who are working poor, and ask them \nwhere they have gotten the most help. Is it from the person who sits \nbehind the computer who has a caseload of hundreds, who processes paper \nand checks, or is it the minister or the person at the local soup \nkitchen, or whatever the case, or neighborhood food banks? Are those \nthe people who actually care, who actually work to make it work for the \npeople who are poor? That is really the fundamental issue here.\n  I was not on the floor at the time the Senator from Indiana gave his \nremarks, but I am looking forward to reading them in the Record because \nof the very high praise from the Senator from New York on his comments.\n  I can only imagine the passion that I know the Senator from Indiana \nhas on this issue, the care and concern he has for making sure that we \ndevelop a system here in Washington that truly is caring, not \ncaretaking; that is truly people oriented, humane in the very \n\n[[Page S 13503]]\nsense of human involvement with other human beings whose problems are \nnot just something that we pay to maintain, but work to solve.\n  That is the fundamental, I think, logical next step and I am \nconfident, when we address this welfare issue again, that we will see \nan increased support for this kind of amendment and for this approach \nto deal with the problem.\n  I am hopeful, whether we do it in the tax bill this time or whether \nits day is a little into the future, we are laying the groundwork now \nfor something that I think will be--I believe this amendment is the \nmost significant amendment that has been offered on the floor. I know \nit will be withdrawn because it is a tax matter and subject to points \nof order and all the problems, but I think this amendment is the most \nsignificant amendment about getting people involved in the communities \nto help their neighbors.\n  One of the great things about America is our relationships with our \nneighbors and our sense of community. The Federal Government has \nsystematically, through welfare programs, said it is not our \nresponsibility to care for our neighbor anymore; you pay taxes, you \nhave Federal benefits, they will take care of them.\n  Well, folks, that may be nice and compassionate on the surface, but \nwhat it does is separate you from the people you live next to, and you \nno longer feel you are responsible for your neighbor. You feel that it \nis not a community anymore, that we are a set of separate kingdoms who \npay our tributes to the lords and the lords will take care of \neverybody. That does not work. That is not America.\n  What we need to get back to is the whole concept that we are in this \ntogether, that we should be a community, that we do have a \nresponsibility for our neighbors, and that we want you to be actively \ninvolved in participating, in making sure that your neighbors, as well \nas the other people in your communities are not in poverty and are \nliving in dignity.\n  That is what this amendment does. I congratulate the Senator from \nIndiana for his stewardship on this issue. I only wish I could be here \nto vote for it, but I understand the need to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I do want to introduce an amendment \nfollowing Senator Coats, but I have listened to the debate and I do \nwant to say a few words of support because I think my colleagues are \nonto something here.\n  The human want, the human despair, the human suffering that is the \nwelfare crisis that we are attempting to address in this debate was not \ncaused by government.\n  There are many ways, I think we feel, in which government has \nfacilitated or enabled the problem to become worse. The problem begins \nwith people who have problems.\n And it will not end until those people are helped by their neighbors, \nby their communities, by a wide array of institutions.\n\n  What I am saying is, and I think this amendment gets to this, is that \ngovernment has not, itself, created the problem, although it may have \nexacerbated it. In the same sense, government alone will not solve the \nproblem. We are going to need community groups, charitable groups, \npeople finding strength within themselves. This amendment recognizes \nthat and tries to create, in the way that we do this in America, tries \nto create a motivation through the tax system for people to get \npersonally involved, once again, in greater numbers--many are now, \nobviously, but to be involved in greater numbers--helping their \nneighbors, their poor neighbors, work themselves out of poverty. So I \nthink there is something here.\n  There is something here, also, in the fact that this well-intentioned \nprogram that started in the 1930's, Aid to Families With Dependent \nChildren--in that sense, the contemplation of Congress was to help the \nchildren of widows--has become so large that in some measure it has \nsent a message to a lot of very well-intentioned, good-natured \nAmericans that the poverty of their neighbors is not their concern.\n  In some ways we have become so good at governmentalizing our \ncommunity responsibility that we have sent a message that individuals \nhave less need to be responsible for those among us who are poor. This \namendment cuts, also, at that conclusion and says to all of us we all \nhave a part to play as we used to before government became so big and \ncommunities became so big.\n  I believe that these problems of babies born to mothers who are \nteenagers, unmarried--a cycle, generation after generation of welfare \ndependency--are so deep that it will take both government and private \nphilanthropic, charitable, and religious institutions to make it \nultimately better. But the very important point that this amendment \nmakes is that Government cannot do it alone. And I congratulate my \nfriends for introducing the amendment and making that point.\n  Finally, I say this. I also think they have made an important \nstatement here in making it clear that religious organizations, faith-\nbased organizations, should be eligible for this credit for \nparticipation in poverty assistance programs because those \norganizations, as I have seen in cities and poor areas throughout \nConnecticut, often have the greatest motivation, the greatest success \nrate in dealing with problems of poverty. When we bring it down to the \nindividuals who are the beneficiaries of this program, I have yet to \nfind a government program that could do a better job than a religious \norganization at instilling in the individual that necessary sense of \nself-worth which is the precondition to any genuine and hopeful effort \nto make that person's life better--based, of course, on the insight \nthat my friend and colleague from Indiana referred to generally, which \nis that if you begin to see yourself as a child of God, and in that \nsense appreciate your value, then you are going to be better able to go \nahead and remake your life in a way that testifies to that insight.\n  I know this amendment is going to be withdrawn. I do think the \nSenator from Indiana, the Senator from Missouri, and the Senator from \nPennsylvania made a very important point here. I hope we can come back \nto it. I hope we will have the opportunity to come back to it, to try \nto truly not only make government more efficient in dealing with \npoverty, but to tap the truly powerful good nature of the American \npeople that is out there and, I think, ready to be tapped to help those \nof their neighbors who are poorer in money and in hope and in \nopportunity than they are.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nConnecticut for his excellent comments and apologize to him for jumping \nahead of him. I did not realize he was rising to speak on the Coats \namendment. Had I known that, I would have let him go forward. I thought \nhe was just standing for his amendment. So I apologize for that, and I \nappreciate very much his comments and his support of this concept. The \nSenator hit the nail on the head very, very well, and I appreciate his \nsupport.\n  I congratulate, again, the Senator from Indiana for offering this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I offer my sincere thanks to both the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Connecticut for their \nwarm words of support for a concept that I think we all endorse and \nbelieve in. I, like the Senator from Connecticut, hope that we have \ninitiated what will be, in the end, a historic debate about how we can \neffectively reach out and help those Americans who, in many instances \nthrough no fault of their own, find themselves in desperate \ncircumstances, but do it in a way that is effective. There is \ncompassion beyond government, and I think we are beginning to discuss \nand tap into what that is.\n  Because the amendment the Senator from Missouri and I have offered is \nsubject to points of order, because it is a tax matter not directly \nrelevant to this bill, because there needs to be more discussion and \nmore foundation laid, in a moment I am going to ask unanimous consent \nto withdraw the amendment.\n  I think this has been a substantive discussion of an extremely \nimportant item that I hope will be brought back up for further debate \nand will become a integral part of the next tax debate on how we \nallocate resources of citizens of \n\n[[Page S 13504]]\nthis Nation, how we allocate those in a way that makes a difference in \npeople's lives and gives us the sense that our work is not in vain and \nthat the check we write is truly making a difference, not only in our \nneighbors' lives but in society.\n  We look forward to that extended debate, and we look forward to the \nday when we can leave the amendment on the floor and bring it to a vote \nbefore the Senate. This is not the appropriate time to do that.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the amendment that is currently \npending be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2539) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2514, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask the amendment I filed at the \ndesk, amendment No. 2514, be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is now \npending.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a modification \nof the amendment that I send to the desk at this time be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2514), as modified is as follows:\n\n       On page 17, line 8, insert ``, for each of fiscal years \n     1998 and 1999, the amount of the State's job placement \n     performance bonus determined under subsection (f)(1) for the \n     fiscal year,'' after ``State family assistance grant for the \n     fiscal year''.\n       On page 17, line 22, insert ``, the applicable percent \n     specified under subsection (f)(2)(B)(ii) for such fiscal \n     year,'' after ``subparagraph (B)''.\n       On page 29, between lines 15 and 16, insert:\n       ``(f) Job Placement Performance Bonus.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The job placement performance bonus \n     determined with respect to a State and a fiscal year is an \n     amount equal to the amount of the State's allocation of the \n     job placement performance fund determined in accordance with \n     the formula developed under paragraph (2).\n       ``(2) Allocation formula; bonus fund.--\n       ``(A) Allocation formula.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Not later than September 30, 1996, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall develop and \n     publish in the Federal Register a formula for allocating \n     amounts in the job placement performance bonus fund to States \n     based on the number of families that received assistance \n     under a State program funded under this part in the preceding \n     fiscal year that became ineligible for assistance under the \n     State program as a result of unsubsidized employment during \n     such year.\n       ``(ii) Factors to consider.--In developing the allocation \n     formula under clause (i), the Secretary shall--\n       ``(I) provide a greater financial bonus for individuals in \n     families described in clause (i) who remain employed for \n     greater periods of time or are at greater risk of long-term \n     welfare dependency; and\n       ``(II) take into account the unemployment conditions of \n     each State or geographic area.\n       ``(B) Job placement performance bonus fund.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The amount in the job placement \n     performance bonus fund for a fiscal year shall be an amount \n     equal to the applicable percentage of the amount appropriated \n     under section 403(a)(2)(A) for such fiscal year.\n       ``(ii) Applicable percentage.--For purposes of clause \n     (i)(I), the applicable percentage shall be determined in \n     accordance with the following table:\n\n                                                         The applicable\n``For fiscal year:                                       percentage is:\n    1998..............................................................3\n    1999..............................................................4\n\n       On page 29, line 16, strike ``(f)'' and insert ``(g)''.\n       On page 66, line 13, insert ``and a preliminary assessment \n     of the job placement performance bonus established under \n     section 403(f)'' before the end period.\n       On page 77, in the matter inserted between lines 21 and 22 \n     (as inserted on page 19 of the modification of September 8, \n     1995), strike ``(C) An increase in the percentage of families \n     receiving assistance under this part that earn an income.'' \n     and insert ``(C) An increase in the number of families that \n     received assistance under a State program funded under this \n     part in the preceding fiscal year that became ineligible for \n     assistance under the State program as a result of \n     unsubsidized employment during such year.''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. As indicated, I submitted the amendment on behalf of \nmy colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Nunn.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Cindy \nBaldwin, who is a presidential management intern fellow in my office \nthis year, be granted the privilege of the floor for the remainder of \nthe debate on welfare reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, there is a happy story to be told in \nthis amendment. I appreciate the fact we have come to a bipartisan \nagreement here on going forward with this amendment. This amendment, I \nthink, goes to the heart of both bills, which is work, which is taking \nthe welfare program and changing it from a kind of income maintenance \nprogram to a work opportunity, work creation, work realization program, \nhopefully, and definitely in the context of the private sector.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of different ways, as I have spoken \nbefore on this floor, in this debate that the current welfare system is \nnot working and does not reflect the best values of our country. \nObviously, the extent to which it has helped to enable the breakdown of \nfamilies, the birth of babies to teenaged young women without fathers \nin the house, and despair and hopelessness for the kids is profoundly \ntroubling and has catastrophic implications for our society. But I \nbelieve that at the heart of the American people's hopes in this \nwelfare reform debate is the question of work. In fact, a recent Wall \nStreet Journal-NBC poll found that 62 percent of the respondents \nbelieve that work is the most important goal of welfare reform compared \nto 19 percent who considered reducing out-of-wedlock births as most \ncritical. I do not mean to diminish the importance of the second goal \nbecause I think in terms of the long-term impact on the welfare rolls \nit is critical.\n  But just to suggest that the most profound way in which this system \nhas digressed from the commonly held values and beliefs of the American \npeople is the extent to which welfare does not encourage work, the \nextent to which it has discouraged work, the extent to which it \nfrustrates and infuriates so many of the American people who feel that \nthey are out there working hard every day paying taxes, and they fear \nand believe that too many of their tax dollars are going to support a \nsystem, this welfare system, that does not adequately encourage, force \nthe people on it to get up, to go out and go to work.\n  Maybe that is why, as we look at the two basic underlying proposals \nthat have been made here on each side of the aisle, that the word \n``work'' appears in the titles that their sponsors have given them. \nSenator Dole's proposal is, as I understand it, entitled ``The Work \nOpportunity Act.'' Senator Daschle's proposal, which was heard as a \nsubstitute earlier and defeated, is called the Work First Act, and that \nis for the reasons that I have stated. The goal here is to cut the \nwelfare rolls, to get people to work, and to create opportunity.\n  As these two proposals have come along, I think we have seen some \nways in which they are quite similar and ways in which they digress \nthat have caused some concern among some of us. It is interesting and \nimportant to note similarities because sometimes in this kind of \ndebate, they get missed. Both proposals, Senator Dole's and Senator \nDaschle's, set essentially the same goal when it comes to work--maybe \nsome slight difference in wording--but that 50 percent of the people on \nwelfare, the families, the potential income earners, be in jobs by the \nyear 2000. It is a goal that is common to both bills. But the way we \nget there is different, and that is what has concerned some of us as we \nhave watched the debate go forward.\n  In Senator Dole's bill there is a 5-percent penalty at the end if you \ndo not achieve the 50-percent placement of people in jobs. In Senator \nDaschle's bill, a different approach is taken. You might call it the \ncarrot as opposed to the stick. And the carrot here is to say that we \nhave to focus in and hold the States to a standard, and an important \nstandard, which is the placement of welfare recipients in unsubsidized \njobs, which is to say private sector jobs. We have some ideas looking \nat the experience about how to do that and where to do it, and our \nexperience suggests building onto some of the cases and grants and \nprograms that have been \n\n[[Page S 13505]]\ncarried out under the Family Support Act of 1988, that the best thing \nto do is to not spend too much time at this business of training, \nalthough training is often necessary, but to focus on getting welfare \nrecipients out there into a job, and then working with them and \ntraining them to make sure that they carry out that job well and that \nthey do so in the context of the work that they are actually \nperforming.\n  Senator Daschle's proposal, as I said, used the carrot, and it said \nthat what we are going to measure every year is what percentage of \npeople on welfare in a given State have been placed into private sector \njobs. It is not enough to gauge how many are in training programs, \nbecause we have done this before. And people can spend a lot of time in \ntraining programs with nowhere to go, all dressed up and no job to \ntake, or no job that they are willing to take.\n  This proposal, creating the personal empowerment contract, is \nsomewhat like Senator Dole's bill, which basically says when people \nsign up for welfare they have to sign a contract, and it has mutual \nresponsibility--no more blank check. You get a welfare check. It is not \neven called a welfare check anymore; it is a temporary employment \nassistance check, and one of the things you have to continue to do to \nget that check is to go out and work, accept any job that is offered, \nunderstanding that that is better than being on welfare, and that it is \nputting you on the first step of a ladder in the private sector job \nmarket that can take you up and up to self-sufficiency.\n  So in Senator Daschle's proposal, a bonus was given to the States, an \nincentive beginning in 1998, creating a pool of 3 percent of the \noverall block grant authorized under Senator Dole's underlying \nlegislation; $16.8 billion a year in that block grant; 3 percent of \nthat money in 1998, 4 percent in 1999, 5 percent in 2000, put into an \nincentive pool to be distributed to the States based on their success \nin getting people off the welfare, not into training programs, not into \npublic works programs or those subsidized jobs, although those can be \ngood sometimes, too, but into private sector jobs.\n  We think that would be not only an important incentive to change the \norientation in terms of the beneficiaries of welfare, the welfare \nrecipients, but we think it would be a very healthy way to shake up the \nwelfare bureaucracy back home in the States, to create incentives that \nare different from today's.\n  Too often in today's welfare system the incentives encourage States \nand administrators and caseworkers alike to make income maintenance--\nnot job placement--their primary mission--income maintenance, write out \nthe check, process the application, get the check to the recipient. \nThat becomes the focus of the system, not stopping the writing of the \nchecks, getting the recipient off of welfare and getting them out into \nan income earning job.\n  The State administrators and caseworkers too often now are sent the \nmessage that it really does not matter whether or not they go the extra \nmile and spend the extra money to remove a recipient from welfare and \ninto a private sector job. That is what this job placement bonus is all \nabout. It sends a message to the States that, if they, their \nadministrators, their case workers, go the extra mile to put somebody \nfrom welfare into a private sector job, that it will pay, that the \nState will receive more money, a job placement bonus, a simple yet \ncritical tool to change the incentives in the welfare office back home \nfrom income maintenance to job placement. A bonus can, and I believe \nwill, turn the welfare office into an employment office, which is what \nit ought to be.\n  Mr. President, so we had these two different visions, and I was \nprepared to offer a separate amendment to incorporate the job bonus \nprovisions of Senator Daschle's proposal into the underlying bill. We \nhave had the opportunity to reason together. We have had some very good \nconversations with Senator Roth, whose modifications to Senator Dole's \nunderlying bill I will describe in a minute, and I think we have come \nup with a superb compromise which I hope people on both sides of the \naisle can support.\n  Senator Roth amended the underlying proposal consistent with the work \nthat I have been privileged to be involved in with him, in his time as \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and ranking minority \nmember before, to try to not only create programs but to create \nstandards by which we can judge those programs as any business would do \nand to reward those who perform better under the programs we have \ncreated.\n  So in Senator Roth's amendment, and provisions included in the \nunderlying Dole bill, a 5-percent bonus pool is created in the year \n2000 which would reward the States, for instance, in proportion to the \nreductions that they had achieved in the length of time families were \nreceiving welfare payments, or the increases in the number of welfare \nfamilies receiving child support. In other words, how many deadbeat \ndads had been shaken and awakened and finally were carrying out their \nresponsibilities.\n  So here is the agreement I believe we have, and I am very grateful \nfor it. It is carried out in the modification to my amendment, Mr. \nPresident, which I have sent to the desk.\n  Under this modification, in 1998, pursuant to the Work First \nproposal, there would be created a pool equal to 3 percent of the \nnational block grant of $16.8 billion which would be contributed to the \nStates based on their success in getting people off welfare and into a \nprivate, a real private sector job.\n  In 1998, that would begin with 3 percent. In 1999, the pool would go \nto 4 percent. And in the year 2000, Senator Roth's provisions remain to \ncreate a 5-percent pool that would be distributed to the States based \non five factors, four of which were in Senator Roth's initial proposal, \nand the fifth would be the one that I have referred to which would be a \nmeasure of the extent to which the States have placed welfare \nrecipients in private sector jobs.\n  I think this is a superb agreement. It makes both approaches better. \nI think it strengthens the underlying proposal by Senator Dole. And \nmore than the question of which side of the aisle it may have come \nfrom, or which proposal it strengthens, it puts teeth into the aim that \nI think all of us have, which is to get people off welfare and back to \nwork, to save the taxpayers' money that we are now spending on a \nprogram that has created such dependency and despair, and to raise up \nthe hopes and sense of opportunity for those who have been condemned to \nthat life of despair on welfare.\n  So I thank Senator Roth and his staff particularly, Senator Dole and \nthe leadership on the Republican side, and all those who have worked \nwith us on this side. This proposal, I take some pride in noting, for a \njob-placement bonus emerges from work that has been done by the \nDemocratic Leadership Council Progressive Policy Institute aimed at \ncreating the right incentives in this system to get people off welfare \nand to work. I am privileged to be the chair of that group, now having \nsucceeded my friend and colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, who I \nalso see in the Chamber and who I am privileged to say has been a \ncosponsor of this amendment with me and Senator Conrad, Senator Nunn, \nand Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their interest \nin this amendment and for what I hope will be unanimous support. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  I commend the Senator for structuring and offering remarks on this \namendment.\n  I think it is important that when we do real welfare reform we do it \nnot just to penalize States that fail to meet certain targets and goals \nbut actually have an incentive to do something positive instead of \nsomething negative. Instead of from Washington punishing States, if you \nwill, that do not meet the goals, we try to get them to accomplish and \nmeet those targets by incentives and bonuses and extra awards if, in \nfact, they are able to meet the targets that we set.\n  Frankly, I think that is a far more efficient and far more \nappropriate method of trying to get States to meet the goals than to \ntry to penalize them. I think this is in keeping with the partnership \nconcept. This is not Big Brother demanding the States do something all \nof the time but to really say we hope they can meet these goals and, if \nthey do, they are going to be rewarded and not just operate with a \nheavy hand \n\n[[Page S 13506]]\nby penalizing States that for various reasons cannot meet the goals we \nset.\n  So I commend the Senator for recognizing this very important fact in \noffering what I think is a major contribution to improving the welfare \nreform bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from Louisiana. I \nthank him for all his work on this amendment. He gets right to the \npoint, which I do want to just stress again, which is that our concern \nwas the underlying bill by providing a 5-percent penalty at the end, at \n2000, if States did not achieve the 50-percent reduction in welfare \nrecipients to work, would be creating a situation where there might be \nan incentive not to comply.\n  In other words, complying will cost some money, getting 50 percent of \nthe welfare recipients to work will cost some money and if there is no \nincentive, no provision, no way that the States by good behavior can \nget that money, they were going to be left with a series of choices \nwhich were not going to be very good. They would either have to raise \nState and local taxes, deny assistance to needy families to get money, \nor create a situation where kids would be left at home because there \nwas not adequate funds for child care for people to try to get off \nwelfare and go to work.\n  So we were worried that the alternative would be that they would \nstart out making, unfortunately, the rational conclusion that maybe it \nwas better not to try to reach the goal of 50-percent welfare to work, \ngive up the 5 percent as part of the penalty because that would \nactually cost them less than what they needed to meet the goal.\n  We think that putting these proposals together in this amendment now \ncreates a positive incentive along the way--1998, 1999, 2000--among \nStates to have them compete, if you will, to have a greater part of \nthat pool we are creating to see which State can place more people into \nprivate sector jobs and therefore receive more money. Again, I thank my \nfriend from Louisiana, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, if there is no further debate, it had been my \nunderstanding that this was acceptable on both sides. As I said before, \nI really want to stress, with some sense of gratitude, the support that \nSenator Roth has given in putting this together, I gather, agreed to by \nleadership on the Republican side, and I sure hope this is part of a \nsense of compromise but also honing our purposes and coming together in \nways that will allow us to achieve a strong bipartisan majority in \nfavor of true welfare reform.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as a cosponsor of the \nLieberman-Breaux-Conrad amendment. I am also pleased that we have been \nable to reach a compromise with Senator Roth on this issue.\n  Mr. President, the funding for work in the Republican bill is \nwoefully insufficient. When the Finance Committee considered welfare \nreform, the Congressional Budget Office told me that funding in the \nRepublican bill was so insufficient, that only 6 States would have a \nwork program. CBO said States were more likely to take the 5 percent \npenalty in the bill than put welfare recipients to work.\n  Now, after the Dole bill has undergone several modifications, CBO \nsays that only 10 to 15 States will have resources sufficient to meet \nthe work requirements under the bill. Seventy to eighty percent of the \nStates will simply not operate the kind of work program advocated by \nthe bill.\n  The risk that most States will not even have a work program makes the \nLieberman-Breaux-Conrad amendment extremely important.\n  Our amendment establishes a bonus fund under the block grant for \nStates that move people into unsubsidized, private sector jobs. Our \ncompromise with Senator Roth dramatically improves the incentives for \nStates to operate meaningful work programs, even in the face of \nwoefully insufficient resources.\n  It is important to remember that many welfare recipients are \ndifficult to employ and require more significant assistance in order to \nbecome employable. Sixty three percent of long-term welfare \nrecipients--those on the rolls more than 5 years--lack a high school \ndiploma. Fifty percent of long-term welfare recipients had no work \nexperience in the year before the entered the welfare system.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to leave anyone with the impression that \nour amendment is a panacea. It is not. Nor does our amendment fix the \nsignificant problems in the Republican bill. Even with our amendment, \nStates will not have the resources to move long-term welfare dependents \ninto the private sector work force. However, the amendment I offering \nwith Senators Lieberman, Breaux, Nunn, and Dodd does provide a critical \nincentive for States to get people into real jobs and off the welfare \nrolls. It is a small, but important step toward improving the bill \nbefore us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and again thank \nSenator Roth for his willingness to work with us in reaching a \nbipartisan compromise.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I am pleased Senator Lieberman proposed his \nperformance standards amendment and that we have been able to \ncollaborate on this important initiative. I also want to thank Senator \nHatfield for his interest in this issue and for his support.\n  Mr. President, the last time Congress passed major welfare \nlegislation was in 1988 to create the job opportunities and basic \nskills training [JOBS] program. The intent of this legislation was to \nmove families from welfare to work. Since then, Federal and State \ngovernments have spent almost $8 billion on this program alone. This \ndoes not include JTPA or a variety of other employment and training \nprograms.\n  GAO has issued a number of reports on the JOBS Program. One need not \nread past the title of a recent statement by GAO before the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources which states, ``AFDC Training Program \nSpends Billions, But Not Well Focused on Employment.'' GAO testified, \n``Today, more than 5 years after JOBS was implemented, we do not know \nwhat progress has been made in helping poor families become employed \nand avoid long-term welfare dependence.''\n  After spending $8 billion on this program, what has the program \nachieved for the taxpayers or the welfare recipients? GAO does not \nknow. The Department of Health and Human Services does not know. The \nexisting AFDC quality control system cannot tell us. We simply do not \nknow.\n  Over the years, Congress has created a confused and confusing system \nwhich rewards idleness and punishes work. The goal of employment has \nbeen lost in an excessive bureaucracy. Education and training have been \nseparated from employment when a job is the real education and training \nprogram people need. That is a system which makes sense only in a Lewis \nCarroll story.\n  Mr. President, by now, it is generally well known that the Republican \nwelfare reform bill eliminates the JOBS Program and gives the power to \nthe States to design their own work solutions. However, we have also \ntaken an additional step to ensure that we will know whether the States \nare effective in moving toward the goal of reducing dependency by \nincorporating performance standards into the legislation. Senator \nLieberman's ideas and support strengthen this proposal.\n  These performance standards are consistent with the quality\n   assurance system already being discussed among the States. The \nNational Association of Human Services Quality Control Directors has \nstated that, ``with the numerous welfare reform waivers being \nimplemented across the Nation, one essential component is the provision \nof performance outcome measurements.''\n\n  The idea of establishing performance standards is not new. In the \nFamily Support Act of 1988, Congress required the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to develop and transmit to Congress a proposal for \nmeasuring State progress. Those recommendations are nearly 4 years \noverdue. Much of the testimony during the welfare hearings held since \nMarch supported the idea of outcome-based performance standards. I do \nnot believe we need to wait any longer to implement that which we \ncalled for 7 years ago. Earlier this year, the quality control \ndirectors helped develop eight specific outcome-based measurements. \nThese measurements were developed by State officials from Delaware, \nIllinois, California, Oregon, Kentucky, Georgia, Massachusetts, \nMinnesota, Virginia, and West \n\n[[Page S 13507]]\nVirginia. The measurements included in the Republican bill are \nconsistent with those recommended standards.\n  Let me also point out there are inherent benefits to be realized in \nwhatever progress the States make toward these performance \nmeasurements.\n  Block grants should not mean simply giving money to the States and \nturning our backs on what they do with it. The purpose of public \nassistance is to help families temporarily in need to return to \nfinancial independence. Establishing performance standards will help us \nhold the States accountable for this $16 billion program.\n  Properly understood, welfare reform is about reforming how Government \nworks. Under the present system, no one is accountable for results. In \n1993, Congress took an important step toward outcome-based performance \nthrough the Government Performance and Results Act. For the welfare \nsystem and for other governmental programs as well, block grants to the \nStates are another important step in reform.\n  This next step in welfare reform may well become a giant leap in \nreinventing Government. In the future, Government funds will no longer \nbe simply distributed to provide a good or service. By instituting a \nquality assurance system based on performance standards, the American \npeople will know whether their hard-earned dollars worked as intended. \nOver the past 30 years, we have spent $5.4 trillion on our longest war, \nthe war on poverty. Now is the time, before another 30 years go by, to \nestablish a system which will tell us whether the goals we have set are \nbeing achieved. Performance standards will enable us to do exactly that \nand we will not need the miles of regulations and thousands of \nbureaucrats which now drive the system.\n  Again, I want to recognize and thank Senator Lieberman and Senator \nHatfield for their efforts on this legislation. I want to also express \nmy deep appreciation to Senator Dole for including my amendment in the \nRepublican substitute. We have taken a bold and important step in \nchanging the way Government works.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the only way to permanently reduce the \nwelfare rolls is to put welfare recipients to work in unsubsidized, \nprivate sector jobs with the skills to remain self-sufficient. It is \nimpossible for a welfare recipient to become economically self-\nsufficient if that individual is not earning a paycheck.\n  Throughout this debate I have urged my colleagues to use common sense \nin finding a solution to the perplexing problem of welfare dependency. \nThe Lieberman Work Bonus amendment makes good sense.\n  The amendment sets aside a small portion of the block grant to \nprovide bonuses to States that have been successful in placing \nrecipients in unsubsidized, private sector jobs. But getting a job is \nnot enough; welfare recipients must keep those jobs. So this amendment \nprovides an additional bonus for job retention.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which will enable more \nwelfare recipients get the jobs they need to get off of welfare and \nbecome self-sufficient.\n  Mr. President, an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that 30 to 35 States will not meet the work rates established \nin the Dole amendment. Given that reality, States may be tempted to cut \ncorners and find a quick fix rather than seek long-term solutions. What \nmay work in the short term will not achieve the lasting change we seek.\n  Last December, Iowa's Governor, Terry Branstad, told me at a hearing \nthat we need to make ``up front investments'' to achieve ``long-term \nresults.'' Iowa has been making these investments and is achieving \nsuccess. We have much more to do, but it is clear that the trends are \nmoving in the right direction. The welfare rolls are declining, more \nwelfare recipients are working, and costs for AFDC are down.\n  I believe that part of the reason Iowa is achieving such good results \nis that welfare recipients have incentives to take jobs. They are able \nto keep more of what they earn and are encouraged to save part of the \npaychecks to deal with future emergencies.\n  Other States have also secured waivers to increase work incentives \nand are having similar results. I believe we should encourage Iowa and \nthese other States to stay the course that is showing such promising \nresults.\n  The title of the Dole bill is the ``Work Opportunity Act.'' We need \nto make it clear that the opportunity to work is not in some dead-end, \nmake-work Government job, but in a job that provides a paycheck.\n  The set-aside is a modest amount, but provides a powerful incentive \nfor States to duplicate successful job placement programs like that in \nRiverside, CA. Or, of course, follow Iowa's lead on welfare reform.\n  I know I sound like a broken record but once again I am going to talk \nbriefly about the Iowa Family Investment Program. One of the greatest \nsuccesses of this new program is that more welfare recipients are \nworking.\n  The welfare reform program took effect on October 1, 1993. At the \ntime 18 percent of welfare recipients were working and earning income. \nThe number of people has been increasing and is now 32.6 percent.\n  This is just the number of people who are working and earning income. \nIt does not include the welfare recipients who are attending education \nand training programs or who are performing community service or are \nengaged in other worthwhile activities--32.6 percent of Iowa welfare \nrecipients are working and earning the paycheck that is critical to \nmoving them off the welfare rolls and keeping them off.\n  This amendment rewards States for doing that very thing. As I said \nearlier, it just makes sense. Without such an incentive, I am concerned \nthat States may take the short course.\n  This amendment does not penalize any State, but merely provides an \nincentive for putting people to work in real jobs that earn real \npaychecks.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent that a recent editorial from the \nDes Moines Register be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Sept. 2, 1995]\n\n                        Working While on Welfare\n\n       Iowa's innovative welfare-reform program continues to look \n     good.\n       Just under two years ago, Iowa's Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children program was converted to a new Family \n     Investment Program with the intent of moving more people off \n     welfare and into jobs. That for years has been the intent of \n     the AFDC welfare plan, which has had some success. But the \n     Iowa plan changed the ground rules, allowing welfare families \n     to keep more of their assets and their earnings to increase \n     incentives to get a job.\n       In July 1993, 18 percent of Iowa AFDC family heads held \n     jobs. The reform plan began three months later. By July 1994, \n     31 percent had jobs. By July of this year, the proportion had \n     risen to 32.6 percent--nearly twice the level of two years \n     earlier.\n       That 32.6 percent gives Iowa the highest ratio of working \n     welfare recipients in the nation.\n       The reform plan contains a carrot-and-stick approach. Under \n     both the old and new plans, workers' welfare benefits \n     decreased as earned income increased, but under the new plan \n     it decreases at a slower rate, meaning total income is \n     higher. Also, under the new plan, recipients can have higher \n     assets and still receive help--which encourages saving.\n       The stick: Recipients can lose benefits if they don't sign \n     a contract to get a job or job training, or if they sign but \n     don't live up to the contract's provisions. That has happened \n     to more than 1,000 former recipients. They still get food \n     stamps and medical care, and public health officials check on \n     the children. But no more cash grants.\n       Iowa is setting an example the nation would be wise to \n     follow.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We do accept the amendment on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question then is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2514), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2603\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I call up my amendment 2603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment 2603 is now pending. \n\n[[Page S 13508]]\n\n  The Senator from North Carolina may proceed.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995, edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHelms be added as a cosponsor on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, before coming to the Senate I spent 45 \nyears in the private sector meeting a payroll as a businessman and a \nfarmer. Every year I watched as the Congress went into session and \nadjourned, leaving it more difficult for working taxpayers to make ends \nmeet because of the out-of-control Government spending programs that \nhave put our country on the path of fiscal disaster.\n  Of all the spending programs implemented by the Federal Government, \nnone has been a bigger failure than those programs collectively known \nas welfare. President Johnson's war on poverty was launched with good \nintentions, but it has been a miserable failure--a disaster. And in \nmany ways it has made the plight of the poor worse instead of better. \nThe current welfare system has become a national disaster.\n  A simple commonsense principle--that we have failed to heed--has \ngotten our Nation and the poor into the present fix: You get more of \nwhat you pay for. And for the past 30 years the Federal Government has \nsubsidized and thus promoted self-destructive behavior like \nillegitimacy and family disintegration. Almost one in three American \nchildren is born out-of-wedlock. In some communities the out-of-wedlock \nbirth rate is almost 80 percent.\n  What is needed is a dramatic change--a reversal of the trends and \nprograms of the last 30 years, and not another failed Federal \nGovernment program, like the Family Support Act of 1988, which \nperpetuates the problem of welfare dependency and increased them.\n  I know from first-hand experience that if you have a problem with \nyour business you have to do something about it immediately.\n  If you tinker around the edges and do not address the problem you \nwill be out of business. Unfortunately, far too few of my colleagues \nhave had the benefit of that sort of business experience. For many here \nin the Senate, there is no problem that can not be fixed with another \nFederal spending program and another appropriation of tax dollars.\n  Mr. President, these people may mean well and they may think that \nthey're being humane, but the way to solve a problem is to address the \nroot cause. And the root cause of the tragedy of welfare dependency is \nillegitimacy, the rise in out-of-wedlock births. Only by seeking to \ncurb the rise in out-of-wedlock births can we possibly hope to reform \nwelfare.\n  The findings of the Dole bill state clearly:\n\n       The increase in the number of children receiving public \n     assistance is closely related to the increase in births to \n     unmarried women.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more likely to be \n     on welfare when they grow up.\n       Among single-parent families, nearly half of the mothers \n     who never married received AFDC while only one-fifth of \n     divorced mothers received AFDC.\n\n\n  This is all from the Dole bill.\n       Young women 17 and under who give birth outside marriage \n     are more likely to go on welfare and to spend more years on \n     welfare once enrolled.\n\n  That is why I have consistently urged the leadership to include \nprovisions like those in the House-passed bill which take away the \ncurrent cash incentives for teenage mothers to have children out-of-\nwedlock.\n  And that is simply what it is--a cash incentive to encourage teenage \nwomen to have children out of wedlock.\n  Currently, 40 percent of AFDC recipients are never-married women, and \nnever-married women are most likely to remain on welfare for 10 years \nor more. Only by taking away the perverse cash incentive to have \nchildren out-of-wedlock can we hope to slow the increase in out-of-\nwedlock births, and ultimately end welfare dependency. We must take \naway the cash incentive.\n  Middle-class American families who want to have children have to \nplan, prepare, and save money because they understand the serious \nresponsibility involved in bringing children into the world. It is \nunfair to ask these same people to send their hard-earned tax dollars \nto support the reckless irresponsible behavior of a woman who has \nchildren out of wedlock and continues to have them, expecting the \nAmerican taxpayers to pay for them, as we have done for the last 35 \nyears.\n  I do not believe that the Federal Government should ever have been in \nthe business of saying to a 15- or 16-year-old girl, ``If and only if \nyou have a child out of wedlock we will send you a check in the mail \nevery month to arrive on the third day of the month.'' This is what we \nsay to them. ``If you have a child out of wedlock, we will send you a \ncheck every month.''\n  The Federal Government should not be in the business of subsidizing \nillegitimacy.\n  I believe that there should be a clear restriction on the use of \nFederal funds to provide cash to unmarried teenage mothers. We should \nprovide in-kind aid or aid through supervised group homes. The mother \nas well as the baby she is having need supervision. But we should not \nuse Federal tax dollars to send checks in the mail to unmarried teen \nmothers. Any State government that believes in its heart that the best \nway to assist teenage mothers in the State is to send that mother a \ncheck in the mail should use State funds and not Federal funds.\n  The House-passed legislation contained a clear restriction on the use \nof Federal funds to give cash welfare to unmarried teen mothers. States \nare perfectly free to use their own money for that purpose. But not \nFederal tax dollars.\n  I believe the House provision is correct. However, there has been a \nlot of concern expressed that this policy is overly directive. \nTherefore, in the amendment I have introduced, I have attempted to \nstrike an even greater balance between the need to combat illegitimacy \nand the need for State flexibility.\n  My amendment takes the restriction on the use of Federal funds to \ngive cash to unmarried teen mothers and adds what has become known as \nan ``opt-out.''\n  Under this amendment, Federal funds cannot be used to give to minor \nmothers. But the State legislature wants to come into session and \noverturn Federal policy, it is free to do so.\n  Under this amendment, if the State legislature wants to come into \nsession and overturn the Federal policy, they are free to do so.\n  States cannot continue the failed policies of the past by doing \nnothing. They cannot just ignore the issue of teen illegitimacy and \nhope it will float away. Any State which wishes to use Federal tax \ndollars to give cash welfare to unwed mothers must go into session and \nenact a law to do so. Therefore they will be responsible to the voters \nin that State that sent them to the State legislature.\n  Thus, the amendment does not mandate a specific solution. But it will \ngenerate careful State consideration of the issue. This amendment does \nnot prohibit State governments from using Federal funds for cash aid to \nunmarried teenagers. But it forces them to consider very carefully what \nthey are doing before they continue to do so. It forces States to think \ncautiously and deliberately before they choose to continue a policy \nwhich has caused so much damage in the past.\n  If enacted, my amendment will generate the needed debate at the State \nlevel on teenage pregnancy.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the simple answer to the issue that is \nbefore us, very well stated by the Senator from North Carolina, is that \nthe morals around us will change when the \n\n[[Page S 13509]]\nmorals within us change. That is going to be a slow process. That does \nnot make any less important the issue that is before us.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has very well stated a proposition, \nand he probably feels he has a very good solution, a legislative \nsolution, to the ills that he has adequately stated.\n  So I do not disagree with the pronouncements and description of the \nproblem. I do disagree with the legislative solution. So I have to take \nexception to the approach by the Senator from North Carolina, because \nit is a very difficult issue.\n  I have given it a great deal of thought, and I believe it is \nimportant that it is being discussed. A lot of people would just as \nsoon not discuss it. Even a lot of people within this body would just \nas soon not discuss it.\n  Last year, we heard it very eloquently stated by Bill Bennett, our \nformer Secretary of Education, in his raising the concern that the cost \nto the society of moral decline since the 1960's has been very \ndevastating. He published, as you recall, what he referred to as the \n``index of leading cultural indicators,'' a compilation which attempted \nto demonstrate a data base analysis of cultural issues. It was a \nstatistical portrait from 1960 to the present of the moral social \nbehavior conditions of our modern American society.\n  It was in the Wall Street Journal that he wrote about quantifying \nAmerica's decline. He cited some of the statistics from the index. \nWhile social spending in the United States since 1960 increased \ndramatically, the social indicators during the same period showed \noverwhelming declines. For example, Dr. Bennett says that in the last \n30 years, while there has been more than a fivefold increase in social \nspending at all levels of government, there has been a 650-percent \nincrease in violent crime, a 419-percent increase in illegitimate \nbirths, a quadrupling of divorce rates, a tripling of the percentage of \nchildren living in single-parent homes, more than a 200-percent \nincrease in the teenage suicide rate, and a drop of almost 80 points in \nthe SAT scores.\n  He said that perhaps more than anything else, America's cultural \ndecline is evidence of a shift in the public's attitude and beliefs. \nOur society now places less value than before on what we owe to others \nas a matter of moral obligation, less value on sacrifice as a moral \ngood, less value on social conformity and respectability, and less \nvalue on correctness and restraint in matters of physical pleasure and \nsexuality.\n  He also stated the good news is that what has been self-inflicted can \nbe self-corrected. So I think Bill Bennett, in stating a crisis \nsituation in American society, has not stated that there is no hope. In \nfact, very correctly he believes that it is within us as a society and \nindividuals within our society to correct this situation.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has described a situation within the \nwelfare system that contributes somewhat to this that needs to be dealt \nwith. The only question is, should it be dealt with at the State level \nthrough the State legislatures, or should it be dealt with by those of \nus in Congress?\n  I say that the States have proven in many areas of welfare reform \nthat they are better equipped to deal with those issues than we are.\n  So in the devaluation of traditional views, we have seen a reciprocal \nincrease in self-destructive behavior. This self-destructive behavior \nin turn manifests itself in our communities, in our families, and it \nleads to an increase in destructive forces for our entire Nation. And \nit has costs with it.\n  We are talking about societal costs of illicit sexual relations. You \nknow them better than I do: The sexually transmitted diseases; teen \npregnancies that cut short bright futures; abortion; broken hearts; \nbroken homes, not to mention the financial costs to individuals, \nfamilies, communities and, again, our entire Nation.\n  William Raspberry addressed this concern in a Washington Post \narticle. He remarked that:\n\n       To a striking degree, the problems we worry most about--\n     teenage pregnancy, fatherless households, AIDS and other \n     sexually transmitted diseases, dropping out of school, infant \n     mortality, even aspects of poverty--are the consequences of \n     inappropriate sexual behavior.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The hip response is to redouble AIDS research, establish \n     birth control clinics in nurseries and schools, distribute \n     condoms and clean needles, in general to teach kids what to \n     do in the back seat of a car.\n\n  He also goes on to say:\n\n       It is all very well to try to save people from disastrous \n     consequences of their behavior, but,\n\nhe emphasizes,\n\n     doesn't it make sense to try to discourage some of the \n     behavior in the first place? A part of the message must be \n     directed not just at the awful consequences but at the deadly \n     behavior itself.\n\n  I sense what the Senator from North Carolina is saying is that at the \nvery least, we should not give financial incentive to this sort of \nbehavior through the welfare system which comes from the taxpayers of \nAmerica. The fact is, the sexual liberation movement of the sixties \ndemonstrated itself to be a socially and morally bankrupt one. The \nonce-accepted practices are perceived by the mainstream as an abject \nfailure.\n  We would not have this welfare reform issue before us if that was not \ntrue. It is time that our social institutions and our Nation as a whole \nreturn to the teachings of the moral obligations: Self-sacrifice, \nsocial conformity, and abstinence. They are truly virtues to be upheld, \nand society appreciates them.\n  Those who teach otherwise will have an increasingly hard sell to a \ngrowingly skeptical mainstream, and that is true or we would not even \nhave this welfare issue before us.\n  Here is some of the specific research on the consequences of being \nborn out of wedlock or living in a single-parent home. These children \nhave specific health risks, substantially higher risks of being born at \nvery low or moderately low birth rates. There are specific educational \nrisks as well. They are more likely to experience low verbal cognitive \nattainment. They are three times more likely to fail and repeat a year \nin grade school than are children from intact, two-parent homes. They \nare almost four times more likely to be expelled or suspended from \nschool. Children of teenage single parents have lower educational \naspirations and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents \nthemselves.\n  As I read this research, as we point to what is wrong--and you have \nall heard it--it is very obvious why welfare reform is an issue. Not \nonly are there health risks and educational risks, but there are also \nsocial risks. And welfare reform is seen as a way of reducing those \nsocial risks. Being born out of wedlock significantly reduces the \nchances of a child growing up to have an intact marriage. These same \nchildren are three times more likely to be on welfare when they grow \nup.\n  They are also more likely to be poor. While only 9 percent of the \nmarried-couple families with children under 18 have income below the \npoverty level, 46 percent of the female-headed households with children \nunder 18 have income below the national poverty level. That is the \nfeminization of poverty. In single-parent families, where they have had \na divorce, the woman is most apt to immediately be into poverty. The \nhusband is not as likely to be. And then these risks are out there for \nthe children as well. But there is as much risk for the young mother as \nwell. The younger the mother, the less likely she is to finish high \nschool. If she has children before finishing high school, she is more \nlikely to receive welfare assistance for a longer period of time.\n  In fact, the Centers for Disease Control has estimated that between \n1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to teenage mothers under the \nAid to Families with Dependent Children Program, the Food Stamp \nProgram, and the Medicaid Program was $120 billion.\n  Apart from the obvious consequences on the children, who have greater \nhealth problems and lower educational aspirations, and the cost to the \nyoung mother, who is less likely to gain independence, we have to look \nat the consequences for society as well. That is what I believe the \nSenator from North Carolina is looking at.\n  We have seen a dramatic rise in crime. Apart from reforming welfare, \ndealing with crime seems to be the highest thing on the priority list \nof our constituents.\n  According to the Bureau of Census, of those youth held for criminal \noffenses \n\n[[Page S 13510]]\nwithin the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived \nprimarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these \nincarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62.8 million children in the \nNation's resident population were living with both parents.\n  So, Mr. President, in the face of all this evidence, is it not \nridiculous to deny the need to return to sanity? The breakdown of the \nfamily and its results for our society are indeed overwhelming. The \nonly issue becomes answering the question: Who should call for the \nreturn to sanity? The Senator from North Carolina says it should be the \nCongress of the United States and the Federal Government. I say it \nshould be the State's responsibility--not in isolation and not without \na track record of their success, because we have seen the Federal \nGovernment fail at welfare reform, as we have seen the number of people \non welfare go up 3.1 million since the last welfare reform bill was \npassed 7 years ago.\n  In the meantime, we have seen State after State--albeit having to \nsuffer some sort of waiver from the Federal Government to get what they \nwant--still succeed at moving people from welfare to work, and save the \ntaxpayers' money. I guess that gives me the confidence that I would \nexpect my State of Iowa and I would also expect the State of North \nCarolina to solve the teenage pregnancy problem, the problem of \nillegitimacy. And if one of the ways they want to do that is \ndiscouraging it by denying additional cash benefits to mothers under \nage 18, then they ought to have the right to do it. If they see some \nother way of doing it, then that other approach ought to be tolerated \nby those of us in Washington, DC, who ought to readily admit a track \nrecord that proves we do not have an answer to every social problem by \nan enactment of Congress and an appropriation of the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  So I agree that out-of-wedlock births, and all of its consequences, \nare destroying our society. Where we disagree is that I believe we \nshould allow States to address the crisis. Personally, I believe the \nStates should try many creative approaches to try to address this \ncrisis in our Nation. I think States should look at the reform in the \nno-fault divorce laws that passed in the fifties and sixties. \nUnfortunately, I have to admit to my colleagues, as well as to my \nconstituents in Iowa, that I made a great big mistake back in the late \nsixties when I supported no-fault divorce as a member of the State \nlegislature. I hope the State legislatures will look at changing those \nlaws to make the decision to marry a more serious one and the decision \nto divorce a more circumspect one.\n  I also think the States should look at changes in their approach to \ndealing with the problems of out-of-wedlock births. They need to \nexperiment with new ideas to see how to discourage people from having \nchildren before they are ready to care for them, and they need to see \nwhat works with teenagers, what works with those who are older. The \nillegitimacy problem is not just one for teenage mothers. We hear a lot \nabout discouraging young people from getting pregnant. But States also \nneed to experiment with how to discourage young men from fathering \nchildren before they are ready to provide for them.\n  Changing laws alone will not change behavior, but it is a first step. \nIn order to address these kinds of social problems, every institution \nin society must take this problem as a very personal problem. That \nmeans every church, every synagogue, every mosque, must work together \nwith their congregations to bring their message of morality and purity \nto the people in their area. Every community group needs to urge \nabstinence as the only sure way to avoid disease and pregnancy. This is \ntruly a crisis requiring immediate action at every level.\n  So I join my colleagues in raising the banner of awareness. However, \nI cannot join my colleague from North Carolina in mandating a specific \nrequirement. I believe the States will address this issue and will \naddress it as successfully in this area as they have on a lot of other \nwelfare reform issues that are before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the amendment of my \nfriend from North Carolina and speak in opposition to a well-intended \nbut, it seems to me, very badly conceived approach to a problem which \nwe all acknowledge.\n  Earlier today, I had the occasion to congratulate the Senators from \nIndiana and Missouri for their hugely insightful and able remarks. I \nrefer particularly to those of the Senator from Indiana on the \nprecedent of what do we do about civil society and about the breakup in \nthose primal relationships that seem to be so essential to any society, \nand have always been assumed to be, but which seem to be disappearing \nin ours.\n  And not only in ours, Mr. President. I remark that in the current \nissue of the Economist, the subject is ``The Disappearing Family.'' But \nsimply to read a passage, it says:\n\n       A father is not just a cash cow. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a \n     Democratic Senator who has taken these problems seriously for \n     30 years, says that a community without fathers asks for and \n     gets chaos. As an American, he has been able to see that \n     chaos for some time, but it is now visible elsewhere. There \n     are neighborhoods in Britain where more than two-thirds of \n     homes with children lack fathers. Some of Paris' wilder \n     banlieues are not that different.\n\n  The Economist article contains a bar chart which is entitled ``Fewer \nGolden Rings, Births to Unmarried Mothers as a Percentage of Total,'' \nwhich shows the extraordinary growth from 1960 in Iceland, Sweden, \nDenmark, France, Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, \nGermany, Holland, Spain, and Switzerland. There was no growth at all in \nJapan.\n  There is a descending order of the present ratios, from Iceland, at \nabout 55 percent. Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, France, Britain, the United \nStates--with Britain and France ahead of the United States--and Canada, \njust after the United States. Australia, Germany, Holland--smaller \nratios in those areas.\n  We are not alone in this, nor have we ignored the subject. It was \nperhaps not widely noticed, but a year ago in Public Law 103-322, \nsigned by the President on September 13, 1994, an anticrime measure, \nthe now majority leader Senator Dole and I sponsored a sense-of-the-\nSenate regarding a study of out-of-wedlock births.\n  It said simply:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--(1) the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, in consultation with the National \n     Center for Health Statistics, should prepare an analysis of \n     the causes of the increase in out-of-wedlock births, and \n     determine whether there is any historical precedent for such \n     increase, as well as any equivalent among foreign nations, \n     and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should \n     report to Congress within 12 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act on the Secretary's analysis of the out-\n     of-wedlock problem and its causes, as well as possible \n     remedial measures that could be taken.\n\n  I can report, sir, that report is ready now and will be released \nshortly. It is a first effort, and I hope it will not be the last.\n  At length, the U.S. Government--the U.S. Congress, this Senate, the \nPresidency--is finally beginning to acknowledge this problem. I have \nmentioned before President Bush's commencement address at Notre Dame in \n1992, and President Clinton's 1994 State of the Union address, where \nthe subject is raised. But it cannot be too emphatically stated that we \nknow very little of the ideology, origins, the modes by which it takes \nplace.\n  I have here a draft of the new report by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. You can see, Mr. President, and I hope the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services might be listening, ``The sense of the Senate \nasks for a study of out-of-wedlock births.''\n  The report does, indeed, say ``out of wedlock.'' But when it gets \ninto the text, it refers to ``nonmarital,'' thus defining down the \nproblem; from the term ``illegitimacy'' to ``out of wedlock'' to \n``nonmarital,'' to--I do not know what the next euphemism will be.\n  But they do make the simple point that changes in behavior, some of \nthese changes in reproductive biology, have led to an extraordinary \nnumber of out-of-wedlock births. In 1992, about 1,250,000--1\\1/4\\ \nmillion illegitimate births. About 1 in 10 unmarried women age 15 to 44 \nbecome pregnant each year--about 1 in 10.\n  I have just offered to the Senate a datum which should shock anyone. \nOne in ten unmarried women become pregnant each year. The vast majority \nof \n\n[[Page S 13511]]\nthese pregnancies are unintended and, in 1991, nearly half ended in \ninduced abortion--obviously a condition we should not ever desire nor \nshould we allow to continue if we can change it.\n  But again, I have to say that there does not now exist any \nunderstanding of how we might do this. I welcome the onset of inquiry. \nThis is not beyond the reach of social science, anthropology, biology. \nBut it is only just beginning to be recognized in our country as in \nother countries. The Economist reports the neighborhoods in Britain are \nnot unlike those in, say Washington, DC, and in Paris. It is a new \nsocial condition, a new social issue.\n  But earlier I cited James Q. Wilson, in a splendid essay, a lecture \nwhich he gave, the Walter Wriston Lecture, at the Manhattan Institute \nin New York City, November 17, 1994, entitled, ``From Welfare Reform To \nCharacter Development.'' I think that is what the Senator from North \nCarolina is talking about, from welfare reform to character \ndevelopment. And he should be. He is to be congratulated for doing it.\n  But Wilson says, about the subject--how do you break the cycle of \ndependency?\n\n       Nobody knows how to do this on a large scale. The debate \n     that has begun about welfare reform is in large measure based \n     on untested assumptions, ideological posturing, and perverse \n     priorities. We are told by some that worker training and job \n     placement will reduce the welfare rolls, but we know that \n     worker training and job placement have so far had at best \n     very modest effects on welfare rolls.\n\n  I say that standing here with a button from the JOBS program in \nRiverside, CA, that says, ``Life Works If You Work.'' But we know the \neffects of these programs are modest.\n  Wilson goes on:\n\n       And few advocates of worker training tell us what happens \n     to children of mothers who are induced or compelled to work \n     other than to assure us that somebody will supply day care. \n     We are told by others that a mandatory work requirement, \n     whether or not it leads to more mothers working, will end the \n     cycle of dependency. We don't know that it will.\n\n  That is James Q. Wilson. ``We don't know that.'' I continue:\n\n       Moreover, it is fathers whose behavior we most want to \n     change, and nobody has explained how cutting off welfare to \n     mothers will make biological fathers act like real fathers. \n     We are told that ending AFDC will reduce illegitimacy, but we \n     don't know that; * * *\n\n  I repeat James Q. Wilson, ``We are told that ending AFDC will reduce \nillegitimacy but we don't know that.''\n\n       * * * it is, at best, an informed guess. Some people \n     produced illegitimate children in large numbers long before \n     welfare existed and others in similar circumstances now \n     produce none even though welfare has become quite generous.\n\n  I plead to the Senate, first, do no harm.\n  Catholic Charities addressed this plea to us earlier this day, asking \nthat there not be a family cap.\n  The first principle in welfare reform must be do no harm, the ancient \nadage of Hippocrates in his essay ``Epidemics.'' It is not the \nHippocratic oath, and we are dealing with an epidemic here. We must \nheed that ancient Greek: First, do no harm.\n  I can say that there is one major research project in operation right \nnow--has been for more than 4 years--it involves very intensive \ncounseling and education offered to teens to prevent teen pregnancy.\n  I would prefer not to give the actual name of the operation because \nyou do not want to interfere with it by stating ahead of time what its \nfindings are, what is happening. But I can tell you that after 4 years \nthe control group, there is no difference in outcome between the \nexperimental group which was given the intensive counseling and \ntraining and the control group which received no such special services.\n  This still baffles us. It is still beyond our reach. Not beyond our \ngrasp. I will use that image. It is beyond our reach, not beyond our \ngrasp. We are trying. We are beginning to learn. But at this point, to \ndeny benefits to children who have no means of controlling the way they \ncome into the world or the circumstances in which they find themselves, \nwould be an act of--irresponsible policy? I hesitate to use that word. \nIt would be an act of--cruelty? I hesitate to use that word as well. \nNot intended; the unintended consequences of social policy are almost \ninvariably the larger and more important ones.\n  So I hope, with expression of great appreciation to the Senator who \nhas raised the subject, thanking him for raising it, I hope we will not \ntake this radical step into the unknown at just the moment when we are \nbeginning to engage the Nation's analytic and social capacities with \nthe issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by responding to our dear and \nlearned colleague from New York, who undoubtedly has spent more time \nand energy studying this problem than any other Member of the U.S. \nSenate. I would like to begin with his application of the Hippocratic \noath to welfare reform.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Hippocrates on ``Epidemics.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say this. I think we are preaching the oath too \nlate. We now have a system where 40 million Americans are receiving \nsome means-tested program broadly defined as welfare. We have a program \nthat does a great deal of harm and that, if left in place, in my \nopinion will do far greater harm than it has done.\n  In the mid-1960's, when the current approach to this problem really \ntook hold with the Great Society, we were looking at something less \nthan 10 percent of all babies born in America being born out of \nwedlock. Today, one out of every three babies born in America is born \nout of wedlock. So I think, quite frankly, that while the advice \n``first do no harm'' is good advice when you do not know what you are \ndoing, the point is we have in place a program that does a great deal \nof harm. And probably no part of that program is more destructive than \nthe part of the program that provides cash bonuses to people who have \nchildren on welfare or children who qualify for welfare.\n  Our dear colleague, Senator Domenici, in the closing remarks he made \nin debate on an earlier amendment, said if you believe that denying \npeople more and more money to have more and more children on welfare is \ngoing to reduce the birth rate of people on welfare, you believe in the \ntooth fairy.\n  Mr. President, let me say that no human behavior in the history of \nthis planet is better documented than the principle that if you pay \npeople to do something they are going to do it, and they are going to \ndo more of it than if you did not pay them. If we know anything about \nthe behavior of the human being, it is that human behavior is clearly \naffected by the environment in which the human operates, by the set of \nrewards and penalties that exist. And clearly, the rewards in the \ncurrent welfare system are all bad from the point of view of producing \nbehavior that we do not want. Let me just give you a few of them.\n  Any 16-year-old girl in our bigger cities can escape from her mother, \ncan get cash and voucher benefits equal to $14,000 of earnings a year, \ncan get housing subsidies, food stamps, and AFDC by doing one thing--by \ngetting pregnant.\n  Does anybody believe that giving that child $14,000 worth of free \nbenefits in return for getting pregnant is not creating behavior that \nwould not exist in the absence of that money? Does anybody really \nbelieve that, if we did not give people more and more money to have \nmore and more children on welfare, that people would be having the \nnumber of children that they are having? I do not believe it.\n  I was having a discussion with my mother the other day on this \nsubject, which I think is always good advice to someone who is engaged \nin public policy today. My mother's thesis on this subject was \nbasically that the problem with welfare is that people today, young \npeople, are not as proud as people were in her generation. I responded \nby trying to explain to my mother that I am not positive that is the \ncase. I think the world faced by young people today is very different \nthan the world my 82-year-old mother faced when she was growing up. I \ntried to explain to my mother that if we had the kind of welfare \nbenefits we have today when she had two little children and was working \nin a cotton mill that she would have taken welfare. My mother said, ``I \nwould not have taken it. I would starve to death before I would take \nit.''\n  I said, ``Well, mother. Everybody you would have known would have \nbeen taking it. There would have been no \n\n[[Page S 13512]]\nstigma in taking it. People would have made fun of you for not taking \nit.''\n  To which my mother responded, ``I would not take it, and if you ever \nsay I would take it, I will go on television and denounce it.''\n  My mother is tough. Maybe she would not have taken it. But the point \nis that no logical person can doubt that the availability of these cash \nincentives to have babies, to have babies out of wedlock, is not \nimpacting behavior. Am I claiming that it is the only incentive that is \nthere? Am I claiming that by eliminating these cash payments that we \nwould eliminate illegitimacy? No. But I do not think any rational \nperson can argue that we would not have less of it if we did stop \npaying people for acting irresponsible.\n  We had an earlier amendment that was adopted which killed the \nprovision in this bill that I thought was very important. We had spent \nmonths working out a compromise that said we are not going to give \npeople on welfare more and more money to have more and more children. I \nthought it was an important provision. Senator Domenici earlier offered \nan amendment which killed that provision, and basically preserved the \nstatus quo, a status quo where now one-third of all the children born \nin the country are born out of wedlock.\n  I do not have any doubt based on that vote that Senator Faircloth's \namendment is not going to be adopted. But I believe that this is a very \nimportant amendment.\n  So my purpose in the remaining moments is twofold: First of all, I \nwant to say to our dear colleague from North Carolina that no Member of \nthe Senate has had a more profound impact on welfare reform than the \njunior Senator from North Carolina, Lauch Faircloth. Had it not been \nfor his persistence and his leadership there would be no pay for \nperformance provision in this bill and we would not have a mandatory \nwork requirement where people who refuse to work and are able-bodied \nlose their check. Had it not been for his persistent leadership, we \nwould still be, even under this bill, inviting people to come to \nAmerica with their hand out to go on welfare rather than their sleeves \nbeing rolled up to go to work.\n  Thanks to his leadership and his commitment, we did have a provision \nin the bill until today that denied additional cash payments to people \nwho have more and more children on welfare.\n  So I want to first thank him for his leadership. And I am convinced \nthat ultimately we are going to reform welfare, and I share with \nSenator Faircloth the commitment that I do not want to just perform \nwelfare because it costs $384 billion a year when you add up all the \nState and the Federal payments. I want to reform welfare because we are \nhurting the very people we are trying to help.\n  The great paradox is that people who really oppose welfare reform, as \nthe President does--and, despite all of his rhetoric, one thing is \nvery, very clear; that is, Bill Clinton wants to preserve welfare as we \nknow it. But one of the things that it is clear to me is that we have \nto redo this system because we are hurting the very people that we are \ntrying to help. Our programs have driven fathers out of the household. \nThey have made mothers dependent. They have denied people access to the \nAmerican dream. They have changed people's behavior. Our social safety \nnet has turned into a hammock. And it has changed the way people \nbehave. As they have turned more and more toward government to take \ncare of them, they have turned less and less to develop self-reliance. \nThey have turned less and less to their family and to their faith, and \nI have no doubt that their life has been diminished.\n  Those who are for dramatic reform in welfare stand on the high ground \nmorally in this debate. Those who defend the status quo, in my opinion, \nare defending a system that may serve some political interest. But it \ndoes not serve the interest of the people in this country who are poor \nbecause it is a system that keeps them poor, it is a system that \nexpands their numbers, it is a system that diminishes their lives, and \nit is a system that diminishes our great country. And I want to change \nit.\n  The final point I want to make is this is a modest amendment that the \nSenator from North Carolina has proposed. What his amendment says is \nsimply this: No Federal funds for cash welfare aid to unmarried mothers \nunder the age of 18 with a State opt-out provision. What does that \nmean?\n  What Senator Faircloth is saying is that, if his amendment is \nadopted, if a child 16 years old is having a baby or has had a baby, \nnothing in his amendment would prevent the State from giving her \nassistance through her own mother, nothing in this amendment would \nprohibit giving her assistance under adult supervision, and nothing in \nthis amendment would prevent giving her food or shelter or clothing. \nBut what the amendment would not do is to create a cash incentive for \npeople to have babies on welfare.\n  That is what the amendment does. In addition, if a State does not \nwant to abide by the Faircloth amendment, and it wants to provide cash, \nthe State legislature must pass a bill and the Governor of the State \nmust sign it taking themselves out of the program.\n  A lot of people oppose this because they know there are a lot of \nStates where politicians might want to get out of the program but \npeople do not want to vote to get out of the program.\n  So this preserves State option. It simply requires that affirmative \naction by the State to be exempt.\n  I want to repeat in closing that I am alarmed about a country, our \ncountry, where one out of every three babies in America is born out of \nwedlock. No great civilization has ever risen that was not built on \nstrong families. No great civilization has ever survived the \ndestruction of its families, and if fear we are not going to be the \nfirst. So I fully understand that this is an area where you could study \nit endlessly. And I generally agree with the Hippocratic principle: \nFirst, do not harm. But the point is we have already done harm. We have \nput in place a program that unless we change it is ultimately going to \nkill our Nation, and I wish to undo it. Given the harm that is being \ndone by the current welfare system, it is time to venture some change.\n  Finally, I totally and absolutely reject the thesis that there is no \ndemonstration that people do more of something if you give them money \nto do it. All of recorded history makes it very clear that if you pay \nsomebody to do something, they are going to do more of it than if you \ndo not pay them.\n  I just remind my colleagues that the first welfare reform measure in \nAmerica was in Jamestown, and what happened is that Capt. John Smith \nhad seen the colony break down as they had adopted a system, basically \na socialistic system where people were given the fruits of society's \nlabor based on an allocation rather than based on their effort. As far \nas I am aware, the first welfare reform principle in the history of \nAmerica was when Capt. John Smith said those who do not work shall not \neat.\n  I believe those kinds of reforms have an effect, and the incredible \npoint that seems to be missed by so many is that these kinds of reforms \nare humane reforms. People cannot be happy when they are kept \ndependent. There is something wrong in a free society when people are \nnot providing their own way. The only real happiness that comes, the \nonly real fulfillment that comes is from individual achievement. And if \nwe want to unleash the energy and the ability which is hidden in so \nmany millions of Americans who are trapped on this welfare system and \nunleash that talent and ability to serve them and to serve the country, \nwe have got to reform this welfare system, and I feel very strongly \nthat this is a very important amendment.\n  A concluding point. I am very disappointed about the adoption of the \nDomenici amendment. It undoes a delicate bill that we had put together. \nI want to say to my colleagues, assuming that we do not mandate some \nnew benefit which would be totally unacceptable and induce me to vote \nagainst this bill, I plan to vote for this bill on final passage. I \nintend to vote to take it to conference with the House.\n  However, when we come back to the Senate with a bill, I am not going \nto vote for a welfare reform bill that does not deal with illegitimacy. \nWe cannot deal with the welfare problem we face, we cannot change this \ndestructive system unless we deal with illegitimacy. And so I am \ncommitted to the principle that when this bill comes back from \nconference, we have provisions which end cash incentives to people to \nhave \n\n[[Page S 13513]]\nmore and more children on welfare. I think that is essential.\n  I wish to congratulate our colleague from North Carolina for his \nleadership on this amendment and on this bill. I am very proud to \nsupport it. I do not have any doubt about the fact that we are probably \ngoing to get about 25 votes, but I believe this is the right thing to \ndo. And I am also confident that this century will not end before the \nFaircloth amendment will be the law of the land. I have no doubt about \nthe fact that while Congress is perfectly content to let a rotten \nwelfare system fester, the American people are not content. They are \ngoing to continue to demand that we make these changes. They are going \nto give us a Congress and a President who are committed to them, and \nwhen they do we are going to make these changes and some of us will \nremember Senator Faircloth's leadership. Hopefully he will be here \nproviding it when the day comes that this amendment will be successful, \nand I am confident that it will.\n  I congratulate him on his leadership.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I actually came to the floor to introduce an amendment \nthat I will get to later on that I think will be important to \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that in situations \nwhere you have violence within a home we give States the room to give \nsingle parents, usually women, an exemption from some of the \nrequirements if that is the only alternative to make sure that they are \nsafe. We do not want to force women back into very dangerous homes.\n  Mr. President, I was listening to my colleague from Texas, and I just \nhave to respond. Let me come back to some unpleasant facts which I \nthink are important because we ought to be making policy on as solid a \nbasis of information as possible.\n  First, actually, I kind of did my own survey in Minnesota, which, I \nsay to my colleagues, was really startling.\n  I try to go to a school about every 2\\1/2\\ weeks during the school \nyear, and I was in an inner-city high school, South High in \nMinneapolis. And actually a young woman about age 16 asked me--I guess \nshe heard about action in the House--she said to me, ``Are you in favor \nof denying welfare benefits to a young woman or girl under 18 years of \nage if she has a child?''\n  I said, ``Well, I will answer that question but first let me ask you \nand let me ask all of you who are here in this assembly''--there were \nabout 300 or 400 students. I did not editorialize. In fact, I tried to \nactually stack it in the other direction. I said that many \nRepresentatives in the House of Representatives have said, look, when a \nyoungster, a young woman knows that she can get on welfare and have \nwelfare assistance, this is what encourages out-of-wedlock births. And \npeople are very serious about dealing with this problem, as I think all \nof us are in this Chamber.\n  Then I said, ``How many of you would agree?'' No one.\n  Mr. President, we are talking all about these young people. Has \nanybody asked them about what the causes are?\n  The question is, why do children have children? But has anybody asked \nany of these young people? I do not think this amendment is connected \nto that reality at all.\n  Then I went to a suburban high school in White Bear Lake, and I asked \nthe students the same question, expecting a very different response. \nThen I went to two other suburban communities. Then I went to about \nthree other schools in small towns. Cross my heart and hope to die on \nthe floor of the Senate, never more than about 5 percent of the student \nbodies, the assemblies, agreed. In fact, I found these students were \nkind of yelling at me, not out of anger but they were saying, ``Are you \npeople crazy? This is why you think young people are having children? \nThis is why you think there are births out of wedlock? These are our \nfriends. We know what goes on. Nobody is thinking about welfare. Nobody \nknows what it is. Nobody is thinking, `Well, if I get pregnant, then I \ndo not have to worry because I get AFDC and I can move out of my \nhome'.''\n  I heard all sorts of other reasons given that you might agree or \ndisagree with. But I want to tell you, talk about a disconnect. The \nvery people that we say we are concerned about, the very people in \nwhose name we pass this legislation, allegedly for whose benefit we \npass this legislation, say, ``Are you crazy? This has nothing to do \nwith this problem,'' which is a serious problem. That is my first \npoint.\n  Please remember that. Now, maybe other Senators in here in the \nChamber have gone out and met with lots of young people and have asked \nthem. And if you have received a very different response, please tell \nme. But I have made it my business to spend a lot of time with a lot of \nyoung people, inner city, suburban, small town, rural, and that is not \nwhat they say. It does not make any sense to them at all.\n  Maybe we ought to listen to them. Maybe we ought to ask them. Maybe \nwe ought to know more. That is my first point.\n  My second point--and I will do this briefly, I say to my colleague \nfrom New York--I am sorry the Senator from Texas has left the Chamber. \nI always feel uncomfortable, because you try to have debates--people \ngive a speech and then they are gone, and you feel like you are \nattacking someone behind their back. I am not making an attack. I put \nit more in the form of questions.\n  The problem with the analysis about this--about all of these mothers \nwho are having all of these children--and this is a terrible crisis in \nour country--is again--and I have heard the Senator from New York say \nthis over and over again, the typical family is one woman, two \nchildren. Seventy-five percent of the AFDC families have two children, \none parent. That is what it is. What are we doing perpetuating the same \nstereotype? In the last 20 years it has not gone up. We do not have \nlarger families.\n  As to this economic rationality argument that it is the money that \ncauses young people to have children, there is no evidence of that at \nall. As for this argument, I think--and I would have to defer to my \nlearned colleague from New York--but I think that if you look around \nthe country, State by State, I do not think there is any direct \ncorrelation between level of benefits and number of children. Is there? \nI mean in some States----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If the Senator would yield for a question. I think he \nwould find in the main the correlation is inverse. The lower the \nbenefit, the higher the ratio.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, that is what I thought my colleague would say.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Not absolute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Right. Let us just say--let us just understand this, \nthere is somewhat of an inverse relationship around the country between \nlevel of benefits and number of children per family. Those States which \nhave the lower level of benefits tend to have the families with the \nlarger number of children. Now, what does that do to the argument of my \ncolleague from Texas about how it is the dollars that cause all of \nthis? Well, he is not here. But you know, for the record, as we say.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as to this whole argument that--as I listened \nto my colleague conclude--that really what this debate is about is a \ndifference between those who take the moral high ground and push \nthrough these changes, versus those who, I guess the flip side of the \ncoin is those who do not take the moral high ground.\n  On that note, I just would like to suggest two final points. One, I \nsaid it once before on the floor, as I listen to some of my colleagues \ntalk about welfare, I get the impression that they are trying to make \nthe argument that welfare causes poverty, that food stamps cause people \nto not have enough money to purchase food. It is like they mix up the \nindependent and dependent variables. It is like arguing Social Security \ncauses people to get old.\n  People become eligible for welfare because they are poor. Or quite \noften you have two parents, and then there is a divorce and then the \nwoman is on her own with children, and she looks for some support for \nherself and her children. And 9 million or so of the 15 million are \nchildren.\n  So, frankly, this argument that this is the high moral ground--I \nthink when all is said and done, ultimately what it amounts to is \ntaking food out of the mouths of children. That is no high moral ground \nposition. \n\n[[Page S 13514]]\n\n  I am sorry my colleague from Texas is not here. Maybe he will come \nback. This whole business of somehow the welfare programs cause the \npoverty is ridiculous--we expanded food stamps and we did not expand \nhunger. I said this before on the floor of the Senate, but let us be \nclear about our history. Richard Nixon, a Republican, established \nFederal standards for food stamps because in the mid and late 1960's \nthere were the Hunger USA, CBS and Field Foundation studies and \npictures of children with distended bellies and malnutrition and hunger \nin America.\n  And so we expanded the Food Stamp Program. And now we do not have the \nscurvy and now we do not have the rickets and now we do not have all \nthe hunger and malnutrition. But somehow, according to my colleague \nfrom Texas, these programs have brought about all this damage to low-\nincome people, to poor people, mainly, I am sorry to say, women and \nchildren.\n  It is really quite a preposterous argument.\n  Mr. President, there is a difference between reform and reverse \nreform. And it is absolutely a great idea to enable a mother or a \nfather to be able to move from welfare to workfare, a good job, decent \nwage, affordable child care. That is not what this has been about. So I \nwould not want to let my colleague get away with his argument about a \nhigh moral ground. I see no high moral ground in punishing children. I \nsee no high moral ground in taking food out of the mouths of hungry \nchildren. I see no high moral ground in essentially targeting those \npeople who are the most vulnerable, with the least amount of political \nclout and making them the scapegoats.\n  And you know what, by way of conclusion? The sad thing is that I \nsometimes think that part of this agenda is to essentially say to those \npeople in our country who feel all the squeeze, middle-income people, \nworking people, if we just bash the welfare mothers and do this and do \nthat and make these cuts and those cuts, then the middle class will do \nwell economically. There is no connection whatsoever.\n  My colleague from Texas--and I promise my other colleagues on the \nfloor, this is my last point--keeps putting apples and oranges \ntogether. And I heard $170 billion or some figure like that being \nquoted as money spent on welfare. I do not know exactly what he is \ntalking about. Is he talking about aid to families with dependent \nchildren? That is what we are debating. I guess he added food stamps. \nHe probably had to add Medicaid to get there.\n  If he is talking about Medicaid, everybody understands that well over \n60 percent of Medicaid is not welfare mothers, it is elderly people. \nSome are our parents and grandparents who at the end of their lives, \nbecause of catastrophic expenses, lost all their resources and now, \nbecause they are poor, they are eligible for Medicaid and nursing \nhomes.\n  And God knows what else he lumped into this figure. So let us be \naccurate about this as we make these decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I listened to the argument for the \namendment's adoption by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I am sorry he is not here because I really did want to ask him \nquestions on the amendment.\n  And at the risk of being a policy nerd, which I think I would hate to \nbe called--I never want to have anyone use that term and apply it to \nme--however, I do have some questions in reading the amendment that I \ndo not know how I am going to get an answer to unless the author is \nhere or somebody who could respond to the author's intent.\n  As I read the amendment that was published in the Record by the \nSenator from North Carolina, it said, ``A State may not use any part of \nthe grant that they get to provide cash benefits for a child born out \nof wedlock to an individual who has not attained 18 years of age.''\n  There is an exception to that prohibition, which is my question, \n``except that prohibition shall not apply to vouchers which are \nprovided in lieu of cash benefits and which may be used only to pay for \nparticular goods and services specified by the State and suitable for \nthe care of the child that is involved.''\n  I happen to think vouchers may be a good idea. But I do not know \nwhether the author of the amendment is requiring vouchers or not \nrequiring vouchers.\n  The bigger point that I would want to make in this argument is that, \nNo. 1, the Senate has already spoken to this question. By a vote of, I \nthink, 66-34, we adopted the Domenici amendment which addressed this \nquestion. And the Domenici amendment essentially said that a State may \ndeny additional cash benefits for an additional child for a mother who \nhas that additional child regardless of her age, whether she is 18 \nyears old or 22 years old or what have you;\n that it would be a State decision to affirmatively deny additional \nassistance to that mother.\n\n  My whole concern about this attack on the question of illegitimacy is \nthat they are missing the target. They are, in fact, using a \nsledgehammer approach, but they are using a sledgehammer to hit the \nwrong person.\n  You do not solve the problem of illegitimacy by penalizing the child. \nThe child did not make a decision to be born. The child did not ask to \nbe a child that is born into this world. Therefore, when you penalize \nthe child, you are not penalizing the right person.\n  The reason why I think that the Work First proposal that we had put \ntogether made so much sense is that we said that the teen mother, or \nany mother who has a child, is going to have to be responsible for \nhaving that child. They are going to have to live in a family \nenvironment with their parent, if there is one, or they are going to \nhave to live in an adult-supervised home to get adult supervision in \ncarrying out their responsibilities. They are going to have to sign a \ncontract to go to work. They are going to have to start looking for a \njob. They are going to have to start receiving training.\n  I suggest that is a far better way to address the question of \nillegitimacy, which is a rampant problem in this country. My State has \nthe second-highest illegitimacy rate in the United States. Forty-some \npercent of the children born in Louisiana are illegitimate. That is \nsomething I think is a disaster already. It is not something waiting to \nhappen.\n  The question is, How do we solve that problem? Do we penalize the \nchild? Do we say to the mother, ``There are not going to be any more \nfunds to take care of the child''? Who does that hurt? It does not help \nthe mother, it does not educate the mother, it does not train the \nmother, it does not teach the mother responsibility. It gives her less \nmoney, and less money for what? The child that did not ask to be born.\n  There are potential mothers, women who are pregnant, when faced with \nthat decision take the easy way out and decide to have an abortion. \nThat is why all the Catholic Conferences, which feel so strongly about \nthis, have said very eloquently they oppose this type of sledgehammer \napproach, because many pregnant ladies faced with that choice will \ndecide to have an abortion because they know there will not be enough \nmoney to take care of the child when it is born.\n  That is a very cruel proposition to a young potential mother faced \nwith a pregnancy, many times in uncertain conditions, even if that \nchild is wanted in the first place.\n  Therefore, I am very strongly opposed to any efforts in trying to \nattack the question of illegitimacy that goes after the child. Go after \nthe mother. Find the father, because for every child that is born, \nthere is a father somewhere, in many cases shirking their \nresponsibility and running away from their responsibility.\n  So put provisions in the bill to go after the deadbeat father who is \nnot recognizing his responsibility. Say to the mother having that child \nthat ``You are going to have to do something different. You are going \nto have to live in an adult-supervised home,'' or ``You are going to \nhave to live in your parents' home,'' or ``You are going to have to \nsign a contract to go to work; you are going to have to enter into an \nagreement in order to get the training that you are going to be able to \nbe employable.'' \n\n[[Page S 13515]]\n\n  Do everything you possibly can to the mother and the father who are \nresponsible for the child, but heaven's sake, do not penalize the child \nwho did not ask to be born. That is why I am so very concerned that we \nsay there is going to be no more money for an additional child.\n  My goodness, we are hurting the child, not the mother, not the father \nwho we may not even know where he is. We should be exercising greater \nauthority to try and find the people responsible for the child and do \nthings to them, for them, with them that educate them to be better \nparents.\n  I come from a State, as I said, that has the second-highest \nillegitimacy rate in the United States of America. I am not proud of \nthat. I want to find a solution to that. I dare suggest this is not a \nsolution. It is a sledgehammer approach, and we are using the \nsledgehammer to beat the child, and that is not right.\n  I am glad the Senator from North Carolina is here, because I kind of \nlike the idea of vouchers, and we talked about vouchers. I guarantee \nyou, there are some teenage mothers who, when they do get extra cash \nassistance, may not use that cash assistance for the benefit of the \nchild. They may use that cash assistance in the most despicable way. \nThey may use it to buy things which are not necessary. They may use it \nto feed an alcohol abuse problem or a drug problem, because we are \ngiving them cash for that extra child. I recognize that, and I am a \nlittle concerned about that, but I want to make sure we protect the \nchild.\n  The Senator in part of his amendment says that as an exception for \nvouchers to those mothers who have an additional child, that the \nvouchers would not be prohibited.\n  The question is, I guess, there is no requirement that a voucher be \nissued. In other words, if that mother has an additional child, maybe \nthe extra amount that they would normally be entitled to would be $50. \nWould there be a requirement in the Senator's mind that the extra money \nbe then given to the mother in a voucher that could only be used to buy \nthings for that child? Or does his exception in the bill have nothing \nto do with the requirement of a voucher?\n  Given the choice--I want the Senator to respond if he can--but given \nthe choice of saying to a mother that there is going to be no \nadditional cash assistance and there is going to be no voucher either, \nI would prefer giving her the cash assistance in the hopes that because \nof the training and the requirements to live in an adult-supervised \nhome or live with her parent or live with greater supervision, the \nmoney will, in fact, be used for the child. But if there is a \nrequirement that they get a voucher to be used only for that child, I \nthink that has some potential possibilities here.\n  So if anybody can respond to my question, my specific question is, \ndoes the Senator's amendment require that an additional child would \nreceive at least a voucher in order to pay for the cost of having that \nadditional child or not? Will the Senator comment on that?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from \nLouisiana, yes, the State has the option to give a voucher, and it says \nvery clearly here that in lieu of cash benefits, which may be used only \nto pay for particular goods and services specified by the State, \nsuitable for the care of the child involved. So the State has the \noption to supply these vouchers for things that would be used \nespecially for the needs of the child, not cutting those off.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator for that response. That is one of the \nquestions I was trying to have answered. The problem I have is, under \nthe Senator's amendment, a State--I certainly hope no State would ever \ndo it--but under this amendment, it certainly could be possible, the \nState could say to that mother--more importantly, in my mind, to that \nchild--that we are not going to give any additional assistance for your \nbenefits, for your needs, nor are we going to give any vouchers for \nyour needs to survive.\n  I think that is something we, as officials who are responsible for \nraising the money for welfare reform, asking taxpaying citizens \nthroughout this country to pay their taxes to try and solve this \nproblem, that we have a responsibility to see that those funds are used \nproperly and appropriately.\n  One thing that I think is proper, appropriate and necessary is that \nwe guarantee that the child is taken care of. I am concerned, in fact, \nI think now very clearly that under the Senator's amendment, that that \nis not guaranteed. The needs of the child will not be guaranteed either \nby a cash payment, which is very clear would be prohibited, or by the \nguarantee of a voucher for that child. I find that to be unacceptable.\n  I want to do--and I will say it again--everything we can to ensure \nthat the parent who had that child is made to be responsible, is made \nto find a job, enter job training, sign a contract to go to work, live \nin an adult-supervised home, live with a parent, find the father \nsomewhere, no matter where he may be or what he may be doing, and say, \n``You have a responsibility, and that is to the child.''\n  It is unacceptable to me to say that we, as Federal officials, are \ngoing to use tax dollars to try and reform this system and yet not \nguarantee that the child will be taken care of. That is a major defect.\n  The Domenici amendment scares me in the sense that it clearly says \nthat a State may deny any additional cash assistance to the child if a \nState so chooses to do so. I think that is less onerous than the \namendment of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  So I hope that this amendment will be rejected.\n  I think that is a proper course.\n                    Amendment No. 2592, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a number of unanimous-consent requests that I \nthink would clear up the proceedings. First, I am going to ask \nunanimous consent that we return to the consideration of the Boxer \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Second, I ask that the Senate proceed to my modified \namendment, which I cleared with the majority leader and Members on the \nother side, which is already at the desk.\n  I ask that my amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2592), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 302, line 4, strike ``and''.\n       On page 302, line 5, strike the end period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 302, between lines 5 and 6, insert:\n       (3) payments for foster care and adoption assistance under \n     part E of title IV of the Social Security Act for a child who \n     would, in the absence of this section, be eligible to have \n     such payments made on the child's behalf under such part, but \n     only if the foster or adoptive parent or parents of such \n     child are not noncitizens described in subsection (a).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that I may speak for not to exceed 3 minutes on my \namendment and that, after that, that will conclude all debate and that \na vote on the Boxer amendment would occur immediately following a vote \non Senator Faircloth's amendment without any intervening action or \ndebate between the two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been a long time coming, this \namendment, because we have had to work together on both sides of the \naisle to make sure that everyone was comfortable with the amendment.\n I want to explain that modified amendment.\n\n  My colleagues, in the Dole bill there is a restriction on benefits to \nnew legal immigrants for the first 5 years they are in this country. In \nother words, they are completely legal, but the Dole bill says they can \nget no Federal means-tested benefits.\n  However, there are exemptions from these restrictions in the Dole \nbill on certain benefits, such as emergency medical care and \nimmunizations.\n  The one exemption that is not in the Dole bill is an exemption for \nfoster care and adoption assistance programs. What that really means, \nin plain English, Mr. President, is that if a legal immigrant child, a \nchild who is here completely legally, is abused or neglected, and the \ncourt says that child must be protected, unless we do this fix that I \nhave in this amendment, that child would not be eligible for the title \nIV-E foster care or adoption assistance program.\n  What we did on both sides of the aisle is work with the language to \nensure \n\n[[Page S 13516]]\nthat those children would be treated exactly like citizen children if \nthey are in a situation where they are abused or neglected in that 5-\nyear period.\n  It is important to note that Federal funding goes to the adopting \nfamilies and the foster families under rules that govern that program \nand certification requirements that are set by the State.\n  But the fact is, if we do not pass the Boxer amendment, then kids who \nare brutalized in families may well continue to be brutalized because \nthere is really not enough funds to help them get adopted or go into \nfoster homes, or the burden could fall entirely on the State or the \nlocality.\n  So I am very pleased that Senators from the other side worked with me \non this, that their staffs worked with me on it most diligently, and \nthat we have reached an agreement. I am sure that none of us would want \nto abandon a child who was brutalized because we made an oversight.\n  Mr. President, I am finished with my remarks. I hope we will pass \nthis amendment with a strong bipartisan vote. I want to thank Senator \nMoynihan of New York for helping me with this amendment and, again, the \nSenators on the other side, Senator Nickles, and Senator Santorum, who \nhelped me work out the details of this amendment.\n  I yield the time back and look forward to a very positive vote on \nthis amendment immediately following the vote on the Faircloth \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, under our order of doing business here--\nwe just finished a Democratic amendment; the Boxer amendment--it would \nnow be our desire to go to the amendment by the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2586\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to \namendment No. 2586.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. A point \nof order. The amendment of the Senator from Maine seeks to strike the \nproposal in two separate places, and, as a result, I believe it is out \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has yet to be called up. The \npoint of order would not lie until the amendment is called up.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2586. In section 102(c) of the amendment, insert \n     ``so long as the programs are implemented consistent with the \n     Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution'' \n     after ``subsection (a)(2).''\n       In section 102(d)(2) of the amendment, strike subparagraph \n     (B), and redesignate subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (B).\n\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, as was just read by the clerk, there are \ntwo portions to this amendment.\n  The first part of the amendment would provide that religious \norganizations may participate in our welfare program, which we want \nthem to do, so long as they comply with the establishment clause of the \nConstitution. We want to encourage churches and other religious \norganizations to become actively involved in our welfare process. We \nwant them to do so, however, consistent with the first amendment.\n  That amendment requires the Government to navigate a very narrow \nchannel when it provides funding to religious organizations. On the one \nhand, we have the free exercise clause, which prohibits a government \nfrom being overtly hostile to religious institutions or organizations. \nThen on the other hand we have the establishment clause, which limits \nthe extent to which the Government can actually sponsor religious \nactivities.\n  The intersection of these two separate constitutional commands, I \nthink, is implicated by section 102 of the welfare reform bill, which \nallows the States to contract with religious organizations to provide \nwelfare services. This provision protects religious organizations from \nreligious-based discrimination. And I think the authors \n\n[[Page S 13517]]\nought to be commended. We, as I said before, want to encourage \nreligious organizations to participate in welfare programs.\n  But, in my judgment, the bill in its current form does too little to \nrestrain religious organizations from using Federal funds to promote a \nreligious message. My amendment would, I believe, remedy this defect. \nIt would ensure that States have the flexibility to implement welfare \nprograms in a manner consistent with the religion clauses of the first \namendment so we neither prohibit nor promote. And that is the balance \nthat has to be struck.\n  The first part of this amendment simply says that we want to \nencourage the States to contract with religious institutions or \norganizations to provide welfare services, but we want to do so \nconsistent with the establishment clause. Now, I think there would be \nvery little debate, indeed any division, with respect to this \nparticular language.\n  The second part of the amendment--and Mr. President, I will ask for a \ndivision of the amendment before the point of order is raised. I ask my \namendment be divided into two parts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to have the amendment \ndivided. It is divided.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the second part of the amendment is \nintended to make it easier for the States to comply with its \nconstitutional duties. The bill currently prohibits the States from \nrequiring religious organizations to establish separate corporate \nentities to administer welfare programs. My amendment would strike the \nFederal mandate.\n  Mr. President, under the bill as drafted, there is a prohibition \nunder part 102(d)(2). It says that neither the Federal Government nor a \nState shall require a religious organization (A) to alter its internal \ngovernment--we certainly do not want that--or (B) to form a separate \nnonprofit corporation to receive and administer the assistance funded \nunder a program described in this subsection solely on the basis that \nit is a religious organization.\n  Essentially what is done by the bill language is to impose a Federal \nmandate upon the States saying neither the Federal Government nor any \nState can, in fact, require a religious organization to form a separate \nnonprofit corporation in order to receive funds under this act.\n  Now, Mr. President, over the years the Supreme Court has had to pass \nupon a variety of cases and they must be examined on an individual \nbasis. In some circumstances, the courts have ruled that the religious \norganization administering Federal funds is so --the words they use \nare--``permeated with a sectarian influence'' that their receipt of \nGovernment funding violates the first amendment.\n  What I want to do is to encourage religious organizations to become \ninvolved in our welfare system. But if we leave the language in the \nbill, it is going to actually have the reverse effect. It is going to \ndiscourage churches from getting contracts to help in our welfare \nsystem because the State is going to be precluded from asking the \nreligious organizations to set up a separate, nonprofit corporation to \nreceive the money and administer the programs outside an atmosphere \nthat is permeated with religious overtones.\n  If the bill stands as currently written, it is going to have just the \nopposite effect its authors desire. States are not going to want to \nwalk into a lawsuit by the ACLU or any other group that will challenge \nthe program as being violative of the first amendment. So the whole \npurpose in our trying to encourage religious organizations to \nparticipate in welfare programs is going to be defeated. The threat of \na lawsuit will discourage States from including religious organizations \nin their welfare programs.\n  So the purpose that I have in mind is to strike part (B), which would \nprohibit the Federal Government or the State from requiring a religious \norganization to set up a separate nonprofit corporation.\n  It may not be necessary for a religious organization to set up a \nseparate entity in each and every occasion. The State might decide that \nthis particular religious organization is structured in such a way that \nit is not permeated with sectarian overtones, as such. A State may \ndecide ``we do not have to require a nonprofit corporation here.'' But \nthe bill says, under no circumstances can the Federal Government or any \nState require that one be set up.\n  So I suggest to my colleagues that we are, in fact, engaged in a \nself-defeating process. We are going to encourage churches and other \nreligious organizations to become involved in the welfare system, but \nwe are going to use language which will, in fact, serve as a \ndisincentive for States to contract with them.\n  Mr. President, I hope, following the debate, that we will have an \nopportunity to vote seriatim; first on part 1, on which I think there \nshould be no disagreement, and then on part 2 of the amendment, which \nwould strike the Federal mandate that prohibits any State from choosing \nto require a religious organization in receipt of federal funds to form \na separate nonprofit corporation.\n  I think that it is in the best interest of those who want to \nencourage religious institutions and organizations to become involved \nto agree to the amendment. Obviously, there is some disagreement on \nthat issue.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Under the proposal of the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, if in our State we were nervous about the constitutionality of \ndealing with the church directly without this religious corporation, \nthen under the Senator's amendment, the State could ensure itself it \nwas on safe ground by requiring that there be such a corporation, and \nthen when the State dealt with it, they would know that they were \nabsolutely safe from lawsuits and all the problems that possibly could \narise.\n  Mr. COHEN. The Senator is correct. What my amendment would do would \nbe to allow the State to decide, in looking at a particular \norganization--they look at the circumstances, they look at the \nenvironment, they look at the entire structure--to say, ``We are \nsatisfied that there is no need to set up a separate nonprofit \ncorporation to administer these funds and, therefore, we are not making \nthat requirement for this particular organization.''\n  On the other hand, they may see an organization is so structured that \nit is, in fact, permeated with sectarianism, as such, and the language \nof the Supreme Court rulings require that a separate nonprofit \ncorporation be established before the organization can receive federal \nfunds.\n  If we do not strike this particular section, it seems to me what the \nState is going to do is to protect itself, to not deal with that \nparticular organization and, therefore, we will not achieve the very \ngoal we are trying to do: to get more churches and religious \ninstitutions involved in our welfare system.\n  I suggest to my colleague that if we leave that language as it is \ncurrently written, it will be very self-defeating and the State will be \nreluctant to engage in contracting out with religious organizations.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Just one more question of the Senator. It seems to me \nwhat the Senator is proposing is giving the States flexibility; the \nState does not have to require it but could.\n  Mr. COHEN. It could.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So, therefore, if the whole goal of this bill, often \nreiterated, is greater flexibility to the States, that this is what the \nSenator's amendment does. And if the State does not choose to require a \nnonprofit corporation, then that is the State's business.\n  Mr. COHEN. The Senator is entirely correct. Let me quote briefly from \nthe case Bowen versus Kendrick, decided in 1988. We have Chief Justice \nRehnquist, and Justices Kennedy, Scalia, White and O'Connor in a 5 to 4 \ndecision. The language is:\n\n       We have always been careful to ensure that direct \n     Government aid to religiously affiliated institutions does \n     not have the primary effect of advancing religion. One way in \n     which direct Government aid might have that effect is if aid \n     flows to institutions that are ``pervasively sectarian.''\n       We have invalidated an aid program on the grounds that \n     there was a ``substantial'' risk that the aid to these \n     religious institutions would, knowingly or unknowingly, \n     result in religious indoctrination.\n\n  The Court also noted that whether an organization has ``explicit \ncorporate ties to a particular religious faith and \n\n[[Page S 13518]]\nby-laws or policies that prohibit any deviation from religious \ndoctrine'' is a ``factor relevant to the determination of whether an \ninstitution is `pervasively sectarian.' ''\n  So the Court is saying that it is going to look at the circumstances \nindividually and make a determination. If you bar a State from \nrequiring a separate corporate entity to be formed, what you are doing \nis sending forth a very chilling message: ``If you undertake to \ncontract out with a church or religious organization under these \ncircumstances, you are going to invite a constitutional challenge.'' \nTherefore, I would imagine the Governor of a State would say, ``Let's \njust not contract out with this particular religious organization. \nWe'll avoid the problem. We don't need any more lawsuits. We don't need \nto be in the Supreme Court.''\n  I say to my friend, the best way we ensure to get the churches and \nreligious organizations into our welfare system is to strike the \nlanguage that would mandate that no State could ever require, under any \ncircumstances, the formation of a separate nonprofit corporation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I was interested in that Supreme Court case the Senator \nquoted. Was that Judge Scalia who joined in that opinion?\n  Mr. COHEN. Judge Scalia did join in the opinion. It was written by \nChief Justice Rehnquist and joined by Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia, \nJustice White and Justice O'Connor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do not think Justice Scalia is looked upon as a \ndangerous liberal on that Court.\n  Mr. COHEN. If I could add one other factor. We have Rosenberger \nversus University of Virginia, a case decided just last spring. Justice \nO'Connor, who cast the fifth and deciding vote, wrote a separate \nconcurrence. Here is some straightforward language from her opinion:\n\n       There exists an axiom in the history and precedent of the \n     Establishment Clause, public funds may not be used to endorse \n     a religious message.\n\n  That is what the Court is looking for, whether public funds are being \nused to endorse a religious message. If a State finds that a religious \norganization is not structured in such a fashion, that it is not, in \nfact, promoting religion either directly or indirectly, then there is \nnot a problem. But if a State is persuaded that an organization is so \npermeated with a sectarian influence, then it is going to require that \na separate corporation handle the funds. It seems to me that we ought \nto give the States that flexibility, and if you do not give them that \nflexibility, it means they are not going to contract out with religious \norganizations.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I could well see the situation where in our State, for \nexample, the attorney general might advise the Governor, ``Don't get \ninto these kind of contracts.''\n  As it exists now, you have no option but to deal with the church \nbecause the bill, as I understand it is written, forbids these \nnonprofit corporations from being set up.\n  Mr. COHEN. It prohibits either the Federal Government or the State \nfrom requiring a religious organization to form a separate nonprofit \ncorporation to receive and administer the funds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So you could get a situation where the attorney general \nadvises the Governor, ``Don't make that kind of a deal because we are \ngoing to end up in court, so just forget it.''\n  Mr. COHEN. That is right.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator's point is a good one. If we are trying to \nencourage the churches to come into this, use their facilities which \nthey have available for day care and other forms of assistance, I think \nthe Senator's amendment makes a lot of sense.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am sorry. I wanted to speak. The Senator was on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I ask if the Senator from Maine will \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. COHEN. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I heard the Senator from Rhode Island ask him if a \nState were allowed to require the formation of a separate corporate \nentity, that would guarantee the State immunity from suit based on \ngrounds of the infraction of the first amendment. Is that the Senator's \nposition?\n  Mr. COHEN. I think what the Senator from Rhode Island was saying is, \nif the State, in looking at the situation, comes to the conclusion that \nrequiring a separate nonprofit corporation will insulate the State \nagainst a lawsuit for violating the first amendment, that the State \nwould be willing to contract with the religious organization to provide \nwelfare services. My amendment gives the State flexibility to make that \njudgment rather than issuing a mandate. I know that the Senator from \nMissouri is concerned, and I appreciate his concern.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I want to know if the position of the Senator from \nMaine is that by virtue of requiring the formation of one or another, \nthat you have a determination about whether or not something violates \nthe first amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. No. The answer to that directly is no.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So the Senator from Maine does not allege that this \nprovision would provide any guarantee. I thought I misunderstood. I \nthought I heard the Senator from Maine tell the Senator from Rhode \nIsland that such a guarantee would be in effect.\n  Mr. COHEN. If I said that, I misspoke, because there is no guarantee \nunder any of these cases. You can always end up in court. I think what \nthe Senator from Rhode Island was saying is that the likelihood of a \nchallenge on the basis of the Establishment Clause is less likely by \nvirtue of setting up such a corporation.\n  You minimize the challenge by creating a separate corporate entity \nthat is not going to be so heavily influenced or permeated with \nsectarianism that the court is going to prohibit it from receiving \ngovernment funding. But each case is decided on an individual basis. As \nwe have discussed, it is not the language of the bill, but it is the \nstructure of the organization, that is scrutinized on an individual \nbasis to determine whether or not that organization is permeated with \nreligious overtones.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Who makes that decision?\n  Mr. COHEN. Ultimately, only the court.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So it is up to the court to decide----\n  Mr. COHEN. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Whether an organization is so permeated with sectarian \npurpose as to be ineligible to participate in a governmental purpose.\n  Mr. COHEN. That is right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is the position of the Senator from Maine that that \nwas decided in Bowen versus Kendrick, and a long line of cases?\n  Mr. COHEN. Exactly right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I rise in fervent support of the \nproposal by the Senator from Maine. It seems to me to anticipate \ndifficulties which can be readily resolved if they are in fact \nanticipated. It is clear that the Senate understood what it was doing \nand indeed provided additional language to resolve issues that might \narise.\n  I do not want, in any way, to complicate matters, but I would like to \nstate that it is a matter of record--or so I believe--that the \nestablishment clause has come into play in areas such as the ones we \nare dealing with only quite recently--only in the 20th century. I \nbelieve it was not until the 20th century that the Court held that \npublic aid to religious schools was unconstitutional. Indeed, I think \nit may only be in the second half of the 20th century.\n  I note for the first--the longest--century of the Constitution, it \nwas assumed otherwise. President Grant, contemplating running for a \nthird term, addressed a meeting or a gathering--or an encampment of the \nArmy, I think they would have said, of the Tennessee, which was held \nout in Iowa, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would \nprohibit aid to Catholic schools. It would not have said Catholic per \nse.\n  Mr. COHEN. I would have to check with Senator Thurmond to verify \nthat.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, Senator Thurmond would know. But it was assumed \nthat it was constitutional. He thought it would be an issue to make it \nunconstitutional. It took another 80 years for the Court to find that \nit was in there all along. I think you can read that clause. It says \nsimply: ``Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of \nreligion.'' \n\n[[Page S 13519]]\n\n  The Church of England is an established church. There were \nestablished churches in most of the colonies. I may be mistaken and \nprobably am. I think several colonies had several established churches. \nThat means public moneys go to the maintenance of the clergy and of the \nhouses of worship. It was never, in any way, thought that you could not \nhave parochial schools receive public moneys. They did in New York, \nuntil the 1920's when, under an informal arrangement whereby State-\nowned lands in the western part of the State--and I suspect Maine has \nthe same arrangement--were sold for different purposes and used. It was \na decentralized situation, and I regret to say--meaning no discredit \nand hoping not, in any way, to offend anybody--the Baptists were found \nto be padding their payrolls. So reform had to take place. Albany took \nover the disbursement of these funds. They were called public schools.\n  The issue arose as to what Bible would be used, and, of course, the \nmajority wanted a King James Bible and the Catholics wanted a Bible of \ntheir own, and so the Catholic schools commenced their independent \nexistence to this day. But the term ``public school,'' or ``PS'' in the \nway of usage in Manhattan, comes from that point.\n  I just hope these comments--I cannot expect them to carry great \nweight across the lawn to our former neighbors in the Court, but it is \na fact that the establishment clause contemplated a form of Government-\nsupported religious institutions. That was normal in most of the world \nthen and had nothing to do with day care centers, or halfway houses, or \norphanages, or schools the way it may today.\n  So I think the Senator has a powerful point, a useful measure, and I \nthank him for being patient with my not necessarily precisely accurate \nrecollection.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I rise in support of the Dole \namendment and in opposition to the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Maine. The Senator from Maine suggests that States should make \ndeterminations about whether there should be another hurdle over which \nnongovernmental, private institutions, religious in character, have to \ncrawl in order to be participants in helping solve this major challenge \nto our society and culture. In doing so, it would place a hurdle in \ntheir path that is placed in the path of no other organization, in \nterms of their eligibility to help solve this problem.\n  Strangely enough, this hurdle is placed in the path of some of the \ninstitutions that have the very best record at helping solve the \nproblem. It is suggested that placement of this hurdle in the path is \nnecessary to protect States and localities from lawsuits. But the truth \nof the matter is that nothing can protect anyone from a lawsuit \nrelating to the constitutionality or lack of constitutionality of a \nstatute or a public program, other than a constitutional amendment, \nwhich is explicit in its authorization. But still you run the risk of \nlitigation.\n  It would be interesting, or perhaps maybe easier to understand this \nif what we were asking for here was unprecedented or had not been \nalready enacted in other parts of the law. But I hold in my hand a \nreport to the Congress for fiscal year 1994 of the Refugee Resettlement \nProgram, which provides four grants directly to religious organizations \nfor dispensing cash benefits. I could read a list of many, many such \norganizations that are involved in doing it.\n  As a matter of fact, many of those who are in this Senate today voted \nin favor of this program in 1980 when the Refugee Resettlement Program \nwas enacted and asked that there be no special safeguard against the \nability of religious, nongovernmental, not-for-profit organizations to \nassist with refugees. We would not want to end up with the anomalous \nsituation of requiring churches to go over special barriers when \nproviding services to welfare recipients in the United States, while \nnot requiring them to go over the same barriers when helping refugees \nand others.\n  Similarly, the Adolescent Family Life Act, which was tested in the \ncase of Bowen versus Kendrick, provides funds to public and private \ncounseling agencies that counsel teenagers on matters of premarital \nsexual relations and pregnancy.\n  The act expressly provided that religious not-for-profit \norganizations were to be considered as eligible. In that case the Court \nheld that the act did not on its face violate the establishment clause.\n  As a matter of fact, the Dole bill as it is currently constituted \nhere and is before the Senate, has special protections in it--\nprotections against proselytization, protections for individuals so if \nthey are offended by having to go to a religious organization to \nreceive a benefit, that the benefit can be provided in another setting \nrather than in the setting of the religious organization.\n  It also provides protections for the churches so that the churches \ncan know they do not lose their ability to hire of like faith, and be \nassociated with employees whose belief and character is consistent with \nthe values for which the institution stands.\n  What we have here is an amendment which seeks to carve out a special \ncategory for welfare reform which does not exist in other parts of the \nlaws.\n  The report to the Congress of the refugee resettlement program \nprovides a list of dozens of organizations which receive help including \nchurches, help that they pass on to the refugees without this kind of \nproblem. There has not been a great problem in any respect, as a matter \nof fact, with the alleged unconstitutionality.\n  So we have a situation where we have those institutions in our \nculture and society with the very best track record of solving the \nproblems of the welfare puzzle. We will say to them, you have to go to \nthe added expense, you have to form a separate organization, you will \nhave to lose some of the protections you have as a church, your ability \nto hire people that have values consistent with yours, that have a \nbelief structure that is consistent with yours, you will have to \nforfeit all that in order to have this opportunity to participate in \nsolving this problem which you have probably been working pretty \naggressively to solve on your own. We would be well served as a Nation \nif these institutions would help us in the solution of this problem.\n  I think that is the challenge which is before the Senate. The \nquestion is whether or not we will continue to throw barriers in the \npath of the organizations which can help us substantially in solving \nthis problem.\n  Now, we have tried the singular Washington one-size-fits-all remedy \nfor a long time in welfare. We have seen what happens. We have watched \nthe roles of those in poverty swell. We have watched the percentage of \nchildren in poverty in our country grow.\n  So when it comes time to try and extend ourselves to find a real \nsolution to this problem and to borrow some of the solutions that the \nrefugee resettlement program has used and to borrow some of the \nsolutions to the problem that have been found in other recent \nlegislation like the Adolescent Family Life Act, all of a sudden we \nhear the old bugaboos about needing to have special requirements for \nthe religious organizations. Requirements that will make them second-\nclass citizens, that will force them to go through the burden of \nsetting up separate organizations.\n  Those who proposed the amendment and support it indicate there will \nbe a tremendous fear on the part of agencies who might otherwise \ncontract with the separate organizations.\n  Nothing in this bill would stop a religious organization from setting \nup a separate organization. Nothing would prohibit it. Nothing would \nchange its option.\n  The only real mandate that we have in the Dole bill is that churches \nwould be placed on a level playing field with other non-governmental \ninstitutions, that we would stop tossing barriers and prejudicial \nconditions in the paths of the religious institutions that wanted to \nhelp.\n  I need to try and make it as clear as I possibly can that I cannot \nendow the churches with rights to do things that they do not have a \nright to do under the Constitution, and neither can this body. I would \nnot want to.\n  I believe that the States should not support the church, that the \nchurch should be separate from the State. But I believe that when \norganizations including religious organizations have the track record \nof helping move people from welfare to work, from indolence to \nindustry, from a situation \n\n[[Page S 13520]]\nwhere they are kept in poverty to a situation where they have \nindependence, I think for us to place undue burdens in their pathway is \nunfair, and not only is it unfair but it is inappropriate.\n  Why we should single out the community of faith in the United States \nof America and say that for that community there are special \nrequirements that do not inure to other individuals in other parts of \nour culture and say they are second-class citizens and they are \nineligible, is beyond me.\n  The courts have not said so. Previous enactments of the Senate have \nnot said so, whether you are talking about the refugee resettlement \nprogram or whether you are talking about the Adolescent Family Life \nAct.\n  In previous efforts to deal with problems like this, the Congress in \nthe Stewart P. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act sought to provide \nemergency shelter grant programs that would allow those programs to go \nto religious nonprofit organizations.\n  What we really ask for is that there be a level playing field here, \nnot for the benefit of the organizations but for the benefit of a \ncountry that desperately needs help in breaking the cycle of \ndependence, breaking the cycle of poverty, and helping people move out \nof that welfare setting into a setting of work and industry.\n  I think it is inappropriate to place between those organizations and \nthe opportunity to participate barriers which will slow their ability \nrather than grow their ability to be a part of the solution.\n  I think we need to emulate programs that can be found in virtually \nevery city in America, programs which now are totally distinct and \nseparate. Obviously, many of them fear involvement with governmental \nentities. We need to invite them to the table, not to proselytize, but \nto say we are interested in having their help.\n  The Dole bill guarantees that no one is to be proselytized. It \nguarantees that no one can be forced to confess or otherwise subscribe \nto a faith to get a benefit. It says that no money can be used for \npurposes of propagating the faith. It says churches, however, do not \nhave to become sterile institutions that are nameless and faithless. \nThe Salvation Army would not have to take the word ``salvation'' out of \nits title in order to participate in the program. It would not have to \nhire people whose beliefs and whose value structure are a threat to the \ncharacter and the doctrine of the Salvation Army itself.\n  I believe that the bill as it stands is an invitation for help. It is \nan invitation which does not threaten the religious liberties of \nindividuals. It does not prohibit churches or other nongovernmental \nreligious organizations that are nonprofit from setting up separate \norganizations. But it simply would not allow the Government to impose \nupon them a requirement which is imposed upon no other organization, no \nother set of institutions in this country.\n  It does not label religious organizations who come to the table as \nparticipants for reconciliation and resolution of the welfare problem \nas second-class citizens, but it does say there are limits to what they \ncan do.\n  It requires that they keep an accounting of the funds they receive \nfrom the Government. It requires that they follow and observe rules of \nhow the funding must be spent. But it protects them from an invasive \nGovernment which might otherwise improperly seek to influence their \nbelief structure or the way in which they conduct worship or engage in \ntheir activities.\n  The Dole bill on this matter is a balanced bill. To require or to \npromote the requiring of an additional hurdle over which these \nreligious organizations would have to go when that is not required for \nanyone else would be manifestly unfair, and in my judgment it would be \ncounterproductive.\n  I want to indicate that I do not have any objection to the first \namendment proposed by the Senator from Maine to add to the bill the \nlanguage that we will operate in a way that is consistent with the \nestablishment clause of the Constitution of the United States. That is \nfine with me. When I took my oath, in every job that I have had for \nquite some time, I have sworn to uphold the Constitution, and I think \nthat is part and parcel of what we do here. And I have no objection to \nthat. I would be happy to agree to that. Since this item has been \nseparated, we might avoid a vote on that.\n  But on the second item, I urge my colleagues not to place in the path \nof well-meaning religious, nonprofit organizations the requirement that \nthere be the opportunity for States to have them go over major hurdles \nand expenses and forfeit opportunities to protect the organization from \nimproper intrusion by Government by accepting this amendment. So I \noppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I rise to support the statements made by \nthe Senator from Missouri with some reluctance, because I understand \nthe Senator from Maine is essentially attempting to accomplish the same \nend as the Senator from Missouri, coming at it from different sides of \nthe equation.\n  He spoke earlier about the extraordinary importance and effectiveness \nof the role of religious organizations and faith-based organizations in \ndealing with questions of welfare, poverty alleviation, poverty \nprevention and some of the social dislocations that exist in our \ncountry. Clearly, an examination, or even a cursory analysis of the \neffectiveness of those programs vis-a-vis Government programs, shows an \nextraordinary gap between the two. The religious organizations' \nprograms have elements of care, elements of lower cost, elements of \neffectiveness that Government programs simply have not been able to \nmatch. So I think all of us recognize that and want to encourage their \nrole in dealing with some of these seemingly intractable social \nproblems.\n  I, like the Senator from Missouri, certainly have no problem with the \nfirst half of the amendment of the Senator from Maine regarding the \nestablishment clause. I think that is proper.\n  But, as to the provision which removes the prohibition against States \nrequiring the establishment of separate, nonsectarian operations by \nreligious organizations, I think clearly--while the intent of the \nSenator from Maine is not to have unwanted State discrimination against \nthose institutions, that very likely could be the result. The practical \neffect of all of that is, I believe, going to discourage, if not \neliminate, most of the organizations from participating in these \nprograms.\n  It is the ability to bring some semblance of their sectarian nature \nto addressing the problem that results in the effectiveness of dealing \nwith the problem. To remove that and subject them to what may be a \ndiscriminatory--at least a test of absolute separation from the very \nbasis underlying their program, I think defeats the program.\n  For that reason I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the \nSenator from Missouri and oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, let me offer a few more comments. I do \nnot know that any other Members are coming to the floor to debate this \nissue or whether we should move to a vote relatively soon. I have not \nhad any requests for further debate on this side.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, if I may, I do not see any Senators \nseeking recognition, nor have I been told of any.\n  We have no requests for speakers on this side.\n  Mr. COHEN. Let me, then, just conclude if I could. Then perhaps my \ncolleague might have some other comments to offer.\n  We are seeking essentially the same goal. That is, namely, to involve \nour religious organizations in helping out in the distribution of funds \nin our welfare program. My concern has been that the first amendment \nmay very well be violated if, in fact, we have religious \norganizations--using the words, once again, of the Supreme Court--that \nare so permeated with sectarianism that the Court would find that \nproviding them with government funding violates the Establishment \nClause.\n  I by no means have suggested that churches or any other religious \norganizations are second-class citizens. Quite to the contrary, they \nare first-class citizens and they do first-class work. They are great \nhumanitarians and we need them desperately in the entire effort in our \nwelfare system.\n  Second, they are well-meaning people. We do not want to punish well-\n\n[[Page S 13521]]\n  meaning people. I come back to the Supreme Court's language in \nRosenberger versus University of Virginia:\n\n       There exists an axiom in the history and precedent of the \n     Establishment Clause, public funds may not be used to endorse \n     a religious message.\n\n  So the question then becomes, would the atmosphere in that particular \nreligious organization be so permeated with sectarianism that it seeks \nto promote and endorse a religious message which would then be subject \nto attack by a lawsuit? Let me just suggest some of the arguments that \ncould be raised if this language remains in the bill.\n  First of all, under the bill, religious organizations are permitted \nto discriminate when hiring persons to provide welfare services with \nFederal funds. Right now we allow religious organizations to \ndiscriminate on the basis of religious affiliation when they hire \npeople. We accept that. We may have a Catholic Church that wishes to \nhire only those of the Catholic faith. We may have a Jewish synagogue \nthat wants only those of the Jewish faith; or Mormons, that want \nemployees of the Mormon faith.\n  Here, however, we go one step further and permit religious \norganizations to discriminate when employing persons to provide welfare \nservices with Federal funds. Is that going to be a dispositive factor? \nI do not know. It may be one factor a court would take into account. We \nhave no way of gauging that now.\n  Under the bill, however, we go one step further and say we prohibit \nStates from requiring religious organizations from establishing \nseparate nonprofit public entities, another factor that would be argued \nin all likelihood.\n  We require that organizations providing welfare services be allowed \nto have religious symbols on their walls and that they not be required \nto remove religious icons, scriptures, or symbols.\n  Whether the totality of that atmosphere would amount to a permeation \nof a sectarian message, I do not know. Only the court will decide.\n  What seems clear to me, however, is that a State might very well \ndecide not to contract out with such a religious organization in order \nto avoid a lawsuit. No State can avoid a lawsuit--I think the Senator \nfrom Missouri is quite correct-- we can do nothing short of a \nconstitutional amendment, and even then it will be subject to a lawsuit \nfor interpretation. But a State might very well be reluctant to draw in \nreligious organizations under these circumstances.\n  So I suggest to my colleagues, one way to avoid the very thing that \nwe are professing we want most--that is, to draw more people in, to \ndraw the organizations in--is to push them away by virtue of the \nlanguage contained in the Dole bill. So we have the same objective.\n  I simply point out, in the Bowen versus Kendrick, which both of us \nhave cited, the Court noted that even when the statute appears to be \nneutral on its face:\n\n       We have always been careful to ensure that direct \n     government aid to religiously affiliated institutions does \n     not have a primary effect of advancing religion. One way in \n     which direct government aid might have that effect is if the \n     aid flows to institutions that are ``pervasively sectarian.''\n\n  I might point out that the court, in ruling in this case, upheld the \nfacial validity of the statute. The Justices then sent it back down to \nthe trial court to see if in application the funds were distributed in \nan unconstitutional manner.\n  So we had the very situation which we are likely to see replicated \ntime and time again in the future. One way to avoid that situation is \nto strike section 102(d)(2)(B).\n  So I want to commend my colleague from Missouri. I think that he and \nI have the same objective. He believes that by leaving that language \nin, it will certainly not discriminate against the institutions, and \nthat is correct. My view is it will, in fact, cause the State to \ndiscriminate in an adverse way, and that is not to contract with those \nvarious institutions which we want to be part of the system.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we prepare to vote, may I just hold \nthe Senate for just a moment to read a passage from the message to the \nlegislature by Gov. William H. Seward in New York State in 1840. \nGovernor Seward went on to a distinguished career here in Washington, \nand we have Alaska, among other things, to thank him for.\n  He said:\n\n       The children of foreigners, found in great numbers in our \n     populous cities and towns, and in the vicinity of our public \n     works, are too often deprived of the advantages of our system \n     of public education, in consequence of prejudices arising \n     from difference of language or religion. It ought never to be \n     forgotten that the public welfare is as deeply concerned in \n     their education as in that of our own children. I do not \n     hesitate, therefore, to recommend the establishment of \n     schools in which they may be instructed by teachers speaking \n     the same language with themselves and professing the same \n     faith.\n\n  Governor Seward was from Auburn, NY, far away from those foreigners, \nand, as a matter of fact, if you would like to know the fact, those \nwere Irish. And they did not speak English. They spoke Gaelic. But the \nidea that they had a right to public school was very clear to people, \nand very close to the Constitution.\n  Just for purposes of innocent merriment and the possible instruction \nof the Honorable Justices of the Court, I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent that, and a few succeeding paragraphs, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       This situation prompted the Whig Governor William H. Seward \n     to make this proposal to the legislature in his message for \n     1840:\n       ``The children of foreigners, found in great numbers in our \n     populous cities and towns, and in the vicinity of our public \n     works, are too often deprived of the advantages of our system \n     of public education, in consequence of prejudices arising \n     from difference of language or religion. It ought never to be \n     forgotten that the public welfare is as deeply concerned in \n     their education as in that of our own children. I do not \n     hesitate, therefore, to recommend the establishment of \n     schools in which they may be instructed by teachers speaking \n     the same language with themselves and professing the same \n     faith.''\n       Instead of waiting for the rural, upstate legislature to \n     ponder and act upon this proposal of an upstate Whig \n     governor, the Catholics in the city immediately began \n     clamoring for a share of public education funds.\\44\\ The \n     Common Council declined on grounds that this would be \n     unconstitutional. In October, 1840, the Bishop himself \n     appeared before the Council, even offering to place the \n     parochial schools under the supervision of the Public School \n     Society in return for public aid. When he was turned down, \n     tempers began to rise.\n       In April, 1841, Seward's Secretary of State John C. \n     Spencer, ex officio superintendent of public schools, \n     submitted a report on the issue to the State Senate. This was \n     a state paper of the first quality, drafted by an authority \n     on the laws of New York State (who was also de Tocqueville's \n     American editor). Spencer began by assuming the essential \n     justice of the Catholic request for aid to their schools:\n       ``It can scarcely be necessary to say that the founders of \n     these schools, and those who wish to establish others, have \n     absolute rights to the benefits of a common burthen; and that \n     any system which deprives them of their just share in the \n     application of a common and public fund, must be justified, \n     if at all, by a necessity which demands the sacrifice of \n     individual rights, for the accomplishment of a social benefit \n     of paramount importance. It is presumed no such necessity can \n     be urged in the present instance.''\n       To those who feared use of public funds for sectarian \n     purposes, Spencer replied that all instruction is in some \n     ways sectarian: ``No books can be found, no reading lessons \n     can be selected, which do not contain more or less of some \n     principles of religious faith, either directly avowed, or \n     indirectly assumed.'' The activities of the Public School \n     Society were no exception to this rule: ``Even the moderate \n     degree of religious instruction which the Public School \n     Society imparts, must therefore be sectarian; that is, it \n     must favor one set of opinions in opposition to another, or \n     others; and it is believed that this always will be the \n     result, in any course of education that the wit of man can \n     devise.'' As for avoiding sectarianism by abolishing \n     religious instruction altogether, ``On the contrary, it would \n     be in itself sectarian; because it would be consonant to the \n     views of a peculiar class, and opposed to the opinions of \n     other classes.''\n       Spencer proposed to take advantage of the diversity of \n     opinion by a form of local option. He suggested that the \n     direction of the New York City school system be turned over \n     to a board of elected school commissioners which would \n     establish and maintain general standards, while leaving \n     religious matters to the trustees of the individual schools, \n     the assumption being that those sectarians who so wished \n     would proceed to establish their own schools.\n       ``A rivalry may, and probably will, be produced between \n     them, to increase the number of pupils. As an essential means \n     to such an object, there will be a constant effort to improve \n     the schools, in the mode and degree of instruction, and in \n     the qualification of the teachers. Thus, not only will the \n     number of \n\n[[Page S 13522]]\n     children brought into the schools be incalculably augmented, but the \n     competition anticipated will produce its usual effect of \n     proving the very best material to satisfy the public demand. \n     These advantages will more than compensate for any possible \n     evils that may be apprehended from having schools adapted to \n     the feelings and views of the different denominations.''\n       The legislature put off immediate action on Spencer's \n     report. But Catholics grew impatient. When neither party \n     endorsed the proposal in the political campaign that fall, \n     Bishop Hughes made the calamitous mistake--four days before \n     the election--of entering a slate of his own candidates for \n     the legislature. Protestants were horrified. James G. Bennett \n     in the New York Herald declared the Bishop was trying ``to \n     organize the Irish Catholics of New York as a district party, \n     that could be given to the Whigs or Locofocos at the wave of \n     his crozier.'' The Carroll Hall candidates, as they were \n     known, polled just enough votes to put an end to further \n     discussion of using public funds to help Catholics become \n     more active citizens.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, if I might for a moment say a few words \nto close to state my support for the Dole bill as it exists rather than \nas it has been proposed to be amended, I thank the Senator from Maine \nfor endorsing the concept of widening and broadening the groups of \nindividuals in the culture who will help us solve the welfare problem. \nBut to elevate the States to the place of a judicial entity which seeks \nto determine whether or not there has to be a separate structure in \nplace in order to avoid first amendment problems I think is a compound \nmisunderstanding.\n  First of all, it is a misunderstanding to think that the States could \nmake a difference. The truth of the matter is whether or not you \nviolate the first amendment cannot be determined by the State. The \nState can cause additional expense, or can place barriers in the \nroadway for religious institutions, but it cannot provide any kind of \nguarantee that there will not be a lawsuit.\n  Second, it is well settled law. I am talking about the modern law, \nand I thank the senior Senator from New York for his comments about the \nrelationship between our States and funding for social services, and \nother types of services. But it is well settled modern law that the \ntest of whether or not there is an infringement of the establishment \nclause is not a test of structure. The test is the test of activity, \nand a test of administration.\n  If you had a totally sectarian organization which was using \ngovernment funds to meet public purposes, it is clear that religious \ninstitutions, according to the case of Bowen versus Kendrick--that is \nthe 1988 case of the U.S. Supreme Court--religious institutions are not \ndisabled by the establishment clause from participating in publicly \nsponsored social welfare programs. You could have a totally secular \norganization, a private, even business, corporation endowed by funds \nfrom the Federal Government, and, if its activities were to somehow \nimpose religion using those funds, it would be an affront to the \nConstitution.\n  Recognizing that it was the activities that could potentially offend \nthe Constitution, and not the structure that could potentially offend \nthe Constitution, the Dole bill was carefully drawn so as to prohibit \noffensive activities and to allow the religious organizations to \nmaintain their structure. We do not want religious organizations to \nhave to change their character. We do not want them to have to belie \nwhat they are. We do not want them to have to participate in hiring \npractices and other difficult situations which are inconsistent with \ntheir belief structure. We want their help but we do not want them to \nuse public funds in achieving religious purposes.\n  So the Dole bill has clear language which goes to the heart of the \nrelevant facts of activity, not of structure, and it makes it clear \nthat, since structure is not really important, this barrier of expense \nand intimidation which would stop some from participating and coming to \nthe table to participate in a full range of these activities should not \nbe mandated or allowed to be required by the States.\n  It is with that in mind that we seek to enlarge the community of care \nin America, and we seek to enlarge it in a way which will bring in \nindividuals who can really make a difference.\n  I pointed out earlier that we had the refugee resettlement program \nwhich has specific authority to deal with religious organizations--and, \nas a matter of fact, has been operating that way--so that we have a \ntest. We already have organizations. As a matter of fact, I believe \nmost of the Members who are in this Chamber now who were in this \nChamber in 1980 voted for this program without these special \nprovisions.\n  It is interesting to me that in the closing days of the Bush \nadministration they made a proposal, as a part of their service to this \ncountry, which recommended exactly what we have asked be done; that is, \nthat we enlarge the group of individuals who are capable of assisting \nby inviting religious organizations, not to proselytize, not to promote \ntheir religion but to participate when their activities are \ncharacterized by the public purpose. And the Supreme Court of the U.S. \nhas explicitly indicated that it is not structure but it is, in fact, \npurpose, and it is, in fact, activity which determines.\n  I just add that the Bowen case in that matter indicated that when the \nactivities were specific and public purpose in nature--and they were \ndefined clearly enough so that there could be an assessment of those \nactivities and an evaluation of them by the State--that was the real \ntest which decided whether or not there was an improper intermixing of \nchurch and state that would be in violation of the first amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Indeed, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COHEN. The Senator has on at least two occasions indicated the \nDole legislation as currently written prohibits proselytizing. I have \nbeen looking at the language. I could not find it. Perhaps the Senator \ncould direct it to my attention, the specific prohibition.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I refer to line 7, section 103--no funds used for \nprograms established or modified under this act shall be expended for \nsectarian worship or instruction.\n  Mr. COHEN. The word proselytizing, I was looking for the word. I have \nnot found it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If I spoke to use proselytization, the word to my \nunderstanding does not actually appear--the provision just prohibits \nusing funds for purposes of sectarian worship or instruction. I do not \nthink that it would obviously allow proselytizing.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. It is with this in mind that I urge the defeat of the \nCohen amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, I believe we can dispose of part one of \nthe amendment simply by voice vote, and then ask for the yeas and nays \non the second part.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is quite agreeable, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2586, division I.\n  So division I of the amendment (No. 2586) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on part 2 of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Friday, September 8, \n1995 edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the managers of the bill will \naccept this amendment. I will just take a very few minutes to describe \nit.\n  Mr. President, this amendment clearly expresses the sense of the \nSenate that any legislation we enact--whatever the final outcome of the \nwelfare reform bill may be--should not eliminate or weaken the present \ncompetitive bidding requirements in any program using Federal funds to \npurchase infant formula.\n  This amendment does not impose any new requirements, but it says that \nwhatever the outcome on this legislation, whenever Federal dollars are \ninvolved in purchasing infant formula, competitive bidding should be \nrequired in the same manner that it is now.\n  The reason I am concerned is that the House of Representatives has \npassed legislation that would create a new block grant encompassing the \ncurrent WIC Program. But that bill does not require the States to use \ncompetitive bidding or equivalent cost containment, which is presently \nrequired for purchasing infant formula in the WIC Program.\n  WIC competitive bidding benefits two classes of people. It allows \nmore people to be helped by WIC with the limited amount of money \navailable. WIC still does not reach all eligible people, so savings \nallow more pregnant women, infants, and children to be served. And \ncompetitive bidding saves taxpayers' money because less spending is \nneeded to achieve the objectives of WIC.\n  I must say at the outset, Mr. President, for the record, I personally \ndo not favor converting WIC into a block grant or drastically changing \nit. WIC has been one of our most successful efforts to improve the \nnutrition and health of children.\n  Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefits and cost \neffectiveness of WIC. It saves money because it heads off a lot of \nproblems that could be very costly. That is my own personal view.\n  Whatever may happen with respect to the WIC program, I strongly \nbelieve that we in Congress have a responsibility to prevent outright \nwaste and squandering of Federal dollars. That is likely to result if \nwe abandon the competitive bidding requirement.\n  The case for competitive bidding is too clear to ignore. Rebates \nobtained through competitive bidding for infant formula have reduced \nthe cost of infant formula for WIC participants by approximately $4.1 \nbillion through the end of fiscal year 1994, allowing millions of \nadditional pregnant women, infants, and children to achieve better \nnutrition and health through the limited WIC funds available.\n  The Department of Agriculture has estimated that in fiscal year 1995, \nrebates obtained through competitive bidding for infant formula will \ntotal over $1 billion, which will enable WIC to serve approximately 1.6 \nmillion additional women, infants and children. For my State of Iowa, \nthe fiscal year 1995 rebate savings will be about $7.8 million, \nallowing an estimated 12,734 more people to be served without one \nadditional dime of cost to the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I worked very hard to include the provision in the \n1987 Commodity Distribution Reform Act that allowed States to keep a \nportion of the savings they achieved through competitive bidding.\n  Without that provision, they could not have used those savings to \nserve more people. The money would have come back to Washington, DC. \nThe chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Chairman Leahy and I, worked \nclosely together to get that legislation passed. In 1989, I introduced \nthe Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act, which included a \nrequirement to use competitive bidding or equally effective cost \ncontainment measures for purchasing WIC infant formula, and again \nworked closely with Chairman Leahy in gaining its enactment.\n  All of the studies and the experience we have had since that time \nshow that we have indeed saved a lot of money through competitive \nbidding, and we \n\n[[Page S 13524]]\nhave served a lot more people. It has been one of our most successful \nprograms, as I said.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, on February 28, 1995, there was an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal. The headline says ``Four Drug Firms \nCould Gain $1 Billion Under GOP Nutrition-Program Revision.'' What the \nheadline referred to was doing away with the competitive bidding \nrequirement in legislation before the House of Representatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article appear at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just to repeat, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution stating that whatever we do here we will continue to have \ncompetitive bidding in the purchase of infant formula using Federal \nfunds.\n  I thank the managers of the bill. I thank Senator Dole for his \nsupport and his willingness to accept this amendment.\n                                Exhibit\n\n           [From the Wall Street Journal, February 28, 1995]\n\n   Four Drug Firms Could Gain $1 Billion Under GOP Nutrition-Program \n                                Revision\n\n                           (By Hilary Stout)\n\n       Washington.--Four pharmaceutical companies stand to gain as \n     much as a billion dollars under a Republican bill that \n     overhauls federal nutrition programs for children and \n     pregnant women.\n       The companies sell infant formula to the Women, Infants and \n     Children (WIC) program, a federal initiative that provides \n     formula as well as milk, beans, rice and other nutritious \n     foods to poor children and to pregnant and breast-feeding \n     women. Since 1989 the companies have been required by law to \n     enter into a competitive bidding process in order to sell \n     formula to WIC, resulting in rebates to the government that \n     are expected to reach $1.1 billion this year.\n       A bill that cleared the House Economic and Educational \n     Opportunities Committee on a party-line vote last week would \n     turn the WIC program over to states in the form of a ``block \n     grant,'' and with it repeal the cost-containment competitive-\n     bidding measure. An amendment to restore it was defeated by \n     the committee. The legislation now moves to the House floor \n     for consideration.\n       The four companies, the only domestic makers of infant \n     formula--Ross Laboratories, a unit of Abbott Laboratories; \n     Mead Johnson, a unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; Wyeth-\n     Ayerst, a unit of American Home Products Corp.; and Carnation \n     Co., a U.S. subsidiary of the Swiss conglomerate Nestle SA--\n     fought the competitive-bidding measure fiercely when it came \n     before Congress in the late 1980s. Until then, they were \n     collecting retail prices for the infant formula they sold to \n     WIC.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the \n     Senate Agriculture Committee and the lawmaker who led the \n     effort to enact the cost-containment measures, threatened to \n     fillibuster the bill yesterday if it reaches the Senate. ``It \n     is really obscene,'' Sen. Leahy said. ``The most conservative \n     of people should, if being truthful, like the competitive \n     bidding. . . .  It's just rank hypocrisy.''\n       If the bill reaches the Senate floor, Sen. Leahy continued, \n     ``I've spent 20 years building bipartisan coalitions and \n     working on nutrition programs. If it's necessary to discuss \n     my whole 20 years' worth of experience in real time, I'll do \n     it.''\n       In 1993, the latest year for which figures are available, \n     the WIC program spent $1.46 billion in infant formula but \n     received $935 million in rebates. That cut the overall cost \n     of providing formula to $525 million, nearly a two-thirds \n     reduction. Moreover, the states, which administer the \n     program, were allowed to use the rebates to add more people \n     to the WIC program.\n       The action on WIC comes as a liberal-leaning research \n     group, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, released a \n     study questioning the continuing effectiveness of some of the \n     infant-formula rebates. The center's analysis found that in \n     the last year, despite the cost-containment requirements, the \n     cost of infant formula purchased through WIC has almost \n     doubled in many states.\n       Since last March, the study said, 17 state WIC programs \n     have signed rebate contracts with at least one of the major \n     formula manufacturers. Under those agreements, the average \n     net cost of a 13-ounce can of concentrated infant formula was \n     60 cents. compared with a 32-cent average price under rebate \n     contracts signed during the previous 15 months, the study \n     said.\n       The Federal Trade Commission has been investigating the \n     infant formula makers' rebate and pricing practices, and at \n     least one state, Florida, has filed suit against the \n     manufacturers.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2680) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2545\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will get a unanimous-consent agreement now \nthat it has been cleared on each side.\n  In the meantime, what is the status of amendment 2545 offered by the \nSenator from Iowa--the other amendment, numbered 2545?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be prepared to accept that amendment No. 2545 if we \nvitiate the yeas and nays and have no discussions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the leader will yield, that is very acceptable. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2545) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13481-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13524-S13539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Reserving the right to object, I ask the majority leader \nif we could add as the next amendment an amendment by Senator Dodd, \nwhich may or may not be offered? But he would like to be added to the \nlist. Obviously, it will be subject to our ongoing negotiation. But if \nwe could add Senator Dodd?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. To the list for tonight?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. To the list for tonight.\n  Mr. DOLE. I have no objection to that. That would follow disposition \nof the Nickles amendment, which is the last one on this list, if we do \nnot have some agreement by then. But I would not be able to enter into \na time agreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is right, and I do not know that Senator Dodd will \neven be interested in offering the amendment, but it was at his request \nthat we add his name. I think that would satisfy the needs on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority leader modify the request?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, I modify my request, if in fact the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, wishes to offer an amendment, he be \nrecognized following the disposition of the Nickles amendment No. 2556.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, my view is we are trying to reach an \nagreement on about four major issues. Hopefully, we will have that \ndetermined by the time we complete voting on these tomorrow. If, in \nfact, we can reach an agreement, I hope all the other amendments would \ngo away, at least nearly every other amendment go away. If we cannot \nreach agreement, then we would have a cloture vote sometime tomorrow \nafter consultation with the Democratic leader.\n  It is still my hope to dispose of this bill tomorrow night because we \nhave six appropriations bills to do. We would like to start \nappropriations bills on \n\n[[Page S 13525]]\nFriday and then complete action on the appropriations bills on the 30th \nof September. If we can do that, there may be an opportunity for us to \nhave a week's recess.\n  So I hope all of our colleagues would help us on the appropriations \nbills. To get to the appropriations bills, we have to finish welfare \nreform, and we are only going to have one cloture vote. If we do not \nget cloture, that is it. It will go in the reconciliation and all these \namendments that are pending will be pending forever, I guess.\n  In any event, there will be no more votes tonight and the votes will \nstart at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If those Members who are having \ndiscussions in the aisle could please retire to the cloakroom?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for gaining order in \nthe Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I will speak for a while and then I really would like \nto defer to my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray. Then I will \ncomplete my remarks.\n  Mr. President, could I have order in the Chamber, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Those Members who are still in the aisle, \nplease retire to the cloakroom so the Senator may be heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last year the Congress made a \ncommitment to fight the epidemic of violence against women and children \nwhen we passed the historic Violence Against Women Act. This commitment \nmust not be forgotten as we debate welfare reform. Yet, the bill that \nwe have before us does not contemplate even for 1 minute that many \nwomen are on welfare because they have escaped violence in their homes. \nSome of the studies that have been done show that as many as 60 percent \nof welfare mothers are women who were battered, women who have left a \nvery dangerous home.\n  The last thing we want to do is force those women back into those \nhomes. For many of these women, welfare is the only alternative, for \nsome support it is the only alternative, for some public financial \nsupport for themselves and their children is the only alternative to a \nvery dangerous home.\n  Domestic violence is one of the most serious issues our country \nfaces. I wish I did not have to say that on the floor of the Senate, \nbut it is the case. It knows no borders, neither race, gender, \ngeography nor economic status shields someone from domestic violence.\n  Every 15 seconds a woman is beaten by a husband or a boyfriend every \n15 seconds. Over 4,000 women are killed every year by their abuser. \nEvery 6 minutes a woman is forcibly raped. The majority of men who \nbatter women also batter their children. A survey conducted in 1992, \nMr. President, found that more than half of battered women stayed with \ntheir batterer because they did not feel they could support themselves \nor their children. We do not want to put women in a situation where \nthey have to stay in an unsafe home where their lives are in jeopardy, \nwhere their children's lives are in jeopardy because of a piece of \nlegislation we passed.\n  Mr. President, this amendment allows an exemption for women who come \nout of these kinds of homes who have had to deal with this kind of \nphysical violence, and it allows States to exempt people who have been \nbattered--it could be a man; usually it is a woman--or subjected to \nextreme cruelty from the strict new rules that we have within the \nwelfare system without being penalized for meeting the participation \nrate.\n  Mr. President, this amendment allows States to modify or to exempt \nwomen from some of the requirements in this bill. Monica Seles, the \ntennis player who was stabbed took 2 years before she could get back to \nplaying tennis. Just imagine what it would be like for a woman who had \nbeen beaten over and over and over and over again and finally left that \nhome with her children. How long does it take her to mend? Do we want \nto say she has to work or she is out? Two years and she is out? It may \ntake a longer period of time.\n  This amendment says we ought to establish at the national level some \noverall standards so that States will exempt from some of the \nprovisions of this piece of legislation women and children who come out \nof these circumstances.\n  Mr. President, the term ``battered'' or subjected to ``extreme \ncruelty'' includes physical acts, sexual abuse, neglect or deprivation \nof medical care, and extreme mental abuse. But we leave it up to the \nStates to define those terms. But what we are saying is this is an \nepidemic. We made a commitment last year. We do not want to force a \nwoman and her children because of their economic circumstances back \ninto a brutal situation, back into a home which is not a safe home, but \na very dangerous home. We have to provide some protection. That is the \nreason for this general guideline that we establish at the national \nlevel and then allow States to go forward. And it is extremely \nimportant that States be allowed to do so. Otherwise, they will be \npenalized for not reaching their employment goal.\n  Right now a State has no incentive to exempt a mother who is faced \nwith these kinds of conditions because that State is trying to meet \nthat work participation rate.\n  This amendment says States ought to be allowed that exemption or \nmodifying it. For example, maybe a mother can meet the 2-year \nrequirement. Maybe she cannot.\n  It is shocking, I say to my colleagues, because they go into a job \ntraining program they have trouble with their abuser. So maybe she \ncannot do that or maybe she can. Maybe the 5-year requirement does not \nwork. We are talking about women and children who have lived through, \nif they are lucky enough, to have lived through nightmare \ncircumstances.\n  So I certainly hope the Senate will have the compassion, and the \nSenate will have the commitment to women and children to allow this \nvery, very important amendment to pass with this very important \nexemption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, in offering this extremely important \namendment. And I commend him on his very eloquent statement and \nappreciate his work on this very difficult and very important issue of \nbattered individuals. He has committed a lot of time and energy to \nthat. I want him to know how much I appreciate that.\n  We all know that America's poor face many obstacles as they try to \nget back on their feet and become productive, contributing members of \nour society. However, the women who have been victims of abuse and the \nchildren, frankly, who have witnessed this abuse, or were abused \nvictims themselves, have even more barriers which impede their ability \nto move on and move up.\n  I would hope that this Senate steps back from the rhetoric of the \npast few days and the technical terms that we are using, and think for \na few minutes about some of the people that this welfare reform bill is \ngoing to very directly affect as we pass it, in particular battered \nwomen and children.\n  These abused women and children have lasting scars that will take \nmany years to heal, and they are often forced to live in fear that \ntheir abuser will find them and hurt them once again.\n  This amendment is important because we must recognize that women on \npublic assistance who were battered confront unique obstacles and \ncircumstances as they make the very difficult move from dependency to \nself-sufficiency. As we attempt to fix our troubled welfare system and \nhelp rebuild America's families, let us not make it harder for these \nwomen and their kids to get ahead and put there troubled past behind \nthem.\n  Domestic violence and the impact that it makes on those who suffer \nthis abuse is a very real and a very serious problem. In my State, a \nsurvey of \n\n[[Page S 13526]]\nwomen on public assistance found that over half reported being \nphysically abused by a spouse or a boyfriend.\n  Throughout this debate on welfare, I have come to the floor several \ntimes to talk about June, who is a welfare recipient in my State, and \nwho is my partner in the Walk-a-Mile Program. That is a program that \nbegan in the State of Washington. It has gone across the country. That \nmatches a welfare recipient with an elected legislator. We have talked \non the phone. We have shared experiences. I shared mine with her. She \nhas shared hers with me. So that we have gotten to know what it is like \nto live in each other's shoes. And I will tell you that hearing her \nstory has really enabled me to better understand the everyday \nchallenges of a young mother trying to make it on her own and to take \ncare of two young kids. It has been difficult for June to share some of \nher stories with me because she was in a very abusive relationship. Her \nchildren witnessed their mother being beaten and verbally abused. In \nfact, June told me her most vivid memory of that time was hearing her \nfrightened 3-year old daughter's pleading voice saying, ``Daddy, are \nyou going to kill my mommy? Please do not kill my mommy.''\n  That is what this woman came from. And I can tell you as a mother, \nand as a former preschool teacher, memories like that have an \neverlasting and dramatic effect on the lives of children who \nexperienced such pain and torment in addition to the emotional trauma \nthat confronts both the woman who suffered abuse and the children who \nare exposed to it. There are many practical problems which prevent \nthese women from succeeding that we have to consider as we look at this \nwelfare debate.\n  First, these women who are abused survivors often have problems \nholding a job.\n  Second, women who have lived with a batterer often lack skills \nbecause their abuser did not allow them to go to work or to attend \nschool.\n  And third, a woman who has left her abuser often faces the extreme \ndanger of being stalked. And she may not be able to leave her house to \ngo to job training classes or to work. And the same woman who has \nfinally decided that enough is enough may live in fear that her abuser \nwill come after her and to get their children and to take them away. Do \nwe think that this woman is going to be a productive worker? Do we \nthink she is going to leave her kids out of her sight? I can tell you \nthe answer is no. These are difficult problems that these women have to \novercome.\n  This amendment takes those factors into account and offers the \nflexibility States need to help women who have been abused to \nsuccessfully improve their lives and that of their children.\n  We cannot ignore these problems that these women will face, and we \nhave to make some exceptions for them. Believe me, and frankly believe \nJune, my Walk-a-Mile partner. It will be hard enough for these families \nto make it. But let us not make it impossible.\n  As Senator Wellstone has so eloquently stated, we do not want to \nforce these women back into the home of their abuser because welfare is \nnot available for them.\n  I urge my colleagues to send the women and children of our Nation the \nright message: We care about you. We respect you. We want you to \nsucceed.\n  Please cast your vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have much more to say, but I believe my colleague \nfrom North Carolina wants to speak now and I will wait and follow or \nrespond to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair.\n  I call up my amendment No. 2609, and I ask for its immediate--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thought my colleague was here to \ndebate my amendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am sorry. I had an amendment. I thought the Senator \nwas through.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BROWN). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  I apologize to my colleague from North Carolina. I thought he was \nhere to debate my amendment, and I did not want to keep him waiting.\n  Mr. President, let me just read a few examples that I think tell the \nstory. Linda Duane from Edison, NJ.\n  Linda is a 38-year-old mother of five. Her ex-husband was a police \nofficer. He was abusive toward her. In 1982, the abuse led her and her \nhusband to separate. ``At that time,'' she says, ``domestic violence \nlaws were not set up to protect women; they protected him.'' She was \nforced to move into her mother's home and she started to receive \nwelfare. She had married right out of high school and never worked \noutside her home. When her divorce came through she paid back all the \nwelfare payments.\n  For five years she was alone and on her own, but she did not get any \ncounseling for her previous abuse. She became involved in an even more \nabusive relationship. She later separated from him but he continued to \nstalk her. He came to her place of employment and she was subsequently \nsuspended from her job for a week. He hung himself the next week on her \nporch while her children were inside the house. She lost her job the \nnext day because she was told she needed to receive mental help before \nshe could return to work. She lost her home and ended up in a battered \nwomen's shelter and again began to receive benefits. She is currently \nin transitional housing where she is trying to put her life together. \nShe just finished some college classes and hopes to return to school \nthis fall.\n  Mr. President, another woman from St. Paul, MN, Fran Stark.\n  Fran, who I must say is quite a success story, is currently the \noffice manager for TRIO and tutor coordinator for Student Support \nServices at the University of Minnesota. She married the year after she \ngraduated from high school. But after 16 years of an abusive \nrelationship she divorced her husband. That left her with two children \nand very few job skills. She went on welfare. She enrolled her son in \nHead Start and became involved with parent training courses there. She \nhas since enrolled at the University of Minnesota and is almost done \nwith her course work to get her bachelor's degree.\n  Lisa Yost from Wilmington, DE.\n  Lisa is a single mother. She has been on welfare since her daughter \nwas born. The father of her child was unemployed and very abusive. \nAfter 3 years she could not take it any more. She had him arrested in \n1993 and went to a shelter. She went on welfare and started to take her \nlife back. She started school to get her GED. She testified that,\n\n       Without welfare I would not be able to maintain my \n     apartment or provide day care for my child. Food stamps help \n     feed my family and we relied on Medicare while I am attending \n     school. The abuse I suffered lowered my self-esteem which \n     kept me from achieving any goals for myself and my child. \n     Healing took time, counseling and a lot of effort from myself \n     . . . Without the financial assistance of AFDC I would not \n     have been able to get my life back on track.\n\n  Mr. President, what this amendment says one more time is let us not \nhave a one size fits all welfare system. Let us at least make some \ncommitment that there will be some compassion built into this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, all you have to do is spend some time \nwith families that have been through this violence.\n  Monica Seles took 2 years to go back to the tennis court because of \nwhat she had to deal with. Imagine what it would be like to be beaten \nover and over again. How long does it take to heal? What we are saying \nis that this piece of legislation does not take into account any of \nthese circumstances for women and their children.\n  What we are saying is that we set at the national level an exemption \nto the rules. Then we let States decide how to implement this and we \nmake sure that no State, loses sight of this kind of an epidemic that \nwe are faced with in this country and, no State is penalized for making \nsure that we do not take women who have been receiving some assistance \nand force them back into violent homes.\n  If this amendment does not pass, that is precisely what we are doing \nwith this piece of legislation.\n  Again--and my colleague from Washington did a very fine job of really \nstating the case--it just takes time. If you \n\n[[Page S 13527]]\ngo to visit shelters, many of the women and men that work in the \nshelters will tell you that over 60 percent of the women who try to \nfind shelters have to be turned away.\n  You are now on your own. You have been beaten. You suffer from the \nequivalent of post-traumatic stress syndrome. You are frightened. You \nare scared. Almost all of your confidence has been beaten out of you or \nyou feel like a failure.\n  And I again remind my colleagues, every 15 seconds a woman is beaten \nby a husband or a boyfriend. Over 4,000 women are killed every year by \ntheir abuser. Every 6 minutes a woman is forcibly raped and over 60 \npercent of welfare mothers come from these kinds of abusive situations.\n  We have to have some exemption. So my amendment specifically says,\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this bill, the \n     applicable administering authority of any specified provision \n     shall exempt from (or modify) the application of such \n     provision to any individual who was battered or subjected to \n     extreme cruelty if the physical, mental, or emotional well-\n     being of the individual would be endangered by the \n     application of such provision.\n\n  That is legalese. What we are saying is that a State can establish \nthe criteria of what is abuse or extreme cruelty. But States must not \nbe penalized when they make exceptions for the victims of domestic \nviolence. They do not have to count these victims in their calculation \nof participation rates.\n  Mr. President, there was a study of a training program in Chicago \nthat found that 58 percent of its participants were current victims of \ndomestic violence, and an additional 26 percent were past victims.\n  So what happens, to give an example, when a mother now tries to go \ninto a job training program to move into the work force, but the \nconfidentiality she needs to be safe from her husband is breached, or \nfor her boyfriend who is fiercely possessive and angry because she is \nnow in a job training program. And many women get beaten up because \nthey go into these job training programs.\n We are going to have to take some kind of an allowance. There has to \nbe some sort of an allowance for these kinds of special circumstances.\n\n  Mr. President, do we want to say after 5 years no more assistance and \nyou have got to go back into this kind of home regardless of the \ncircumstances? What happens if a woman cannot find a home? What happens \nif she cannot go into a job training program, no fault of her own? What \nhappens if her children who were also beaten or who saw their mother \nbeaten over and over and over again and are emotionally scarred and she \nneeds to spend more time at home with those children? What happens, Mr. \nPresident, if she has to leave the State to get away from her batterer \nbecause she is not safe in that State, which means she has to \nessentially uproot herself, go to another State, start her life all \nover again, which makes it much more difficult, we all know, to find a \nhome, to find a job, to get back on your own two feet?\n  Mr. President, if we were going to say that a young mother under 18 \nyears of age should not automatically assume that she can set up a \nseparate household and receive full support. She should stay with her \nfamily. Fine.\n  But what if she is in an abusive home? What if she herself has been \nbattered? Do we want to force her back into that home? Do we want to \nsay that is the only place she can be?\n  Mr. President, there are many other examples that I could give. But \nas we search for solutions that will help women and children escape \npoverty, we must understand the violence that exists in the lives of \nmany economically vulnerable women and their children. And this whole \ndebate on welfare reform that we have had is just one more glaring \nexample of the lack of awareness, I think on our part, unfortunately, \nand understanding of domestic violence. The whole community has to be \nthere to support these women and their children. Otherwise, they are \nnot going to have the opportunity to become safe, and then to become \nstrong and independent and healthy families. But the burden cannot just \nbe put on the mother.\n  It seems to me that this debate is the same old ``it's not my \nbusiness'' excuse. But it is our business. We must all be involved. \nDomestic violence is a root cause of violence in our communities, and \nwe must do everything we can to end the cycle of violence. And I will \ntell you right now, this will not be real welfare reform if it is one-\nsize-fits-all, if we do not at least set some sort of national \nstandard, giving States maximum flexibility to make sure that there is \nan exemption for women and children who come from such families, or at \nleast some modification.\n  I say to my colleagues, do not put women and children in a situation \nwhere they have no other choice but to go back into a home where their \nvery lives are at risk.\n  Unfortunately, that is not melodramatic. I know this. I know it from \nthe work that Sheila, my wife, and I do in Minnesota with so many women \nand children who have been victims of domestic violence. We just lost \nsight of this.\n  Last year we passed the Violence Against Women Act. In one short \nyear, has so much changed that we are no longer willing to look at \nthese special concerns and circumstances of the lives of these women \nand these children?\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with the protection of \nbattered individuals. Usually they are women and children; sometimes \nmen. This is an amendment that I think builds into this piece of \nlegislation an extremely important exemption. It is an amendment, if \npassed, which will be nationally significant because the U.S. Senate \nwill be saying that we understand the magnitude of the problem of \ndomestic violence, of family violence in our Nation, that we understand \nthat in this welfare reform bill there ought to be some sort of \nallowance set at the national level with States having maximum \nflexibility so that we do not lose sight of the fact that all too many \nof these welfare mothers having come from violent homes, having been \nbattered, they may not be able to adhere to all these requirements. And \nwe need to allow for that. We need to have either an exemption or some \nkind of modification, letting States administer it.\n  And, Mr. President, if we do not pass this, we are unwittingly going \nto put many women in a situation where they are going to have to return \nto that violent home, to that dangerous home, because they have no \nother alternative. We are cutting them off the welfare. And the welfare \nwas the only alternative they had to that abusive relationship. We \ncannot go backward in that way.\n  Mr. President, I do not see anybody here on the floor that seems \ninterested in debating me on this. For tonight, I will take that as a \nsign of unanimous support. But I leave the floor full of optimism that \nI will get good bipartisan support for this amendment.\n  I would yield the floor to my colleague from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2609\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2609 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 2609 now \nbecomes the pending question before the Senate.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have heard a number of my colleagues \nremark today that there is no evidence which connects welfare with \nillegitimacy. And I would say first that not even President Clinton \nagrees with this. President Clinton believes there is a link between \nwelfare and the collapse of the family.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list prepared by the Heritage Foundation of \n19 recent academic studies on the link between welfare benefits and \nout-of-wedlock births be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the studies were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Studies of Welfare and Illegitimacy\n\n       The following is a list of nineteen studies conducted since \n     1980 on the relationship of welfare to illegitimacy. Fourteen \n     of these studies found a relationship between higher welfare \n     benefits and increased illegitimacy.\n       1. Bernstam, Mikhail S., ``Malthus and Evolution of the \n     Welfare State: An Essay on the Second Invisible Hand, Parts I \n     and II'', working papers E-88-41, 42, Palo Alto, CA, Hoover \n     Institution, 1988\n       Research by Mikhail Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at \n     Stanford University shows that childbearing by young \n     unmarried \n\n[[Page S 13528]]\n\n     women may increase by 6 percent in response to a 10 percent \n     increase in monthly welfare benefits; among blacks the \n     increase may be as high as 10 percent.\n       2.

Anne, and O'Neill, June, ``Underclass Behaviors \n     in the United States: Measurement and Analysis of \n     Determinants'', Center for the Study of Business and \n     Government, Baruch College, February 1992\n       Dr. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding \n     constant a wide range of other variables such as income, \n     parental education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50 \n     percent increase in the monthly value of AFDC and Food Stamp \n     benefits led to a 43 percent increase in the number of out-\n     of-wedlock births.\n       3.

In general, an \n     increase in roughly $100 in the average monthly AFDC benefit \n     per recipient child was found to lead to a drop of over 15 \n     percent in births within wedlock among black women aged 20 to \n     24.\n       4.

Plotnick of the \n     University of Washington shows that an increase of roughly \n     $200 per month in welfare benefits per family causes the \n     teenage illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by 150 \n     percent.\n       6.

O'Neill, June, ``Report of Dr. June O'Neill'' (affidavit \n     in lawsuit concerning the New Jersey family cap policy.)\n       This study using data from a controlled scientific \n     experiment show that the New Jersey ``family cap'' limit on \n     AFDC benefit significantly reduced out-of-wedlock births \n     among mothers on AFDC. The cap was shown to reduce the \n     monthly value of aggregate welfare benefits for an AFDC \n     family by 4 percent and to result in a 19 to 29 percent \n     reduction in the number of illegitimate births to AFDC \n     recipients.\n       8.

Fourteen of these studies found the relationship \nbetween higher welfare benefits and increased illegitimacy. Five \nstudies do not. The most interesting of these is the study by Dr. June \nO'Neill, Director of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  This study shows that a 50-percent increase in the monthly value of \nAFDC and food stamp benefits leads to a 43 percent increase in the \nnumber of out-of-wedlock births.\n  A 50-percent increase in monthly benefits leads to a 43 percent \nincrease in out-of-wedlock births. My pending amendment modifies the \nprovision in the Dole bill which allows welfare funds to be used for \ncash aid to unmarried teenage mothers. The amendment is designed to \ndisrupt the pattern of out-of-wedlock childbearing that is passing from \none generation to the next.\n  My amendment seeks to stop giving cash aid that rewards \nmultigenerational welfare dependency. I believe the Federal Government \nshould never have been in the business of saying to a 16-year-old girl, \n``Have a child out of wedlock and we will mail you a check each \nmonth.''\n  Earlier I offered an amendment which would have prohibited Federal \nfunds to be used for cash aid to unmarried teenage mothers unless a \nState legislature specifically voted to use Federal funds in that \nmanner.\n  Under my previous amendment, Federal funds could be used for in-kind \nbenefits or vouchers and State funds could be used for cash. But \nFederal funds could not be used for cash to teenage mothers unless the \nlegislature of that State so voted to do so.\n  I think that is a fine amendment. But some people feel that even this \nis too great a restriction on State flexibility. So I present another \namendment which allows Federal cash aid to teenage mothers but only \nunder certain circumstances.\n  The amendment I am now offering is a modification of the provisions \nin the Dole bill on giving Federal cash aid to minor mothers.\n  Let us be clear about what the Dole bill currently does. The bill \nsays you can use Federal funds to give vouchers and in-kind benefits to \nan unmarried teenage mother, or you can use funds to put the mother in \na supervised group home. That is fine, and we all agree. But the Dole \nbill goes on to say, however, that you can use Federal funds to give \ncash benefits to unmarried teenage mothers if that teenage mother \nresides with her parent. If she resides with her parent, she can \nreceive Federal cash benefits.\n  Let us be very clear what type of household we are putting cash into. \nIn this household, there will be three people: First, the newborn \nchild; second, the unmarried teenage mother of that child; and third, \nthe mother of the teenager, the adult who is the grandmother of the \nnewborn child.\n  The problem with this scenario is that the adult woman, the mother of \nthe teenager and the grandmother of the new child, the woman upon whom \nwe are counting for adult supervision of the unmarried teenage mother, \nis very likely to have been or be an unmarried welfare mother herself. \nIt is very likely that this adult mother gave birth to the teenager out \nof wedlock \n\n[[Page S 13529]]\nsome 15 years ago and raised her, at least in part, on welfare. This is \nthe grandmother.\n  The young teenager, in giving birth out of wedlock, is simply \nrepeating the pattern and model which her mother gave her.\n  Let me provide the Senate and the public with a few statistics:\n  A girl who is raised in a single-parent home on welfare is five times \nmore likely to have a child out of wedlock herself than is a girl \nraised with two parents and receiving no welfare--a girl raised in a \nsingle-parent home on welfare is five times more likely than a girl \nraised in a two-parent family.\n  Roughly two-thirds of all unwed teenage mothers were raised in broken \nor single-parent homes--two-thirds of all unwed teenage mothers.\n  What we have here is a pattern of illegitimacy and a pattern of \nwelfare dependency which passed from one generation to the next. The \namendment I am now offering is intended to break up this lethal and \ngrowing pattern of multigenerational illegitimacy and multigenerational \nwelfare dependency.\n  The current amendment follows the same basic rule on teenage mothers \nas the Dole bill, which says you cannot use Federal funds to give cash \naid, a check in the mail, to a teenage mother unless that teenage \nmother resides with her parents or another adult relative.\n  My amendment maintains that same basic rule, but adds one limitation. \nThe limitation states that an unmarried teenage mother cannot receive \nFederal cash aid, a check in the mail, if the parent or adult relative \nthe teenager is living with herself had a child out of wedlock and has \nrecently received aid to families with dependent children. The whole \napproach here is to break the cycle of children born out of wedlock.\n  The teenage mother cannot get cash aid, cannot get a check in the \nmail if she is residing with a parent who herself has had a child out \nof wedlock and was a welfare mother. The teenager in these \ncircumstances could receive vouchers or federally funded in-kind aid, \nbut she could not get a federally funded check in the mail if she is \nliving with an adult who has had a child out of wedlock and then been a \nwelfare mother herself.\n  This restriction applies only to Federal funds. A State can use its \nmoney to send a check in the mail to anyone it wants. But what we are \ndoing is trying to break the cycle. American communities are being torn \napart by multigenerational illegitimacy and multigenerational welfare \ndependency. In some communities, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now \nreaching 80 percent. We need to disrupt this pattern of out-of-wedlock \nbirths from one generation to the next.\n  But instead of disrupting the pattern, the Dole bill reinforces it, \neven sanctifies it. It pretends the answer to teenage illegitimacy is \nto have the teenager reside with her mother who, in many cases, was the \nsource of her problem in the first place.\n  If you vote against this amendment, you are voting to give cash aid \nto multigenerational welfare households. If you vote against this \namendment, you are voting to subsidize and promote multigenerational \nillegitimacy. If you vote against this amendment, you are voting to \ncontinue the very policies that are destroying and ruining lives of \nyoung women and children and condoning and promoting multigenerational \ndependency, illegitimacy, not welfare reform. And what we are here for \nis to reform welfare.\n  No society has ever survived the collapse of the family within that \nsociety. No nation can survive the death and destruction of its \nfamilies. Families in America are on the brink of collapse. Let us not \npush the American family into its grave with this type of welfare \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am going to withhold for a moment. I \nsee my friend and colleague from North Dakota with whom I am \ncosponsoring the next amendment coming onto the floor. It is \nappropriate that he call up the amendment and begin the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2528\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut. I \ncall up the Conrad-Lieberman amendment No. 2528.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is now the Conrad \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment promotes a comprehensive \nstrategy to prevent teen pregnancy. If there is one problem I think \nSenators on both sides of the aisle recognize is right at the center of \nthe problems of this Nation, it is the dramatic increase in teen \npregnancy. I have talked to my colleagues before and shown a chart that \nshows that in 1992 there were more than a half million births to teen \nmothers, and 71 percent of those births were to unmarried parents. I \nhave also shown my colleagues, in the past, a chart that demonstrates \nthat our Nation's teen birth rate is now more than twice as high as in \nany other industrialized country.\n  The Federal Government, we believe, has a responsibility to assist \nStates in developing effective teenage pregnancy prevention strategies, \nand that will help prevent the cycle of poverty that results.\n  The Conrad-Lieberman amendment does the following: It provides $300 \nmillion, over 7 years, for States to develop adult supervised living \narrangements. I call them ``second chance homes.'' They are places \nwhere young, unmarried mothers can get the structure and supervision \nthat they need to turn their lives around.\n  Second, the Conrad-Lieberman amendment retains the requirement added \nto the Dole bill that teen parents live with their parents or another \nresponsible adult and that they stay in school. There are a lot of \nthings we do not know. But we do know that for a teenage parent to have \na chance, it is critically important that they be in an adult-\nsupervised setting and that they stay in school. If there is one thing \nthat is clear, it is that.\n  Mr. President, the Conrad-Lieberman amendment also establishes a \nnational goal to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies to teens by 2 \npercent a year. It encourages communities to establish their own \nteenage pregnancy prevention goals. It establishes a national \nclearinghouse to share what we learned about what works to prevent \nteenage pregnancy. It establishes a 5 percent set-aside for teen \npregnancy prevention strategies to be developed by the States.\n  Finally, the Conrad-Lieberman amendment calls for the aggressive \nprosecution of men who have sex with girls under the age of 18.\n  Mr. President, there is compelling evidence that two things have an \nenormous impact on long-term welfare dependency: teenage pregnancy and \nlack of a high school education.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, in 1992, teen mothers \ncomprised 42 percent of the welfare caseload. We also know that 63 \npercent of those on welfare for more than 5 years have less than a high \nschool degree.\n  Mr. President, if you start analyzing the problem of welfare \ndependency, you have these two factors, and they are very, very clear: \nteenage pregnancy and lack of a high school education.\n  If we are really going to reform welfare, we absolutely must confront \nboth of these issues. We must reduce teen pregnancy, and we must \nrequire that those teen parents get an education to equip them to care \nfor their children. The Conrad-Lieberman amendment does both.\n  Mr. President, I want to highlight our provision related to second-\nchance homes. The second-chance home provision is supported by a \nsignificant sector of the religious community, including the U.S. \nCatholic Conference. Second-chance homes are commonsense responses to \nthe teen pregnancy crisis.\n  I want to acknowledge the tremendous work of the Progressive Policy \nInstitute, and specifically Kathleen Sylvester, in developing this \nrecommendation. Second-chance houses are innovative, adult-supervised \nliving arrangements that should be available to teens who are unable to \nlive with a parent or other responsible adult. Communities can use \nsecond-chance homes to create a structured living environment that \nprovides education and training, early childhood intervention and \ndevelopment, case management, and family counseling. \n\n[[Page S 13530]]\n\n  We have a bipartisan agreement that States should provide adult-\nsupervised living arrangements. The requirement in this bill, however, \ncould unintentionally place teen parents at risk of being forced to \nlive in abusive households.\n  Mr. President, if we are not going to force young girls with infants \nof their own to live in households with abusive parents, then we must \nprovide appropriate alternatives to be available.\n  As currently written, the Republican bill acts as a disincentive to \nStates serving these young girls at all. Why? First, when the authors \nof the Republican bill added the adult-supervision requirement, they \nfailed to add any funding to make it work. Second, because it costs \nmoney to develop structured environments like second-chance homes, \nStates are much more likely to use the very limited funds in the bill \nfor other purposes.\n  Therefore, the most vulnerable teenage girls with their own children \nwill simply not be served by most States. This is why the U.S. Catholic \nConference, Catholic Charities, and the National Council of Churches \nsupport my proposal. In fact, last Friday, Catholic Charities sent a \nletter to every Member of the Senate supporting my approach. Their \nletter said:\n\n       The first principle in welfare reform must be: ``Do no \n     harm.''\n\n  The letter went on to say:\n\n       We support Senator Conrad's amendment, which not only would \n     require teen mothers to live under adult supervision and \n     continue their education, but it would also provide the \n     resources for second chance homes to make that requirement a \n     reality.\n\n  The majority of teenage mothers will live with their parents, with \nlegal guardians, with relatives, or foster parents. In some cases, \nhowever, there will be no place for the teen mother and her child to \ngo. That is the reason and that is the purpose for second-chance homes.\n  Teen mothers are extremely difficult to place in foster care. Most \nfoster families simply do not want them. Go to any foster-care agency \nand ask them what is the most difficult placement they have. Other than \nthe severely disabled, there is nothing more difficult to place in a \nfoster-care home than a young mother with her own child.\n  Certainly, none of us want to deny needed aid to a teen mother and \nher child when no suitable adult is available to look after them. We \nmust provide the means for States and local communities to create \nstructured living environments for these teens. It takes money to \ndevelop the kinds of structured settings that will be needed.\n  The Conrad-Lieberman amendment provides funding for States to develop \nsuch settings--these second-chance homes--where teenage mothers can \nhave the attention, the discipline, supervision, and structure that \nthey need in order to have a second chance.\n  Our Nation simply cannot sustain a system that locks millions of \nchildren into a lifetime of poverty because their parents were \nteenagers when the children were born. Confronting teenage parenthood \nrequires a comprehensive approach, with maximum flexibility for States. \nThat means providing the resources to enable States to prevent teenage \npregnancies, including the development of second-chance homes.\n  During the debate on the Coats amendment earlier today, there was \nmuch discussion of the need to capitalize on community resources. Many \nlocal institutions and individuals do a remarkable job of instilling \npositive values in teen mothers and others in need. One of the best \nexamples that I have seen is Covenant House. Covenant House is a \nCatholic-based charity that provides an excellent model of what second-\nchance houses can be. When Covenant House takes young mothers under \ntheir wing, those mothers seldom experience a second pregnancy until \nthey are ready to provide for that child.\n  The strategies in the Conrad-Lieberman amendment can provide a \nsignificant boost to our national attempt to combat teen pregnancy. I \nhope our colleagues will support it.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me just say that among the most \ncompelling testimony before the Finance Committee was the testimony of \nSister Mary Rose McGeady. The sister came before the Finance Committee, \nand she described to us what they have experienced at Covenant House, \ntaking in hundreds and hundreds of young mothers, unmarried, and their \nchildren.\n  She said over and over, our experience has been if you provide \nstructure, if you provide supervision, if you give these people a \nvision, that they can lift themselves beyond their current \ncircumstances and have a chance to succeed in life.\n  If they can make the best of the opportunities that they have, if \nthey see a path through education to make something of their lives, \nthey will not have a second child until they are ready to care for that \nchild.\n  I wish my colleagues could meet this sister who runs Covenant House, \nsee the sparkle in her eye and see the spring in her step and see the \nvision that she has of what we can do to really achieve results in \ncombating teen pregnancy.\n  She has been there. She has been in the trenches. She has fought the \nfight. She has done it successfully.\n  We ought to make certain that model is available in every State in \nthis Nation. That would do something serious about combating a problem \nthat I think all of us understand to be one of the critical problems \nfacing this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota for his outstanding statement and for the work that we \nhave done together to fashion this amendment. I am proud to be his \ncosponsor of it.\n  Mr. President, there has been considerable talk in this debate about \nthe problem of babies born out of wedlock, particularly babies born out \nof wedlock to teenage mothers, as well there should be. It has a direct \nand powerful effect on the welfare caseload.\n  The fact is that although teenage mothers themselves make up only a \nsmall percentage of the welfare caseload today, only 8 percent in 1994, \nthe fact is over half of the mothers on welfare today had their first \nchildren when they were teenagers.\n  The problem of teenage pregnancy is central to the problem of \nwelfare. To state the obvious, but sometimes it is important to do so, \nthis has been constructed as a program of aid for dependent children. \nMore than half of the mothers on welfare have dependent children \nbecause they had babies when they were teenagers and there is no father \naround.\n  Obviously, we are focusing on this problem of babies being born out \nof wedlock and babies being born to teenagers out of wedlock because it \nis a more broadly threatening social catastrophe that is affecting our \ncountry.\n  Take a look at the statistics with regard to prisoners in our jails \ntoday and you will find a startling number of them were born to mothers \nout of wedlock and grew up with no fathers in the house.\n  In trying in this bill to do something about teenage pregnancy and \nbabies born out of wedlock generally, I think we are trying to do \nsomething not only to reform the welfare system but to make ours a \nsafer society, and in the process to save some of these children born \nto poor teenage mothers, born to a life which in most ways is without \nhope for the mother and for the child.\n  Senator Conrad and I are thinking of fashioning the broadest approach \nto this problem of teenage pregnancy that will be part of this debate. \nI hope our colleagues on both sides will look at the details of this \nproposal and join in trying to create, really, a national crusade \nagainst teenage pregnancy.\n  A national crusade which can be directed by a Federal official which \nwill feature a national clearinghouse so that States and private and \nphilanthropic charitable institutions can share ideas about programs \nthat have to cut the rate of teenage pregnancy. A national campaign \nwhich will set national goals and give each State the goal of reducing \ntheir teenage pregnancy rate by 2 percent a year. It does not sound \nlike a lot, but today it is skyrocketing in the other direction.\n  Create a goal of involving 25 percent of the communities in America \nin teenage pregnancy prevention programs. Then to put some money behind \nall this to take the existing title 20 program which covers a host of \nsocial programs for the poor, and mandate that each State use 5 percent \nof the money they receive under title 20 for teen pregnancy prevention \nactivities.\n  It is that critical a problem facing our country. Mr. President, the \nbirth \n\n[[Page S 13531]]\nrate for single teenage parents has tripled since 1960 from 15 to 45 \nbirths per 1,000 unmarried girls age 15 to 19.\n  More than a third of the babies born in America today are born out of \nwedlock. It is a startling change in sociology in the family and \nreflects a startling change in values.\n  We spend a lot of time talking about why it has happened. I will come \nback to this in a while. Some of it has to do with the messages that \nthe media are sending our kids as they grow up. Some of it clearly has \nto do with an increasing sense of sexual permissiveness which we see by \nthese stunning numbers is not without its consequences and its victims. \nIts victims are the poor babies born to poverty with a teenage mother \nwithout a father in the House.\n  What kind of hope can that poor child have to make something decent \nof his or her life. I think the change in values has had its \nconsequences here.\n  I fear that the welfare system has all been part of the problem. I do \nnot say it has created the problem. It is much more complicated than \nthat. There is no question in my mind based on reading I have done, \nbased on conversations I have had with young women who have had babies \nout of wedlock when they were teenagers, that the existence of the \nwelfare system has in some measure facilitated, enabled, made more \nlikely, the birth of babies out of wedlock to teenage girls.\n  We all pay the price for that consequence. That is why dealing with \nthe problem of teenage pregnancy, dealing with the problem of babies \nborn out of wedlock, has to be a central part of our effort at welfare \nreform.\n  Each year about 1 million teenage girls become pregnant and confront \nthe consequence of that pregnancy. About half of those girls have their \nbabies. Half a million babies, roughly 40 percent have abortions, and \nanother 10 percent of those teen mothers miscarry.\n  Well over 60 percent of the teenage mothers are single. They are not \nmarried. For those single mothers who raise their babies, the \nconsequences are obviously grim, particularly if the mother does not \nhave at least a high school education. Of course, many who are below \nthe age of 17 or 18, who have their babies, do not have a high school \neducation.\n  As William Raspberry, columnist, noted in the Washington Post, \nchildren born to parents who had their child born out of wedlock before \nthey finished high school and reached the age of 20 are almost \nguaranteed a life of poverty. Bearing a child in your teens as a single \nmother is simply wrong, and our society must give that message to men \nand women who are responsible for the birth of those babies to single \nteenage mothers. It is contrary to our values. It is contrary to our \ninterests. It is contrary to the interests of those young women and the \nchildren they bear.\n  Unfortunately, our current welfare policies too often send the \nopposite message, and that is why they need to be changed. We need to \nrequire teenage parents who receive welfare to live at home with their \nown families or, if that is not appropriate, in adult supervised group \nhomes, some of the Second Chance Homes that Senator Conrad has \ndescribed so well, that will be enabled by the amendment that we offer \ntonight.\n  In my conversations with young women who gave birth to babies out of \nwedlock when they were teenagers, and I asked them, ``Why did you do \nit,'' I must say, first, I was impressed by the overwhelming percentage \nof these young women I spoke to who said, ``Senator, I love my baby, \nbut I wish I had not had the baby when I was so young.''\n  I would say, Why did you do it, as you look back at it?\n  Some said the obvious: ``I did not protect myself when having sex.''\n  Others said, ``I did it in part because I knew if I had a baby I \nwould be able to go on welfare, and that welfare check would enable me \nto move out of my house and to become independent.''\n  Any of us who have raised teenage kids know that they all want to be \nindependent. The idea that these young women would have incorporated a \nvalue system, or lack of such, that would lead them to want to have a \nbaby to get the welfare check to move out of their houses, that is a \nsad commentary on where we are. And that is why it is so critical to \nrequire, and send a message, that that is not going to be the way out \nof the house anymore. If you are a teenage mother and you want welfare, \nyou have to live at home or you have to live in a supervised group home \nsetting, such as the superior Second Chance Homes that Senator Conrad \nhas described. We ought to require them to stay in school and to take \nparenting classes. It is no excuse, and it ought not to be an excuse, \nfor young women who have babies to drop out of school.\n  The amendment that we have proposed tonight builds on this foundation \nby establishing the national goals that I have talked about and the \nclearinghouse. Let me briefly discuss these provisions.\n  I think if we want to make significant progress on this issue, we \nhave to set national goals. That is what Senator Conrad and I have done \nin this amendment. We have to be able to measure our progress toward \nthose goals. This amendment establishes that goal, reducing out-of-\nwedlock teen pregnancy rates by 2 percent a year.\n  The purpose of the national goal is to galvanize the efforts of the \npublic and private sector to address this problem. As President Clinton \nsaid on August 9 when he visited North Carolina, ``Teenage pregnancy is \nnot a problem that we in Government alone can fix.'' How right he was. \nPresident Clinton said he is working to get all the leaders of all \nsectors of our society involved in this fight. I think we, in this \nwelfare reform legislation, can add momentum and support to his effort \nby establishing clear national goals that both private and public \nsector organizations can aim at and rally around. We have to put our \nenergy where it is most likely to make a difference in children's \nlives.\n  In shaping policies to achieve the goals we are setting out here, I \nthink we have to keep in mind some of the terrible facts about pregnant \nteenage girls. As Kathleen Sylvester of the Progressive Policy \nInstitute said in a recent Washington Post op-ed, ``Most teenage \nmothers come from poor, dysfunctional families. Many have been \nneglected or abused.'' This is the cycle of poverty and dysfunction \nthat continues from generation to generation. Ms. Sylvester reported \nthat as many as two-thirds were victims of rape or sexual abuse at an \nearly age. And, sadly, the abuser was often a member of their \nhousehold. That is why we are talking about Second Chance Homes \ntonight. As a consequence, teenage mothers start out extremely \nvulnerable to the sexual advances of older men.\n  Mr. President, there was a recent study done by the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute that produced results that we have discussed here on the \nfloor before, but I found them startling. Bringing together a number of \nstudies, they reported that half of the babies, at least half of the \nbabies born to teenage mothers, were fathered by an adult man. I must \nsay that my vision of this problem was that these children being born \nto teenage mothers were the result of casual, irresponsible sex with \ntwo teenagers. Not so, according to this study--in most cases, in more \nthan half the cases. The younger the mother, according to the study, \nthe greater the age difference between her and the father of the baby.\n  Among California mothers, in one study of mothers aged 11 to 15--\nbetween the ages of 11 to 15--women, young girls, who would carry the \nbaby to birth, 51 percent of them said that the fathers of those babies \nwere adults, were over 18.\n  There are studies we could go on and on with. But the point is that \nthese are appalling findings, and they cry out to us to try to do \nsomething to protect these young women.\n  When we talked about these statistics a few days ago on the floor, \nthe senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, stood and made a \npoint that I found very provocative and also, I think, insightful, \nwhich is that, tragically, too often we are dealing here with girls \ngrowing up in poor families without a father in the house, and part of \nwhat that means is that there is not an older man in the house to \nprotect his daughter from the unwanted advances of another older man, \none of the roles--a role so primal that we tend not even to think about \nit--that the father in an intact family normally will play. \n\n[[Page S 13532]]\n\n  So part of this amendment that Senator Conrad and I have introduced \ntries to begin to get at this problem by expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the States, which are the main enforcers of criminal law in \nour society, have to look again at laws that we barely ever mention \nthese days that used to be very much a part of our lives and the life \nof the courts, which is to say laws against statutory rape, to say it \nis a crime for an adult man to have sex with a woman who is a minor.\n  Perhaps, again, as part of the sense that consenting people should do \nwhatever they want sexually, the general tone of sexual permissiveness \nin our society, these laws have either been amended down or out of \nexistence, or if they are in existence, they are rarely enforced today.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that Senator Conrad and I include in this \nappeal to the States raising the question of whether it might not just \nbe one deterrent to an adult man--who, in this case, could well be a \nsexual predator, an aggressor with a younger woman--to think twice if \nthat man knows that the statutory rape laws are going to be enforced \nonce again in that State.\n  In trying to put some money behind the general program that we have \noutlined, I mentioned the use of title XX funds. The amendment would \nrequire that 5 percent of the title XX social services block grant be \ncommitted by the States to teenage pregnancy prevention programs, and \nthat is not a small sum. That equals $140 million a year to begin to \nhelp the States try a multitude of responses to this social disaster \nthat is occurring in our society and that is affecting every one of us, \nwhether we see it or feel it immediately--certainly affecting us in the \nincreasing rate of violent crime among young people.\n  Mr. President, a second and final word about the idea of a \nclearinghouse which the amendment would establish at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  We are dealing here with a profound, complicated, difficult social \nproblem. There are a lot of ways to go at it--law enforcement, and \nstatutory rape is one. But we need to encourage the widest array of \nexperiments with dealing with this problem at the State level. And the \naim there is to then share that program with programs that work with \nother States and philanthropic and private charitable groups around the \ncountry.\n  The fact is that we are beginning to know something about what works. \nThe Henry Kaiser Foundation several months ago published a monograph \nthat reviewed the effectiveness of 123 sex education curricula programs \nand their policy implications. Their work was supported by a diverse \ngroup of organizations, including the American Enterprise Institute, \nthe Alan Guttmacher Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, and the Population Council. And the study's key findings \ninclude the following:\n  Sex education in school-based health centers do not increase \nfrequency of sexual activity among high school students or reduce the \nage when they first become sexually active. Some school-based clinics, \nbut not all, actually delayed the age of first sexual activity, and \nincreased contraceptive use resulting in fewer pregnancies.\n  Programs that are effective focus on three behaviors: One is to \nprotect oneself sexually. The second is abstinence. And the third is \nhow to resist the pressure--peer pressure, or pressure from an \nindividual, a man--to have sex.\n  To be effective, the school-based sex education programs have to be \ntailored to the populations they serve.\n  That was the message of those studies.\n  Finally, and very critically, the studies concluded that sex \neducation programs should not be value neutral. Those that gave \nstudents sexual information and told them to make their own judgments \nwere not effective in changing behavior.\n  In other words, we have to stop our sense of neutrality, a sense that \nanything goes in this society, because there are consequences when \nanything goes, and they are terrible for our society. We have to preach \nand teach a very clear message. Sexual activity at an early age, \nactivity that results in teenage pregnancy, is simply wrong. It ought \nnot to happen. It is unacceptable. It is a disaster for the mother \ninvolved, for the baby involved, and for our society.\n  That is the kind of information that I believe can be shared through \nthe clearinghouse that would be set up under this amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me say a final related word, and that is about the \nrole of the media. I think the media has had generally a negative \neffect on values in our society. And I think they could have an \nextremely positive effect because their impact on our kids is so \npowerful.\n  A growing body of evidence, in my opinion, supports the conclusion \nthat the pervasiveness of sexual messages on television, in the movies, \nand in music has contributed to the dramatic rise in the number of \nteenagers having sex, and in turn the rise in teen pregnancies.\n  Mr. President, I need not belabor this point. But I saw a recent \nstudy about the number of sex acts that one can see on an average day \nwatching soap operas, the number of sexual references that one can hear \nand see in prime time on television, and the number of sexual topics \nthat are discussed, usually not normal behavior, on TV talk shows. I \nthink the cumulative effect of all of that, as Senator Moynihan has \nsaid so well, is to define deviancy down to the behavior that was not \nonly not done much in earlier time but certainly not talked about, and \nhold it up as a kind of standard of normalcy; at worst, something to \ngiggle about. We are paying the price for that. I think it is time that \nthose who put shows on television and who run the networks appreciate \nit.\n  The most compelling evidence in this connection is a poll that was \ntaken of children themselves by a group that I believe was called \nChildren Now, a survey of children aged 10 to 16. And when asked the \nquestion 62 percent of them said that they believe that what they saw \non television encouraged them to have sex earlier than they should \nhave. I hope that those who put those shows on television will begin to \nthink more seriously about the consequences of what they are putting \non. It is exactly these concerns that were part of what led Senator \nConrad and I to introduce the amendment on the telecommunications bill \nthat passed with a strong bipartisan support that would call on TV set \nmanufacturers to put in what we call the ``choice chip,'' to let \nparents choose what their kids will see and that requires TV networks \nto rate the programs that they put on.\n  Mr. President, the electronic media have enormous influence, and they \ncould use it for good, and in many cases they have used it for good. \nOne of the best known examples I think is the way the entertainment \nindustry embraced the campaign against drunk drivers through a \nconscious effort to weave portrayals of designated drivers into a \nnumber of TV shows in addition to the outright commercial messages \nagainst drunk driving. The entertainment industry and television \nparticularly played a critically important role in helping to reduce \nthe number of alcohol-related fatalities.\n  There is simply no reason that they could not make a similar \ncommitment on behalf of the campaign against teen pregnancy.\n  I think another way we can encourage the media to become allies is in \nthe use of direct advertising such as was done in the campaign against \ndrunk driving. And the Maryland State government provides us with an \nexcellent example of the potential that lies in this approach. In 1988 \nit embarked on what might be called a media blitzkrieg to combat teen \npregnancies. The State was saturated with advertisements on television, \nradio, billboards, buses, as well as videos, brochures, and special \nlessons that were distributed in schools. More than $7 million was \nspent on the TV and radio spots alone. In the first 3 years of the \ncampaign, birth rates and abortions dropped. And by 1991 the State \nreported a 13-percent decrease in teen pregnancies, which in this field \nis startling, and in this case very encouraging.\n  The media campaign could not singlehandedly account for those \nchanges. But it is clear to me--and I think most who have looked at \nthis study--that it played a very significant role in that reduction. \n\n[[Page S 13533]]\n\n  Perhaps the best indication of its effectiveness was the fact that in \na followup study 94 percent of the students and teachers at five middle \nschools in Maryland knew about the campaign, and could repeat the \ncampaign slogans verbatim.\n  So we have a real problem on our hands here, and we are all suffering \nthe consequences of it.\n  This amendment that Senator Conrad and I have put forward tonight is \na an attempt to put our Nation on the course of an urgent, intense, and \ncomprehensive campaign to cut down the rate of teenage pregnancies.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for the partnership that we \nhave once again established. It is always a pleasure and an honor to \nwork with Senator Conrad, particularly, as is normally the case with \nus, in a good cause.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLieberman, who has been a real leader in the whole challenge of dealing \nwith what is happening with respect to teenage pregnancies.\n  I, first of all, want to apologize to him. I moved him from \nConnecticut to Vermont. I was just in Vermont. It is a beautiful place, \na wonderful setting, and I am quick to identify Senator Lieberman with \nplaces that are pleasant. But in fairness, he belongs in Connecticut. \nAnd Connecticut is lucky to have him.\n  I have enjoyed our partnership on this challenge because I think of \nteenage pregnancy as really a tragedy for America. It is a tragedy for \nthe children, it is a tragedy for the young women and girls, and it is \na tragedy for the entire country.\n  Mr. President, one in three children being born in America today are \nborn out of wedlock. In some cities in America, two out of three \nchildren are being born out of wedlock. Tonight, we are in the Capital \nCity of the United States. In this city, two out of three children born \nthis year are being born out of wedlock.\n  What chance do they have? What chance do their mothers have? We know, \naccording to the GAO, that 42 percent of the welfare caseload in this \ncountry is teenage mothers or girls or women who had babies when they \nwere teenagers. It is central to the problem we face.\n  I wish to share a couple of vignettes from an example of a second-\nchance home before I end because I think these vignettes are important. \nThey are real life experiences. This is what is happening to the people \nabout whom we are talking. This is a story about Sherice.\n\n  Sherice, now 20, has a 2-year-old daughter and no one to help out. \nShe, too, was trapped early in the cycle of welfare dependency.\n  Sherice grew up on welfare, and was made responsible for caring for \nher ten younger siblings by her alcoholic mother. At 17, she dropped \nout of high school when she became pregnant with her daughter Jamila. \nShe was forced to take her daughter out of the family's overcrowded \napartment to live with reluctant relatives. Sherice's options ran out \nwhen this living situation also proved inhospitable, and she found \nherself with no one to turn to and became homeless.\n  Sherice and Jamila were referred to an American Family Inn in Queens, \nNY. After obtaining her GED through the on-site high school and \ncompleting a 4-month job training apprenticeship in food services, \nSherice found a place to live and set out to find a job. With the help \nof the American Family Inn's employment specialist, Sherice entered the \nNew York Restaurant School with a partial scholarship in order to \nfollow her dream of becoming a chef.\n  She recently completed her demanding cooking classes and soon will \nbegin an externship in a local catering company. She plans to use the \nskills she learned to form her own catering company after she graduates \nin October, 1995.\n\n  Mr. President, this is someone who, because of a second-chance home, \nhas her life together, who is a productive member of society because of \nthe structured, supervised setting she was able to experience in a \nhome.\n  A final vignette.\n\n  Elena. Elena is an 18-year-old single mother with a 2-year-old son, \nAndrew. She has never been married, has never lived independently, and \nshe receives public assistance. She represents a typical mother \nresiding at American Family Inn.\n  Elena has a fractured and unstable past. She shuffled between her \nmother and father until age 5, when she was placed in the first of \nthree foster homes due to physical abuse from her mother. At age 14, \nElena moved in with her boyfriend and his parents and at age 16, \ndropped out of high school to give birth to her son. Her relationship \nwith her baby's father deteriorated as he continued and increased his \ndrug use. She left with her son and moved back in with her mother until \nher stepfather forced her to leave.\n  Elena had no other choice but to enter the shelter system. Prior to \narriving at an American Family Inn in Manhattan, Elena had lived in an \nemergency assistance center, a short-term shelter and a welfare hotel. \nThe day after she enrolled in the on-site programs, including the \nalternative high school where she is working toward completing her GED, \nthe licensed day care center where her child is being socialized to the \nnorms of education and the independent living skills workshops where \nshe is learning topics such as parenting, budgeting, nutrition, and \nfamily violence prevention.\n  Elena has also begun intensive job readiness and job training. Each \nafternoon she fulfills her internship requirement as a teacher's aide \nin the on-site day care center. She is expected to complete the program \nin the next several months, move into her own apartment and either find \nfull-time employment or a enroll in a community college to pursue \nhigher education.\n\n  This is Elena's statement, and I quote:\n\n       I feel this is a place where I can get my life together. \n     I'm getting my education and learning to work. My mother \n     never cared if I went to school and she never told me about \n     having babies or being a parent. The people here and the \n     programs here are helping me. I'm learning to be a teacher's \n     assistant so that I can go to college and start my own \n     business and get off of public assistance. I needed this \n     chance.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think there is a Member in this Chamber whose \nheart is so cold that they are not moved by a story like that one--\nsomebody who grew up in an abusive home, had a child at much too early \nan age, forced into homelessness, and who now, because of a second-\nchance home, is getting an education, wants to start her own business, \nwants to get off public assistance and make something of her life.\n  That is the promise of what we can accomplish by focusing on this \ncritical challenge to America's future. We can make a difference. We \ncan do something that will lead to a different result than a life of \npoverty and dependence, and we can do it by action tomorrow. That is \nwhen the vote will be held.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Conrad-Lieberman amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2581\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask to call up amendment 2581 for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is now the pending question. \nThe Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am here to try and undo what I think is a very \nunfortunate area of the bill which attempts to do something which we \nwould all agree with, and that is to reduce the number of illegitimate \nchild births in this country and to hopefully reduce the number of \nabortions. I think it was one certainly sponsored with all the hopes \nand dreams of being able to do that. However, I oppose it because I \nfind that it would be most counterproductive and would result in an \nentitlement being created which would in effect not establish any \npolicy that will really accomplish the goals for which it was \nconceived. Thus, I have sponsored an amendment to strike the so-called \nillegitimacy ratio from the welfare bill.\n  Last night, we heard from Senator Domenici and others about how \nconservative social engineering is no better than liberal social \nengineering. We all know that Federal strings often do \n\n[[Page S 13534]]\nnot produce the desired behavior modification and can even produce \nunintended negative results. I hope my colleagues will join me in my \nopposition on those grounds.\n  Throughout this debate, we have discussed frequently the importance \nof ending entitlements. It may surprise some of my colleagues to learn \nthat this provision creates a new entitlement and will be funded by the \nterms ``such sums as necessary.''\n  Now, CBO has scored the costs at $75 million over the 7 years. I \nthink their estimate may well be very, very conservative. Because of \nthe way I read the provision, I calculate this new entitlement could \ncost as much as $1.6 billion per year by the year 2000, if all our \nStates reduce their out-of-wedlock birth rates without reporting higher \nabortion rates.\n  This gives me pause, especially for reasons I will outline about \nunreliable statistics.\n  But let me point out also just to verify that figure, which may seem \nto be outlandish to start with, the reason for that is that all you \nhave to do is one time go below the 1995 base, and for the rest of the \nperiod, providing you do not go back up, you will get this bonus which \nis in it. And if each State does that, we will have the figure I gave \nyou of about $1.6 billion per year.\n  The provision entitles States whose proportion of in-State--I \nemphasize ``in-State''--out-of-wedlock birth rates have decreased \nwithout an increase in their State abortion rates to either an \nadditional 5 percent of their block grant if the birth rate has \ndecreased by 1 percent or 10 percent if the birth rate decreases by 2 \npercent or more. And it only has to do it once providing it stays below \nthe baseline. So if a State's out-of-wedlock births decrease as a \nproportion of their total births, they can receive as much as 10 \npercent more than their base cash assistance and child care block \ngrant.\n  I do not understand why we want to create a new entitlement, \nespecially for States that need the dollars less. In other words, if \nyou have decreased your problem, you end up with more money for perhaps \nas much as the term of the whole bill, of our period which we are \ncovering here on the budget. We all know that out-of-wedlock birth \nrates show a strong acceleration with the rate of welfare dependency. \nIf there are more children born to single parents, there will be more \nneed for State and Federal assistance. And that is part of why we are \nso concerned.\n  But rather than try to construct, actively work toward, lower out-of-\nwedlock birthrates, this ratio seems completely backward since it sends \nmore money to States that need it less. And States that for whatever \nreason experience higher out-of-wedlock birthrates and need it more, \nthey cannot tap into the newly created entitlement.\n  Mr. President, I have here a letter from Catholic Charities USA in \nopposition to this illegitimacy ratio. There are some who tried to get \nthis into the pro-life, pro-choice area here. I would just point out--\nand I will read this letter now into the Record because I think it is \nso helpful in letting everyone know that this is a group which \nobviously is a pro-life group. This is addressed to Senator Dole.\n\n       Dear Senator Dole:\n       Catholic Charities USA is deeply concerned about the \n     proposed illegitimacy ratio bonus being put forward as part \n     of welfare reform legislation in the current Congress. The \n     proposal is another speculative venture being imposed upon \n     the entire country and its poorest families without test, \n     trial, or experiment.\n       Our fear is that State governments, in a time of drastic \n     funding cuts and escalating human need, will resort to the \n     family cap, teenage mother exclusions, and other drastic \n     measures, all in the illusive hope of garnering additional \n     millions of dollars of funding. (The funding itself will have \n     to be cut from other needed programs or services in our zero-\n     sum budget situation.)\n\n  I would emphasize that. There is no provision for the funding in this \nbill. It will have to come from existing sources otherwise, and it is \nan entitlement, meaning that it must come. I will continue with the \nletter.\n\n       Those measures, while as yet unproven to cut birth rates, \n     are far more likely to produce increased abortions, as the \n     failed New Jersey family cap experiment already has shown, \n     and to hurt poor children and families. And the proposed \n     illegitimacy ratio bonus contains no penalty for increasing \n     abortion rates in States which experiment with the lives and \n     well-being of their poorest families.\n       No church community has been as vigorous as our own in \n     support of human life or of sexual abstinence outside of \n     marriage. And no community has as broad experience as our own \n     in Catholic Charities in working with women who are pregnant \n     and unmarried and with their children. We urge you to remove \n     the proposed illegitimacy ratio from the pending legislation \n     in the interest of sound family policy.\n\n  Signed by Father Fred Kammer, president of Catholic Charities USA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Catholic Charities USA,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 12, 1995.\n     Senator Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Catholic Charities USA is deeply \n     concerned about the proposed illegitimacy ratio bonus being \n     put forward as part of welfare reform legislation in the \n     current Congress. The proposal is another speculative venture \n     being imposed upon the entire country and its poorest \n     families without test, trial, or experiment.\n       Our fear is that state governments, in a time of drastic \n     funding cuts and escalating human need, will resort to the \n     family cap, teenage mother exclusions, and other drastic \n     measures, all in the illusive hope of garnering additional \n     millions of dollars of funding.

We urge you to remove \n     the proposed illegitimacy ratio from the pending legislation \n     in the interest of sound family policy.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Fr. Fred Kammer, SJ,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We all know that out-of-wedlock birth rates show a \nstrong correlation with the rate of welfare dependency. If there are \nmore children born to single parents, there will be more need for State \nand Federal assistance. That is part of why we are so concerned. But \nrather than try to constructively work toward lower out-of-wedlock \nbirth rates, this ratio seems completely backward.\n  Mr. President, I also understand, as well as reading the letter from \nthe Catholic Charities, that the Catholic bishops oppose a similar \nprovision in the House. They are concerned, as I am, that rather than \neffecting positive behavior change by decreasing out-of-wedlock \npregnancies, this new entitlement would encourage out-of-wedlock and \nout-of-State--I emphasize that for your memory later on when we talk \nabout how these things are worked--out-of-State abortions. And I would \nalso add that this may well mean back-room abortions or some of those \nthat we will not be able in any way to take note of in the requirement \nfor statistics here.\n  Because States do not qualify for the funds by showing an increase in \ntheir in-State abortion rates, there are a few ways to influence those \nnumbers. The most obvious is underreporting. According to the Centers \nfor Disease Control, several States currently have inaccurate, \nincomplete, or even completely estimated abortion rates. I think \nCalifornia is one of those.\n  So here we are going to establish a baseline which will be used for \nthe length of the bill that will allow States to collect on figures \nthat are totally or may be totally inaccurate. As we might expect, it \nis difficult to encourage, particularly without a mandate to report, \ncomplete reporting of abortions. We will be looking at situations which \nwill already be in being which have had no reporting requirements. That \nis, that we use a base year of the year 1995, which is almost over with \nand will be by the time all of this gets into being. So we are setting \nup a base year here for which we have no reliable statistics whatsoever \nand using that to determine an entitlement program. Women who receive \nabortions want to maintain their confidentiality, and abortion \nproviders, particularly in the face of recent violence, may want to \n\n[[Page S 13535]]\nmaintain their anonymity. So the current numbers are not accurate. We \nhave no adequate baseline to compare to, and we have no uniform \nreporting system in place.\n  If we mandate reporting without providing significant funds for the \nStates to do this, we will be sending an unfunded mandate to the \nStates.\n  Another way to influence these statistics would be to toughen State \nrequirements for obtaining an abortion. In some States--this is \nimportant to remember--in some States as many as 40 percent or more of \ntheir in-State abortion rates are from people who reside outside the \nState. So if you know you are going to maybe get millions or hundreds \nof millions of dollars here by getting abortions performed across the \nborders, there is going to be tremendous incentive to accomplish that. \nMaking abortions more difficult to obtain could obviously help to lower \nthe abortion rate. This provision would offer a cash incentive to \nStates for tougher abortion laws possibly resulting in unreported \nabortions or more abortions out of State or more abortions under \nimproper conditions.\n  All in all, accurate abortion statistics will be extraordinarily \ndifficult, if not impossible, to obtain. We must struggle with what \nconstitutes an abortion or an induced pregnancy termination. Does the \nso-called morning-after pill count? What about a routine D & C that may \nor may not have involved a pregnancy? How will we know if women take a \nlarge enough dose of oral contraceptives to induce menstruation? It is \nan off-label use but expels any pregnancy that may be there and induces \nmenstruation. How are we going to count those? Are we going to require \nwomen to report that?\n  There is currently no standard definition, nor accurate or agreed-\nupon reporting procedure, especially for what we will have to use as \nthe baseline year.\n  Currently, States define their terms and define how they report. Some \nStates only report hospital procedures, and public health officials \nextrapolate the other numbers. In the case of at least one State, the \nmost recent figures available are completely estimated and are not \nbased upon any report. States that currently report high numbers or \nbroadly drawn definitions stand to gain, while States that have been \nunderreporting will have no alternatives but to continue.\n  We are setting up something here which was well-intentioned I am \nsure, but is so open to manipulation or intrusion into the personal \nlives of people that I cannot believe it can be supported by anyone \nthat has examined it, notwithstanding the wonderful intentions.\n  Mr. President, I believe this new entitlement is illogical and \nunwieldy. It could potentially cost quite a bit of money, but the \ncriteria for qualification are unclear and difficult to quantify \naccurately. In this provision, we are attempting the very kind of \nsocial engineering that we have railed against and tried to prevent. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in voting to strike this illegitimacy \nratio.\n  As I said earlier, I know it was well-intentioned, and I would be \nwilling to work with those who are behind it to see if there are other \nways that we could reduce teenage pregnancies in particular. I know \nthat from studies that show there are many things that we could do and \nalso enhance our educational system by increasing the school days and \nmore child care, all the kinds of things that can try to bring about \nthe kind of society that does not seem to promote or to enhance the \nability for young people to have pregnancies out of wedlock.\n  Mr. President, I am ready to yield the floor. I do not see anyone \npresent at this time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of an important \nelement of the Dole welfare reform package. This provision--known as \nthe illegitimacy ratio bonus--will help, I believe, the fight against \nthe chronic problem of illegitimacy without increasing the tragedy of \nabortion. I urge my colleagues to vote against striking it from the \nreform package.\n  We now know, Mr. President, that the dramatic increase in out of \nwedlock births is a chief cause of welfare dependency and a chief cause \nof a number of other social pathologies.\n  Children brought up without the benefit of two parents are six times \nas likely to be poor and to be poor longer than other children. They \nare two to three times as likely to have emotional and behavioral \nproblems, more likely to dropout of school, become pregnant as \nteenagers, abuse drugs, commit crimes, and even commit suicide.\n  This makes illegitimacy a driving force behind welfare dependency and \nthat is doubly tragic because our welfare system is a significant cause \nof illegitimacy.\n  Welfare, as currently constituted, creates a vicious cycle of \ndependency. Children have babies and turn to the welfare system in a \nfailed attempt to become ``independent.'' Then their babies, in turn, \ntoo often end up on welfare.\n  And illegitimacy has reached epidemic proportions in America. By the \nend of this decade, 40 percent of all-American births will take place \nwithout the benefit of marriage.\n  Mr. President, I believe we must stop the spread of this epidemic. It \nis destroying our cities and more importantly, it is destroying far too \nmany lives.\n  One problem we face in fighting out of wedlock births is that no one \nhere in Washington really knows what constitutes the total solution to \nthe problem. Circumstances in our various States and localities vary \ntoo widely for any single one size fits all Washington strategy to \nsucceed in lowering illegitimacy.\n  Thus, I believe our best course is to encourage the States to \nimplement their own strategies to lower out of wedlock births. This \nprovision, by giving bonuses to States that lower illegitimacy ratios, \nwould do just that.\n  Mr. President, reducing illegitimacy is just not a function of the \nwelfare system. The States must look beyond welfare reforms; they \nshould pursue educational reforms, tax reforms, such things as \nenterprise zones and others to create jobs and economic opportunity, \nthings of that sort. They should explore ways to set up counseling \ncenters to encourage, among another things, responsible behavior and \ndiscourage out of wedlock births. All of these need to be part of the \nsolution, not just changes in the welfare system. And that is why we \nthink this bonus provision is the right approach, because it will \nencourage creativity on the part of the States in pursuit of reforms in \nall of these areas.\n  Some have expressed concern about the abortion language in this bonus \nprovision. But I just point out the following:\n  One, this provision does not affect any abortion laws.\n  Two, it does not take a position, pro or con, on the issue of \nabortion.\n  Three, it does not penalize or punish any State in terms of their \nFederal funding.\n  Four, it brings about no changes in the requirements as to the \nreporting of names of individuals having abortions, or anything along \nthat line.\n  Now, as I have talked to Members of the Senate, both those who are \npro-life and pro-choice advocates, I have not found anyone who wants to \nsee the rate of abortions go up. Indeed, pro-choice advocates tell me \nthey want abortions to be safe, legal, and rare. And I believe them. To \nme, ``rare'' means as many, or fewer, abortions than we have today--not \nmore. Therefore, no one should find this bonus provision objectionable. \nIt is designed to encourage States to experiment with various new \nstrategies to reduce illegitimacy, except the strategy of encouraging \nmore abortions.\n  I know some think that somehow that would produce new restrictions at \nthe State level and, in some way or another, on abortion. All I can say \nis this, Mr. President. In this country, the abortion debates have been \nraised in the State Houses for 20-plus years. If there were going to be \nrestrictions, they would be imposed on the basis of the debates we have \nalready had. I do not believe the potential availability of these bonus \ndollars--only available if somehow this remarkable increase in \n\n[[Page S 13536]]\nillegitimacy were reduced--would be the final factor in causing a State \nto take action to change, in any way, or make their abortion laws more \nrestrictive.\n  In my judgment, this provision gives us a constructive means by which \nto attack a serious problem. By giving goals to the States, and rewards \nfor meeting those goals, we will encourage them to develop strategies \nfor fighting out of wedlock births. By leaving to the States the \nformulation of particular rules and programs, we will encourage \nexperimentation in a variety of strategies aimed at addressing a \nvariety of circumstances.\n  Without increasing abortions, this provision will reduce \nillegitimacy, and thereby reduce the welfare rolls and increase \nopportunity for everyone.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against striking it from the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Michigan for \nhis excellent statement, and there is little that I disagree with in \nwhat he said.\n  However, I point out that he has not, in any way, answered any of the \nquestions I raised about how this would work and that the figures I \ngave were inaccurate. That is, very simply, that if a State, one time, \nreduces its rates in order to comply with the bill and never does \nanything more, but holds them where they are, they would be able to get \nthe full 10 percent bonus for the full term of the bill, which could \nmean as much as--totally, if all the States did it, $1.6 billion a \nyear; and that there is no provision in the bill for that money, other \nthan it is entitlement and therefore it would be taken from other areas \nin order to fund it. I think that is one area that ought to be \nremembered.\n  Secondly, also, the base year--there was no correction in the facts I \ngave about the fact that there is no accurate data available for the \n1995 base year, which would be used for that. Nor was there any \ncontradiction to my statement that by shifting out of wedlock births to \nother States, or Canada, or wherever else, it would not be possible to \nreach that ratio with no real decrease in out of wedlock births; nor \nthe fact that there is no definition here for abortion, so that the \nresults of what would happen for a State could well be determined \nentirely upon abortion definitions, which are nowhere included, and \nvary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n  I would like to join my good friend from Michigan in trying to find \nways that we could provide workable and appropriate incentives to be \nable to reduce the out of wedlock births, especially among our young \npeople. But I just urge my colleagues to realize that this one has some \nserious problems, and I hope they will remove it from the bill with my \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont and I are good \nfriends and are in large agreement on most of this I see, but obviously \nthere are certain things that we do not have full agreement on.\n  Let me comment on a couple of the points that were made. First and \nforemost is that before any benefits or bonuses are going to be \nrealized, we really do have to produce something that has not been \nproduced in this country in a long time. That is a decrease in the \nnumber of out-of-wedlock births.\n  Now I think I am probably one of the Members of this Chamber who has \nvoted time after time to make sure we do not spend the taxpayers' money \nunwisely and have tried very hard here to establish what I think are \npriorities for spending.\n  I, too, am concerned whenever we spend money here, even if it is $75 \nor $80 million here and in a budget of $1.5 trillion.\n  The reason that I am supporting this so strongly is because I can \nthink of very few spending priorities that we could possibly establish \nthat would be more important to the future of our Nation and would more \ndirectly address the problems we confront than the priority of \nencouraging a nationwide effort to reduce illegitimate births.\n  I think in the long run there will be more savings than spending \nbecause to the extent that we end this problem, we reduce this problem, \nthere will be benefits for many.\n  Separately, when we set priorities here I do not disagree with the \nSenator from Vermont when we talk about job training and education and \nso on. I think this priority is one that Americans across the board \nagree on ought to be at the top of our list. These dollars only get \nspent if we succeed in addressing the problem. They do not get spent if \nwe fail.\n  I think at least in my State most people would say that establishing \nthis type of incentive system is the step in the right direction of \ntrying to bring attention to this problem and trying to give States the \nkind of encouragement I think they need to change and to adopt a broad \nset of policies--not just welfare policies but education policies. As I \nsaid in my remarks, perhaps changes in tax codes, perhaps inviting \nprivate entities to play a greater role in helping teens at risk and so \non.\n  I think this will be the outcome. I hope that our colleagues who have \ntalked, and many, many have talked about the out-of-wedlock birth \nproblem will come to see this.\n  I do not think anybody has the perfect solution. The reason I so \nstrongly support this one is that it does not dictate to any State what \nit can or cannot do. If a State does not want to collect the data, if a \nState does not want to try to deal with the problem, it is not under \nany mandate to do it. It will not be punished.\n  If States take up the call, if States join the effort, if States make \npositive progress, if States actually reduce the rate of illegitimate \nbirths, I think a reward of the sort suggested here is a step in a \npositive way in terms of setting our priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I end by saying that I agree what we \nshould do is have help in the States on ways to change behavior such \nthat we no longer have out-of-wedlock births.\n  I am afraid what this will do which States are good at, that is, in \nfact, very innovative in the ability to fiddle with statistics and \nrecords and gain billions of dollars. That, the States have always been \nvery, very good at.\n                           Amendment No. 2625\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Children's \nFair Share Amendment, which has been offered by my friend and colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Graham.\n  As we debate ways to reform our welfare system, we should constantly \nremind ourselves that what we have before us is more than just words \nand rhetoric, more than just political points to score, more than just \nsound bites for the next town meeting. What we have before us in \nreality, Mr. President, is the quality of life of the children who live \nin poverty in United States of America.\n  These children did not make any mistakes, Mr. President. They did not \nlose a job or miss a house payment or have their marriage crumble \naround them. By and large, they do not have the capacity to fix the \neconomic problems their families struggle with each day--even if they \nwanted to and tried.\n  They were just born poor--or their families became poor. And they are \nour future, Mr. President.\n  This amendment is a valuable addition to this debate because it is \nbased on a simple premise which I believe is fair and unassailable. It \ntakes the money we have decided as a nation to spend on poverty \nprograms and it allocates that money to our fifty states based on where \npoor children actually live.\n  The only variations from this premise is the inclusion of a small \nstate minimum allocation, and the inclusion of a 50-percent annual \ntransition period.\n  Otherwise, our Federal dollars go to where poor children live. \nFunding allocations are updated annually and based on census data \nreflecting the 3 previous years numbers of children living in poverty.\n  Mr. President, without this amendment, block grants are frozen in the \nunderlying bill at fiscal year 1994 funding levels. While this \nadvantages high benefit, low growth States, it severely disadvantages \nlow-benefit, high-growth States, like Virginia. I am extremely \nconcerned that the supplemental funding included in the bill, while \nhelpful, will simply not be enough to enable my fast-growing State to \nresponsibly meet the needs of our most vulnerable children.\n  I served as Governor of Virginia, between January, l982 and January \nl986. \n\n[[Page S 13537]]\n During that time, the Commonwealth increased its AFDC benefit twice--\nonce in l984 and once in l985--and it has not increased its AFDC \nbenefit since. Between l970 and l994, Virginia's AFDC benefit lost 58 \npercent in value when adjusted for inflation.\n  To me, locking in enormous funding disparities between States is bad \npublic policy. It disadvantages poor children in many States, Mr. \nPresident, children who deserve a better quality of life, children who \nshould expect to receive one from this Congress.\n  Mr. President, we can argue welfare reform on ideological grounds. We \ncan argue over how much money we should spend. But Mr. President, when \nwe argue about where that money should go, that is an easy one. It \nshould go to the children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe proposed fair share amendment to change the amount of Federal funds \nStates receive for welfare reform.\n  I cannot stand here today and vote for a formula that will penalize \nmy State of Maryland in order to reward other States that have been \nunwilling to help themselves over the past decades.\n  Our current welfare system says to States that if you are a poor \nstate, we will give you more Federal dollars. We do this through a \nFederal match. Some States are told that for every dollar you spend, we \nwill give you a dollar. That is what Maryland is told. Other poorer \nStates are told that for every dollar you spend, we will give you two. \nThat may seem unfair, but we have done that because we know some States \nare less well off. Even under this system, States must still decide \njust how much they want to spend. Some States, including Maryland, I am \nproud to say, have placed a high priority on ending poverty.\n  The amendment before us will take all the Federal dollars we \ncurrently spend and give more to States that have a history of little \ncommitment to welfare reform. We do that by taking from States that \nhave made a great effort at ending poverty. This is not an approach \nthat will create welfare reform. Instead we will force States to fight \neach other for limited resources.\n  Mr. President, changing the funding formula in a bad bill is a lot \nlike moving around the furniture on the deck of the Titanic. We need to \ndo more then that. We need real welfare reform. One step in that \ndirection is to vote this amendment down.\n    COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTICIPATION UNDER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the original Workforce Development Act \nprovisions contained in the bill before us made dramatic changes to the \nFederal role in job training and vocational education. Initially, I had \nsome serious concerns about the insufficient attention that the bill \npaid to the importance that community colleges play in the delivery of \nthose services. I had two major concerns. First, that representatives \nfrom community colleges should actively participate in the development \nof the work force education plan. Second, I submitted that the head of \nthe State's community college system should be included as a member of \nthe collaborative process that the Governor must work with while \nwriting the State strategic plan.\n  Mr. President, today I am pleased to say that due to the cooperation \nand collaborative efforts of my colleagues on the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources, those concerns have been addressed.\n  Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with Senator \nKassebaum to clarify the modifications to the work force training \nprovisions of the bill.\n  Mr. President, community colleges are one of the major providers of \nadult job training and postsecondary vocational education in this \ncountry. These institutions have close and positive relationships with \nsecondary schools, elected officials, and local business and industry \nleaders. There are over 1,200 of these institutions, located in every \ncorner of each of our States including over 30 from my home State of \nMichigan. As you know, these institutions are extremely concerned about \ntheir ability to continue to provide high quality education and \ntraining services that will be beneficial to the community, in light of \nthe consolidated work force system created by the bill reported out of \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n  With this in mind, I would like to get a clarification of the role \nthat community colleges will play in the new job training system. I \nwould like to ask my distinguished colleague from Kansas, the chair of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, what role \ndo you envision for these institutions in the new job training system?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. This legislation is clearly intended to provide \nFederal financial support for the education and training of all \nsegments of the work force in each State. The bill provides States the \nflexibility to set up structures that best serve their citizens and I \nexpect that States will continue to use the community college as a \nprimary resource, due to their past successes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe that postsecondary vocational education is a \nvery important aspect for economic growth in our society. Postsecondary \nvocational programs allow an individual to build on the education he or \nshe received in high school, provide higher level skills, and equip the \nindividual with a foundation for promoting a more constructive future. \nBecause of the advancements of technology, community colleges are a \nnecessary force for training and retraining individuals who could \nbecome displaced workers. In Michigan, community colleges are the major \neducators for high-skilled, high-waged workers. The average annual \nearnings for an individual with an associate degree is over $5,000 a \nyear higher than that for someone with only a high school diploma.\n  Because of the importance of postsecondary vocational education, I \nmust ask if this bill will alter the course of postsecondary education? \nAnd, if so, how will this bill affect postsecondary vocation education?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. This legislation consolidates programs that have \nprovided support for both secondary and post secondary educational \nprograms. The legislation is designed to expand, improve, and modernize \nquality vocational education at both the secondary and postsecondary \nlevels. As in current law, however, States will remain free to choose \nthe percentage of funds they will allocate to secondary and \npostsecondary vocational education.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The State planning process for the overall strategic plan \nand the State education plan will guide the State's work force \ndevelopment policy. The major stakeholders should have input into this \nprocess. Because of the strong involvement that community colleges have \nhad across the country in providing education and training, community \ncolleges should play a pivotal role in the development of the State \nwork force plan. Is there a role for the community college system in \nthis regard?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The State work force education plan is to be \ndeveloped by the elementary and secondary agency of the State. That \nagency must collaborate with the postsecondary agency of the State, \nincluding community colleges. I expect this to be meaningful \ncollaboration, leading to appropriate support for secondary and \npostsecondary education programs in the State. In addition, State \nofficials responsible for postsecondary education and community \ncolleges are members of the collaborative process the Governor must \nwork with on the State strategic plan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleague from Kansas for her support and \nattention to this matter.\n                 Welfare Reform, Let us Tread Carefully\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today, as I stand here in the U.S. \nSenate, the winds of change swirl around the dome of the Capitol, and \nsurround the body of the House and the Senate. Do not let the winds of \nchange, however, cloud our judgment and prevent us from carrying out \nour duty to protect life and liberty.\n  The Republican call to harness these winds of change is refreshing. I \nagree that there are many issues which need to be addressed. There is a \nvicious cycle of impoverished parents who raise children in poverty. \nThose children who do not have adequate access to quality education, \nwhich would break the cycle of dependency, continue to spin a wheel of \npoverty, and \n\n[[Page S 13538]]\nlanguishing there for the remainder of their lives.\n  In fiscal year 1994, there were over 5 million families on aid to \nfamilies with dependent children (AFDC), over 14 million individuals. I \nask you how many of those do you surmise were children; 9.5 million \nchildren were on AFDC in fiscal year 1994. Two-thirds, two-thirds were \nchildren, a truly disturbing number. You will hear these numbers again \nand again as we debate welfare reform. I reference these figures to \nimpress upon your conscience that we are dealing with individual people \nand not numbers. We must understand the links of poverty in order to \nunderstand and break the chains of poverty. According to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, you are below the poverty line when income falls below \nthree times the cost of an inexpensive, yet nutritionally adequate food \nbudget for a nonfarm family. For a family of three in 1994 the figure \nwas $12,320. How many of us could provide decent clothing, food and \nshelter for ourself and two children for $12,320?\n  We need welfare reform, but we first need to address the root \nproblems of poverty; lack of education, lack of affordable and adequate \nchild care, and access to upward social and economic mobility and \nstability. A successful society allows its citizens the opportunity to \neducate themselves, to increase their opportunities and knowledge. It \nis of no benefit to society to remove welfare recipients and place them \ninto jobs with no upward mobility. Without the prospects of advancement \nthey can only maintain the status quo at best and as history has taught \nus the cycle possesses a powerful habituation to welfare.\n  We need to find good jobs for able bodied people in our society. Yes, \nthe United States can assist its poor and offer them a helping hand, \nbut we cannot continue our present pace of entitlement spending. To \nbecome competitive with the world market we must educate all in our \nsociety. There needs to be interaction between the States and the \nFederal Government to work in a complementary partnership to solve \nthese problems. Packaging our problems in a nice box and ribbon and \npassing them onto the States with no accountability and no direction \nwill not make them disappear.\n  Over these past years in Oregon, the Governor's office, county \ncommissioners, and the Oregon Workforce Quality Council are just a few \nof the many people who have worked together to enact job training \nlegislation in Oregon, which has been one of the most successful States \nin the Nation in moving people from welfare dependency to work. Oregon \nhas chosen to link public assistance functions with welfare-to-work \nservices, providing a seamless link amongst the differing human \nresource agencies. Oregon has made landmark progress with the \nintegration of education, employment and training programs, but the \nFederal Government also must be a part of restructuring the system. \nThat is why I am pleased to see that my Workflex Partnership \nDemonstration project has been included in the underlying Dole \namendment. This demonstration project allows the Secretaries of \nEducation and Labor to designate up to 6 States in which Federal \nauthority will actually be transferred to the State so that the States \nmay make waivers of Federal law in the job training and education \narena. Given the decline in discretionary dollars in the budget, State \nand local flexibility which promotes performance over paperwork is an \nintegral ingredient for success. Mr. President, we are making progress \nin Oregon and I do not wish to be set back in our efforts.\n  What about the States which are not as progressive as Oregon? How do \nwe ensure they care for their poor? I agree with the underlying \nperformance measures in the Dole amendment which sets Federal standards \nin the form of performance-based outcomes and provides States guidance \nnot mandates. This will provide an incentive to States to be innovative \nin their State programs by rewarding them with a performance bonus. \nThere are those who argue that it is perverse to reward those States \nwhich reduce the number of people on their welfare roles, but I think \nit just as perverse to reward those States who do nothing to reduce \ntheir welfare roles. In all areas, our Federal system penalizes States \nthat are progressive and reduces them to the standards of the lowest \ncommon denominator. Our citizens expect better, they deserve better.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that I am committed to working \nwith all interested parties in reforming our welfare system. I believe \nthose that can work should work. As chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee I have directly experienced the struggle we face to allocate \nfunds for our complex array of domestic programs. This discretionary \nfunding pays for the operation of all three branches of the Government. \nIt pays for the roads and bridges of our transportation infrastructure, \nthe loans that go to provide public housing, student loan assistance \nand small business assistance, our national parks, and many more \npurposes which have nearly universal support. These funds have been \ndrastically diminishing over the years, while the entitlement programs \nhave grown. These entitlement programs put further pressure on the \nAppropriations Committee to make difficult funding decisions. While \nentitlement programs continue to grow, less and less will be available \nfor discretionary programs.\n  Our commitment to bettering the standard of living for those in \npoverty must not waiver. The Federal Government should encourage not \nimpede innovation and creativity in the States and private sector. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to fashion a bipartisan \nsolution that addresses these goals.\n                           Amendment No. 2488\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, unfortunately, because of a lack of \ntime yesterday, I was unable to give my entire statement regarding \nSenator Breaux's partnership amendment. I feel strongly on this issue \nand would like to have my entire statement on the importance of \nmaintenance of effort submitted for the record. I know that earlier \ntoday, a modification was accepted on this issue. While I strongly \npreferred adoption of the Breaux amendment, I am glad to see some, \nmeaningful progress on this key point.\n  Anyone who argues for welfare reform talks a lot about \nresponsibility. This Senator does, too. Welfare should not be a hand-\nout for people in search of a free lunch and a way to avoid work. \nWelfare reform should change the rules to turn government help into \nsomething that steps in for just as long as it takes to get a job or \nback into the workforce.\n  But welfare is also about the responsibility of states and the \nFederal Government to be honest partners. States and the Federal \nGovernment have always shared the responsibility for the poorest \nfamilies and children who exist everywhere in America. Unfortunately, \nthe bill before the Senate is an invitation to States to back out of \ntheir end of that responsibility. When that happens, when States are \nreleased from their financial role in welfare, some tragic results may \nbe in sight.\n  One reason debating welfare reform is so frustrating is that we find \nourselves immersed in terms and language that do not exactly roll off \nthe tongue. It is also a topic where it is far too tempting to simplify \nlife, and attempt to divide the country between good people and bad \npeople. But we all know that is not how life works. And we should know \nand acknowledge on this Senate floor that a welfare reform bill should \ndeal honestly with the realities of America--not just the stereotypes \nor the examples that do offend all of us.\n  I say that because this amendment raises an issue that does not leap \ninto a sound-bite. It tries to preserve a concept called ``maintenance \nof effort'' that is clumsy in wording but very clear when it comes to \nresponsibility for welfare's future. The purpose of this amendment is \nto continue a genuine division of labor among the states and the \nFederal Government for poor families and children. It tries to prevent \nan abdication by State governments from their role in keeping a safety \nnet under children and deserving parents.\n  A welfare reform bill should free up states from needless bureaucracy \nand micro managing, no question about it. But welfare reform should not \negg on states to back out of their commitment to their poor families \nand children. This amendment is the answer. It very clearly says to \nstates, ``you keep your end of the bargain, and the Federal Government \nwill keep its end.'' \n\n[[Page S 13539]]\n\n  As a former Governor, I sincerely doubt that the Governors who might \nlike the welfare bill before us just the way it is--- which frees them \nfrom the obligation they have always had--would ever propose the same \ndeal when they help communities in their States. Matching requirements, \ncost-sharing, burden-sharing, whatever you want to call it--this is a \nbasic part of making sure that responsibility is spread around for \ngovernment's functions.\n  The majority leader introduced some modifications to the Republican \nwelfare package just before the recess, and one involves the claim that \nhe added a ``maintenance-of-effort\" provision. It is very weak, too \nweak--we can and we must do better.\n  The majority leader's so-called compromise lasts for exactly 3 years, \nand asks States to put 75 percent of a portion of their AFDC spending \nin 1994 back into their future welfare reform system.\n  In fact, the Dole provision adds up to asking all states to invest \n$10 billion a year for just the first 3 years, with no basic matching \nrequirements whatsoever for the last 2 years on this bill. This leaves \na gaping hole in the state's share if compared to the current \narrangement across the country. The result could be that $30 billion \ndisappears from the safety net for families and children.\n  What is worse is the cleverness attempted in how a state's share is \ncalculated. The Dole bill would allow states to ``count'' State \nspending on a whole bunch of programs simply mentioned in this bill--\nstates would be able to get credit essentially for their spending on \nfood stamps, SSI, and other programs that help low-income people toward \nmeeting the requirement; that means that money for programs not \nspecifically directed to financing basic welfare for children could \neasily count towards the so-called ``maintenance of effort.'' Again, \nthis is an invitation to States to back out of keeping up their basic, \nhistorical responsibility for children.\n  Remember, it is the children who are two out of every three people \nwho get basic welfare. It will be the children who will be hurt when \nstates back out of their spending on welfare because Congress passed a \nbill that invites them to do just that.\n  Our amendment does not ask States to raise a penny more for welfare. \nFederal-state partnerships and matching arrangements are common sense--\nthey promote accountability, and they are used to finance Medicaid, \nhighways, clean water efforts, and education programs. And on this \ntopic of welfare, here is a bill that now says Uncle Sam will write the \nbillion dollar checks, but Governors can write all rules. If that means \nbacking out of the States' responsibility for poor families and \nchildren, be our guest.\n  Right now, State revenues represent about 45 percent of the resources \nspent in America on welfare. If the Federal Government is about to send \nalmost $17 billion a year to States in a block grant with tremendous \nflexibility, we should ask States to contribute their fair share. This \nis the way to promote fiscal accountability and responsibility.\n  Mr. President, we should simply correct this part of the bill with \nthe Breaux amendment--an amendment that requires States to maintain \ntheir historical responsibility for millions of children and families.\n  The stakes are high and serious. We know that when children are \nabandoned, the future of the rest of America is dimmed.\n  In other words, there are real consequences to rejecting this \namendment. Without States maintaining this investment, there will not \nbe enough money--not nearly enough--for child care for parents to move \nto work or for the job placement and training that some parents need to \nget into real jobs. A few years from now, we will be on this floor \nwondering how a bill packaged with such bold promises of change and \nreform resulted in so little--and perhaps we will be here trying to \nrepair the damage of backing the country out of an honest, direct \ncommitment to children.\n  The Breaux amendment calls for the preservation of a solid, honest \nFederal-State partnership for the long-term. We must change the welfare \nsystem and the rules. We are all ready to be tougher about who gets \nwelfare. That means giving States much greater flexibility. But it is \nirresponsible to send checks to states accompanied with an invitation \nto back out of their own commitment to families and children.\n  Personally, I believe that taxpayers are willing to help feed and \nshelter the children who are not the ones to blame for their parents' \nunemployment or poverty. Surveys even show that 71 percent of Americans \nbelieve needy families should get benefits as long as they work. Time \nand time again, it is clear that work and responsibility are what the \npublic cares about. They are not asking us to solve problems with \nslogans and gimmicks.\n  Real reform is what we should deliver. Let us be serious about \nwelfare reform, let us be honest, and let us deal in the real world of \nAmerica. We should make some necessary changes to the Dole bill to \nensure that every parent who can work, does. We should keep needy \nchildren in our hearts, and keep compassion for them in this bill. And \nwe should preserve the basic idea that states must do their part.\n  This should be a bipartisan amendment, and it deserves support. This \nis exactly when and where the political rhetoric should be put aside, \nand where the bill should be changed to continue into the future a true \npartnership between states and the Federal Government that will help \ndetermine what kind of country we will be.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13524-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now soaring \ntoward $5 trillion, has been fueled for a generation now by \nbureaucratic hot air--and it is sort of like the weather--everybody \ntalks about it but almost nobody did much about it until immediately \nafter the elections in November 1994.\n  But when the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but one of the 54 \nRepublicans supported the balanced budget amendment--that was the good \nnews.\n  The bad news was that only 13 Democrats supported it--which killed \nhopes for a balanced budget amendment for the time being. Since a two-\nthirds vote--67 Senators, if all Senator's are present--is necessary to \napprove a constitutional amendment, the proposed Senate amendment \nfailed by one vote. There will be another vote either this year or in \n1996.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Tuesday, September 12, the federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,964,465,905,748.40 or $18,845.20 \nfor every man, woman, and child on a per capita basis.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13539-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13539-S13540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this year, Congress \noverwhelmingly passed the Congressional Accountability Act which was \nsigned into law by the President. The purpose of the act was to clarify \nthat we cannot pass laws applying to the private sector that do not \napply to us as well.\n  After many years of pursuing this legislative initiative, I was \npleased with the final outcome of the act.\n  A concern has been raised that the welfare bill before us today is \nnot clear on the issue of congressional coverage.\n  If the leader would indulge me, I would like to enter into a colloquy \naddressing this concern.\n  Mr. Leader, is it the intent of the legislation in section 453(a) of \ntitle 9, the child support enforcement title of the bill, to include \nSenators and Congressmen in the definition of ``any governmental \nentity''?\n  Mr. DOLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Are committees of the House of Representatives, the \nSenate, and joint committees included in \n\n[[Page S 13540]]\nthe definition of ``any governmental entity''?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes, that is the intent.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Yes. The intent of the term ``any governmental entity'' is \nto cover every level of government--in effect, Federal State, or local \ngovernment; and, to cover every branch of government--in effect, \nexecutive, legislative, judicial, or administrative.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to authorize \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide supplemental crop disaster \nassistance under certain circumstances, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n          THE FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE ACT AMENDMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, over the last 2 months cotton \ncrops in many counties in Mississippi have suffered severe damage due \nto unusually high insect infestations. It is estimated that over \n160,000 acres of cotton have been damaged amounting to a loss of over \n$100 million. This devastation has not only struck Mississippi, but \nTexas, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Georgia as well. Early \nestimates provided by the National Cotton Council, State extension \nservices, and State departments of agriculture show approximately 1.6 \nmillion acres affected all together with over $700 million losses to \nfarmers.\n  Cotton farmers have spent large amounts of money trying to control \nthese infestations. Many in my State will not even harvest their crops \nbecause of the extensive damage. Many will have crop yields so low that \nthey will not even be able to recover their production costs.\n\n[[Page S 13541]]\n\n  Farmers have catastrophic crop insurance coverage which was mandated \nin the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1994 as a requirement for \nparticipation in the cotton program. However, the damages from this \ndisaster will far exceed this coverage.\n  I am introducing legislation which authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture to provide supplemental crop disaster assistance in \naddition to benefits provided in the Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, \nif the Secretary determines that an extraordinary disaster situation \nexists.\n  The Government's Catastrophic Crop Insurance program is not \nsufficient to help the farmers in the situation they are to recover and \nstay in business. More must be done.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bryan, \n        Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Bumpers, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Simpson, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1236. A bill to establish a commission to advise the President on \nproposals for national commemorate events; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 the national commemorative events act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National \nCommemorative Events Advisory Act, the purpose of which is to create a \nPresidential advisory commission tasked with reviewing the merit of \nproposed commemorative observances.\n  Mr. President, we simply must find an alternative way to review and \nlimit the hundreds of congressionally sponsored commemorative \nresolutions. These resolutions are intended to honor worthy causes by \nsetting aside a particular day, week, month, or year as a time of \nspecial recognition. In principle, this is a noble idea. But, \nregrettably, in recent years our zeal for commemoratives has gotten \nentirely out of hand.\n  During the 95th Congress, we had 57 commemoratives. In the 99th \nCongress, a high-water mark was reached when 275 commemoratives were \npassed. In the 100th, 101st, 102d, and 103d Congresses, the totals fell \nslightly. However, it is shocking to note that during each of these \nfour Congresses, commemoratives accounted for over 30 percent of all \npublic laws passed by Congress.\n  There is a very tangible cost to this excess, beginning with the fact \nthat the laborious process of enlisting cosponsors and passing \ncommemorative bills have become a major drain on our time as well as on \nthe time of our staffs. There is also a cost in trivializing the whole \nidea of commemorative observances. We have all noticed a kind of \nGresham's law at work, with the proliferation of bad commemoratives \ndriving out of circulation the truly worthy commemoratives.\n  To put it bluntly, Mr. President, this bill is designed to save us \nfrom ourselves--to save us from good intentions run amok. The bill \nwould create a President's Advisory Commission on National \nCommemorative Events, which would have the task of conducting an \nindependent merit review of commemorative proposals. Congress would no \nlonger pass commemorative resolutions. Instead, the proposed advisory \ncommission would be charged with the sole function of reviewing \nproposals for national commemorative events making positive or negative \nrecommendations to the President.\n  This Presidential advisory commission is an idea whose time has come. \nIt would streamline the process of considering proposals, while saving \nthe Congress considerable time and resources. In addition, it would \nprovide for a fair and impartial review of the hundreds of \ncommemorative proposals submitted by a large and growing number of \nconstituent groups.\n  There are a number of differing projections comparing the relative \ncosts of passing commemorative through Congress and through an \nindependent commission. To be accurate, these calculations need to take \nfull account of the staff time now devoted to handling commemoratives \nin Congress.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware that commemoratives are both a curse \nand a blessing for Members of Congress. They are enormously time \nconsuming. However, they are also perceived as an important vehicle for \nwinning the favor of worthy causes and special interests.\n  I myself sponsored an amendment to the 1994 crime bill to designate \nMay 1, 1995, as Law Day, U.S.A., to honor our Nation's law enforcement \nprofessionals. However, I am confident of the merit of this Law Day \ncommemorative and would be happy to subject it to independent review by \nthe proposed advisory commission.\n  Mr. President, I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting \nthis bill. We can best honor all our constituents not by passing \ncommemorative after commemorative, but by applying ourselves to \nsubstantive legislation that will make a real difference in our \nconstituent's lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Commemorative \n     Events Advisory Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the preparation and consideration of the multitude of \n     bills proposing particular days, weeks, months, or years for \n     recognition through Presidential proclamation unduly burdens \n     the Congress and consumes an inordinate amount of time;\n       (2) such proposals could be more efficiently considered by \n     a commission whose sole function would be to review proposals \n     for national commemorative events and to make positive or \n     negative recommendations thereon to the President;\n       (3) such a commission would streamline the process by which \n     such proposals are currently considered and save the Congress \n     considerable time and resources which could be devoted to \n     matters of more pressing national concern; and\n       (4) such a commission would better ensure the impartial \n     review of proposals for national commemorative events \n     generated by a wide variety of constituent groups.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend certain provisions of law relating to child \npornography, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the child pornography prevention act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is impossible for any decent American \nnot to be outraged by child pornography and the sexual exploitation of \nchildren. Such material is a plague upon our people and the moral \nfabric of this great Nation.\n  And, as a great Nation, I believe that we have both the \nconstitutional right and moral obligation to protect our children from \nthose who, motivated by profit or perversion or both, would abuse, \nexploit, and degrade the weakest and most vulnerable members of our \nsociety.\n  Current Federal law dealing with child pornography reflects the \noverwhelming bipartisan consensus which has always existed, both in \nCongress and in the country, that there is no place for such filth even \nin a free society and that those who produce or peddle this \nreprehensible material must be made to feel the full weight of the law \nand suffer a punishment reflective of the seriousness of their offense.\n  As with many of our criminal statutes, however, effective enforcement \nof our laws against child pornography today faces a new obstacle: The \ncriminal use, or misuse, of new technology which is outside the scope \nof existing statutes. In order to close this computer-generated \nloophole and to give our law enforcement authorities the tools they \nneed to stem the increasing flow of high-tech child pornography, I am \ntoday introducing the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1995.\n  The necessity for prompt legislative action amending our existing \nFederal child pornography statutes to cover the use of computer \ntechnology in the production of such material was vividly illustrated \nby a recent story in the Washington Times. This story, dated July 23, \n1995, reported the conviction in Canada of a child pornographer who \ncopied innocuous pictures of children from books and catalogs onto a \ncomputer, altered the images to remove the childrens' clothing, and \nthen arranged the children into sexual positions. According to Canadian \npolice, these sexual scenes involved not only adults and children, but \nalso animals.\n  Even more shocking than the occurrence of this type of repulsive \nconduct is the fact that, under current Federal law, those pictures, \ndepicting naked children involved in sex with other children, adults, \nand even animals, would not be prosecutable as child pornography. That \nis because current Federal child pornography and sexual exploitation of \nchildren laws, United States Code title 18, sections 2251, 2251A, and \n2252, cover only visual depictions of children engaging in sexually \nexplicit conduct whose production involved the use of a minor engaging \nin such conduct; materials such as photographs, films, and videotapes.\n  Today, however, visual depictions of children engaging in any \nimaginable forms of sexual conduct can be produced entirely by \ncomputer, without using children, thereby placing such depictions \noutside the scope of Federal law. Computers can also be used to alter \nsexually explicit\n photographs, films, and videos in such a way as to make it virtually \nimpossible for prosecutors to identify individuals, or to prove that \nthe offending material was produced using children.\n\n  The problem is simple: While Federal law has failed to keep pace with \ntechnology, the purveyors of child pornography have been right on line \nwith it. This bill will help to correct that problem.\n  The Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1995, which includes a \nstatement of congressional findings as to harm, both to children and \nadults, resulting from child pornography, has three major provisions. \nFirst, it would amend United States Code title 18, section 2256, to \nestablish, for the first time, a specific, comprehensive, Federal \nstatutory definition of child pornography. Under this bill, any visual \ndepiction, such as a photograph, film, videotape or computer image, \nwhich is produced by any means, including electronically by computer, \nof sexually explicit conduct will be classified as child pornography \nif: (a) its production involved the use of a minor engaging in sexually \nexplicit conduct; or (b) it depicts, or appears to depict, a minor \nengaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (c) it is promoted or \nadvertised as depicting a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\n  Second, this bill amends the existing statutory definition of \nsexually explicit conduct contained at section 2256 to include the \nlascivious exhibition of the buttocks of any minor or the breast of any \nfemale minor.\n  Finally, this bill would protect the Federal Government, State and \nlocal governments, and State and local law enforcement officials, from \nthe threat of civil lawsuits and the awarding of damages as the result \nof searches and seizures made in connection with child pornography \ninvestigations or prosecutions.\n  Current Federal law, United States Code title 42, section 2000aa, \nincludes exceptions to the Privacy Protection Act allowing certain \nsearches and seizures, where the offense consists of the \n\n[[Page S 13543]]\nreceipt, possession, or communication of information pertaining to the \nnational defense, classified information or restricted data.\n  This bill would extend that exception to offenses involving the \nproduction, possession, sale or distribution of child pornography, the \nsexual exploitation of children, or the sale or purchase of children, \nactivities which enjoy absolutely no first amendment protection.\n  Because there have already been several bills or amendments \nintroduced during this session of Congress pertaining to computer \ntelecommunications and the transmission on the Internet of obscene or \nindecent material, which have been the subject of extensive and on-\ngoing comment and debate both here in the Senate and in the country at \nlarge, let me emphasize that the bill I am introducing today is not a \ntelecommunications bill and does not propose new or expanded \nrestrictions or regulations with respect to the Information \nSuperhighway.\n  Child pornography is a particularly pernicious evil, something that \nno civilized society can or should tolerate. It poisons the minds and \nspirits of our youth. It permanently records the victim's degradation \nand abuse, and can haunt those children for years to come. It fuels the \ngrowth of organized crime. It encourages the activities of pedophiles \nand can be used to seduce even more young victims. Congress can and \nshould act, promptly and decisively, to close any loophole in statutes \ndesigned to protect our children from the kind of threat and harm posed \nby child pornography.\n  I strongly urge the Senate to promptly pass the Child Pornography \nPrevention Act of 1995.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Pornography Prevention \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the use of children in the production of sexually \n     explicit material, including photographs, films, videos, \n     computer images, and other visual depictions, is a form of \n     sexual abuse which can result in physical or psychological \n     harm, or both, to the children involved;\n       (2) child pornography permanently records the victim's \n     abuse, and its continued existence causes the child victims \n     of sexual abuse continuing harm by haunting those children in \n     future years;\n       (3) child pornography is often used as part of a method of \n     seducing other children into sexual activity; a child who is \n     reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to \n     pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be \n     convinced by viewing depictions of other children ``having \n     fun'' participating in such activity;\n       (4) prohibiting the possession and viewing of child \n     pornography encourages the possessors of such material to \n     destroy them, thereby helping to protect the victims of child \n     pornography and to eliminate the market for the sexually \n     exploitative use of children; and\n       (5) the elimination of child pornography and the protection \n     of children from sexual exploitation provide a compelling \n     governmental interest for prohibiting the production, \n     distribution, possession, or viewing of child pornography.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 2256 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)(E), by inserting before the semicolon \n     the following: ``, or the buttocks of any minor, or the \n     breast of any female minor'';\n       (2) in paragraph (5), by inserting before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, and data stored on computer disk or by \n     electronic means which is capable of conversion into a visual \n     image'';\n       (3) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and'';\n       (4) in paragraph (7), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (5) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(8) `child pornography' means any visual depiction, \n     including any photograph, film, video, picture, drawing, or \n     computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made \n     or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of \n     sexually explicit conduct, where--\n       ``(A) the production of such visual depiction involves the \n     use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;\n       ``(B) such visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a \n     minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or\n       ``(C) such visual depiction is advertised, promoted, \n     presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that \n     conveys the impression that the material is or contains a \n     visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit \n     conduct.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, with respect \nto the regulation of interstate transportation by common carriers \nengaged in civil aviation, and for other purposes; to the \n\n[[Page S 13544]]\nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n THE AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nFord, to introduce legislation that will streamline the Federal \nAviation Administration in a comprehensive and responsible manner. This \nbill was developed to ensure that in this era of fiscal accountability, \nthe FAA can continue to operate the safest air traffic control system \nin the world. Our work on this bill began with the premise that \naviation safety was no place for partisan conflict or for gamesmanship \nbetween the legislative and executive branches. We worked to craft a \nbipartisan solution that brings together the views and experience of \nall the parties engaged in aviation safety. We also sought a \npartnership with the administration to get the job done.\n  Currently, one of the most challenging tasks for those of us in \nCongress who want to balance the budget is to find innovative and \nworkable solutions to ensure that essential Government services not \nonly continue, but are performed even better. Federal regulation of \nairline safety is one such service that virtually everyone agrees must \ncontinue and, in fact, should undergo major modernization. Indeed, \nafter several major air traffic computer systems failed this summer, \nthe traveling public is right to be concerned about what the Government \nintends to do about the problem. Traditionally, the Government's \nresponse would have been to pour more tax money into the FAA's budget. \nUnder the new budget resolution, however, that will not be possible. \nMore importantly, the truth is that simply spending money does not \nguarantee improvements anyway.\n  For those of responsible for the oversight of aviation safety, the \nfocus in the FAA reform debate is now how we can actually improve \nairline safety at the same time that the amount of tax dollars spent on \nthe FAA is cut back. We believe that the legislation being introduced \ntoday, by making major reforms at the FAA and changing the way the \nagency is financed, can accomplish this goal. In addition, this bill \nenables us and the agency to create incentives to reduce or eliminate \ncurrent operational inefficiencies that cost airlines and their \npassengers billions each year.\n  Specifically, our proposed legislation will take the FAA as far as \npossible out of the political environment and provide it with a clear \ndirection and stable source of funding. It will free this essential \nagency from many restrictive regulations and requirements, particularly \nin the areas of procurement and personnel. Most significantly, however, \nit will compel the FAA to become an organization that is far more \nresponsive to the needs of those who use the air traffic control \nsystem--air carriers, general aviation, and the traveling public.\n It is designed to provide the kind of direction and incentives that \nwill result in a safer and far more efficient air transportation \nsystem.\n\n  As the FAA reform debate has intensified this year, the role of the \nFAA has come under intense scrutiny. Without question, the FAA has \nprovided the United States with the finest aviation safety system in \nthe world. However, this is an agency that has major flaws. It has \nspent over $20 billion in the last decade for a modernization program \nthat is way over budget and has never lived up to its promise. \nMoreover, the operational inefficiencies resulting from the failure of \nthe modernization program are measured in billions of dollars annually.\n  Some have suggested that the FAA's problems could be solved simply by \nprocurement reform--in other words, by giving the agency the ability to \ncut redtape in buying equipment. Although we acknowledge that \nprocurement reform is important, even essential, that alone does not do \nenough. Without changing the basic mission and structure of the \norganization, procurement reform would merely be a way of allowing an \nagency to make bad purchasing decisions even faster. Our proposed \nlegislation reflects an understanding that we had to do more than \nprocurement and personnel reform to resolve the FAA's problems. Our \nbill recognizes that the legislative and budget constraints under which \nthe FAA works are simply too restrictive to make the fundamental \nchanges necessary.\n  It has been particularly distressing to see that because of these \nconstraints, the FAA has been unable to keep up with the dynamic \ntechnical and economic changes taking place in the airline industry. \nThat, in turn, highlights the fact that there is a disconnect between \nthose who fund the system and those who operate it. Over 70 percent of \nthe FAA budget comes from the industry using the system, mostly through \na 10-percent tax on airline tickets. In the future, the only way to \nsave tax dollars will be to require that users pay an even greater \npercentage. Yet, under the current system, there is little incentive \nfor the FAA to develop systems that will result in operational \nefficiencies. That is because there is no relationship between the way \nthe money comes in and the way it is being spent. Our legislation is \nthe only bill that attempts to remedy this fundamental deficiency.\n  Under our bill, the FAA would be required to design a new fee system \nbased upon the use of the system by airlines and others, instead of the \nprice of an airline ticket. In this way, system users would have a \ngreater stake in a safe and efficient air traffic control system, and \nthe FAA, in turn, would have a greater stake in making sure that it \nunderstands the industry it regulates. Those who use the FAA's services \nwill pay more user fees to support the FAA in the future. That is a \nfact of life under the budget resolution. But, if our legislation is \nenacted, we are convinced that the operational efficiencies realized by \nthe users will more than offest the additional expenses. And, for the \nfirst time, the fees will be directly applied to the services provided.\n  In no case will safety be given a lower priority. In fact, there will \nbe an explicit link between safety and productivity. Since nothing in \nthis legislation will change the current FAA goal of zero accidents, \nthe only way that productivity and capacity will increase under the new \nsystem is if safety margins improve even more than they are today. We \nwant the users of the system to have as great a stake in assuring the \nhighest Federal safety standards as possible. That is precisely what \nthis bill will do. It will create a public/private partnership that \nwill link safety and productivity to ensure that both improve.\n  This bill comes at a critical time for the FAA. We are confident that \nwe are on the right track by having de-politicized the issue and having \nsought the most impartial and skilled advice in putting it together. It \nis our intent to see this bill enacted into law, and then commit \nourselves to intense oversight to be sure that it is implemented in a \nway that places safety at the forefront, turns the FAA into a more \nmodern and responsive agency, improves the performance of the air \ntraffic control system, and saves money for American taxpayers.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today the Senate begins the debate on \nmeaningful reform of the Federal Aviation Administration. With the \nintroduction of the Air Traffic Management System Performance \nImprovement Act of 1995, we have fashioned a bipartisan approach with \nthe administration on how to achieve the long term goal of maintaining \nthe world's safest air transportation system. We could use a lot more \nbipartisan approaches to problems. The aviation industry is no \ndifferent than the general public--they want rational solutions to \ndifficult problems--not political cat fights.\n  I began to search for ways to reform the FAA many years ago and in \n1987, introduced S. 1600, a bill that would have made the FAA an \nindependent agency. However, the problems today are different than \nthose that prompted S. 1600. Today's problems are not about micro-\nmanagement and internal disputes. The issue today has two parts--money \nand efficiency.\n  The bill today addresses those issues in many ways. First it sets in \nmotion a series of new systems to fund the agency, new systems for its \npeople and programs. My goal is not to merely cover a funding problem, \nbut to use money to derive a better agency. As a result, the fee \nsystems that are to be set up will be difficult to design. No one wants \nto create discincentives. For example, in authorizing the FAA to \ncollect fees for certification work, I want to make sure the FAA \nfocuses its resources on what is needed. If the FAA chooses to merely \nuse the certification fees as a means to \n\n[[Page S 13545]]\nraise revenue, they may choose to function like lawyers and charge by \nthe hour, not by the product or value of the service. No one wants to \nencourage the FAA to run up bills for the sake of raising money. There \nis much work that needs to be done to assign fees. The industry, the \nFAA, the Department and the Committee need to continue to work out the \nbest way to accomplish our goal.\n  However, all parties must bear in mind that under the current set of \nassumptions, the FAA will need approximately $59 billion through 2002. \nHowever, under the budget resolution calls for only $47 billion. \nSomehow, we have got to recognize what this $12 billion gap means. To \nput it in perspective, it could mean the closure or elimination of many \nservices that are now provided. Like many situations, when we begin to \ndownsize, the smallest communities tend to bear the brunt of cuts. Air \ntraffic control towers at small airports, which are critical to the \neconomic development of our small communities, could be the first to \ngo. Flight service stations that handle general aviation traffic also \ncould be on the first list of closures. In addition, do any of us \nreally want to think of an air traffic control system with fewer \ncontrollers than we have today?\n  If current trends are correct, by the year 2002, we will have a 35-\npercent increase in passenger traffic, and an 18-percent increase in \noperations. Absent financial reform, the FAA will experience a 14-\npercent decline in funding. These statistics will mean only one thing--\nan FAA without an ability to meet its safety mission and without \nadequate funding to meet air traffic control demands.\n  Today, the Chicago center in Aurora experienced its second outage in \nrecent months. I know the National Transportation Safety Board is \nlooking into ATC problems now, but we must recognize that without the \nability to modernize, and quickly, problems like Chicago may reoccur.\n  With respect to the bill, it does not create a corporation, nor does \nit make the agency independent. Instead, the bill strikes a balance. \nRegulatory and budget issues will be coordinated between the Secretary \nand the Administrator. In other areas such as personnel and \nprocurement, the Administrator will have authority. These changes are \nimportant and will change how FAA manages its business. The goal, and \none we all share, is an FAA with the ability to act quickly, and be \nable to count on funding.\n  The bill today asks many segments of the industry for help in \nsupporting the FAA's mission. I do not ask airlines, manufacturers, and \nothers for their financial support lightly and I know that bill be \ncontroversial. But something has got to change.\n  I have a choice--I can look at the FAA, and the budget assumptions \nand do nothing, or I can work to make sure that the safety of the \ntraveling public is protected. After 21 years in Congress, having spent \nmany years as Aviation Subcommittee chairman and now ranking Democrat, \nI can tell you that we have got to act. The bottom line, unfortunately, \nis that the travelling public simply can not count on funding for the \nFAA under the drive to balance the budget.\n  To those that will object, we will continue to work with you on FAA \nreform. There is much we agree on, and a lot of work to be done. I also \nwant to point out that while the House bill differs from the bill we \nare introducing today, we share a common goal--a better FAA.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

Res. 171\n\n       Whereas the Bush Administration and the Clinton \n     Administration have both worked relentlessly to build on the \n     Middle East peace process that began in Madrid in October \n     1991, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive, lasting \n     peace between Israel and all its neighbors;\n       Whereas on September 13, 1993, the first major breakthrough \n     of the Madrid peace process was achieved when Israel and the \n     Palestinians signed the Declaration of Principles on Interim \n     Self-Government Arrangements on the White House lawn;\n       Whereas September 13, 1995 marks the second anniversary of \n     this important breakthrough;\n       Whereas the United States has pledged to support the \n     Israel-Palestinian Declaration of Principles through \n     diplomatic and political efforts, the provision of \n     assistance, and other means;\n       Whereas the May 4, 1994 Cairo Agreement between Israel and \n     the Palestinians resulted in the withdrawal of the Israeli \n     army from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and the \n     establishment of a Palestinian Authority with responsibility \n     for those areas;\n       Whereas Israel and the Palestinian Authority are continuing \n     negotiations on the redeployment of Israeli troops our of \n     Arab population centers in the West Bank, the expansion of \n     the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction into the areas \n     vacated by the Israeli army, and the convening of elections \n     for a Palestinian council;\n       Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles \n     helped pave the way for the October 25, 1994 signing of a \n     full peace treaty between Israel and Jordan, which \n     established full diplomatic relations and pledged to resolve \n     all future disputes by peaceful means;\n       Whereas the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty has resulted in \n     rapid normalization and unprecedented cooperation between the \n     two nations in security, economic development, the \n     environment, and other areas;\n       Whereas the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles \n     helped pave the way for Israel to establish low-level \n     diplomatic relations with Morocco and Tunisia, and to \n     initiate official contacts with Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain;\n       Whereas the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council \n     have announced their decision to end all enforcement of the \n     secondary and tertiary boycotts of Israel;\n       Whereas extremists opposed to the Middle East peace process \n     continue to use terrorism to undermine the chances of \n     achieving a comprehensive peace, including on August 21, \n     1995, when a suicide bomber blew up a bus in Jerusalem, \n     killing one American and four Israeli civilians;\n       Whereas the issue of security and preventing acts of \n     terrorism is and must remain of paramount importance in the \n     Israeli-Palestinian negotiations; and\n       Whereas compliance by the Palestine Liberation Organization \n     and the Palestinian Authority with all of their solemn \n     commitments is essential to the success of the peace process: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its support for the Israeli-Palestinian \n     Declaration of Principles on the second anniversary of its \n     historic signing;\n       (2) supports the efforts of Israel and the Palestinians to \n     conclude an agreement on implementation of the second phase \n     of the Declaration of Principles;\n       (3) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, all acts of \n     terrorism aimed at undermining the Israeli-Palestinian peace \n     negotiations and other tracks of the Middle East peace \n     process, and calls upon all parties to take all necessary \n     steps to prevent such acts;\n       (4) calls upon the Palestine Liberation Organization and \n     the Palestinian Authority to comply with all of their \n     commitments;\n       (5) welcomes the progress made toward peace between Israel \n     and its neighbors;\n       (6) commends those Middle Eastern leaders who have \n     committed to resolve their differences through only peaceful \n     means;\n       (7) reiterates its belief that a comprehensive, lasting \n     peace between Israel and its neighbors is in the national \n     interest of the United States;\n       (8) encourages all participants in the Middle East peace \n     process to continue working to achieve lasting peace \n     agreements while adhering fully to all commitments made and \n     agreements reached thus far;\n       (9) calls upon the Arab states to demonstrate their \n     commitment to peace by completely dismantling the Arab \n     boycott of Israel in its primary, secondary, and tertiary \n     aspects; and\n       (10) strongly supports the Middle East peace process and \n     seeks to effect policies that will help the peace process \n     reach a successful conclusion.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 2 years ago today, my colleagues and I \nwere privileged to witness a historic moment on the White House lawn: \nthe signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles.\n  Today, on behalf of myself, Senator Brown, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Pell I am submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate on this important anniversary.\n  This resolution very simply expresses the Senate's support for the \ndeclaration of principles, its recognition of the progress that has \nbeen achieved in the Middle East peace process, and its commitment to \nhelp the process reach a successful conclusion.\n  The Middle East has changed so much in the last 4 years that we often \ntake the changes for granted. But it sometimes bears reviewing how much \nhas been achieved in such a short time.\n  Think of it:\n  Four years ago, before the Madrid conference in October 1991, Israel \nhad never sat face-to-face in peace talks with most of its Arab \nneighbors. Today, meetings between Israeli and Arab officials--from \nIsrael's immediate neighbors, from the Persian Gulf States, and from \nNorth Africa--are so routine and so numerous that they scarcely receive \nmention in the news media.\n  Just over 2 years ago, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators remained \nlocked in a fruitless stalemate, and direct talks between Israel and \nthe PLO were deemed impossible. Today, there is Palestinian self-rule \nin Gaza and Jericho, Israeli and Palestinian Authority are on the verge \nof reaching an agreement on Palestinian elections and further Israeli \ntroop redeployments in the West Bank, and handshakes between Israeli \nand PLO leaders are commonplace.\n  Just over 1 year ago, Israel and Jordan remained officially in a \nstate of war. Today, thanks to the courage and leadership of King \nHussein and Prime Minister Rabin, Israel and Jordan have signed a full \npeace treaty, enjoy full diplomatic relations, and are continually \nexpanding their cooperation in security, economic development, tourism, \nthe environment, and many other areas.\n  Mr. President, no one would deny that peace has not yet been secured \nin the Middle East. Much, much work remains to be done. Although the \nIsraeli-Syrian negotiations have at times showed promise, with senior \nIsraeli and Syrian military officers holding substantive talks on the \nsecurity arrangements that must accompany an agreement, these talks \ncurrently seem caught in a stalemate. Clearly, many hard rounds of \nnegotiations remain.\n  Israel's talks with Lebanon are essentially on hold until there is an \nIsraeli--Syrian deal. Israel and the Palestinians must continue to \novercome obstacles to the implementation of their agreements, and their \nnegotiations will get no easier once final status talks begin next \nyear.\n  In addition, the peacemakers of the Middle East face continual \nopposition from those who would use terrorism to upset the peace \nprocess. We were reminded of this once on August 21 when a suicide \nbomber blew up a bus in Jerusalem, killing one American and four \nIsraeli civilians. Like the suicide bombings that preceded it, this was \na heinous and unforgivable act of terrorism.\n  All who are committed to peace must do everything in their power to \nprevent acts of terrorism. Nowhere is this more true than in the areas \ncontrolled by the Palestinian Authority. While the performance of \nChairman Arafat's authority in security matters has improved with time, \nit must do even more to prevent and punish all terrorist acts. Suicide \nbombers and other extremists must not be allowed to succeed in their \ngoal of preventing the arrival of peace.\n  But, the obstacles and the hard work ahead do not change the fact \nthat real peace in the Middle East is today genuinely within reach, as \nit never has been before. The long-held dream of Israelis to live in \npeace with all their neighbors, in secure borders, is not a real \npossibility.\n  To bring this process to a successful conclusion, the parties \nthemselves must make all the difficult decisions. But the support of \nthe United States has always been essential to Middle East peacemaking, \nand it remains so today.\n  Presidents Bush and Clinton, and Secretaries of State Baker and \nChristopher, deserve enormous credit for their unyielding commitment to \npursuing a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, and their efforts \nhave earned them the respect and gratitude of parties throughout the \nregion.\n  The Congress has also been consistent in its strong support of all \nefforts to advance the peace process, and expressions of that support \nhelp bolster the parties in their efforts. One recent expression of \nthat support was the introduction of S. 1064, the Middle East \n\n[[Page S 13547]]\nPeace Facilitation Act of 1995, which I was proud to cosponsor along \nwith Senators Helms, Pell, Dole, Daschle, Mack, Lieberman, McConnell, \nLeahy, and Lautenberg. This bill would allow the President to continue \nto provide assistance to the Palestinians and to conduct relations with \nthe PLO, but it includes strict new language mandating compliance by \nthe PLO and the Palestinian Authority with all of their commitments.\n  The resolution I am submitting today presents an opportunity for the \nSenate to mark an important milestone on the long road to peace between \nIsrael and the Palestinians. As we take note of this day, let us also \nreiterate once again that the successful conclusion of a comprehensive \npeace in the Middle East is in the United States national interest, and \nthat we in the U.S. Senate stand firmly behind all those who are \ncommitted to achieving that peace.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13545-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13547-S13549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENT SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n      THE WORK OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 1995\n                                 ______\n\n      SIMON (AND REID) AMENDMENT NO. 2681\n  Mr. SIMON (for himself and Mr. Reid) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 2280 proposed by Mr. Dole to the bill (H.R. 4) to restore \nthe American family, reduce illegitimacy, control welfare spending, and \nreduce welfare dependence; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n                TITLE ____--COMMUNITY WORKS PROGRESS ACT\n\n     SEC. ____00.

Mr. President, the recent news that we now have \nover a million people in our State and Federal prisons, and over half a \nmillion in our local and county jails, is unprecedented in this country \nand perhaps unprecedented in any country.\n  We have to be looking for other answers than more and more prisons. \nAnd there are much better answers, both from the viewpoint of the \ndollar and from the viewpoint of humanity.\n  States are compounding the problem with passage of various \nlegislation, such as ``three strikes and you are out'' in California.\n  A Chicago Tribune editorial commented recently on the State picture \nin Illinois. What it is really commenting on is about an attitude that \nexists, not only in Illinois, but in the Nation.\n  And what the editorial says makes a good deal of sense.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The editorial follows:\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Aug. 28, 1995]\n\n                   Time To Face the Truth on Prisons\n\n       Now that Gov. Jim Edgar has signed the state's new truth-\n     in-sentencing legislation, someone is going to have to figure \n     out how to make it work before there is a disaster in the \n     prison system. The governor is willing, but the \n     responsibility belongs squarely with the General Assembly \n     that created this time bomb.\n       When the legislature passed the law, it is a pity that it \n     wasn't accompanied by truth-in-legislation legislation to \n     give the public an honest portrayal of the costs. Instead, it \n     pandered to the popular appeal of getting tougher on serious \n     crime without regard to the consequences and without \n     providing the resources to handle the added burden on the \n     prisons.\n       Among other things, the law requires that convicted \n     murderers must serve their entire sentences and those \n     convicted of other serious crimes--attempted murder, rape, \n     kidnapping, armed robbery--must serve at least 85 percent. \n     That certainly resonates strongly with a public continually \n     outraged by stories of violent offenders who serve half their \n     time and commit other heinous acts when released. And \n     certainly prison space and stern punishment ought to be \n     reserved primarily for the worst offenders.\n       Truth in sentencing, however, focuses on getting felons \n     into prison and keeping them there longer; it ignores the \n     impact and fosters a myth that there will be no effect on the \n     general prison population.\n       There will be a dramatic effect. According to the state \n     Department of Corrections, it will add the equivalent of some \n     3,800 inmates at a cost of $320 million over the next 10 \n     years--an impact that will escalate in succeeding years. And \n     these will be the hardest cases, stuffed into a prison system \n     that already is seriously overcrowded and may be out of space \n     next year.\n       Anticipating this, Edgar proposed adding some 4,800 cells \n     to the system, but the legislature--primarily because of \n     Democratic opposition--cynically rebuffed his request for \n     bonding authority. In short, the legislature was eager to \n     flood the prisons with new inmates but not to pay the bill.\n       Now Edgar is proposing a different strategy; contracting \n     with private firms to build a new prison and two work camps \n     and add cells to eight existing prisons. The state would \n     lease the facilities and run them.\n       There is merit to the idea in that it could get the job \n     done, and the governor deserves credit for trying. But the \n     answer is not some gambit to bypass the legislature; it is \n     for the legislature to face its obligation.\n       First it must concede what it is not telling the public; \n     that for every prisoner pushed into the system, someone must \n     be pushed out the other end--perhaps sooner than the public \n     will tolerate. Or the overcrowding will get worse, raising \n     the risk of inmate violence and riots, and ultimately \n     inviting federal court intervention to force Illinois to \n     clean up its act.\n       If more prison space is the solution, the General Assembly \n     must provide the money. If not, it must expand the concept of \n     innovative alternative sentencing for non-violent offenders \n     and revisit the state criminal code--reducing the penalties \n     for lesser offenses and giving judges more discretion.\n       Truth in sentencing is an easy answer to serious concerns. \n     There is no easy way out of the problems that it will create, \n     and it's time to stop the pretense.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13549-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13549-S13550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          THE AMERICAN PROMISE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as has been said many times before, \nours is \n\n[[Page S 13550]]\nthe only nation founded on an idea--the idea of democracy. No idea is \nmore American. Yet the idea of democracy is neither simply defined, nor \neasily described. American democracy expresses itself in endless \nvariations.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, to remind my colleagues of the \ngrassroots democracy, taking place every day in communities across the \nUnited States, which is literally vital to the life of the Nation, yet \ntoo often ignored in the chambers of this Capitol. With that in mind, I \nrecommend to you ``The American Promise,'' an important new PBS \ntelevision series celebrating community-based democracy. ``The American \nPromise,'' a 3-hour program, makes its national broadcast premiere on \nOctober 1, 2 and 3.\n  Here in Washington, we conduct democracy's most visible work. It is \nthe democracy studied in political science classrooms and reported by \nour newspapers, magazines, and television programs.\n  We arrive here after elections, propose and study legislation, and \nthen vote on competing proposals. It is a fact that each stage of the \nprocess has winners and losers. By necessity, we live and work in a \nworld of partisanship and competition. Before any proposal becomes the \nlaw of the land, it must be debated, tested and its consequences \nthoroughly understood by the people and by us, the people's \nrepresentatives,\n  Not surprisingly, this world in which we are immersed leaves many \ncitizens frustrated and cynical. Too often, this version of democracy \nseems to be nothing but a political contest. Who is up? Who is down? \nHow do yesterday's events affect the power to get things done tomorrow? \nOur standing is judged by an extraordinarily sensitive barometer, \ninstantaneously reflecting each small political success and failure.\n  Our work here in Washington is but one form of American democracy--we \nwould be seriously mistaken to think otherwise. We must never lose \nsight of the fact that American democracy is larger and more diverse \nthan the business conducted here in this Capitol. In community after \ncommunity across America, in ways great and small, citizens decide \nevery day to become part of the democratic process--they decide what \nthey want. They join an organization; build a better mousetrap; \nquestion why flawed practices can't be changes; engage in respectful \ncivil debate, and shoulder the responsibility to make hard decisions.\n  When this happens, there are no losers. American democracy comes to \nlife and everybody in the community wins.\n  So strong is my belief in the importance of grassroots democracy that \nI can say it literally shaped my political career.\n  When I was appointed to the position of national administrator of the \nAmerican Revolution Bicentennial Administration in 1974, my goal was \nsimple: to encourage the maximum number of people across America to \nbecome involved in the programs they--not government--desired to honor \ntheir local communities and our great Nation. We wanted our Nation's \n200th birthday to be celebrated in a simple, historic way, with maximum \nparticipation on the ``Village Greens'' of every crossroad, town, and \ncity in America. I will never forget the wonderful breadth of \nexperience I had over the next two years, working with citizens, local \ngroups, service clubs, organizations, City Councilmen, Mayors, and \nGovernors. America's birthday was celebrated America's way, from every \nvantage point across the country.\n  There is no better antidote to doubts about our Nation's future than \ngrassroots democracy.\n  Happily, ``The American Promise'' reminds us all of the community-\nbased democracy found beyond this Capitol. In so doing, it restores our \nfaith in the idea of democracy, the idea of America, and the wonderful, \nlimitless potential for our Nation's future.\n  In some fifty different story segments from every region of the \nUnited States, lessons are offered on the skills and values needed to \nbring democracy to life. They illustrate core American values--freedom, \nresponsibility, opportunity, participation, and deliberation. Special \nhistorical reenactments are included, the first set in 1769, in the \nstreets of Colonial Williamsburg. We watch as a young Thomas Jefferson, \nalong with Patrick Henry, Colonel George Washington, Peyton Randolph, \nGeorge Mason, Richard Henry Lee, and others take the first steps toward \nfreedom. In the House of Burgesses, in a local tavern, on the streets, \nthe group draws up Virginia's plans to boycott English goods. We hear \nWashington's words: ``How far their attention to our rights and \nprivileges is to be awakened or alarmed by starving their trade and \nmanufacturers remains to be tried.'' Viewers will see our Founding \nFathers starting a rebellion that will gather strength for 7 more years \nbefore it takes the form of the Declaration of Independence.\n  That is a sobering thought: our freedoms were not won by crazy \nrevolutionaries on a field of battle, but rather through years of \nmeetings, of talk, of debate and compromise. It is a true reminder of \nthe communal instincts that helped form our great Nation.\n  The October premiere of ``The American Promise'' will be just the \nbeginning of the program's contributions. It will then be put to use in \nhigh school and junior high school classrooms throughout the country, \nas an instructional tool on civics and community-based democracy.\n  The National Council on the Social Studies has endorsed the program. \nFarmers Insurance Group, the program's corporate sponsor, has pledged \nto make the video, teaching guides, and classroom materials available \nto all interested schools and teachers at no cost.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and viewers across America to \nwatch this important and instructional program. And I extend my \ncommendation and appreciation to the Farmers Insurance Group, and its \nChairman, Leo E. Denlea, Jr., for bringing this fine programming to us.\n  ``The American Promise'' reminds us of all that is good and right in \nAmerica--and what we have to do to make good on America's bright \nfuture.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13549-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13550-S13551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                BLACK STUDENTS LIVE DOWN TO EXPECTATIONS\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there is continued discussion, and will be \nuntil November 1996 at least, on the whole subject of affirmative \naction.\n  My strong belief is that affirmative action has been a good thing \nbut, like any good thing, can be abused occasionally. Religion can be \nabused. Education can be abused. But that does not make religion and \neducation a bad thing.\n  While we were in recess, the New York Times published an op-ed piece \nby Claude M. Steele, a professor of psychology at Stanford University \nand president-elect of the Western Psychological Association.\n  It gives a solid analysis of affirmative action at the collegiate \nlevel.\n  It is important enough to call to the attention of my colleagues, who \nmay not have seen it, and to others who may read the Congressional \nRecord.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The material follows:\n               [New York Times; Thursday, Aug. 31, 1995]\n\n                Black Students Live Down to Expectations\n\n                         (By Claude M. Steele)\n\n       Stanford, CA.--The debate over affirmative action on \n     college campuses has become dangerously distanced from facts. \n     The issue has taken on such an ideological fervor that votes, \n     Presidential and otherwise, are hanging in the balance. In \n     the fray, the image of African-American college students has \n     taken a beating.\n       Opponents of affirmative action claim that it pushes \n     African-American students into schools where they can't \n     compete and where, with the stigma they bear as ``special \n     admits,'' they get lower grades and drop out more than other \n     students.\n       It is true that these students have their troubles, \n     suffering a college dropout rate hovering near 70 percent \n     (against 40 percent for other students), with lower grades to \n     match. Given such statistics, even supporters of affirmative \n     action have faltered, too unsure themselves about the \n     students' abilities to rise quickly or publicly to their \n     defense.\n       In fact, most black college students are in school on the \n     same terms as anyone else, not as a result of any racial \n     preference. Still, as their fate goes, so goes our faith in \n     affirmative action and in the ability of public policy to \n     address racial and social problems. So a few facts and some \n     new evidence can help in addressing some central questions.\n       Do the academic troubles of black students stem from their \n     being underprepared for the competition?\n       This is a common complaint that has turned into \n     conventional wisdom. But in fact \n\n[[Page S 13551]]\n     there isn't much evidence of it. Very few minority students are \n     admitted to any college beneath that school's cut-off for \n     other students.\n       It is true that blacks have lower S.A.T. scores than other \n     entering students. But the deficit in test scores--which are \n     certainly flawed as predictors anyway--doesn't begin to \n     explain why black students are more likely to drop out and \n     get bad grades once they begin college. Besides, this \n     ``underperformance'' is just as common among black students \n     entering with very high test scores and grades as it is among \n     those with weaker credentials.\n       One thing is clear: If affirmative action is failing by not \n     producing more successful black college students, it is not \n     because they have been placed where they can't compete.\n       If it isn't a lack of preparation, then what is depressing \n     their performance?\n       Recent research by my colleagues and me points to a \n     disruptive pressure tied to racial stereotypes that affects \n     these students. The pressure begins simply enough, with a \n     student's knowledge that negative stereotypes about his group \n     could apply to him--that he could be judged by this \n     perception, treated in terms of it, even that he could \n     fulfill it.\n       Black students know that the stereotypes about them raise \n     questions about their intellectual ability. Quite beside any \n     actual discriminatory treatment, they can feel that their \n     intelligence is constantly and everywhere on trial--and all \n     this at a tender age and on difficult proving ground.\n       They may not believe the stereotype. But it becomes a \n     threating hypothesis that they can grow weary of fending \n     off--much as a white student, for example, can grow weary of \n     fending off the stereotype that his group is racist.\n       Everyone is subject to some form of what I call \n     ``stereotype vulnerability.'' The form that black students \n     suffer from can hurt them where it matters, in academic \n     performance. My research with Joshua Aronson shows that \n     ``stereotype vulnerability'' can cost these students many \n     points on exams like the S.A.T.\n       Over time, the pressure can push the students to stop \n     identifying with achievement in school. They may even band \n     together in doing this, making ``disidentification'' the \n     pattern. For my money, the syndrome is at the root of black \n     students' troubles in college.\n       If affirmative action contributes to this problem, it is \n     less from the policy itself than from its implementation, \n     often through a phalanx of ``minority support'' programs \n     that, however well intended, reinforce negative stereotypes. \n     Almost certainly, there would be persistent, troubling \n     underperformance by minority students even if affirmative \n     action programs were dismantled, just as there was before \n     they existed.\n       Is there only reason to believe that affirmative action \n     programs can alleviate this problem?\n       In the diagnosis may lie the seeds of a cure: Schools need \n     to reduce the burden of suspicion these students are under. \n     Challenging students works better than dumbing down their \n     education. Framing intelligence as expandable rather than as \n     a set, limiting trait makes frustration a signal to try \n     harder, not to give up. Finally, it is crucial that the \n     college convey, especially through relationships with \n     authoritative adults, that it values them for their \n     intellectual promise and not just because of its own openness \n     to minorities.\n       My colleagues (Steven Spencer, Mary Hummel, David Schoem, \n     Kent Harber and Richard Nisbett) and I incorporated these and \n     other principles into a program at the University of Michigan \n     for the last four years. The students, both white and \n     minority, were selected randomly for the project and as \n     freshmen were housed in the same dorm.\n       Through workshops and group study, all placing emphasis on \n     the students' intellectual potential, the program eliminated \n     the differential between black and white students' grades in \n     freshman year for the top two-thirds of the black students.\n       It helped others as well; 92 percent of all the students in \n     the group, white and black, were still in school after four \n     years.\n       The successes of comparable programs--Urie Treisman's math \n     workshops at the University of Texas, Georgia State's pre-\n     engineering program, John Johnide's faculty mentoring \n     project, also at Michigan--show that this approach can work.\n       But what about reverse discrimination? How much does this \n     policy of inclusion cost in exclusion of others?\n       To know if affirmative action is displacing whites in \n     admissions, you have to know if, among comparably qualified \n     applicants, more minorities get in than whites.\n       Thomas Kane of Harvard University's Kennedy School of \n     Government found that this seems to happen only in elite \n     colleges, where the average S.A.T. score is above 1,100. \n     These schools make up only 15 percent of our four-year \n     colleges. There was no evidence of preference in admissions \n     among the rest.\n       Moreover, in the elite schools, blacks don't often use the \n     preference they get, choosing schools closer to home, \n     perhaps, for various reasons. They rarely exceed 7 percent of \n     the student body at the top schools. Overall, affirmative \n     action causes little displacement of other students--less by \n     far than other forms of preferences, like the one for \n     children of alumni.\n       In our society, individual initiative is an indisputable \n     source of mobility. But a stream of resources including \n     money, education and contacts is also important. After all \n     this time, even the black middle class has only tentative \n     access to this stream. Affirmative action in college \n     represents a commitment to fixing this, allowing those with \n     initiative a wider aperture of opportunity.\n       If its opponents prevail and affirmative action is dumped, \n     will the same people, so ostensibly outraged by the racial \n     injustice of it, then step forward to address the more \n     profound racial injustices?\n       I wouldn't bet on it and, in the meantime, let's talk about \n     this policy frankly and pragmatically: how to improve it, \n     when it should be more inclusive, and how it should be made \n     fairer.\n       To dump it now would be to hold some people, just beginning \n     to experience a broader fairness in society, to a tougher \n     standard than the rest of us have had to meet.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13550-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13551-S13552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   APPLICABILITY OF REGULATION E FOR ALL ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFERS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced \nS. 131, a bill that would remove the applicability of regulation E of \nthe Electronic Funds Transfer Act for all electronic benefits transfer \n[EBT] programs established under Federal, State, or local law, with the \nexception of when payments are made directly into a consumer's account. \nI introduced this legislation for the purposes of removing the barriers \nfor States so that they could implement EBT. Although regulation E \nprovides many protections for the consumer, the States see it as \nbarrier to implementing EBT because it requires States to be liable for \nlost and stolen benefits over $50. This added liability could result in \nadded administrative costs.\n  At the time I introduced this bill, I expected cash-assistance \nwelfare programs to continue to be federally regulated. But now, it \nappears that our largest cash-assistance program for low-income people, \nAid to Families With Dependent Children [AFDC], will be block granted \nand there will no longer be Federal oversight in many areas. Because of \nthis, we must be somewhat more careful in exempting cash assistance and \nother welfare programs that use electronic benefit transfers from all \nof the provisions of regulation E. I want to explain why there may be \nproblems in adopting the current language in the House welfare bill \nthat exempts electronic benefit transfers [EBT] from regulation E.\n  Electronic benefit transfers are the transfers and distributions of \nFederal and State benefit programs through electronic banking \ntechniques. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act governs all ATM \ntransactions and point-of-service sales such as the use of your credit \ncard or ATM card at the grocery store. The act assures individuals that \ntheir complaints about unauthorized uses and systems problems will be \nattended to in a timely manner. Other protections provided by \nregulation E include the disclosure of information to the consumer \nabout their rights. I'm sure that most Members would agree that these \nprovisions are fair and should be applied to welfare recipients as well \nas the general banking population. Indeed, States that currently have \nEBT already provide most of these services.\n  Under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act [EFTA] the cardholder is only \nresponsible for up to $50 if the card is lost or stolen and benefits \nare withdrawn. EFTA requires cardholders to have a personal \nidentification number [PIN] which should prevent unauthorized \nwithdrawal of benefits even if the card is stolen. This number should \nonly be known by the recipient so if the card is stolen, the thief \nwould not be able to gain access to the benefits. In an EBT system, if \nmoney is stolen from the account the State would be liable for all \nbenefits beyond the $50 limit.\n This single provision opens EBT to fraud and abuse which could result \nin very high costs to the States. The States have said that this \npotential liability would prevent them from going forward with the \nimplementation of EBT programs.\n\n  EBT holds many benefits for the administering agency and the \nrecipient. EBT delivers benefits more cost-effectively and eliminates \nthe need to print and process food stamps. It also eliminates postal \nfees for sending out checks and authorizing documents. It can provide \nsubstantial protections against fraud and theft. There is a successful \nEBT demonstration project in Ramsey \n\n[[Page S 13552]]\nCounty, MN. Ninety-five percent of recipients in Ramsey County prefer \nEBT over checks and food stamps. It allows recipients to have their \nmonthly benefits on the date that they are available, instead of when \nthe Postal Service finally delivers them. It also allows the recipient \nto bypass check cashing fees and to withdraw small amounts at a time, \nmaking them less of a target for mugging.\n  Senator Dole's welfare reform proposal S. 1120, as well as Senator \nDaschle's proposed substitute, the Work First proposal, would exempt \nonly food stamp benefits distributed by EBT from regulation E. I \nsupport these provisions, for now, because the Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture would continue to have authority to ensure \nthere are adequate protections. For example, it is my understanding \nthat the Secretary could require the application of regulation E to \nfood stamps if the States or banks abuse the system. But the same would \nnot be true for AFDC if the Congress were to convert the program to a \nblock grant for cash assistance. Under a block grant beneficiaries \nwould have no recourse if banks or the State agencies did not act \nresponsibly.\n  In contrast, the House has taken a different approach and has \nexempted all needs-tested Government programs that make use of EBT from \nregulation E. For reasons I have described, I do not think this is \nappropriate. I believe legislation that effects regulation E's \napplication to EBT needs more thought. We need to consider how to \nminimize State liability while still maintaining protections for \nrecipients using EBT. Congress should take the short-term step of \neliminating the $50 liability limit. Other requirements of regulation \nE, such as the requirement to address complaints in a timely manner, \nmay continue to be necessary to ensure that recipients in Federal cash-\nassistance welfare programs are treated fairly. The Federal Reserve \nBoard has already determined that regulation E shall apply to all EBT \nprograms as of February 1997. We need to act on this issue soon so that \nStates will not see the impending implementation of regulation E as a \nbarrier to starting EBT programs. I would like to work with my \ncolleagues to eliminate barriers to the States' use of EBT so that \nStates will not be dissuaded from implementing EBT programs.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13551-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FANNIE MAE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I recently joined Mayor Daley, \nFannie Mae President Larry Small, and others, in announcing Fannie \nMae's ``HouseChicago'' plan. ``HouseChicago'' is a $10 billion, 7-year \ninvestment plan developed by Fannie Mae's Chicago Partnership Office, \nthe City of Chicago and numerous local partners.\n  Fannie Mae was created by Congress as a federally-chartered, \nshareholder-owned corporation, whose mission is to make sure mortgage \nfunds are readily available in every State of the Nation. I am proud to \nsay Fannie Mae has done a tremendous job at fulfilling that mission, \nand I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues the following \neditorial by the Chicago Tribune regarding Fannie Mae's investment in \nthe city of Chicago.\n\n              [From the Chicago Tribune, August 26, 1995]\n\n                       Fannie Mae's Home Cookin'\n\n       It's hard to overstate the importance of home ownership to \n     the success of a neighborhood.\n       Besides being a ticket to the middle-class, ownership gives \n     people a larger stake in their communities. It makes them \n     less tolerant of vandalism or drug-dealing and more likely to \n     get involved in a block club or the PTA.\n       But as nearly every homeowner is reminded once a month, \n     it's the mortgage-holder that really owns the house. It's the \n     lender or, more often, the financial house that buys the \n     mortgage from the lender whose investment is most at risk. \n     That's why the note-holder gets first claim on the property \n     should the purchaser fail to make payments.\n       And that's why lenders have strict standards about whom \n     they will lend to and under what circumstances. But as \n     lenders increasingly sell their mortgages on the so-called \n     ``secondary'' market, it's the standards of the huge mortgage \n     purchasing corporation that become key.\n       In that regard, recent initiatives by the Federal National \n     Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the nation's largest \n     repurchaser of home mortgages, deserve to be recognized and \n     applauded.\n       Not to be confused with the local confectioner, Fannie Mae \n     is a federally chartered, publicly traded corporation whose \n     mission is to encourage private investment in residential \n     mortgages. It recently struck a deal with the city to modify \n     its underwriting standards in certain disadvantaged \n     neighborhoods.\n       Participating lenders can now offer extra-low (3 percent) \n     down payment terms to families earning up to 20 percent above \n     the area median income of $51,300--if the house they are \n     buying is located within the city's empowerment zone or \n     certain other areas targeted by City Hall for redevelopment.\n       Some might call this an attempt at gentrification, but it \n     means that middle-income families--and the stability they \n     bring--will be lured into neighborhoods they might otherwise \n     spurn as too risky.\n       Other Fannie Mae changes will make it easier for buyers of \n     small apartment buildings to get conventional mortgages, as \n     well as buyers participating in the city's New Homes For \n     Chicago Program and the purchase-rehabilitation program run \n     by a group called Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago \n     (NHS).\n       The bottom-line in Fannie Mae's ``House Chicago'' program \n     will be $10 billion in private loans pumped into \n     neighborhoods that might otherwise have to rely on federal \n     mortgage insurance . . . with all the abuses those programs \n     often bring.\n       It's not the candy company, but Fannie Mae is giving new \n     meaning to ``Sweet Home Chicago.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13552-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           TONY ELROY McHENRY\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Even as a young child, Tony always \nfound a peacefulness in his faith; he was a life-long member of Beulah \nBaptist Church.\n  Tony was educated in Spotsylvania County at the John J.

He is \nsurvived by his wife. Tony distinguished himself as an offset pressman \nfor the U.S. Senate Service Department and friends remark on his quiet \ndignity and pride taken in his work. He always balanced professionalism \nand a courteous manner, certainly his trademarks.\n  Tony McHenry will be missed by family and friends: his smile, his \nwarm and engaging personality, his earthly spirit.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/13/senate-section/article/S13552-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.
