Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, in \njust a few minutes the Democratic leader and I will be sending to the \ndesk resolutions which make majority and minority party committee seat \nassignments for the 105th Congress. I want to again thank publicly, for \nthe cooperation that we have received on this matter, both my \ncolleagues within the conference and also Senator Daschle and his \ncolleagues. I think it is not the usual situation that we can file \nthese committee assignments this early in the session. I think it is \ngoing to help us facilitate our work early.\n  Following the adoption of these resolutions, the Senate will be \nproceeding to the House of Representatives in order to attend a joint \nsession of Congress for the counting of the electoral college votes.\n  Immediately following the conclusion of that joint session, the \nSenate will adjourn over until Tuesday, January 21. On January 21, the \nSenate will stand in recess between the hours of 12:30 and 2:15 in \norder to allow for the weekly party conferences to meet. At 2:15, \nTuesday, January 21, Senators may begin to introduce legislation for \nthe 105th Congress. However, no votes are expected to occur during the \nsession of the Senate on Tuesday, January 21, 1997.\n  Mr. President, did the Democratic leader have a comment he wanted to \nmake at this point on the committee assignments, or should we proceed \nwith the resolutions?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me also thank all of our colleagues. I want to \nthank our colleagues for their cooperation and the great participation \nwe have had in getting us to this point as quickly as we have. I thank, \nas well, the majority leader for his cooperation on the work we have \nbeen able to achieve in getting to this point. I think these committees \nrepresent a very fair and accurate presentation of ratios as it relates \nto the membership of the Senate, and I am very pleased with the way our \nnegotiations turned out.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S109-4", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMENDING PARAGRAPHS 2 AND 3 OF RULE XXV\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I announce to my colleagues that one of the \nresolutions just adopted relates to necessary committee ratio changes \nfor the 105th Congress. I note this allows for an increase of one seat \non the Intelligence Committee from both sides of the aisle. The \nDemocratic leader and I are allowing for this increase in the size of \nthe Intelligence Committee for this Congress only due to the great \ninterest in serving on this important committee from Members on both \nsides of the aisle and also because of the seriousness of some of the \nmatters they will be considering and wanting to make sure that we are \ncomplying with the statute.\n  One of the things we have been trying to do as we started this year \nis to take a look at what the rules are and what the statutes require \nand try to comply with that. The statute is clear about wanting to have \nat least two from the Armed Services Committee, two from the Judiciary \nCommittee, and two from Foreign Relations. I think it is particularly \nimportant that we have Members from the Armed Services Committee on \nIntelligence because so much of what they do has an Armed Services \nCommittee relationship. In fact, the hearings on the funding for that \ncommittee, I believe, always have to report to the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  This change in the numbers will be only for this Congress, and then \nwe will work in the next Congress back toward the statutory number of \n8-7. We may want to come down maybe two steps, 9-8, but we should try \nto be in compliance with the statutes on the numbers as well as the \ncommittee jurisdiction and representation on that committee.\n  Again, I state that following this Congress it would be our intention \nto reduce the size, but we will do that only in working with the \nDemocratic leader. This is the only committee, also, that only has a \none-seat difference, and the statute requires that. All the others have \ntwo.\n  I wonder if the Democratic leader would like to comment on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have had a \nnumber of conversations about this particular issue, and I have \ndiscussed the matter in great detail with the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee. He shares the view, given the agenda and given \nthe legal need to ensure the representation as is required by law, that \nonly on a one-time interim basis an additional Armed Services Committee \nmember needs to be placed on the committee.\n  As the majority leader has indicated, this is one time and one time \nonly. This is an interim assignment. We intend to work with him to \nbring the committee size down to its legal, permanent size in the \nensuing Congresses. So I urge people to recognize the intention here, \nand that is to accommodate the chair and the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee and to accommodate their agenda.\n  I am certainly in agreement with this approach and appreciate the \nopportunity to work through this particular matter as we have.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank the Democratic leader for \nthe attention he has joined me in giving to the Intelligence Committee. \nIt is a very important committee, and I am not sure we have always \ngiven it the consideration that it should have, but we have done it \nthis time. I am very pleased with what the result has been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S111-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S111-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S111-S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on January 8, 1997, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that pursuant to the provisions of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 2, 105th Congress, the Speaker reappoints as members of the \nJoint Committee to make the necessary arrangements for the inauguration \nof the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United \nStates on the 20th day of January 1997, the following Members of the \nHouse: Mr. Gephardt of Missouri, Mr. Gingrich of Georgia, and Mr. Armey \nof Texas.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolutions, each without amendment:\n\n       S.

Mr. President, I want to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to Chester Herwitz, a resident of Worcester, MA, who on \nJanuary 11 will be the sole American to receive the Indo-American \nSociety Annual Award. The prominence of the two other recipients--\nMother Teresa and Dr. Manmohan Singh, the former Finance Minister of \nIndia--attests to the prestige of this award.\n  Born in Swampscott, MA, Chester moved west within my State, \neventually settling in Worcester. I have known Chester Herwitz for \nalmost 30 years. He brings enormous passion, intelligence, energy, and \nintegrity to his chosen field, contemporary Indian art. For more than \n20 years, he has lent works from his collection to dozens of museums in \nEngland, France, and the United States, including two in Massachusetts, \nthe Worcester Art Museum and the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem.\n  I also applaud the good works of Chester and his wife Davida. In \n1994,\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\nthey established the Chester and Davida Herwitz Charitable Trust to \nsupport contemporary Indian art. In addition, Chester has served on the \nboard of several charitable and social-service organizations in \nMassachusetts.\n  I am particularly proud that a great nation like India will recognize \nChester's work. I trust that Chester will continue to enrich the \ncultures of both India and the United States. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S113-4", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AM 1450 WMIQ\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor AM 1450, Iron \nMountain and Kingsford, Michigan's Information Station. On January 25, \n1996, the station will celebrate 50 years of continuous broadcasting \nand community service.\n  On April 4, 1946, the first organizational meeting of the Iron \nMountain Kingsford Broadcasting Co. was held to license a new radio \nstation for the area. William and Frank Russell, along with the Delta \nBroadcasting Co. and the Lake Superior Broadcasting Co., were the \ndriving force behind this organizing group. The new radio station was \nto be a news station operated by the Iron Mountain News, the area's \ndaily newspaper.\n  Construction on the broadcast facility began on November 14, 1946 and \non November 21, the new station was officially named WMIQ, with William \nGoodrich serving as its first general manager. On Saturday, January 25, \n1947, WMIQ began broadcasting at 8:00 a.m. Governors Sigler of Michigan \nand Goodland of Wisconsin both wired the station to offer words of \ncongratulation.\n  During the past 50 years, programming has included national and local \nnews coverage, the ``Scandinavian Cheer Hour'' broadcast from the \nBethel Mission Covenant Church in Swedish, live musical performances, \nthe WMIQ Playhouse and Sunday morning services from First Lutheran \nChurch. WMIQ also has a long history of national and local sports \ncoverage.\n  WMIQ ownership changed hands in 1968 when Jim Klungness and Charles \nHenry purchased the radio station. WMIQ currently has sister stations \nWIMK-FM in Iron Mountain and WUPK-FM in Marquette. WMIQ has been very \nactive in the community over the years by supporting the Caring House \nfor domestic violence victims, the Can-A-Thon food drive, the March of \nDimes and Easter Seals.\n  WMIQ has been an integral part of the Iron Mountain and Kingsford \ncommunities for the past fifty years. Its great work keeping the public \napprised of current events has earned WMIQ the title of Michigan's \n``Information Station.'' I know my Senate colleagues join me in \ncongratulating WMIQ for a half century of service to its broadcasting \naudience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S114-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-OSHKOSH\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. UW-Oshkosh is celebrating its service \nto the State of Wisconsin as an institute of higher learning for 125 \nconsecutive years and will be concluding its celebration with a large \ncommunity event on February 8, 1997.\n  The University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh has a rich tradition of serving \nthe families of our State through dedication and devotion to the \nprinciples of higher education. UW-Oshkosh was founded in 1871 with an \nentering class of 43 students. During that time the university was \nmainly a teacher-training institution, producing thousands of teachers \nwho contributed immensely to Wisconsin's leadership in education.\n  Today, as part of the distinguished University of Wisconsin System, \nUW-Oshkosh enrolls more than 10,000 students on its campus in Fox \nRiver, WI. The university's four colleges and graduate school offer a \nrange of programs in education and human services, letters and science, \nbusiness administration, and nursing. With a tradition of strong \nprograms in the arts and sciences and in professional career fields, \nthe university has created an environment that promotes excellence and \nvalues diversity. In the past several years faculty and students have \ncreated a blueprint for the university's future, including a vision \nstatement and 11 goals. Mr. President, the blueprint has been working \nbecause for the third consecutive year UW-Oshkosh ranks in the first \ntier of Midwestern colleges and universities by U.S. News and World \nReport.\n  I hope that all of you will join me in congratulating the faculty, \nstudents, employees, and graduates of the University of Wisconsin-\nOshkosh for all of their accomplishments during their 125 years of \nexistence, and I know you will join me in wishing them well during the \nnext 125 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S114-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY SPEAKER CRUZ BUSTAMANTE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to Cruz Bustamante, the newly elected speaker \nof the California Assembly.\n  Speaker Bustamante is a native Californian, born in Dinuba and raised \nin the great Central Valley, where he still lives and represents the \n31st District. He graduated from Tranquility High School and attended \nFresno City College and California State University at Fresno. He has \nhad a career marked by community service, having worked in various \nemployment and training programs.\n  He understands his community well, having served on numerous boards \nand commissions including the Fresno United Way Allocation Committee, \nBurroughs Elementary School Site Committee, City of Fresno Citizens \nAdvisory Committee and the Roosevelt Plan Implementation Committee.\n  In addition to his extensive experience in state and local government \nand organizations, he also has a firm understanding of the workings of \nCongress and the Federal Government. Early in his career, he served as \na summer intern in former Congressman B. F. Sisk's office. He later \nworked as district representative for former Congressman Richard \nLehman.\n  Cruz Bustamante is California's first Assembly Speaker of Latino \nheritage. He is a modern day pioneer. California is home to millions of \nLatinos and others of various ethnic backgrounds. Mr. Bustamante's \nspeakership heralds new horizons for every Californian concerned with \nthe future of our ever changing State.\n  So today, I ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me \nand Speaker Bustamante's wife Arcelia, their daughters and \ngrandchildren, his colleagues, constituents and numerous other \nsupporters in wishing him every success as he meets this challenge.\n  Cruz Bustamante has been described by Republicans and Democrats alike \nas an intelligent and able leader. He has said that his tenure as \nSpeaker will focus on the needs of the people of California. I look \nforward to working with him on behalf of all Californians, and I look \nforward to a continuing story of success for California's new Assembly \nSpeaker, Cruz Bustamente.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/09/senate-section/article/S114-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 21, 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
