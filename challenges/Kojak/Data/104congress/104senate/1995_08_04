Under the previous order, the \nSenator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we are ready to proceed now on this \nbill, and I believe the distinguished Senator from Nebraska desires at \nthis time to take up the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2111\n\n            (Purpose: To propose a substitute to title XXXI)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send to the desk the Thurmond-Domenici \namendment and ask it be reported immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for \n     himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Lott, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bond, \n     Mr. Thompson, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2111.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2112 to Amendment No. 2111\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 3135 of S. 1026 authorizing a program for \n                       hydronuclear experiments)\n\n  Mr. EXON. As per our previous agreement, I send an amendment in the \nsecond degree to the desk at this time and ask that it be read in its \nentirety, and I also ask that the cosponsors of the amendment be \nidentified as part of the reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatfield, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Glenn, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Simon, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2112 to amendment No. 2111.\n       On page 33 of the underlying amendment, strike out section \n     3135, lines 11 through 19.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina will have 70 minutes under control in this debate and \nthe Senator from Nebraska will have 90 minutes. The Senator may \nproceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous-consent \nrequest, I thought we said we could speak about the bill first, and \nthen it would go to Senator Exon for the debate.\n  Did I misunderstand? If I misunderstood, it is all right. \n\n[[Page S 11354]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, immediately after the reading \nof the amendment, the Senator from Nebraska was to be recognized to \noffer a second-degree amendment to the Thurmond amendment; there would \nbe 70 minutes debate under the control of the Senator from South \nCarolina and 90 minutes under the control of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not need the time. Just so I know when we would \nbe speaking.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding, and I ask the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from South Carolina if they agree \nwith this, that during this period that has just been identified, we \nwould be able to speak on the underlying amendment or on the Exon \namendment or on both, and the statement I intend to give would be a \nstatement on both, starting, of course, with a description of the \nThurmond amendment and my reason for sponsoring it, and also discussing \nmy reason for supporting the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if I might respond and clear up any \nmisunderstanding, the time agreement that was entered into and was \nspecifically agreed to last night was 90 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from Nebraska, and 70 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from South Carolina. That time agreement is for debate on both \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina and the second \ndegree, and the time can be allotted. Any Senator can debate either the \nunderlying amendment or the amendment in the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from Nebraska, it \nis my understanding, though, it would be used off of either the time--\nlet me state this. I worked, the Senator from Nebraska knows, on the \ntime agreement. The 70 minutes was to be used in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Nebraska. We have arranged time to speak \nagainst the amendment of the Senator, and that was certainly my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. EXON. The time to speak against the second-degree amendment would \nbe under the control of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. While the Senator is debating, I will talk \nto the chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am certainly pleased to join my good \nfriend from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, and others, including the \ndistinguished junior Senator from the State of New Mexico, and many \nother cosponsors, to correct one of the most objectionable provisions \nin the defense authorization bill that is now before the Senate. The \nExon-Hatfield, et al., amendment is a very simple and a very \nstraightforward one. It would delete--eliminate--section 3135 of the \nbill in its entirety, and remove the $50 million authorization for \nhydronuclear testing. Our amendment makes no adjustment to the funding \nfor either the stockpiled storage program or the overall energy \ndepartment budget. Our amendment is funding neutral. It simply removes \nthe authorization in the bill for the use of $50 million to resume \nnuclear weapons testing.\n  With that brief opening statement--and I will be expanding on this \nfurther--I now yield 10 minutes to my colleague, the junior Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. If I may ask the Senator from Nebraska, I hoped to have \nabout 15 minutes before the end of the debate. May I take all that time \nat this point?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, I will yield 15 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thought I had to make my opening statement.\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator from South Carolina wishes to make an \nopening statement preceding the 15-minute remarks by the Senator from \nNew Mexico, I am certain that will be agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nnecessary.\n  The proposed amendment is the result of the diligent efforts of \ninterested parties that have endeavored to resolve concerns raised by \nthe original provisions of title XXXI. I would like to thank the \ndistinguished Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development. Without the efforts of \nSenator Domenici and his staff the agreement underlying this amendment \ncould not have been reached. It has been a privilege to work with him \nand his staff, I say to Senator Domenici.\n  I would also like to thank the other Senators that have cosponsored \nthis amendment, and contributed to the substance of the amendment. I \nwant to specifically recognize the superb efforts of Senator Lott, the \nChairman of the Strategic Forces subcommittee in arriving at this \nagreement. Finally, I wish to thank Senator Kempthorne whose excellent \nwork raised key issues in hearings on the Department of Energy.\n  Through this amendment we have achieved what we and our cosponsors \nbelieve is a prudent balance between the need to focus the Department \nof Energy on the near-term manufacturing capabilities required for the \nnuclear weapons stockpile and the need to invest in long-term science-\nbased stockpile stewardship. With this compromise we also restore the \nnecessary resources to meet the Department of Energy's request for \nnonproliferation, verification, and arms control research and \ndevelopment.\n  This bill sends the message that the Senate will support the \nnecessary investment in this crucial element of strategic nuclear \ndeterrence. Working together, we will continue to do what is necessary \nto maintain the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. \nMaintaining the Nation's smaller nuclear stockpile in a safe and \nreliable condition to meet the requirements of the Department of \nDefense is the first priority mission of the national security programs \nof the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy and the \nadministration must not lose sight of this fact as they work to fund a \nvariety of other important programs, such as the Environmental \nRestoration and Waste Management Program, which this amendment also \nsupports.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will Senator Thurmond yield me 5 minutes to speak on \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the able Senator from New Mexico \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Thurmond for the kind \nremarks. Obviously, for those who know of my interest in the defense \nlaboratories that are operated by the Department of Energy, in \nparticular the three major nuclear deterrent laboratories of Los \nAlamos, Sandia-Albuquerque, and Lawrence Livermore, this is a very good \namendment from the standpoint of recognizing their capability and their \nprowess in terms of maintaining the nuclear deterrent in a safe and \nreliable fashion.\n  We are engaged, now, in a great transition between where we were \ngoing and what we were defending against, in terms of the development \nof nuclear weapons. Essentially, this bill says let us go a little bit \nslow before we jump to conclusions as to how we are going to replace \nand replenish the nuclear stockpile over time. Because, it says, we are \nmoving now in the direction of a stewardship program that is built \naround the nuclear laboratories and in conjunction with the complex \nthat does much of the fabricating and manufacturing. But it says we are \nnot going to move rapidly into a ``let us build up and let us make sure \nwe have all the manufacturing capabilities,'' but, rather, let us rely \nupon the institutions within the Defense Department and the DOE to tell \nus precisely how we ought to handle the stockpile we are going to have \nto maintain.\n  I am very pleased that we struck a good balance here in that the \nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Defense wanted us to move \ntoward a science-based stewardship program built around the three \nnational laboratories, and we are in the process of developing that.\n  While we are doing that, we do not want to let the other complexes \nthat \n\n[[Page S 11355]]\nwere part of keeping us strong--we do not want to have them disappear. \nSo there is money in here to keep them going, have them in a good state \nof repair, and make necessary investments.\n  In the meantime, the institutions within the DOD and Department of \nEnergy will be advising the Congress on precisely how we ought to, over \na long period of time, maintain the requisite number of nuclear \nwarheads and weapons.\n  We do not have that kind of recommendation yet, and the bill, if not \namended, would have drawn some conclusions in that regard that the \nSenator from New Mexico thought were premature. So that is why this \namendment was offered. That is why we all worked very hard to put it \ntogether.\n  It clearly says the powerful laboratories, including three or four \nthat are helping with it, including the one in the State of Idaho, \nArgonne, and others--that all of these are part of maintaining our \nnuclear stockpile in one way or another and are also part of making \nsure we do the cleanup work and we maintain the capability for storage \nof the fuel that we need that is coming out of the defense side.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment increases the stockpile stewardship \nby $239 million. It maintains the nuclear posture review as the means \nof determining the size of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile. \nIt lifts the prohibition on lab-directed research and development, and \nallows the Secretary to choose between a reactor and accelerator to \nproduce tritium but it locates that in South Carolina, and provides \nadditional stockpile management funding to upgrade the DOE production \ncomplex to meet manufacturing requirements.\n  So I believe when you look at that it is a rather comprehensive \namendment, and it is a substitute for a very major part of the bill.\n  I want to thank Senators on our side who worked together, and it was \nmy privilege--not being on the committee--to work with them in putting \nthis amendment into the form that I believe the Senate ought to adopt \nwithout a dissenting vote.\n  I want to acknowledge Senator Bingaman's actions with reference to \nthis. Obviously in the committee he expressed some doubts about this. \nHe will express those himself today. And clearly working together with \nDemocrats and Republicans, and Senators like Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Nunn, and others, I think this amendment is going to come out \nto be a very forward step in maintaining our nuclear weapon deterrent \nand maintaining the stockpile in an appropriate manner for the next 20, \n30 or even 40 years. I thank Senator Thurmond for yielding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I certainly want to associate myself with \nthe remarks previously made in this regard by the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from New Mexico with regard to the measure \nbefore us, the underlying amendment that was offered the first thing \nthis morning by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  I wholeheartedly support this amendment that was worked out after a \nlot of hard work and a lot of thought. I think it is a very, very sound \namendment. It has the wholehearted support of this Senator.\n  It is a good time though for me to emphasize--with all the work that \nhas been done by all of the parties that have been partially named thus \nfar this morning that I support--that I think the amendment now before \nus, the underlying amendment introduced by the Senator from South \nCarolina, is a great improvement over what came out of the committee, \nand I believe it is nearly unanimously supported. I thank all of those \nwho played a key role in working this out.\n  It is a good time for me to emphasize though that the second-degree \nExon amendment goes after one part of this bill which I will be talking \nabout in greater detail as will many others Senators. That is the part \nof the bill which allows hydronuclear testing which we think is an \nimportant step in the wrong direction, and, if the Exon second-degree \namendment is approved today, I think there will be unanimous support \nfor the bill as introduced by the Senator from South Carolina--if the \nExon-Hatfield, et al., amendment is accepted.\n  With that statement, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield 15 minutes--with my thanks for all the work he has done on \nthis in company with Senator Domenici and others--to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement by the \nSenator from Nebraska, and also the statement by my colleague from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Thurmond amendment and of \nthe Exon second-degree amendment to it. I would first like to explain \nto my colleagues why the Thurmond amendment is an enormous improvement \nover the DOE provisions currently in the bill. There are three \nexceptions and they are being dealt with in the second-degree \namendments being proposed by Senators Exon, Reid, and McCain. I will \nsupport all of those amendments as well.\n  When we debated this bill in committee, I raised numerous objections \nto the DOE provisions. I expressed the view that these provisions took \na series of extreme positions for which there was no support in the \nhearing record of the committee. My objections were summarized in the \ndissenting views I filed in the committee's report. I am pleased to \nreport to my colleagues that the Thurmond substitute amendment has now \ncorrected most of the numerous problems I identified and several that \nwere subsequently identified by the executive branch.\n  Let me highlight the most significant changes:\n  I had criticized the tritium production and plutonium disposition \nprovisions because they would have prejudged ongoing programmatic \nenvironmental impact statements by favoring a multipurpose reactor \napproach--the least likely approach to come out of these studies. The \nThurmond amendment is now neutral on the technical choice. It \nappropriately funds work on tritium targets, work that DOE under \nSecretary Curtis told us in the Strategic Forces Subcommittee hearing \non May 16 would be required under all options.\n  Unfortunately, while backing off from making a technical choice on \ntritium production, the Thurmond amendment now contains a provision \nmandating that any new tritium production facility be sited at Savannah \nRiver. It is that provision which Senator Reid is seeking to strike \nbecause it obviously disadvantages the Nevada test site in the ongoing \nenvironmental impact statement process.\n  The tritium language also makes $10 million available to a university \nconsortium for plutonium research. Senator McCain will seek to ensure \nthat any money spent for university research in this area is \ncompetitively awarded. This is a long-standing policy of the Armed \nServices Committee at least since Senator Tower was chairman.\n  The second area that was problematic in the original bill was a \nseries of provisions--sections 3134, 3163, and 3166--and a $344 million \nfunding add-on aimed at sizing a nuclear weapons manufacturing complex \nat cold war levels when far more cost-effective alternatives are being \ndeveloped in the stockpile stewardship and management programmatic \nenvironmental impact statement process. Those provisions are entirely \nreworked in the Thurmond amendment and the funding for stockpile \nmanagement has been reduced $215 million. There is now no mandate to \nrebuild production capacity to cold war levels. What is left in the \nbill is consistent with the ongoing programmatic environmental impact \nstatement process on stockpile stewardship and management.\n  The third problem in the original bill had to do with laboratory \nmanagement and funding. Senator Domenici referred to this. The original \nbill contained a provision, section 3139, barring the laboratories from \nusing defense program funds for laboratory-directed basic research, the \nlifeblood of the laboratories, and for science education. The bill also \ncut requested funding for dual-use technology partnerships with \nindustry by $249 million. The Thurmond amendment deletes the \nprohibition on use of defense funds for lab-directed basic research and \nscience education, restores $239 million for the stockpile stewardship \ntechnology partnership \n\n[[Page S 11356]]\nand education programs and includes a provision that all of these \nprograms must support national security requirements.\n  The fourth problem in the original bill involved a severe cut in \nrequested funding for nonproliferation and arms control verification \nprogram--a total of $78 million. This would have very seriously damaged \nthe national laboratories' programs in critical areas and slowed the \neffort to bring Russian nuclear weapons facilities under better \nsecurity and safeguards. The Thurmond amendment restores all of that \nfunding.\n  The fifth problem in the original bill involved provisions, sections \n3137 and 3138, which would have put the Department of Energy's defense \nfacilities outside the purview of the National Environmental Policy Act \nand raised a constitutional separation of powers issue according to the \nSecretary of Energy, who opposed them. The Thurmond amendment deletes \nthose provisions.\n  Finally, the original bill included a provision, section 3167, that, \naccording to the statement of administration policy on this bill, would \nhave prohibited international inspections of DOE facilities under the \nterms of the treaty between the United States and the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. The Thurmond amendment deletes this provision, \nwhich I know Senator Pell was very concerned about.\n  This rewrite of the DOE provisions marks a significant improvement in \nthis bill as a whole. It brings this bill into alignment with the \nenergy and water appropriations bill passed on Tuesday evening and with \nthe administration's request with only modest changes. I commend my \nsenior colleagues from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his central \nrole in helping to bring about this result. He did yeoman work on \nconvincing the members of the Armed Services Committee on his side to \naccept these changes. I also commend him for producing in his role as \nchairman of the subcommittee the excellent defense section of the \nenergy and water appropriations bill passed on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, there are still, however three problems with the \nThurmond amendment. I have already mentioned the Reid and McCain \namendments. Let me now turn to the amendment being offered by Senator \nExon.\n  Senator Exon is seeking to strike a provision in the Thurmond \namendment, which was also in the underlying bill. The provision sets \naside $50 million to prepare for hydronuclear testing. The \nadministration did not request funds to carry out hydronuclear tests in \nfiscal year 1996. These are tests with a low yield, usually measured in \npounds of TNT, which provide information about the ignition of the \nprimary of a nuclear weapon. These are expensive tests to conduct, \napproximately the same as for a nuclear weapons test--on the order of \n$10 to $20 million per test.\n  The administration's policy in the ongoing Comprehensive Test Ban \nnegotiations is to limit such tests to a yield of four pounds of TNT. \nThe administration is not opposed in principle to such testing, but the \ntechnical experts have not found tests which are worth doing. A 1994 \nsummer study by a JASON task force, chaired by Sid Drell of Stanford \nUniversity, has recommended against hydronuclear testing. The JASON's \nare a group of the Nation's foremost scientists who under the aegis of \nthe Mitre Corp. advise DOD and DOE on technical matters. They wrote:\n\n       The very limited added value of hydronuclear tests that \n     provide for a brief glimpse into the very early stages of \n     critically have to be weighed against costs, and against the \n     impact of continuing an underground testing program at the \n     Nevada Test Site on U.S. nonproliferation goals. On balance \n     we oppose hydronuclear testing.\n\n  Mr. President, this is frankly a highly complex matter. The bottom \nline for me is that the nuclear weapon stewards in the Department are \nnot crying out for hydronuclear tests within their limited budgets. The \nbest minds in the scientific community on balance do not support them. \nIf a specific problem arises that would require a \nhydronuclear test to resolve, I believe that the \nadministration would request the funds and the test would be conducted \nwithin the 4 pound limit the President has set. But the bill before us \nand the Thurmond amendment insist on spending $50 million to prepare \nfor hydronuclear tests with no specific purpose in mind.\n  I attended the May 16 Strategic Forces Subcommittee hearings on the \nweapons program and I can recall no witness from the laboratories or \nDOE or the Pentagon demanding such test preparations.\n  Mr. President, we can not afford to spend money unwisely when we are \nfighting to bring our deficit under control. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Exon's amendment.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, I am cosponsoring the Thurmond amendment \nbecause it is an enormous improvement in six different areas over the \nexisting bill language. I also support all three efforts to further \nimprove the language in the Thurmond amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I am glad to yield to my colleague from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just wanted to correct one item the \nSenator would not have known about because it was changed last night. \nSenator McCain's request for competitiveness with reference to that $10 \nmillion university project, is in the amendment as offered.\n  I am not speaking for Senator McCain, but I am not sure there will be \nan amendment on that effort because he already prevailed and it is in \nthe amendment that was sent to the desk.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that updated information. I \nthink that is one additional improvement in the Thurmond amendment and \nI, as I say, commend my colleague and others who have worked hard to \nput this amendment together. I hope we can pass it with an overwhelming \nvote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the Exon \namendment, the Exon-Hatfield amendment, and I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 10 minutes or whatever time he needs to the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to, as long as it is on Senator Exon's \ntime.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would like to ask if this would be a convenient time \nfor me to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Very convenient.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I am trying to get ahead of the game at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator has a full committee markup.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator and I thank Senator Exon.\n  Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join with Senator Exon this \nmorning. The Senator from Nebraska is perhaps one of the Senate's most \nknowledgeable persons on the issues involving the nuclear weapons \nstockpile. He has certainly demonstrated leadership in protecting the \nintegrity of the stockpile, as well as the efforts to end nuclear \nproliferation. So I do not believe this is an either/or situation. I \nthink it is a very wise approach that the Senator from Nebraska has \ncreated for us to consider.\n  I think every Senator should be aware that the bill as reported by \nthe Armed Services Committee contains an extremely provocative, \nunnecessary, and expensive provision which would allow for the \npreparation of hydronuclear experiments which would yield expulsions up \nto 20 tons.\n  Mr. President, we got out of that nuclear explosive testing business \n3 years ago by the actions of this body. Three years ago, the Congress \nadopted a moratorium on underground nuclear testing, and this \nmoratorium was put in place as an acknowledgment after hundreds--\nhundreds--of underground tests of our nuclear stockpile. It was in our \nnational interest not to test.\n  The Armed Services Committee in its report justifies this provision \nand the authorization for $50 million to prepare for these tests with a \nstatement that it is concerned about the readiness of the Nevada test \nsite. This is the wrong reason to test. In fact, this is not a reason \n\n[[Page S 11357]]\nat all. It is no reason. I will be interested to learn the source of \nconcerns about the test site's readiness capabilities--who dreamed this \nup, and why the preparation for a hydronuclear test is the preferred \noption for maintaining that readiness. I think we deserve to have that \nkind of information and the source of it.\n  As most Senators know, the Exon-Hatfield-Mitchell law, which \ninitiated our testing moratorium 3 years ago, acknowledged the \npossibility that a resumption of testing could be necessary to ensure \nthe safety and reliability of the stockpile. Following an initial 9-\nmonth moratorium on testing, the Exon-Hatfield-Mitchell law allows for \na 3-year program of limited testing and no more than five tests per \nyear. So there is a flexibility factor already in the law. To date, the \nPresident of the United States has not certified that any weapon in the \narsenal has a safety or reliability problem that would require \nexplosive testing.\n  So certainly the President, who has a role to play in this, and \nespecially through the Department of Defense, has no request for this. \nThis is pure and simple a resurrection of the cold war mentality that \nhas dominated this Congress for too long, especially under the military \nindustrial complex that exists all over this country that former \nPresident Eisenhower warned this country against.\n  Yet the Armed Services Committee is recommending that the full Senate \napprove $50 million to prepare for the commencement of a series of \ntests at the Nevada test site. Why? There is no justification for these \nfunds. There is no request for these funds--not from the Department of \nDefense, not from the President of the United States, not from the \nNational Security Council, not from any body of authority that \nrepresents the major responsibility for protecting this country.\n  The provision included in the bill must be removed. It is dangerous \nand provocative and threatens the goal clearly stated by a Congress \nwhen it adopted the Exon-Hatfield-Mitchell law. That goal is the \nsuccessful negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty.\n  Let me say that again. The goal is a comprehensive test ban treaty, \nnot the renewal of testing to challenge the rest of the nations of the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, current CTB negotiations led by the United States \ncontain a discussion about thermal nuclear tests, but the official \nposition of the United States is that the comprehensive test ban should \nprohibit all nuclear tests exceeding 4 pounds. Four pounds, Mr. \nPresident, not 40,000 pounds as the Armed Services Committee is \nproposing.\n  I believe that the provision in this bill and its accompanying report \nare fatally flawed. Let me read to my colleagues a passage from page \n367 of the Armed Services report:\n\n       The Committee recognizes that the administration is \n     currently negotiating a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in an \n     effort to preclude or make more difficult the spread of \n     nuclear weapons. However, the committee notes that sub-\n     kiloton hydronuclear experiments are not particularly \n     suitable for bomb development or giving foreign military \n     planners confidence in a nuclear weapons design.\n\n  I am stunned by this passage. It is factually incorrect. Independent \nnuclear weapons experts have made it clear that hydronuclear tests are \nuseful to proliferant states attempting to develop nuclear weapons \ncapabilities. That is the very reason the United States comprehensive \ntest ban negotiation position bars such tests over a few pounds of \nyield. This bill ignores these facts and argues that the United States \nshould prepare for tests anyway.\n  It is clear to me and should be to all of my colleagues that the \nprovision included in the bill is at the very best a very unfortunate \nmistake. The President has not requested these tests. The independent \ngroup of nuclear weapons experts known as the JASON group concurs that \ntesting because no safety or reliability problem exists.\n  If this mistake is left unrepaired, it will result in grave \nconsequences. American public opinion is solidly behind the effort to \nachieve a comprehensive test ban treaty and expect our leadership in \nthe negotiations. If this bill is adopted with the current provision \nintact, we will irreparably harm our ability to negotiate a \ncomprehensive test ban. I fully expect the American public and people \naround the world to react with the same astonishment and anger that it \nvented when France announced its decision to resume testing.\n  The Exon-Hatfield proposed amendment must be adopted if we are to \navoid a return to the Dark Ages of a nuclear arms race. Three years ago \nwe were able to end the cycle of vague justifications for underground \nnuclear testing and replace them with concrete requirements which must \nbe met before testing resumes. The provision included in this bill \nbreaks current law and will likely lead to irreparable harm to the \ncomprehensive test ban negotiations.\n  Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, I would make one final note. The Senate has already \ncompleted action on the energy and water appropriations bill, which \ncontains funding for weapons activities. That bill does not include \nfunds for hydronuclear testing. Voting for this amendment would be \nconsistent--that is, voting for our proposed amendment, Senator Exon's \nand mine--with current law as well as appropriations for the coming \nfiscal year. And I can assure the Armed Services Committee I will do \nall within my power as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to \nblock any funding for this kind of foolishness if it should prevail in \nthis final bill.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would add one final note. For the last few days \nI have been asked to interview on my experience in Hiroshima a month \nafter the bomb had been dropped, following World War II. It has only \nbeen the last few years that I would even like to talk about that kind \nof experience. But how--how absolutely immoral, how insensitive to \nbegin to act for this kind of provision on the 50th anniversary of that \nhorrible devastation that was wreaked upon Hiroshima and the people of \nJapan. What a monster we let loose in that situation.\n  It saved my life. I can attest to that because we were stationed for \nthe invasion of Japan at the time. And having been in that occupation \nof September 2, 1945, and seen the following MacArthur order to put a \nwhite sheet before each of the gun emplacements at the very area we \nwere to invade it was like sailing through inland seas of \ncheckerboards. It would have been a murderous crossfire upon which \nprobably who knows, a million people would have lost their lives. But \nnevertheless--nevertheless--not trying to judge in hindsight the wisdom \nof that bomb, the fact is, how insensitive on the 50th anniversary of \nthat bomb to propose something of returning to the Dark Age mentality \nof testing again for increasing the capacity to kill and to destroy \nlife as this would lead us to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield myself such time as I may need from our allotted \ntime.\n  I just want to compliment my very dear friend and colleague from \nOregon for the excellent remarks that he has just made. It puts in \nperspective so dramatically and so honestly and in such a \nstraightforward manner the heart and soul of the Exon-Hatfield \namendment, which is to follow on the Exon-Hatfield amendment of 3 years \nago that we were joined in by the then-majority leader, George \nMitchell. I think maybe we were somewhat surprised when we won that \nvote. But I think it was a giant leap forward in facing up to the \nrealities of the situation that confront us.\n  So I thank my friend and colleague, a man of great wisdom and \nexperience, for outlining in a very articulate fashion his views as to \nwhy the Exon-Hatfield amendment should be adopted, and also backing \nthat up with his vast experience. When he was talking about those dark \ndays of World War II when important decisions were being made, I was at \nClark Field in the Philippines, which had just been taken during that \nparticular period of time. And I know also--not to the extent that I \nbelieve my friend from Oregon did--but we knew full well what was being \nplanned. We knew the sacrifices that were going to have to be made. And \nwhen the Senator from Oregon said his life was probably saved by that \naction, I think that is very much on point.\n  Having said that, I would like to come to the defense for a moment of \nformer Senator Harry Truman, then President Harry Truman, who had the \n\n[[Page S 11358]]\ncourage to make that devastating decision that I believe very likely \nleft its mark on the great President Harry Truman.\n  I am convinced he did the right thing, but it was a horrible thing. \nThe Senator from Oregon has brought that very dramatically to the \nattention of the Senate.\n  Therefore, while I have been known as a hawk, and continue to be a \nhawk, I happen to feel that humanity has to recognize that if we keep \nmaintaining as a major part of our national security the threat of \nanother Hiroshima, then we are in dire circumstances, as far as \nhumanity is concerned.\n  I ask my friend, though, about one part of his remarks, if I \nunderstood them correctly--I suspect there was somewhat an unintended \nunderstatement, if I heard my friend correctly--I believe he said that \nif the Exon-Hatfield amendment is not adopted, it will irreparably harm \nthe chances for a nuclear test ban treaty. I believe those were the \nwell-chosen words the Senator from Oregon used.\n  I happen to think that is a very minimal statement. I simply say if \nthe Exon-Hatfield amendment does not prevail, it will not harm our \neffort for a comprehensive test ban treaty, it will destroy it.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Oregon feels that I am justified in \nmaking that statement a little more stronger than he did in his well-\nchosen remarks?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would not want to debate that issue with the Senator, \nbecause I know that he made that with care, understanding, with great \nfeeling. I do feel, based upon the kind of outpouring of criticism that \nwas leveled by all parts of the world against France for its announced \nintention to resume testing, that it would be escalated by about a \nhundredfold against the United States because of our superb leadership \nrole we play in making those policies that affect the whole world, far \nmore than France. But nevertheless, even with France, it is a setback. \nI think it would be even a greater setback and perhaps lead to total \nimpossibility of success if you resume testing.\n  (Mr. SHELBY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. EXON. I could not agree more and thank my friend for his remarks.\n  Mr. President, the Exon-Hatfield amendment then, if I can repeat that \nagain, is a very simple and straightforward one. It will delete section \n3135 of the bill in its entirety and remove the $50 million \nauthorization for hydronuclear testing that the Senator from Oregon has \naddressed in a very eloquent fashion.\n  Our amendment makes no adjustment to the funding for either the \nstockpile stewardship program or the overall Energy Department budget. \nOur amendment is funding neutral. It simply removes the authorization \nin the bill to use $50 million to resume nuclear weapons testing, and \nthe reasons for removing that and not doing it have been adequately \naddressed already by my colleague from Oregon and the junior Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Three years ago, as was alluded to by Senator Hatfield, a strong \nbipartisan coalition in both Houses of Congress twice approved a plan \nto phase out nuclear weapons testing and give the moribund \ncomprehensive test ban negotiations a shot in the arm. Successful \nnegotiation of a global comprehensive test ban treaty would \nsignificantly advance the cause of nuclear weapons proliferation by \ndenying those nations tempted to develop nuclear capability the means \nto prove out their weapons. Getting that done, in the view of this \nSenator, is absolutely essential.\n  The Senator from Oregon, Mr. President, raised some rather \ninteresting questions in his riveting remarks to the Senate this \nmorning. He said, why is this included in the defense authorization \nbill? It was not requested by the administration. How did it creep back \nin? I suggest the answer to the question is that, despite all of our \nefforts to the contrary, there are people embedded in the Pentagon \ntoday that want to resume nuclear testing on a full-scale basis. This \nis a step in that direction, a very important and a very ill-timed one, \nin the opinion of this Senator.\n  Those people deep inside the Pentagon, and associated with it, have \ntried to influence the President of the United States to lift his \nobjections, which he has stated over and over and over again to not \nbegin nuclear testing by the United States of America, who is far ahead \nof any real, imagined or invented future enemies that might be a \nnuclear threat. If we begin testing today, it will be viewed by the \nrest of the world as they are currently reviewing and showing their \ndistress of the French and their distress of the Chinese for the \ntesting in this area that they are about as of now.\n  We must not join. The attack that will be launched against China and \nFrance and the United States of America, the leader in this field, is a \nterrible step in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, I feel so strongly about this issue. I talked a great \ndeal yesterday, along with others, about the ballistic missile defense \nsystem. And on a close vote, the Senate validated the actions of our \nArmed Services Committee in that regard. I think that was a terrible \nmistake, but it has been done. But if we do not adopt the Exon-Hatfield \namendment and go ahead with this program that is an open invitation, \nmuch more than a camel's nose under the tent, to start the nuclear race \nall over again, we will have essentially no one but ourselves to blame.\n  A comprehensive test ban would also freeze in place the inherent \nadvantage of the United States, as it has at the present time, because \nwe possess the most tested and proven nuclear stockpile ever. After \n1,148 nuclear weapons tests over 50 years, the United States possesses \nthe safest and most reliable nuclear weapons in the world. No one can \nargue with that.\n  The resulting law that we talked about earlier, called the Hatfield-\nExon-Mitchell law, enacted an initial 9 months testing moratorium \nperiod, followed by 3 years of limited weapons testing, if necessary. \nAnd the Senator from Oregon referenced that in his remarks this \nmorning.\n  During this 3-year period, no more than 5 safety and reliability \ntests could be conducted each year, for a total of 15 tests. Approval \nfor the tests are to be sought from Congress through an annual testing \nreport outlining the justification for such testing.\n  To date, no authority to conduct any weapons tests have been sought \nby the administration, and along with Russia, which, of course, are \nwatching us in this area, we have not tested. Now comes France, and we \nall observe as to what they have done recently with regard to tests.\n  Likewise, I will mention once again the concern I have with the \nChinese action. But during the time following enactment of the \nHatfield-Exon-Mitchell law, those nations, led by the United States, \nhave been working hard to reach agreement in Geneva on a comprehensive \ntest ban treaty.\n  If we want to flush that down the drain, then defeat the Exon-\nHatfield, et al., amendment.\n  I must confess, Mr. President, that I have had some rather angry \nwords with certain administration officials on this particular matter. \nWhile the President has been steadfast, there are some close to him who \nare wishy-washy on this issue. I hope the President will listen to \nthose of us who have done a great deal of study and have a great deal \nof concern about this. And I think the President will, notwithstanding \nthe fact that some of those closest to him are wishy-washy on the \nissue, and I have told that to them to their face.\n  After 2 years of negotiations, we are hopeful that we are entering \nmaybe some kind of an end-game with regard to a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. The nuclear and nonnuclear nations of the world are on track to \nreach an agreement, possibly, by 1996--a goal expressly endorsed by not \nonly the United States, but China, Russia, and France. No one should \nignore the fact that the permanent extension of the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty was obtained this spring with the assurance \nprovided by the nuclear powers that a comprehensive test ban treaty \nwould soon follow. The world is in agreement: It is time to close the \nnuclear Pandora's box, and a comprehensive test ban treaty is a \nsignificant step toward that end. Let us not kill the possibility.\n  I recount the history of this issue so as to provide a context for \nbetter understanding the real reason why the Armed Services Committee \nprovided $50 million for hydronuclear testing. Let no Senator \nmisunderstand the true \n\n[[Page S 11359]]\nintent behind this provision of the bill. Its purpose is to bust out of \nthe nuclear testing moratorium we have been observing for the past 3 \nyears as a result of the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell bill that has been \nreferenced on several occasions this morning. It wants the United \nStates to renege on our commitment made during the NPT conference. It \nhopes to scuttle the comprehensive test ban treaty negotiations now \nunderway.\n  The cumulative effect of these consequences will be to undermine our \nefforts to halt the spread of nuclear weapons around the world. As a \nresult, our national security will be weakened, not enhanced, by the \nresumption of nuclear weapons testing and a new nuclear race will be in \nfull swing. Our standing as a world leader will be irreparably harmed \non the issue of nonproliferation. For proof of these things to come, \nsimply look at the world condemnation over the recent French decision \nto resume testing. The world is astonished, but the French, in their \nway, go ahead as they always do. Let us not follow their course.\n  Some may ask, what is a hydronuclear test exactly? The simple \ndefinition is that it is a very low yield detonation--usually measured \nat a few pounds of explosive yield--to assess primary performance and \nsafety of warheads. While a high-explosive explosion generates \nsufficient energy to melt the core of the weapon, the nuclear energy \nrelease is insufficient to cause the bomb to reach full criticality and \nwith the possibility that it would explode with full power. It is true \nthat the U.S. negotiation position in Geneva would allow for such \nexperiments not to exceed 4 pounds of yield under a comprehensive test \nban treaty. However, a treaty agreement has not been reached, and it is \nthe present administration policy not to conduct such tests outside the \ntreaty. I hope the President and the administration maintain that \nposition.\n  Moreover, the authorization bill seems to use the term ``hydronuclear \nexperiments'' rather loosely. As section 3165 of the bill notes, the \ntests to be performed may be measured not in terms of pounds of TNT \nyield, but rather in tons. That was stated in somewhat different form \nby the Senator from Oregon in his remarks to the Senate this morning. \nThe type of nuclear tests the committee majority has in mind are not--I \nemphasize ``not,'' Mr. President--traditional hydronuclear tests. They \nare looking at detonation with yields up to 40,000 pounds-- that is a \nwhole lot more than 4 pounds--or 20 tons of explosive power.\n  The $50 million authorization provided in the bill for these nuclear \nweapons tests is a particularly mischievous add-on to the President's \nbudget request. The mandate is in violation of existing law, which \nstates that all proposed nuclear tests be included in the annual \nadministration report on our Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile and the \nneed, if any, to conduct tests. Specifically, the bill violates the \nprovision of the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell law that states, ``Only the \nnumbers and types of tests specified in the report * * * may be \ntested.''\n  In short, the bill totally negates the process already in existence \nfor proposing and approving, with congressional concurrence, new \nnuclear weapons tests.\n  More central to the point is whether these new tests are really \nneeded. No safety or reliability problem is known to exist with any of \nour Nation's nuclear weapons to justify a resumption of weapons \ntesting. On this most important point, there is no disagreement. \nAdministration officials, from the laboratories to the Secretaries of \nDefense and Energy, all the way up to the President, are unanimous in \nthis opinion. Even the JASON group--also referenced by the Senator from \nOregon in his remarks this morning--an assembly of outside nuclear \nweapons experts, concurs with the finding that no safety or reliability \nproblem exists, and that the restart of nuclear testing is not \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, there is no explanation in the committee bill as to \nwhich warheads are to be tested, or which weapons, why they are to be \ntested--though, in a very vague fashion, almost a carte blanche \nauthority--and they do not even say how many tests are allowed. There \nis no limit.\n  Absent a known safety or reliability problem, the primary purpose for \nthe resumption of testing is unknown. If it is to maintain worker \nexpertise at the Nevada test site, it should be made clear that the \ncommittee has received no testimony to suggest that the testing \nexpertise is eroding, or if it was, the proposed authorization to use \n$50 million to resume testing would stem this.\n  There is not any question but that this Senator has stood at the \nforefront--because we live in an uncertain world, and we have no way of \nknowing what the next move in the world, especially in nuclear testing \nis going to be--I have been at the forefront in maintaining a facility, \nwith the people at the Nevada test site to be there, to do the testing, \nif an emergency arises.\n  I suggest that the true reason for the committee action is the basic \nbelief that the United States should test for the sake of testing. It \nis a good thing to do, some seem to feel, even if it means undermining \nour Nation's efforts to close Pandora's box and halt the spread of \nnuclear weapons around the globe.\n  American leadership in the world community is strongest when we lead \nby example. We should continue to do that--lead by example. There is \nnever more the case than in the area of nuclear weapons testing. We \nmust continue to lead, and we must be responsible.\n  Contrary to the committee direction, there is no reason, Mr. \nPresident, to restart nuclear weapons testing. American public opinion \nhas been solid against such a proposition for quite some time. Our \ncountry is poised to join the world community in taking a historic step \ntoward limiting the number of nuclear states in the future.\n  Seriously endangering these efforts, as the committee testing \nprovision would do, we will be working against the very national \nsecurity interests that we profess to support in other areas of the \nbill, such as ballistic missile defense funding and, of course, the \nNunn-Lugar program.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Exon-Hatfield, et \nal., amendment and turn back this misguided attempt to fire up the cold \nwar rhetoric of the past.\n  After 1,100 nuclear detonations, our stockpile is safe. It is \nreliable. It is time to concern ourselves with whether other nations \nare going to start and deploy their own nuclear arsenals.\n  The resumption of U.S. nuclear weapons testing will doom--will doom--\nthe comprehensive test ban negotiations, and in the process, give the \ngreen light to the world leaders, hoping to find superpower status in \nthe form of even a nuclear bomb or two.\n  Our amendment is a choice between priorities. A vote for the Exon-\nHatfield, et al., amendment is a vote against the spread of nuclear \nweapons. A vote against our amendment is a vote for more testing and an \nabdication of responsible U.S. leadership.\n  We would be no different from the French, in their decision to test--\nan object of worldwide ridicule and derision.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully think and then cast \ntheir vote, which I think and hope will be overwhelming, for the cause \nof halting the spread of nuclear weapons, and support the Exon-\nHatfield, et al., amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 31 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from South Carolina has 61 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the chairman of \nthe committee, the manager of this bill, and extend my congratulations \nto him, also, for the amendment that he has offered.\n  This amendment removes the triple play reactor for tritium \nproduction, appropriately shifts more funds to stockpile stewardship, \nrestores stewardship funding for industrial partnerships that are \ncritical to the new technology development for stockpile stewardship, \nand restores verification funding critical to fighting nuclear \nproliferation\n   I am also very pleased to see that the amendment endorses test \nreadiness and hydronuclear tests.\n  There is only one problem I have with the amendment, and under the \n\n[[Page S 11360]]\n  unanimous-consent request I will offer an amendment at a subsequent \ntime about that.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues in the Senate that I have the \ndeepest respect for the senior Senator from Nebraska and the senior \nSenator from Oregon. I say to my friend from Nebraska that he could not \nbe more wrong. He keeps talking about nuclear testing. This has nothing \nto do with nuclear testing. That is the whole point of the experiments \nwe are talking about. They are not nuclear tests.\n  Mr. President, there has been reference by the Senator from Nebraska \nand the Senator from Oregon about the JASON report. We will talk about \nthe JASON report.\n  In July of this year, July 25, a couple of weeks ago, the new JASON \nreport, the one that we should be talking about, says:\n       Underground testing of nuclear weapons at any yield level \n     below that required to initiate boosting is of limited value \n     to the United States. However, experiments involving high \n     explosive and fissionable materials that do not reach \n     criticality are useful in our understanding of the behavior \n     of weapon materials under relevant physical conditions. They \n     should be included among treaty consistent activities . . .\n  The report cited by the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from New \nMexico--they should have read the more recent version, because it \nsupports what the Senator from South Carolina is doing with this \namendment.\n  With all due respect, they should not be throwing around the JASON \nreport, because quoting from the JASON report arrives at the opposite \nconclusion.\n  Now, we will also talk about this as it relates to Nevada. Mr. \nPresident, this is not some kind of a pork issue for Nevada. The bill \nprovides funds for a program of hydronuclear experiments at the nuclear \nweapons design laboratories at the Nevada test site.\n  I assure Members that it was written to assure that the majority of \nfunds would go to the weapons laboratories which are not in Nevada. \nThey are in New Mexico and one in California. The funds will go to the \nlabs, regardless of how the vote on this amendment turns out.\n  Very little, if any, of the funds will go to the Nevada test site. My \nconcern is not dollars to Nevada, but, rather, making it clear that \nthese experiments are important and should be allowed to commence.\n  I also caution the stewardship supporters that support the Exon \namendment could be interpreted as a prohibition of experiments the labs \nare currently contemplating at the labs and at the test site. I think \npeople should be very careful about the intent of this amendment, and \nwhat the final result would be if the amendment is adopted.\n  There is no accepted definition of hydronuclear experiments. Mischief \ncan and will be done if this amendment is passed. If the amendment is \ndefeated, the decision on hydronuclear experiments will revert to the \nPresident, where it belongs.\n  I am forever amazed, Mr. President, that we are elected to the \nlegislative branch of Government. But it seems we have 535 Secretaries \nof State.\n We have people who seem to think that they know better than the \nexecutive branch.\n\n  The Exon amendment is to limit stewardship, it is to limit readiness, \nand, of course, hydronuclear experiments. For 3 years we have let our \nnuclear weapons competence deteriorate. It is now time to end that \ndeterioration. Not to return to the cold war--no one wants to do that--\nbut to maintain and protect our nuclear deterrence and our nuclear \nexpertise.\n  The Senator who offered the amendment has stated on a number of \noccasions that there have been a lot of tests conducted. Sure there \nhave been a lot of tests conducted. Carl Lewis has been running and \nbroad jumping and doing all the other things he does for 12 or 15 \nyears. If he stops, he loses that touch. You must continue to work on \nsomething you are good at--recognizing that we led the world in safety \nand reliability of nuclear weapons. Of course we did. Why? Because we \ncontinually worked at it and we should not just give up on that.\n  Stockpile stewardship is critical to maintaining a safe, secure, \nreliable nuclear stockpile. Stockpile stewardship is also underfunded, \nbut that is not the debate here today. As long as we own nuclear \nweapons--there is no doubt we will own them for the foreseeable \nfuture--we have an obligation to ourselves and to the world to keep \nthem safe, secure and reliable.\n  My friend who has offered this amendment has attempted to make this a \nnuclear testing issue. The problem in the world today is not because of \nnuclear testing. We are not going to do nuclear testing. Even if this \namendment is defeated, we are not going to do nuclear testing. The \nproblem in the world today is nuclear weapons, and these experiments \nwill do nothing to harm the negotiations that are taking place for the \ncomprehensive test ban, which I support. I repeat, as long as we own \nnuclear weapons--and there is no doubt we will own them for the \nforeseeable future--we have an obligation to ourselves and the rest of \nthe world to keep them safe.\n  The Senator from Oregon stated we have had hundreds of tests. Of \ncourse we have had hundreds of tests. But those tests, the majority of \nthem, were for new weapons development. You cannot have this huge \nnuclear arsenal we are going to have for the foreseeable future and \njust let it sit. So long as we choose to own nuclear weapons, without \nthe benefit of full-scale nuclear testing--and we are not talking about \ndoing full-scale nuclear testing--we must support a fully funded \nstockpile stewardship program. This bill recognizes we must support the \nability to resume testing, which is referred to as ``readiness.''\n  I appreciate the complimentary statement of the author of this \namendment regarding readiness. But, until we have proven that the \nalternative, the stockpile stewardship and management program, will \nwork, we must retain the ability to test in an emergency.\n  Furthermore, this bill, the underlying bill, recognizes that \nreadiness can only be achieved cost effectively as a byproduct of \nongoing experimental programs. The experimental program at the test \nsite has been put on hold for a long time. We have acknowledged that. \nThere was a legitimate break in the test and experimental program, as \nthe laboratories reassessed what needed to be done. I have heard the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico talk for hours about the ability of the \nlabs to do what is important, scientifically, for this country. I \naccept that and I agree with that. We have had these labs, the best in \nthe world, the best the world has ever known--we have had these labs \nreassess what needs to be done in a world without nuclear testing. \nBecause, no matter what the Senator from Oregon says, no matter what \nthe Senator from Nebraska says, we are not talking about nuclear \ntesting. Our laboratories have said: We have reassessed this in light \nof the fact we do not believe there is going to be further nuclear \ntesting. They say to give us confidence in our nuclear weapons, a \ntransition must be made.\n  That is what we are talking about and that is why I support the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  There was some added delay that came in deference to politics --not \ngood science; politics--to the extension of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty. That treaty has been extended. I supported \nthat. We are now engaged in comprehensive test ban negotiations, but \nthe experiments the labs have proposed for 1996, and the President \nwould approve, are clearly well within the scope of any potential \ncomprehensive test ban. They are also well outside the scope of the \nHatfield-Exon-Mitchell testing limitation.\n  If there is any problem in the bill because of report language or \nsome vague, abstract thought process that people may have, I have \nacknowledged to the Senator from Nebraska we will put specific \nlanguage--I should say more specific language--in the bill saying the \ntests are limited to no more than 4 pounds. I made that offer. But \npeople do not want to accept that. They want to fight on nuclear \ntesting, and there is no nuclear testing. We cannot fight about \nsomething that does not exist.\n  I repeat, we will offer to say there can be no experiment--not a \ntest--no experiment over 4 pounds; not tons, not kilotons, not \nmegatons--4 pounds. How big is 4 pounds?\n  My dad was a miner. I used to go down, as a boy, with him in the \nmines. He would drill the holes and he would load the holes, tamp that \npowder in--sticks of dynamite. He would put in 4 \n\n[[Page S 11361]]\npounds, and 4 pounds is not very much, Mr. President. We acknowledge \nthat. We agree to that. Because that is what the amendment of the \nSenator from South Carolina talks about, is those experiments of 4 \npounds or less.\n  But no one has agreed to accept that. Why? Because they want to \ndebate here on nuclear testing. This is not what the debate is about. \nThis is not nuclear testing.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to vote against this Exon amendment. What \ndoes this amendment mean for U.S. policy? The United States is trying \nto negotiate a comprehensive test ban by the end of this year. Our goal \nis to end nuclear testing. Our goal is also to preserve the right to do \ntreaty-compliant experiments, and that is what we are talking about \nhere today. Hydronuclear experiments would be included in this.\n  We passed a resolution earlier this session of Congress to continue \nto hold firm in seeking these goals. I supported that. That was the \nright way to go. Recently, 24 Senators wrote the President to request \nthat he not change his strategy. That strategy includes the experiments \nwe are talking about in this amendment--not big tests; but experiments \nof less than 4 pounds. Are we now telling the President to change his \nstrategy, to no longer seek to assure the right to do these important \nexperiments? I hope the answer is no, and that the record will show \nthat the answer is no, because otherwise this amendment is much more \ndangerous than it appears on the surface.\n  What is a hydronuclear experiment?\n  Could I ask the Chair how much time of the 20 minutes does the \nSenator from Nevada have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada currently has \napproximately 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. What is a hydronuclear experiment? I am quoting:\n\n       Nuclear materials, either plutonium or uranium are \n     configured with high explosives in a geometry very similar to \n     a nuclear explosion. The amount of material and/or the \n     geometry are chosen so that no--\n\n  I underline or underscore ``no.''\n\n     nuclear chain reaction will occur when the explosion is \n     detonated. Nuclear reactions occur and radiation is emitted \n     in tiny quantities. By historic convention, in the United \n     States the yield of an experiment is less than 4 pounds of \n     TNT equivalent.\n\n  This is a millionth of a kiloton. This is 4 pounds.\n  The vast majority of informed experts that have studied the issue of \nthe safety and reliability of nuclear weapons, including the JASON \ngroup--including the JASON group--who have studied the issue of the \nsafety and reliability of nuclear weapons, recognize the importance of \ndoing the experiments we are talking about today.\n  The only substantial debate is over the value or the size or the \nyield of these various experiments. That debate is going on in the \nGovernment now. But remember, we have agreed to clearly indicate, in \nthis amendment, that it would be no more than 4 pounds.\n  So that is what the bill seeks to support. That is why we need \nhydronuclear experiments. And that is why we should support this bill \nand defeat the Exon amendment.\n  This is not, I repeat, a fight over nuclear testing. We should not \nlet this become a fight over nuclear testing. Nothing in this bill will \nlead us to break any treaty, to break any existing law, or to end our \ntesting moratorium.\n  To compare 4-pound experiments to what the French or Chinese are \ndoing is stretching one's imagination beyond my ability to comprehend. \nThe French are setting off kilotons in the middle of the ocean. In the \nChinese deserts, they are setting off kilotons, thousands of tons of \nTNT.\n  So to try to compare that to these tiny little experiments in which \nyou could carry the dynamite around in your pockets, 4 pounds, is \nabsolutely absurd.\n  We know that the President will only approve treaty compliance \nexperiments. We know the President's position on a comprehensive test \nban. He has made it very clear. This bill will not change the \nPresident's position on that. The issue is whether you can conduct \nthese experiments. The only experiments being proposed by the labs or \nthe Department of Energy are treaty compliance, and well within the \nscope of any plausible test ban treaty.\n  The experimental preparations called for in this bill are long \noverdue. We are talking about experimental preparations that will be \ndone in laboratories.\n  Senator Exon and others are concerned about this bill leading to an \nundermining of U.S. efforts to conclude a comprehensive test ban. There \nis no basis for that concern. First of all, the President must approve \nall nuclear tests or hydronuclear experiments. And we all know that he \nwill not approve any experiment that is not consistent with our \nnegotiating position.\n  Second, the hydronuclear experiments that would be considered by the \nnuclear weapons laboratories and the Department of Energy will not have \nyield that would be considered a nuclear tests under U.S. law or under \ninternational conventions. What this bill will do is get our Nation \nmoving on fully developing our stockpile stewardship program.\n  Is there anything wrong with wanting to make sure that these weapons \nthat we have are safe and reliable? No one is talking about building \nnew weapons or new weapons systems. Should we not have a stockpile, no \nmatter how large or how small, that is safe and reliable? I hope the \nanswer cries out as yes.\n  An essential element of a program like this is a program of \nexperiments that uses both nuclear materials and high explosives, a \nprogram of hydrodynamic experiments and hydronuclear experiments. This \nbill says that we have delayed these experiments long enough, and it is \ntime to move with an experimental program and do it soon.\n  This program is critical to stockpile stewardship. This program is \ncritical to readiness. And let me add that readiness to testing is \ncritical until we have fully established that we can maintain the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile without nuclear \ntesting. This is not an attempt to start testing. This is an attempt to \nfind an alternative to testing and at the same time preserve our \ncapability to resume testing if our national security demands it.\n  We must be concerned about the dangers of an accidental explosion. We \nmust be concerned that we have a safe and reliable stockpile.\n  I again refer to the professional group that was talked about by the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from Oregon, giving great \ncredence to the JASON report. I again read from their own sources. \nTheir own sources say, however, that experiments involving high \nexplosives and fissionable material that do not reach criticality are \nuseful in improving our understanding of the behavior of weapons \nmaterials under relevant physical conditions. They should be included \namong the treaty's consistent activities.\n  I suggest that if you are going to use something as a source, you \nshould use the latest source. And the latest source is July 25, 1995, \nwhere the JASON group supports what the committee has agreed to in this \nbill. Based upon the JASON report of good common sense, logic, and the \nsafety and reliability of our weapons, this amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I was hoping we could move back and forth on \ntime. There are 31 minutes left on our side.\n  I would like to have a better balance on time. But if there is no \nspeaker ready to go over here, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, this discussion is taking place on the anniversary of \nthe end of World War II and the use of atomic weapons, as we all are \naware from the news reports of the last few days. It was the first time \nwe really had weapons of mass destruction used like this, and we saw \nwhat nuclear weapons could do. My view in that area, as an aside, is \nthat we really saved lives, both Japanese and American, by what \nhappened out there. But out of World War II we came into the cold war, \nwhere bomb and missile development became very major programs and \nbecame survival for this country.\n  At the same time, though, that we were proceeding along those lines, \nwe kept our concerns about the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear \nmaterial, and hoped all along that someday we \n\n[[Page S 11362]]\ncould get control of our nuclear stockpiles as well as those of our \nmajor adversary for all of those years, the Soviet Union. Then, in the \nmeantime, we hoped that others could be persuaded not to go the nuclear \nroute. We had hopes that someday we might get control of some of these \nmatters. Until that day, we wanted to prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons. We did not want to see nuclear information, nuclear weapons, \nbe spread to smaller and smaller nations where maybe their use would be \ncommon in border wars and things that the rest of the world would not \ndeem that important. And we would see new levels of terror around the \nworld that would make Hiroshima and Nagasaki look like tiny \nfirecrackers compared to the potential of what might happen.\n  So what did we do? Well, in the hope that we might be able to make \nsome advances in this area, we formed the Nonproliferation Treaty, and \nwe have just gone through the 25th anniversary. The purpose of NPT was \nto tell nations foursquare with the nuclear weapons route, if you will, \nthat we will cooperate with you on peaceful uses of nuclear material \nfor medicines or whatever purposes. Meanwhile, we will try to get \ncontrol of this nuclear stockpile on both sides, Soviet and American, \ntry to get it under control.\n  We passed legislation here in 1978 just a couple of years or 3 years \nafter I came into the Senate called the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act. \nThe Pressler amendment came much later. Other laws have been put on the \nbooks through the years, all with the objective of keeping control of \nnuclear weapons around the world.\n  We finally at last, in our day and time, are seeing a reduction in \nthese stockpiles of weapons. We still hope that we can get to a \ncomprehensive test ban sometime, one that is verifiable and justifies \nthe faith that these other nations have placed in the United States. So \nhere we are, in 1995, having really moved down the road a long, long \nway. We have made a lot of progress.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise to speak as a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Nebraska, Mr. Exon, to strike what I view \nas an ill-advised provision in the bill pertaining to low-yield testing \nof nuclear weapons.\n  On May 12, 178 parties to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty agreed \nto make that treaty permanent. That was a big fight. They agreed to \nmake that treaty permanent, not a 5-year review as we have been going \nthrough, but to make it permanent. And America's success in achieving \nthis outcome was substantially encouraged by promises made by the \nnuclear weapons states to conclude, to do everything we could to \nconclude a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty by 1996.\n  Shortly after the celebration died down, after that NPT extension, \nChina set off a nuclear device, and said more would follow. France then \ndeclared it, too, would fire off a few before halting next year. China \ncontinues to support the right to conduct so-called PNE's, peaceful \nnuclear explosions. These steps by China and France do not help at all \nto advance the cause of nuclear nonproliferation of either variety--\nhorizontal nonproliferation which seeks to prevent the geographical \nspread of the bomb in more countries, or vertical proliferation which \nseeks to prevent the increased growth and sophistication of weapons \nalready in the stockpiles of the nuclear weapons states.\n  Yet, instead of expressing its opposition to the actions of France \nand China and proceeding along the lines that we have developed through \nall of these years, the hoped-for area where we really could get \nnuclear stockpiles under control, the Armed Services Committee voted on \nJune 29 to require the President to make ``preparations to commence \nlow-yield hydronuclear experiments,'' a policy that would substitute \nlow-test for no test.\n  It was stated here that these have nothing to do with nuclear \nexplosions, but they do. The title of them is hydronuclear--small \namounts, very small amounts, but they are nuclear experiments. They are \nlow-test nuclear experiments. That is the definition of them. That is \nthe reason they are called hydronuclear experiments.\n  These experiments are basically an attempt to say that we will look \nat the hydro characteristics of a low-yield explosion-- in other words, \nthe wave patterns, the way the motion occurs internally, combine that \nwith computer techniques that can tell us something about safety. That \nis true. But it could also be used by a nation that could develop \nsophisticated computer techniques to give them a lot of clues how to go \nahead and do their own weapons development.\n  So the question comes down to, do we want a comprehensive test ban or \ndoes this undermine a comprehensive test ban?\n  In the dreams of its supporters, this action could well pave the way \nfor nuclear test explosions with yields ranging from 4 pounds to \nseveral hundred tons of TNT equivalent--even within something called a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And recall, 100 tons is 200,000 pounds \nequivalent of TNT--100 tons, 200,000 pounds of TNT.\n  By comparison, the blasts at Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center \nwere equivalent to the explosive yield of between 1,000 and 2,000 \npounds of TNT. The FBI has not released its official estimate figure \nyet, but it is in the ballpark because on August 3, 1995, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms informed my staff that their own \nexplosives experts estimate the yield of the Oklahoma City bomb at \nabout 2,100 pounds of TNT equivalent.\n  More explosive than these detonations, however, will be the punch \nthat will come from angry members of the global nonproliferation regime \nif the United States and the other nuclear weapons States start to play \ngames over their commitment not to engage in any further nuclear tests, \nwhich was a key item during deliberations over whether we were going to \nextend the NPT. Many of these countries have already sent a blizzard of \ndemarches, aide-memoirs, nonpapers, and other such diplomatic missives \nto remind the United States and the other nuclear weapons States about \nthat basic arms control and nonproliferation goal, perhaps best \nsummarized in the preamble of the NPT itself of seeking to achieve the \ndiscontinuance of all test explosives of nuclear weapons for all time.\n  Any resumption by the United States of such tests, or even active \npreparations to resume such testing, would jeopardize this hard-won \nconsensus on the permanent extension of the NPT.\n  Essentially, if we heed the nuclear testing policy dictated in this \nbill, we will only invite the following type of collective declaration \nby the nonnuclear weapons States: Halt all testing or we leave the \ntreaty. I think some nations might well do that. If we are having \ntrouble today affording a limited missile defense and curbing the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons within the NPT and ABM Treaties, just \nimagine how worse these conditions would be if these treaties \ncollapsed. I do not think we can afford to take such a risk.\n  The testing policy dictated in this bill is all the more mystifying \ngiven that even veteran bomb designers do not believe that low-yield \nnuclear test explosions are vital to ensure either the safety or \nreliability of our nuclear stockpile.\n  Former Livermore Director Herbert York does not believe such tests \nare necessary. We have conflicting testimony here about the JASONs. And \nthe JASONs, I might add, are an advisory group to the Department of \nDefense. They are academics and defense experts, think-tank experts. \nThey are one of the most top-level scientific groups that advises the \nDepartment of Defense, so their expertise in this area is without \nquestion.\n  Now, the JASONs in the past have said they see some advantages to \nthis type of testing but the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages \nin the dangers to nonproliferation, to the NPT, and so on--outweigh \nthis--and that has been their view in the past. Another view was \nexpressed on the floor this morning. We are asking for some \nclarification of that. And I hope we can get that before our debate \nhere is concluded this morning.\n  In November 1994, just last fall, the JASONs specifically cited the \neffect of renewed underground nuclear testing upon U.S. \nnonproliferation goals as grounds for their conclusion that they oppose \nit. After considering NPT and considering the advantages, and some of \nwhich there were, they say, ``On balance, we oppose hydronuclear \ntesting.''\n  That was last November. Even our nuclear weapon labs have come around \n\n\n[[Page S 11363]]\nto the view that such testing is not necessary to maintain the nuclear \narsenal.\n  Dr. Frank Von Hippel, until recently the Assistant Director for \nNational Security in the White House Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy, goes so far as to say that a resumption of nuclear testing--and \nthis would be just low-level nuclear testing, hydronuclear testing\n\n     . . . would be seen as a fraud by virtually all of the 170 \n     nonnuclear states that agreed this spring to an indefinite \n     extension of the Nonproliferation Treaty after receiving a \n     commitment that a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would be \n     signed next year . . . Based on U.S. experience, the \n     objective value of ``reliability'' tests is negligible in \n     comparison with the costs of reneging on the deal with the \n     nonweapons States, which promises that we will all work \n     together against the spread and to reduce the numbers of \n     these terrible devices.\n\n  That was published in the Los Angeles Times on July 26 of this year.\n  We have all sorts of definitions of ``comprehensive,'' I guess. I \nthink comprehensive is pretty clear myself, but comprehensive to me \nmeans these lower-level tests also. So we need obviously a bit more \npredictability when we attempt to forge a national policy or craft a \npermanent international treaty. But we cannot go on unilaterally \ncontriving new definitions of our international treaty commitments, a \nlesson that unfortunately has yet to be learned by supporters of \nprovisions in the current bill addressing the ABM Treaty.\n  Mr. President, a basic nuclear fission explosion is caused when a \nchemical explosion forces a sudden release of energy from the nucleus \nof atoms, typically plutonium or highly enriched uranium. In testing a \nnuclear explosive device, there is no nuclear explosion if the total \nenergy released from a detonation is equal to the yield from the \ndetonation of just the chemical explosives in that test device. If, \nhowever, you get some energy release greater than the energy that is \nreleased from the chemical explosive, then you have a nuclear \nexplosion. A device that produces such explosions is what we call a \nnuclear explosive device.\n  Under current nuclear proliferation sanctions legislation, our \ncountry imposes tough sanctions if nuclear nonweapons states detonate a \ndevice that produces a nuclear yield of only 1 pound, 1 pound of TNT \nequivalent.\n  The source for that is section 834 of the Nuclear Proliferation \nPrevention Act of 1994, Public Law 103-236. This was a standard used by \nthe United States during a nuclear test moratorium between 1958 and \n1961. It was used at that time to define what was called a hydronuclear \nexperiment.\n  Section 3135 of the current bill makes available $50 million for, \n``Preparation for the commencement of a program of hydronuclear \nexperiments.'' Later on, in section 3165 of the bill, the bill makes it \nclear that this bill intends to include detonations with nuclear yields \non the order of 20 tons of TNT to fall within the category of \n``hydronuclear tests''--that is in the bill--although the series of \ntests during the old moratorium had nuclear yield of far less than a \npound of TNT.\n  The bill is therefore not only an extreme diversion from historic \nU.S. practice but in establishing a 4-pound testing level, it adopts a \nstandard that is four times higher than the standard we now apply to \nother countries in implementing our nuclear proliferation laws.\n I think it opens up a Pandora's box for arms control professionals and \nintelligence professionals who are responsible for verifying compliance \nwith a comprehensive test ban. Verifying such a ban is difficult \nenough, but I think it is far easier to verify that there have been no \nnuclear explosions whatsoever, than it is to determine whether a given \nnuclear explosion at an unknown location had a yield of 1, 3, 4, 5 \npounds, or whatever.\n\n  Moreover, our current 1-pound definition for sanctions, which is \nstill the law, has nothing to do with restraints on nuclear testing. As \nI clearly stated on the floor in my remarks a couple years ago, on May \n27, 1993, this definition:\n\n       . . . is not intended to foreclose any other definition \n     that may be adopted in the course of the negotiation of any \n     future international agreement limiting the testing of \n     nuclear explosive devices, including a Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty.\n\n  I would today go further and say, no test ban treaty that deserves \nthe word ``comprehensive'' in its title can allow nuclear explosions of \nany size, period. That is what comprehensive means, no nuclear \nexplosions.\n  Explosive tests at even 1 pound and below can give a proliferant \ncountry some potential benefits, no doubt about that, especially in the \nareas of weapons safety, though there is no indication that any \nproliferant country has chosen that route to acquire the bomb. When you \ngo to 4 pounds, then 40 pounds, then 400 pounds, and beyond, then you \nobviously run into more and more proliferation risks. We drew the line \nat 1 pound for sanctions purposes many years ago, not to legitimize \ntests below that level but simply to guarantee that no proliferant \ncountry could escape from the force of U.S. sanctions by undertaking \nexactly the type of so-called hydronuclear experiments described in the \ncurrent bill.\n  In short, America should not be encouraging the world community to \nengage in low-yield nuclear testing. A comprehensive test ban must \neliminate all nuclear explosions. As I said on this floor last March \n16, it is essential that we proceed with several measures to strengthen \ncontrols against the global spread of nuclear weapons, including:\n\n       Negotiation at the earliest possible date of a verifiable--\n     underline verifiable--permanent comprehensive ban on the \n     testing of nuclear explosive devices, with emphasis on those \n     words ``verifiable,'' ``permanent,'' ``comprehensive'' and \n     ``ban.''\n\n  Mr. President, we in the past have seen Taiwan have a program for \nnuclear weapons. We were able to bring them around to turn that program \noff. South Korea had a similar program at one time. We turned that off. \nIran is in the process, we believe, now of heading for nuclear weapons. \nWe are trying to turn that off. Pakistan has already gone that route \nagainst our very serious objections. India went that route in 1974.\n  Are we now to come into this debate today and say that we are going \nto perform little bitty nuclear explosions, but you people cannot do \nthe same things? It just does not make sense if what we are trying to \ngo to is a comprehensive test ban.\n  The debate today is ironic given that we just do not need to perform \nhydronuclear experiments to maintain the reliability of our nuclear \narsenal. In fact, our Government is now investing billions in special \nfacilities that will enable our country to ensure the safety and \nreliability of the stockpile without nuclear explosive testing. And \nthat includes hydronuclear testing. This is what is known as to the \nstockpile stewardship program.\n  Are there advantages to hy- dronuclear testing? Of course there are. \nI agree with that. But the dangers to the NPT and the worldwide spread \nof nuclear weapons as other countries see us testing and decide to do \nthe same thing is far greater. The danger is far greater than any \nadvantage we get out of the hydronuclear test.\n  If the hundreds upon hundreds of nuclear tests that we have \nundertaken over the last half century have still not given us a \nreliable arsenal, then this dubious record surely offers sufficient \ncause for us to question whether testing is truly as efficient a method \nfor establishing a method of safety and liability as its proponents \nclaim it is. The truth is, of course, that we already have a safe and \nreliable arsenal. And a good way to keep it that way without testing is \nto leave the designs alone.\n  Supporters of the nuclear testing section of the bill appear to want \nit both ways, twice. They want both to resume nuclear testing and fund \nbig-ticket nonnuclear test facilities. They also want both to expand \ncurrent nuclear and missile defense capabilities and to propagate the \nview that our potential adversaries will do nothing in response that \nwill adversely affect our national security. I am opposed to such \nreasoning, and I am sure I am not alone in challenging these totally \nincompatible goals.\n  I applaud the leadership of my friend from Nebraska. Over the years \nhe has fought for restraints on nuclear testing. I am proud to be \nincluded as a cosponsor of his amendment today. I hope our colleagues \nhave been following the debate here on the floor today. And I hope we \nhave an overwhelming vote in support of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. \n\n[[Page S 11364]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 10 minutes to the able Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the chairman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to the Exon amendment \nand in support of the committee's position.\n  Let us begin with a redefinition here of what we are talking about. \nWhat is a hydronuclear test? All that the committee has done is to \nprovide $50 million to enable us to have the capability to conduct such \ntests, should the administration decide to go forward with that \ndecision.\n  A hydronuclear experiment is one in which the conventional high \nexplosive yield is greater than the nuclear yield.\n  So we are, by definition, talking about something that does not have \na high nuclear yield. As a matter of fact, the kind of tests that have \nbeen contemplated in the past are tests with approximately 4 pounds--4 \npounds--of material, between 1 and 4 pounds. All these experiments \nprovide is an experimental calculation of the safety of the stockpile. \nThat is what we are talking about here.\n  Now, what about the CTB, the comprehensive test ban? Would conducting \nsuch tests run afoul of the test ban? Well, we can quote no better \nauthority than one of our colleagues here in the U.S. Senate who was \nhere during the debate on the Hatfield amendment. And I refer to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who suggested that such \nlow-yield tests would be perfectly acceptable within the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. On September 18, 1992, Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       The first of these concerns--accidental detonation--can be \n     resolved with safety tests with an explosive power equivalent \n     to a few pounds or less of TNT. Such test need not be limited \n     under a comprehensive test ban.\n\n  That is on page S13965 of the Congressional Record.\n  Now, the reason, of course, why, such tests should be allowed under \nthe CTB is because they are not verifiable. As the Senator from Ohio \npointed out, the CTB only works at levels where you can verify that the \nnations that are adhering to the treaty are, in fact, adhering to the \ntreaty. These low yields are not verifiable. They are so small you \ncannot detect them. That is why they could not be included under a CTB. \nThat is why this has nothing to do with the CTB. So let us get that off \nthe table right now.\n  The next point is: Why test? Lawrence Livermore Laboratory estimates \nthat:\n\n       One-third of all of the weapon designs placed in the U.S. \n     stockpile between 1958 and 1987 required and received post-\n     deployment nuclear tests to resolve problems.\n\n  In other words, after we had put the warheads on top of the missiles, \nor put them in the bombs in the planes, one-third of all of those \nweapons required and received postdeployment tests to resolve problems \nthat they had developed.\n  ``In three-quarters of these cases the problems were identified as a \nresult of nuclear testing.'' In each case the weapon was thought to be \nreliable and adequately tested when it entered the stockpile.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we test in order to find out whether \nthey are still going to work, whether they will be reliable, and \nwhether they will remain safe. These are the most complex weapons in \nour entire inventory, and yet they receive the least testing once they \nhave been deployed. We shoot the guns. We fly the airplanes. We sail \nthe ships. This is called readiness.\n  But some of our friends on the other side do not want to know whether \nthe most complex weapons in our inventory are reliable, whether they \nwill work, and whether they are safe. And how can they possibly \nconstitute an effective deterrent if those against whom they might be \nused understand that they have not been tested maybe for 30 years? We \nare talking about weapons, warheads that will be in our inventory for \n30 years or more, never having been tested. Lawrence Livermore notes \nthat in three-fourths of the cases where testing was done, problems \nwere identified as a result of that testing.\n  These weapons were thought to be reliable. Let me be very specific.\n  Of the 16 Lawrence Livermore developed warhead designs that entered \nthe stockpile between 1958 and 1987, several were found to have \nproblems. For six of these, the WXX, the W84, the W79, the W68, the \nW47, and the W45, the resolution of these problems involved nuclear \ntests.\n  Further, of the 25 Los Alamos weapon designs that were deployed \nbetween 1958 and 1987, one-third have required postdeployment nuclear \ntesting. That is what we are talking about here.\n  Let us go to the element of safety, because, obviously, we want our \nweapons to be safe, and technology has improved, has enhanced our \ncapability of making these weapons safe.\n  The 1990 Drell panel, which was constituted to consider this issue, \nconcluded that ``there is still room for substantive improvement in \nnuclear weapons safety.''\n  One manner to improve the safety of the warheads is to replace \nwarheads--the ones that have high explosives--to ones with insensitive \nhigh explosives, the so-called IHE. High explosives can be detonated in \nabnormal thermal pressure or shock environments.\n  That can be a danger in a crash situation or a fire situation.\n  As the Drell panel noted, ``In certain violent accidents, such as \nairplane fires or crashes, HE has a high probability of detonating, in \ncontrast to IHE.'' The Drell panel concluded that:\n\n     . . . replacing warheads with HE with new systems with IHE is \n     a very effective way--perhaps the most important step--for \n     improving safety of the weapons stockpile from scattering \n     plutonium.\n\n  IHE was first introduced in 1979 in the stockpile. As of early 1990, \nonly 25 percent of the stockpile was equipped with IHE. Incorporating \nIHE in the stockpile could require design changes and, thus, the \nrequirement to retest the weapon to ensure its ability to accomplish \nits military requirement.\n  So, Mr. President, both for reliability reasons and for safety \nreasons, some limited testing is necessary.\n  There has been a lot of quotation here of the so-called--I should not \nsay ``so-called''--of the experts on the subject, because experts will \ndiffer in their opinions and the JASONs are all experts and so are the \ndirectors of the laboratories.\n  I quoted the statistics from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and \nthe Los Alamos Laboratory. One of my colleagues said the lab directors \nare against this. The lab directors are for it. Ask Sig Hecker, who is \nthe director today of the Los Alamos Laboratory. Some of the quotations \nwere for previous directors. This is the current director of Los \nAlamos, and he says we ought to have testing.\n  You can find whatever you want to in the JASON report, but what my \ncolleague from Nevada is quoting from is the most recent report. It is \nthe draft July 1995 report. That is the most recent report.\n  Of course, they point out the fact that there are some advantages and \nsome disadvantages, but one of their conclusions is that experiments \ninvolving--actually let me read the first sentence, because it will \nsupport the position of the Senator from Nebraska. I do not want to \nquote selectively, I am going to quote the whole thing:\n\n       Underground testing of nuclear weapons at any yield level \n     below that required to initiate boosting is of limited value \n     to the United States.\n\n  They are talking about these very low yield kind of tests.\n  But they go on:\n\n       However, experiments involving high explosives and \n     fissionable material that do not reach critical--\n\n  The ones we are talking about--\n\n     are useful in improving our understanding of the behavior of \n     weapons materials under relevant physical conditions. They \n     should be included among treaty consistent activities.\n\n  That is the most recent JASON report. Obviously, they discussed all \nof the pros and cons, and there are pros and cons of this kind of \ntesting.\n  Let me just conclude with two points, Mr. President. The Senator from \nNebraska, in his opening remarks, talked about the wishy-washy advisers \nof the President. I think who he had in mind--he can correct me if I am \nwrong--is the Secretary of Defense William Perry, perhaps among others. \nIf the Senator would like to correct me right now.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator is wrong, but he has a right to be wrong.\n  \n[[Page S 11365]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator tell me who he meant when he referred to \nthe wishy-washy advisers to the President?\n  Mr. EXON. There are a whole group of wishy-washy advisers to the \nPresident. I talked about people inside the Pentagon. The Secretary of \nDefense supports my position. I hope you are not saying the Secretary \nof Defense supports your----\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, I am going to say that.\n  Mr. EXON. You are wrong. You have a right to be wrong.\n  Mr. KYL. Because the Secretary of Defense and the Defense Department \nin May of this year had suggested to the administration the \ndesirability of these kinds of tests. When the issue went to the \nNational Security Council and the highest counsels, including the \nPresident, the Defense Department recommendations were shelved, they \nwere overruled.\n  As a result, we are not going to go forward with these tests, \nalthough the most recent Defense Department document in July of this \nyear, which I can quote to you, does refer to the continuing open issue \nas to whether we should go forward.\n  But in any event, I find it interesting that this is the same \nSecretary of Defense who was so relied upon yesterday in the debate on \nmissile defense and find it ironic that some people on the floor were \nsuggesting that the reason we did not need missile defenses is because \nwe could rely upon our triad, our nuclear triad. You cannot have it \nboth ways. If you are not going to test reliability and safety of the \ntriad, then you should be supporting missile defense. If you are not \ngoing to support missile defense, then you ought to be supporting the \neffectiveness of our nuclear triad.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude at this point. The whole phrase, \nthe whole concept of stockpile stewardship implies a responsibility. \nThat is what stewardship means. And these are the most complex weapons \nin our inventory. As I said, we test guns and planes and ships \nregularly. It is called readiness. I cannot believe that we are arguing \nhere about a 1-to-4 pound test that does not reach criticality, where, \nby definition, the conventional yield is greater than the nuclear \nyield, and it seems to me, therefore----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senate ought to support the committee position and \nreject the position of the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 3 more minutes to the able Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the chairman for yielding. I will take 30 seconds of \nthat time.\n  Let me say this. We all wish the nuclear genie had not been let out \nof the bottle, but it was. I noted with interest, Senator Hatfield, \nSenator Exon, and others commented about their experience in World War \nII and glad that President Truman made the decision he did, which \nprobably brought that horrible war to a conclusion much faster than it \nwould have been, and thank God the weapon he chose to use worked.\n  All we are saying is, in the future, 30 years from now we better know \nthat the weapons we rely on in our stockpile will work. To do that, we \nneed to be prepared to conduct the very limited tests, and that is \ngoing to require the limited money included in the bill for this \npurpose. That is why we need to reject the Exon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 12 minutes to the able Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered \nby my good friend, the senior Senator from Nebraska. During the course \nof the debate this morning, references have been made to the 50th \nanniversary of the end of World War II and the use of nuclear weapons \nat Hiroshima and later Nagasaki. Let me say, I think those references \nhave absolutely nothing to do with what we are talking about today.\n  We are not debating whether we should resume underground testing, as \nit has been historically known at the Nevada test site. That is not the \nissue before us today. We are not debating about the prospect of \ndeveloping new nuclear weapons. The issue, I think, that was framed so \nartfully by the distinguished junior Senator from Arizona, the question \ntoday is the safety and reliability of the nuclear arsenal.\n  No scenario that I am familiar with contemplates a future in terms of \nour armed service deterrent that does not include our nuclear arsenal. \nSo safety and reliability is essential and critical.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have joined my \ncolleagues on a number of occasions questioning the Department of \nEnergy and the Department of Defense officials regarding our plans to \nmaintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile in \nthe absence of nuclear testing.\n  In hearing after hearing, the answer came back that we simply do not \nknow. Mr. President, no one in this body can state with categorical \ncertainty that our nuclear weapons arsenal has suddenly become safe and \nreliable for the foreseeable future, and that there is no need to \ncontinue to ascertain the safety and reliability of that nuclear \nstockpile.\n  Nuclear weapons, by their very nature, are extraordinarily complex \nsystems. We simply do not understand the effects of aging on many \ncomponents that make up each nuclear device. Those who designed the \nnuclear weapons planned for our enduring stockpile did not contemplate \nthe maintenance of these systems past their designed life. Our national \nlabs, which are ultimately responsible for certifying the safety and \neffectiveness of our nuclear weapons systems, have initiated a science-\nbased stockpile stewardship program, which aims to give us the \ninformation we need to know about the nuclear stockpile without nuclear \ntesting.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with these new strategies, \nincluding the National Ignition Facility, the ATLAS, the DAHRT, and \nmany others. Once these facilities are up and running, the labs \nanticipate the ability to obtain much of the data previously gathered \nthrough nuclear testing without performing nuclear tests. But science-\nbased stockpile stewardship has never been considered as a complete \nsubstitute for all types of nuclear tests or experiments for a number \nof reasons.\n  Even when the science-based stockpile stewardship program is fully \nimplemented, there will still be gaps in the type of knowledge our labs \nneed to gather. It is a common misperception that the new simulator \ntechnology, anticipated to become available soon, will, in effect, \nsimply simulate nuclear tests and allow us to gather all of the same \ndata that a nuclear test may provide. Mr. President, nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. Each of the components of the science-based \nstockpile management program will provide some of the data, which are \nissues of concern, such as certifying the safety and effectiveness of \nour weapons system. None will provide all the data, and even the \ncombination of all of the new technologies currently being considered \nwill not eliminate the need for certain types of actual testing with \nnuclear materials.\n  Given the high level of uncertainty that remains regarding science-\nbased stockpile stewardship, the Senate Armed Services Committee has \ntaken a very reasonable and responsible approach in the legislation \ncurrently before the Senate. The committee directs preparations to \nconduct nuclear testing should this type of testing become necessary. \nThe bill does not direct hydronuclear testing, and hydronu- clear tests \nwould still have to be approved by the President of the United States \nunder current law.\n  It is, in my judgment, reckless for our Nation to hold thousands of \nthe most powerful and dangerous weapons known to mankind and not have \nthe knowledge or understanding of how to maintain them.\n  Another concern regarding this amendment is its affect on the Nevada \ntest site and the unique capabilities this complex brings to the U.S. \nnational security effort. The DOE stated its intention to allow the \nreadiness of the Nevada test site to slip from 6 months up to 3 years. \nThe Nevada testing facility is a unique resource, and \n\n[[Page S 11366]]\nthe Nation's investment in it must be protected. Personnel at the \nNevada test site are a small community of highly specialized workers \nwith expertise found nowhere else in the world. This capability is \nirreplaceable and must not be risked. The combination of an aging \nstockpile and the decaying nuclear weapons expertise at the Nevada test \nsite and at the labs pose a direct threat to the safety and reliability \nof our stockpile.\n  It is important to note that hydronuclear testing would not lead the \nUnited States on a path to violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \nas has been suggested by some of our colleagues.\n  While negotiation positions are generally regarded as classified, it \nhas been reported in the media that the United States favors a limit \nunder the CTB of hydronuclear tests with less than 4 pounds of nuclear \nyield. Other nations apparently want a much higher yield.\n  It has been reported in the press that Great Britain wants up to 100 \npounds, Russia wants tests up to 10 tons, and France wants tests \nallowed up to 100 to 200 tons.\n  At this point, there is simply no way to predict how the final CTB \nmay be negotiated. Even with the hydro- nuclear testing program, the \nUnited States can remain in full compliance with all current \ninternational agreements and the likely future provisions of any CTB.\n  In fact, the Armed Services Committee report language specifies \n``treaty complaint'' hydronuclear tests.\n  We must remember that even if START II is ratified, the United States \nwill continue to maintain a stockpile of thousands of nuclear weapons.\n  The reliability of these weapons forms the basis of their existence \nas a strategic deterrence. As our stockpile of nuclear weapons is \nreduced, the reliability of each nuclear weapon becomes even more \ncritical to an effective deterrence.\n  It is possible that only through hydronuclear testing at the Nevada \ntest site can we have adequate assurance that our nuclear weapons will \nfunction as expected if a time should ever be needed to use them in a \ncrisis.\n  Almost one-half of the nuclear weapons systems developed since 1970 \nhave needed nuclear testing to correct or evaluate defects. Clearly, \nthis amendment could seriously hamper our confidence in our nuclear \nweapons stockpile.\n  Mr. President, I am afraid this amendment may, in some part, be \nmotivated by a misunderstanding of what the committee hoped to \naccomplish by adding funding to the stockpile stewardship account for \nhydronuclear testing.\n  While the terminology may be confusing, the committee does not \nenvision a resumption of the type of nuclear tests that we have become \nfamiliar with over the years. These are not full-scale tests of nuclear \nweapons, nor are they intended to test for new weapon designs.\n  Very small hydronuclear tests may, for example, test whether dropping \na weapon would result in a nuclear detonation--a test that, I suggest, \nshould hardly raise nonproliferation concerns.\n  Such tests are not designed to improve our ability to use nuclear \nweapons against any future enemy. They are designed to protect those in \nthe Armed Forces or the general public who may be put at risk by an \nunsafe or deteriorated weapon.\n  Other experiments, slightly larger, but still nowhere near the level \nof a full-scale test, and still completely consistent with our treaty \nobligations, could test the so-called ``boost'' provided by the tritium \ncomponents of a weapon.\n  Some have argued that such tests are largely irrelevant; the claim is \nmade that it makes little difference if the yield of the nuclear weapon \ndeteriorates only slightly over the period of time. The answer to that, \nMr. President, is that we simply have no assurance, however, that an \nold weapon will experience only a slight reduction in yield.\n  While everyone hopes and assumes that we will never use a nuclear \nweapon again, it is simply unconscionable not to provide our military \nplanners the confidence they need in the anticipated yields of our \nnuclear weapon systems.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment offered by \nthe senior Senator from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time to the able chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield Senator Kempthorne 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee. With regard to this debate, there is a reality, and \nthe reality is that we have a nuclear arsenal. It exists. Now, perhaps \nthrough START Treaties we are going to see a reduction of the nuclear \nwarheads. I think we all want to see that continue. But the reality is, \nwe have a nuclear arsenal. And the reality is, Mr. President, it is the \noldest stockpile in our history. Yet, we want to make sure that we \nmaintain the safety and the reliability of that stockpile.\n  Talk about scenarios of disaster, what happens if you have an \nunreliable situation occur with a nuclear stockpile? Right now, we have \na high level of confidence. As we continue each year, the confidence \nlevel goes down.\n  It is analogous to having an automobile that is working well today; \ndoes that mean we should then shut down all garages and diagnostic \ncenters? No, because the automobile is a machine, and it will need to \nhave monitoring and repair, just as this machine that we have of the \nnuclear arsenal will need.\n  These hydronuclear tests with a yield of about 4 pounds--and I agree \nwith the Senator from Nevada, I support, if there is need for \nclarification, that it is not more than 4 pounds-- these 4-pound tests \nshould more accurately be called experiments. These are safety \nexperiments. These experiments give detailed data about how a weapon is \naging. This data is then used to draw decisions about the safety and \nreliability of the weapon.\n  These experiments are compatible with the ongoing negotiations for a \ncomprehensive test ban. Indeed, during a recent discussion with the DOD \nUnder Secretary Curtis, he pointed out that hydronuclear experiments \nwill be compatible with a comprehensive test ban.\n  Moreover, during the previous moratorium, an underground test from \n1958 to 1961, the United States conducted hydronuclear tests at the Los \nAlamos National Laboratory. In testimony this year, Dick Reis, the \nDepartment of Energy official in charge of defense programs, \nacknowledged that there is no guarantee that the proposed Science-Based \nStockpile Stewardship Program will work.\n  What does that mean--the Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship Program? \nThis is a program that has to come up with computer modeling, physics \nmachines, to understand the aging of weapons. It will take about 10 \nyears to put this science-based stockpile reliability program in place. \nAnd then perhaps another 10 years to determine its accuracy. Ten years \nbefore we will have it in place, and another 10 years to determine its \naccuracy. That is a total of 20 years, Mr. President.\n  The design life of our nuclear stockpile is 20 years, roughly. \nUnfortunately, that clock is not just starting.\n  As I said, we have the oldest stockpile in our history. So in 4 \nyears, 5 years, when we hit the year 2000, many of the elements to that \narsenal will have reached their design life capacity.\n  That does not mean they will no longer be of value to us, but again \nthe confidence level goes down.\n  Dick Reis informed the Armed Services Committee on May 16, ``The \nhistory of the stockpile has shown that the continuous surveillance, \nrepair and replacement of components and subsystems is commonplace.''\n  We are spending billions of dollars on Trident submarines, on D-5 \nmissiles, upgrades to the Minuteman missile, but without a safe and \nreliable nuclear stockpile, all of this investment could be for naught.\n  The bill now on the floor authorizes almost $200 million to maintain \nthe Nevada test site in a state of readiness. The current \nadministration policy says we must be able to conduct an underground \ntest at the test site within 3 years of a decision to test. The \ninvestment to maintain the test site requested by the President allows \nus to leverage that investment and conduct these experiments at minimum \ncost. \n\n[[Page S 11367]]\n\n  On May 16, the Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Dr. Hecker, \ntestified before the Armed Services Committee. As part of his written \ntestimony, Dr. Hecker provided the committee with a document entitled \n``Nuclear Weapons Stewardship: Los Alamos National Laboratory.''\n  Page 18 of this document states:\n\n       Hydronuclear experiments include some fissile material but \n     no nuclear explosion. Only small amounts of energy are \n     released. They are used to assess primary performance and \n     safety. These experiments are important for two reasons: They \n     can be used, (1) to directly address the nuclear detonation \n     safety of the stockpile weapon; and, (2) to provide important \n     benchmark performance measures. Our plan is to gather \n     baseline, hydrodynamic and hydronuclear data on all \n     stockpiled weapons systems.\n\n  In other words, hydronuclear tests are an important component of the \nnew Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n  Mr. President, will we continue to oppose hydronuclear experiments \nafter a comprehensive test ban treaty is signed? In other words, are we \ngoing to exclude these experiments from all future stockpile \nstewardship activities?\n  I do not believe that is the position of the Clinton administration. \nI do not believe it is the position of the Armed Services Committee. \nGiven the uncertainties in the Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram and the time lag before this program provides meaningful data, \nthe Armed Services Committee took what it believes to be the prudent \nstep of providing funds to prepare for hydronuclear experiments that \nare compatible with the comprehensive test ban treaty, to stem the \ninevitable decline in the confidence of our nuclear stockpile.\n  There has been a great deal of reference as to what is the amount \nthat we are going to be testing--400 pounds, 4,000 pounds, 40,000 \npounds. Again, it is 4 pounds. I will reference in the bill itself, \npage 383, section 3165, Report on Hydronuclear Testing:\n\n       The committee directs that the Secretary of Energy is to \n     move forward with the ``preparation of a comprehensive \n     report'' by the directors of the two nuclear weapons design \n     laboratories on the relative costs and benefits of \n     alternative limits on the permitted levels of hydronuclear \n     testing to include 4 pounds, 400 pounds, 4,000 pounds, 40,000 \n     pounds of yield.\n\n  But it is a report. It is a report on the cost and benefit analysis.\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       The committee requests the preparation of a single report \n     with additional and/or dissenting views by each director as \n     they deem appropriate. The report should be delivered to the \n     congressional defense committees, the Secretaries of Defense \n     and Energy and the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic \n     Command for their comments.\n\n  That is what is in here. Again, Mr. President, in summary, we have \nnuclear stockpile. It is the oldest in our history. We better ensure \nthe safety and the stability of that stockpile. The way they are \nproposing they will do that is to now come up with a computer model \nprogram that is 10 years away from now.\n  We are simply saying that one component that will help us is the \nhydronuclear experiments of not more than 4 pounds. If that is not a \nvery realistic and responsible approach, I do not know what is.\n  I yield the balance of my time back to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 7 minutes to the able Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the importance of maintaining a \nsafe and reliable U.S. nuclear deterrent, and in opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend, the senior Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, the issue is not testing of new weapons. It is \nassuring a credible U.S. nuclear deterrent. If the United States is to \nmaintain a nuclear weapons capability, we must be able to assure the \nsafety and reliability of our existing stockpile.\n  Unless we have the capability to continue experiments and testing, we \ncannot ensure either.\n We must continue to make needed investments in nuclear weapons \nstockpile maintenance.\n\n  Nothing in the bill that is pending before us will violate any treaty \nor obligation, nor will it violate self-imposed moratorium on nuclear \ntesting. Hydronuclear testing will not violate any existing U.S. treaty \ncommitments, nor would it violate the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty that we are trying to negotiate. But such testing does provides \nthe essential margin of safety we need--short of the resumption of \nfull-scale nuclear testing. I would add that the President has reserved \nthe right to resume testing, if deemed to be vital to our national \nsecurity interests and maintenance of our nuclear deterrent.\n  The amendment that has been proposed will nullify our ability to \nassure to stockpile safety and reliability. We will not get to the goal \nof a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty if we unilaterally preclude \nourselves from conducting essential stockpile maintenance and \nrelaiblity activities, including hydronuclear testing.\n  One critical component of U.S. nuclear stockpile management is the \nPantex Nuclear Weapons Plant, a Department of Energy [DOE] facility \nlocated in Amarillo, TX. The Pantex plant, along with Savannah River, \nY-12 and the Kansas City plant, is one of the few remaining production \nsites with existing infrastructure and capabilities that, if upgraded \nin place, can cost-effectively and meet the needs of nuclear weapons \nstockpile management and missile material disposition requirements \nidentified in the Defense Department's Nuclear Posture Review.\n  However, Mr. President, I remain very concerned that the Department \nof Energy's published 5-year budget plan calls for cuts in weapons \nactivities of up to 40 percent in fiscal year 1997 and beyond. The DOE \nportion of the Defense authorization bill should be used for its \nintended purpose--to meet the nuclear deterrent capability our national \nsecurity needs require.\n  Our nuclear weapons complex is undergoing a crucial reconfiguration. \nI am concerned that decisions could be made which would both compromise \nthe integrity of our nuclear deterrent and needlessly waste billions of \ndollars of taxpayer money. The current and future existence and full \nutilization of our production sites, working with the national labs, is \ncritical to maintaining an effective and efficient nuclear deterrent.\n  Pantex, as the sole site in the United States for assembly, \ndisassembly, and maintenance of nuclear warheads, as well as the \nprimary site for interim storage of plutonium components removed from \nthese weapons, is key to a cost-effective, competent nuclear deterrent \nin a scaled-back complex. Some proposals in DOE would suggest that \nPantex and the other production sites be phased out, with the Nevada \ntest site becoming the sole production site for the complex.\n  This course, however, would not only deprive our country of the \nability to remanufacture and deal with significant weapons production \nif the need ever arose, but would also result in the needless \nrecreation of a multibillion-dollar infrastructure at Nevada which \nalready exists at the existing production sites. By retaining and \nupgrading Pantex as the primary stockpile stewardship and management \nfacility, we would also realize other cost savings, in the form of \navoided transport cost and duplicative environmental, security, and \nsafety expenditures.\n  We must ensure an orderly and safe transition to civilian stewardship \nof nuclear materials decommissioned from military use. I believe that \none of the most critical national security issues facing our country \ntoday is the safe, environmentally sound, and secure storage and \ndisposition of these materials. An example of this transition would be \npurification and fabrication of weapons components. Such capacity could \ncomplement a reactor for the dedicated source of tritium production, by \nfabricating mixed oxide fuel from plutonium components for disposition \nin such a reactor.\n  One key element to implementation of this transition for the entire \ncomplex is the National Resource Center for Plutonium, which is \noperated by a consortium of Texas universities. The center was funded \nat $9 million in fiscal year 1995, and the administration and the \nHouse-passed version of the Defense authorization bill recommended \nauthority for $10 million in fiscal year 1996, with recommendations for \ncontinuing support in fiscal year 1997. This center enjoys a symbiotic \nrelationship with the national labs, in its work with \n\n[[Page S 11368]]\nfissile material disposition supplements.\n  I would like to personally thank Chairman Thurmond and Senators Lott \nand Kempthorne for the outstanding work done by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in bringing needed attention to nuclear stockpile \nmanagement and the maintenance of our nuclear deterrent capabilities, \nwhich addresses, head-on, the concerns raised in the Defense \nDepartment's Nuclear Posture Review.\n  Mr. President, the position outlined in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee Defense authorization bill provides the Department of Energy \nwith clear guidance to maintain and enhance our nuclear deterrent \ncapabilities. At the same time, the bill provides direction to DOE to \nmake the necessary decisions to clean up nuclear waste sites; to \naddress the issue of plutonium and highly enriched uranium disposition; \nto consider new reactor options for disposition of fissile materials \nand the disposition of fissile materials--plutonium--through \nfabrication of mox fuel and the burning up of mox fuel in a reactor; \nand finally to make a rational choice, in the very near term, for a \ndedicated source of tritium production.\n  Mr. President, nuclear weapons stockpile management is a critical \nelement in putting us on the right course to meet our critical national \nsecurity requirements and this legislation sets us on the right course \nand gives needed direction and support to the Department of Energy. I \nam proud to be part of and supportive of the efforts of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee to address in a meaningful and realistic \nmanner our Nation's critical national security and defense needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will yield myself 3 minutes.\n  First, I would like to introduce letters from the Secretary of \nDefense and the Secretary of Energy, since their names have been \nmentioned, in full support of the Hatfield-Exon amendment.\n  I would simply also advise the Senate that, following the references \nmade by some Senators with regard to the new JASON report, the \nSecretary of Energy initiated a call to me. She was very upset about \nthe slant that was being placed on this. She has furnished me a full \ncopy of the JASON report of August 3. I submit that at this time to be \nmade part of the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters and the report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 1995.\n     Hon. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: Thank you for sending me a copy of your \n     June 20 letter to President Clinton providing your views on \n     the nuclear testing moratorium and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     (CTB) Treaty. I want to assure you that U.S. policy on the \n     nuclear testing moratorium has not changed, and there are no \n     plans to change it. Based on the assumption that a treaty \n     will be signed before September 30, 1996, and subject to the \n     same understandings that govern our current moratorium, the \n     President extended the moratorium until the CTB enters into \n     force. As you may know, the President has stated that he \n     considers the maintenance of a safe and reliable nuclear \n     stockpile to be a supreme national interest of the United \n     States. We are currently reviewing how best to ensure that \n     this mandate can be carried out, both now and in the future. \n     Your letter provides an important perspective for our \n     deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. James Exon,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, \n         Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: As the Senate considers provisions \n     relating to hydronuclear experiments in S. 1026, the \n     ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996,'' \n     as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, I wanted \n     to reiterate that the President's Fiscal Year 1996 budget \n     request included no funds to conduct hydronuclear \n     experiments. The Administration stands behind its budget \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hazel R. O'Leary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                            Nuclear Testing\n\n(Prepared by JASON, the MITRE Corp; Sidney Drell, Chair, John Cornwall, \n  Freeman Dyson, Douglas Eardley, Richard Garwin, David Hammer, John \nKammerdiener, Robert LeLevier, Robert Peurifoy, John Richter, Marshall \n Rosenbluth, Seymour Sack, Jeremiah Sullivan, and Fredrik Zachariason; \n                             Aug. 3, 1995)\n\n\n                     1 (u) summary and conclusions\n\n       (U) We have examined the experimental and analytic bases \n     for understanding the performance of each of the weapon types \n     that are currently planned to remain in the U.S. enduring \n     nuclear stockpile. We have also examined whether continued \n     underground tests at various nuclear yield thresholds would \n     add significantly to our confidence in this stockpile in the \n     years ahead.\n       (U) Our starting point for this examination was a detailed \n     review of past experience in developing and testing modern \n     nuclear weapons, their certification and recertification \n     processes, their performance margins,\\1\\ and evidence of \n     aging or other trends over time for each weapon type in the \n     enduring stockpile.\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                              conclusion 1\n\n       (U) The United States can, today, have high confidence in \n     the safety, reliability, and performance margins of the \n     nuclear weapons that are designated to remain in the enduring \n     stockpile. This confidence is based on understanding gained \n     from 50 years of experience and analysis of more than 1000 \n     nuclear tests, including the results of\n      approximately 150 nuclear tests of modern weapon types in \n     the past 20 years.\n       (U) Looking to future prospects of achieving a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a stated goal of the \n     United States Government, we have studied a range of \n     activities that could be of importance to extending our \n     present confidence in the stockpile into the future. We \n     include among these activities underground experiments \n     producing sub-kiloton levels of nuclear yield that might be \n     permitted among the treaty-consistent activities under a \n     CTBT.\n       (U) Three key assumptions underlie our study:\n       1. (U) The U.S. intends to maintain a credible nuclear \n     deterrent.\n       2. (U) The U.S. remains committed to the support of world-\n     wide nonproliferation efforts.\n       3. (U) The U.S. will not encounter new military or \n     political circumstances in the future that cause it to \n     abandon the current policy--first announced by President Bush \n     in 1992--of not developing any new nuclear weapon designs.\n\n\n                             conclusion 2:\n\n       (U) In order to maintain high confidence in the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of the individual types of \n     weapons in the enduring stockpile for several decades under a \n     CTBT, whether or not sub-kiloton tests are permitted, the \n     United States must provide continuing and steady support for \n     a focused, multifaceted program to increase understanding of \n     the enduring stockpile; to detect, anticipate and evaluate \n     potential aging problems; and to plan for refurbishment and \n     remanufacture, as required. In addition the U.S. must \n     maintain a significant industrial infrastructure in the \n     nuclear program to do the required replenishing, \n     refurbishing, or remanufacturing of age-affected components, \n     and to evaluate the resulting product; for example, the high \n     explosive, the boost gas system, the tritium loading, etc. \n     Important activities in a stockpile stewardship program that \n     will sustain a strong scientific and technical base, \n     including an experienced cadre of capable scientists and \n     engineers, are described in the body of this study.\n       (U) The proposed program will generate a large body of \n     technically valuable new data and challenging opportunities \n     capable of attracting and retaining experienced nuclear \n     weapons scientists and engineers in the program. This is the \n     intent of DOE's currently planned stockpile stewardship \n     program.\\2\\ For the success of this program, the management \n     of the three weapons laboratories (LANL, LLNL, SNL) must \n     motivate, support, and reward effort in an area that has lost \n     some of its glamor and excitement in the absence of new \n     nuclear design and test opportunities.\n       (U) Nevertheless, over the longer term, we may face \n     concerns about whether accumulated changes in age-affected \n     weapons components, whose replacements might have to be \n     manufactured by changed processes, could lead to inadequate \n     performance margins and reduced confidence in the stockpile.\n       (U) Enhancements of performance margins will add \n     substantially to long-term stockpile confidence with or \n     without underground tests. To cite one example, we can adjust \n     the boost gas fill or shorten the time interval between \n     fills. (This is discussed more fully in the classified text.)\n\n\n                             conclusion 3:\n\n       (U) The individual weapon types in the enduring stockpile \n     have a range of performance margins, all of which we judge to \n     be adequate at this time. In each case we have identified \n     opportunities for further enhancing their performance margins \n     by means that are straightforward and can be incorporated \n     with deliberate speed during scheduled maintenance or \n     remanufacturing activities. However greatest care in the form \n     of self-discipline will be required to avoid system \n     modifications, even if aimed at ``improvements'', which may \n     compromise reliability. \n\n[[Page S 11369]]\n\n       (U) This brings us to the issue of the usefulness, \n     importance, or necessity of reduced-yield (less than 1 \n     kiloton) underground tests for maintaining confidence in the \n     weapon types in the U.S. stockpile over a long period of \n     time.\n       (U) For the U.S. stockpile, testing under a 500 ton yield \n     limit would allow studies of boost gas ignition and initial \n     burn, which is a critical step in achieving full primary \n     design yield. The primary argument that we heard in support \n     of the importance of such testing by the U.S. is the \n     following: the evidence in several cases and theoretical \n     analyses indicate that results of a sub-kiloton ( \n     500 tons) test of a given primary that achieves boost gas \n     ignition and initial burn can be extrapolated to give some \n     confidence in the yield of an identical primary with full \n     boosting. Therefore, if a modified or remanufactured primary \n     is introduced into the stockpile in the future to correct \n     some aging problem, such tests on the modified system would \n     add to confidence that the performance of the new primary is \n     still adequate.\n       (U) It follows from this argument that the utility to the \n     U.S. of testing at yields of up to approximately 500 tons \n     depends on such tests being performed on a continuing basis \n     and yielding reproducible results. If they are permitted only \n     for a few years, such tests could add to the theoretical \n     understanding of the boosting process and the reliability of \n     the computer-codes that attempt to describe it, but would not \n     contribute directly to the reliability of the weapon in the \n     enduring stockpile in view of the possible manufacturing \n     changes made at a later date. To gain evidence as to whether \n     long-term changes in age-affected weapons components have any \n     impact on boost-performance the tests would have to be made \n     with the remanufactured weapons themselves.\n                             Conclusion 4:\n\n       (U) In order to contribute to long term confidence in the \n     U.S. stockpile, testing of nuclear weapons under a 500 ton \n     yield limit would have to be done on a continuing basis, \n     which is tantamount to remaking a CTBT into a threshold test \n     ban treaty. While such ongoing testing can add to long term \n     stockpile confidence, it does not have the same priority as \n     the essential stockpile stewardship program endorsed in \n     Conclusion 2, nor does it merit the same priority as the \n     measures to enhance performance margins in Conclusion 3. In \n     the last analysis the technical contribution of such a \n     testing program must be weighed against its costs and its \n     political impact on the non-proliferation goals of the United \n     States.\n\n\n                             Conclusion 5:\n\n       (U) Underground testing of nuclear weapons at any yield \n     level below that required to initiate boosting is of limited \n     value to the United States. However experiments involving \n     high explosives and fissionable material that do not reach \n     criticality are useful in improving our understanding of the \n     behavior of weapons materials under relevant physical \n     conditions. They should be included among treaty consistent \n     activities that are discussed more fully in the text.\n       (U) This conclusion is based on the following two \n     observations.\n       (U) [(a)] So-called hydronuclear tests, defined a limited \n     to a nuclear yield of less than 4 lbs TNT equivalent, can be \n     preformed only after making changes that drastically alter \n     the primary implosion. A persuasive case has not been made \n     for the utility of hydronuclear tests for detecting small \n     changes in the performance margins for current U.S. weapons. \n     At best, such tests could confirm the safety of a device \n     against producing detectable nuclear yield if its high \n     explosive is detonated accidentally at one point. We find \n     that the U.S. arsenal has neither a present nor anticipated \n     need for such re-confirmation. The existing large nuclear \n     test data base can serve to validate two- and three-\n     dimensional computational techniques for evaluating any new \n     one-point safety scenarios, and it should be fully exploited \n     for this purpose.\n       (U) [(b)] Testing with nominal yields up to a 100-ton limit \n     permits examination of aspects of the pre-boost fission \n     process. However, this is at best a partial and possibly \n     misleading performance indicator.\n       (U) An agreement to limit testing to very low yields raises \n     the issue of monitoring compliance. We have not made a \n     detailed study of this issue, but not the following: \n     Cooperative, on-site monitoring would be necessary, and \n     relevant measurements, including for example neutron yields, \n     could be made without compromising classified information on \n     bomb designs.\n       (U) We have reviewed the device problems which occurred in \n     the past and which either relied on, or required, nuclear \n     yield tests to resolve.\n\n\n                             Conclusion 6:\n\n       (U) For the weapon types planned to remain in the enduring \n     stockpile we find that the device problems which occurred in \n     the past, and which either relied on, or required, nuclear \n     yield tests to resolve, were primarily the result of \n     incomplete or inadequate design activities. In part, these \n     were due to the more limited knowledge and computational \n     capabilities of a decade, or more, ago. We are persuaded that \n     those problems have been corrected and that the weapon types \n     in the enduring stockpile are safe and reliable in the \n     context of explicit military requirements.\n       (U) Should the U.S., in future, encounter problems in an \n     existing stockpile design (which we do not anticipate at \n     present) that are so serious as to lead to unacceptable loss \n     of confidence in the safety, effectiveness, or reliability of \n     a weapons type, it is possible that testing of the primary at \n     full yield, and ignition of the secondary, would be required \n     to certify a specified fix. Useful tests to address such \n     problems generate nuclear yields in excess of approximately \n     10 kT. DOE's currently planned enhanced surveillance and \n     maintenance program is intended to alert us to any such need \n     that may arise. A ``supreme national interest'' withdrawal \n     clause that is standard in any treaty to which this nation is \n     a signatory would permit the U.S. to respond appropriately \n     should such a need arise.\n\n\n                             Conclusion 7:\n\n       (U) The above findings, as summarized in Conclusions 1 \n     through 6, are consistent with U.S. agreement to enter into a \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of unending duration, \n     that includes a standard ``supreme national interest'' \n     clause. Recognizing that the challenge of maintaining an \n     effective nuclear stockpile for an indefinite period without \n     benefit of underground tests is an important and also a new \n     one, the U.S. should affirm its readiness to invoke the \n     supreme national interest clause should the need arise as a \n     result of unanticipated technical problems in the enduring \n     stockpile.\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Defined as the difference between the minimum expected \n     and the minimum needed yields of the primary.\n     \\2\\ See the 1994 JASON Report JSR-94-345 on ``Science Based \n     Stockpile Stewardship''.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I just want to summarize what the situation is with regard \nto this report. Senator Reid, Senator Kyl, and probably others have \nconfused the just-completed JASON report. But they did not reveal the \nfull story. They are simply wrong, and they are comparing oranges with \nlemons. The entire quotation in the JASON report just put out, on \nhydronuclear testing, is as follows:\n\n       A persuasive case has not been made for the utility of \n     hydronuclear tests for detecting small changes in the \n     performance margin for current U.S. weapons.\n\n  So the newest JASON report does not endorse nuclear tests. Also, the \nparticular quotation used by the Senator lacks accuracy. When they \nquote the JASON report as saying, ``However, experiments involving high \nexplosives and fissionable material that do not reach criticality are \nuseful in improving our understanding of * * * weapons materials,'' the \nSenator fails to mention the most important point, that the experiments \nthat do not reach criticality are not hydronuclear tests. They are not \nhydronuclear tests.\n  I simply point out that the portion of the report that the Senator \nquotes deals with experiments that are not hydronuclear in any way. \nAgain, the JASON report is very clear. I quote from it.\n\n       A persuasive case has not been made for the utility of \n     hydronuclear tests . . .\n\n  I hope this begins to set the record straight. I yield 5 minutes to \nmy colleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from \nNebraska for yielding but also, most important, for the legislative \ninitiatives which he and Senator Hatfield and others have taken over \nthe years to try to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons through a \ncomprehensive ban on nuclear testing. And they are related. And that is \nthe whole issue.\n  We recently were able to obtain the continuation of the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty. We fought really hard for that and we got \nother nations to go along with it. We did so based on our commitment to \na comprehensive test ban treaty. We are in no position to tell other \nnations that they cannot have nuclear weapons, even though we do, if we \nare going to ignore our commitments to them to obtain a comprehensive \ntest ban--emphasis on the word ``comprehensive''--when that commitment \nto them and that representation to them was part and parcel of our \ngetting a nonproliferation treaty. That is the issue. It is the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  That is why the statement that was made by the DOD and DOE scientific \nadvisory group--called JASON--relative to hydronuclear tests, is so \nimportant. I am going to read that again because this, to me, is really \nthe heart of the issue. We are talking about hydronuclear tests. This \nis what they said just last November:\n\n       The very limited added value of hydronuclear tests have to \n     be weighed against costs and against the impact of continuing \n     an underground testing program at the Nevada test site on \n     U.S. nonproliferation goals.\n\n\n[[Page S 11370]]\n\n  That is what they say. This is the JASON group which has been \nreferred to so many times this morning. These are the scientists that \nadvise the DOE and DOD, and this is the weighing process, the limited \nadded value, of which there is some. Everyone concedes that tests have \nvalue. The question is, Do the benefits outweigh the costs? We have \ndone a lot of that in regulatory reform lately talking about cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n  So what our DOD and DOE scientists did last November was weigh the \nbenefits, the limited added value of hydronuclear tests against the \ncosts. That is, in their words, the impact of continuing that program, \nan underground testing program at the Nevada test site on U.S. \nnonproliferation goals.\n  What is their conclusion? Now I am quoting JASON:\n\n       On balance, we oppose hydronuclear testing.\n\n  Why? These are their words:\n\n       Since hydronuclear tests would be potentially more valuable \n     to proliferants, it would be in our national interest to \n     forego them.\n\n  That, for me, is the bottom line. We have spent a lot of time here \ntrying to figure out how we can defend against nuclear weapons, either \nin the theater system, short-range missiles delivering them, or in \nlong-range missiles delivering them.\n  This body I think is darned near unanimous on how we are going to try \nto defend against theater missiles. We are very much divided as to the \nbest way to defend against the long-range missiles. But proliferation \nis the greatest threat in the future to this country--proliferation of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Our best scientists say hydronuclear tests are potentially more \nvaluable to proliferants--the bad guys--than they are to us and, \ntherefore, it would be in our national interest to forego them.\n  What the current JASON report says in this is the one that was quoted \nby our good friend from Nevada. He quoted the section that relates to \ntests which have no nuclear yield, tests which do not reach \ncriticality. That is not the issue before us. Those are hydrodynamic \ntests. Those are not hydronuclear tests. Those have zero nuclear yield. \nThere is no criticality. And he read a section of the report that was \njust released last night which said, ``Experiments involving high \nexplosives and fissionable material that do not reach criticality are \nuseful in improving our understanding in behavior of weapons.''\n  That is true. But there is no downside on that. That is not a nuclear \ntest. That is not a nuclear experiment. That does not reach \ncriticality. There is no nuclear yield.\n  The next page of this same most recent report is the one that Senator \nExon has just quoted from reasserting the conclusion of the JASON group \nagainst hydronuclear testing.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Massachusetts, and \nfollowing that, 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Exon amendment to delete \nthe section on nuclear testing. For the second time in 2 days we are \naddressing provisions of the committee bill that go against the tide of \nhistory, and would send us back to the days of the cold war and the \nnuclear arms policies of that period.\n  In April, the United States reached a new milestone with the \npermanent extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This \ntreaty, first signed in 1968, is a solemn agreement by 178 nations to \nhalt the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  Achieving this goal was not a foregone conclusion when the treaty \nextension conference commenced. The five nuclear weapons states agreed \nto work in good faith for a comprehensive test ban in 1996. It was \nunderstood by all the nations at the conference that a test ban will be \nthe single most important step we can take to ensure that the non-\nproliferation treaty will be observed and maintained.\n  The bill and the Thurmond amendment calling for the administration to \nprepare for nuclear tests runs directly contrary to the principle we \naccepted at the non-proliferation conference. Some argue that test in \nquestion--called a hydronuclear test--is not a real nuclear test. That \nis not true in terms of physics, and it is not true in terms of public \npolicy.\n  In physics, a hydronuclear test is a very low yield explosion, but it \nis a nuclear explosion nonetheless. Moreover, it is a type of explosion \nthat the United States does not need to maintain the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear arsenal. This view has been stated and \nreaffirmed by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, and by many technical \nexperts, including the JASON panel. We can use alternative methods, \nsuch as advanced simulations and other non- nuclear technical means, to \nensure the safety and reliability of our stockpile.\n  In terms of public policy, a hydronuclear test is clearly regarded as \na nuclear explosion by many of the signatories to the NPT. They have \nmade it clear that they will not accept a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nthat allows for hydronuclear tests.\n  That is the reality. Some may wish it was otherwise. In the past, I \nhave suggested that such tests, if small enough, might be acceptable \nunder a comprehensive test ban. But clearly other nations disagree, and \nthe goal of a comprehensive test ban is too important to lose.\n  The Exon amendment will enable us to take the next important step in \nthe post-cold war era-- the achievement of a comprehensive test ban \nthat will serve as the cornerstone in that all important battle to \nprevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I urge the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  This is a sound, sensible amendment. I hope that it will be agreed \nto.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I support the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], and am pleased to be a cosponsor. \nThis amendment would remove from the Armed Services Committee bill the \nrequirement that $50 million be spent in preparation for hydronuclear \ntesting.\n  In one respect, I believe the committee bill would set our Nation on \nan unfortunate course. It in effect would place the United States in a \nposition of moving toward a new nuclear testing program. This would \ndeflect us from the current strong administration effort to achieve a \ncomprehensive test ban and it would send an unmistakable signal to \nother nations of the world that the United States is not serious and \npurposeful in its quest of a test ban.\n  Those who joined with us in the decision this spring to extend the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty could come to no other conclusion than that \nthe United States had acted in bad faith in order to secure approval of \nextension of the treaty. This would be an unfortunate effect of any \nsuch decision to go forward with a testing program that simply is not \nneeded to safeguard our national security.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this amendment will leave the way open \nto the successful completion of test ban negotiations in Geneva. That \nnegotiation is in process now with the goal of achieving a \ncomprehensive test ban next year.\n  I would hope that such a ban can be in place by October 1, 1996, as \nenvisaged in legislation over the last several years. Until that time, \nI would hope that the United States would continue to adhere to the \npresent moratorium on nuclear testing. I believe that the President \nshould be commended strongly for his steadfastness in this regard.\n  Some years ago President John F. Kennedy reached a breakthrough \nagreement with the Soviet leadership that brought the first agreed \nlimit on nuclear testing. That agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty \nof 1963, forbade nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in outer space, and \nunder water. It allowed testing only underground and required that \ntesting be done in such a way that the world be spared from radioactive \npoisoning from the debris of nuclear tests.\n  Moving beyond that Limited Test Ban Treaty has been difficult and \ntortuous. President Nixon accomplished the Threshold Test Ban Treaty in \n1974 and his successor, President Ford, negotiated the Peaceful Nuclear \nExplosions Treaty. It took more than 10 years to get these treaties \nratified and in place.\n\n[[Page S 11371]]\n\n  Currently, the five nuclear powers are following different courses. \nWe and the British, who must use our testing site, are adhering to a \nmoratorium. The Russians are also adhering to a moratorium. The Chinese \nare following a nuclear testing program in anticipation that a test ban \nmay be achieved. The French have just unleased a political firestorm in \nthe Far East by announcing a series of tests in the South Pacific.\n  Earlier this year the President of the United States made the very \nwise decision to abandon U.S. efforts to negotiate a treaty with a \nprovision allowing an easy exit from the treaty at the 10-year mark. \nThis provision could accommodated those who would like a comprehensive \ntest ban to be effective and in force for only 10 years. Nonetheless it \nworried those nations who fear\n that the nuclear superpowers do not, in fact, intend to end nuclear \ntesting for all time. The President understood these concerns and \ndecided to negotiate a treaty without an easy exit. As is the case with \nmost treaties, nations will be able to get out of the treaty if they \nfind their supreme national interests are jeopardized.\n\n  Unfortunately, there have been protracted discussions on whether to \nallow exceptions under the treaty and what kind of exceptions they \nshould be. Some of the parties would like to see a reduced threshold \nfor nuclear testing rather than elimination of testing. Some would like \nto see so-called peaceful nuclear explosions revived. Still others \nwould like to see safety and reliability testing be permitted. In our \nown country, these discussions have led from the suggestion that \ndetonations with explosive power of several pounds be permitted. This \nhas led still further to advocacy by some in the defense community of \nflexibility in the treaty that would allow hydronuclear explosions of \nseveral tons, or even hundreds of tons of explosive power.\n  Mr. President, we would delude ourselves if we believe that the \nnations of the world, having agreed to the permanent extension of the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty this spring at our behest, would now agree to \nallow continued nuclear testing under any guise. We are committed to \nthese nations to bring nuclear testing to a halt. We should not be \ndissuaded from pursuing that course.\n  The authorization bill as written would require hydronuclear testing \nand essentially deflect us from our goal of a complete end to nuclear \ntesting. The Exon amendment would get rid of this provision and allow \nthe President to pursue the present course. I hope the Senate would \nhave the wisdom to agree to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes, fifty-one seconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the prudent and \nreasonable attempt to plan for the resumption of treaty compliant \nhydronuclear testing, as contained in the Thurmond-Domenici amendments.\n  Every weapons system, indeed every machine in our technological \nsociety, requires testing. Hydronuclear testing is the only tool left \nto assess our confidence in the safety and reliability of the shrinking \nU.S. nuclear stockpile.\n  DOE testimony to the House states that the potential alternative to \ntesting, science-based stewardship, is not guaranteed to work. If it \ndoes work, it will take 15 to 20 years to perfect. Given this risk, it \nis imprudent to give the sole remaining tool which can perform a \nreality check on the primary of a nuclear weapon in a dynamic \nenvironment.\n  No other nation should feel threatened that we feel the need to keep \nour weapons safe and reliable. I urge the defeat of the Exon-Hatfield \namendment and demonstrate a strong support for our Nation's nuclear \ndeterrence.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will use 1 minute out of my leader time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the first of \nthe consecutive votes, there be 4 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween Senator Thurmond and the sponsor of each amendment before each \nof the remaining votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be \nthe only first-degree amendments in order to S. 1206, and that they be \nlimited to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  I will submit the list, since there are 185 amendments; 105 \nDemocratic amendments and 80 on the Republican side.\n  This has been approved by both sides. At least it gets us to a limit.\n  I do not know how we can finish this bill. Senator Thurmond is \nprepared to stay all night tonight. He has a plane at 5:30 in the \nmorning.\n  So we can go at least until 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining, and I \nam going to move to table the Exon amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. EXON. I make an inquiry of the Chair. I thought that the yeas and \nnays on the Exon amendment had been ordered.\n  Is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Then a tabling motion would not be in order at this time, \nwould it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised by the Parliamentarian \nthat a tabling motion would be in order.\n  Is there a sufficient second on the tabling motion?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Exon amendment \nis set aside. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] is recognized to offer \nan amendment, on which Senator Reid will control 40 minutes and Senator \nThurmond will control 20 minutes.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2113 to Amendment No. 2111\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provision designating the location of the new \n        tritium production facility of the Department of Energy)\n\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 2113 to amendment No. \n     2111:\n       On page 29 of the amendment, strike lines 18 through 21.\n  Mr. REID. The record should read as on the amendment that this is \noffered on behalf of both Senators from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I object to the section of this amendment that directs \nthe Department of Energy to site its new tritium production facility at \nSavannah River.\n  For Members of the Senate, let me explain briefly what we are talking \nabout. Tritium is an element that is critical to all modern nuclear \nweapons. However, it is radioactive and decays. Our weapons will cease \nto work if we do not periodically replace the tritium. We do not now in \nthe United States have the ability, the capability to produce tritium. \nWe must develop a new tritium source.\n  We are, in this amendment, striking from this Thurmond amendment the \nspecification that this new producer of tritium shall be in Savannah \nRiver. This is not an appropriate action and certainly it is not an \nappropriate issue for legislative action.\n  Decisions like this belong with the administrative branch of our \nGovernment. Decisions like this must be based on a complete analysis of \nmany complex technical and economic decisions. A fair and impartial \nassessment of alternatives for different techniques and sites is what \nis called for. To think that we, as a Senate, can step in without \nhearings, without any procedures at all to indicate what would be the \nproper site for this production facility would be absolutely wrong.\n  It is clear the reason that this is in the bill is because of the \nchairman of the committee being from South Carolina. There is no other \nreason. The fact is there are a number of sites that the Department of \nEnergy and this administration generally are looking at to determine \nwhere would be the best place to put it. One of the sites, of course, \nis at the Nevada test site.\n  If there were a vote taken today with the people in the Department of \nDefense, people in the Department of Energy who are making the \ndecision, Nevada would probably win, but that is not how these \ndecisions are made. It is not by a vote. It is by people who are \nadministrators, who listen to the experts who work under them and for \nthem and with them to determine where would be the best place to site \nthis production facility. It certainly should not be done in a site \nspecific amendment as we are now asked to consider.\n  Why does South Carolina feel that they must legislate the outcome of \nthis issue? Why should not South Carolina and the Members of this \nSenate be willing to take their chances that their site is the best \nsite?\n  The junior Senator from New Mexico earlier today in his remarks on \nthe underlying Thurmond amendment indicated that he would not approve \nof the site specific section of the bill. He said that he would support \nthe Reid amendment, and I think that is the way it should be.\n  This is not some small project that you can put any place you want. \nThis is a multibillion-dollar project. This is not a project that costs \na few million dollars, a few hundred million dollars. This is a project \nthat costs a few billion, and it is simply wrong to site it as has been \ndone by the committee in this bill. This is a multibillion-dollar \n\n[[Page S 11373]]\nproject upon which our nuclear deterrent critically depends.\n  As we all know, funds for all Federal projects are limited. We should \nnot be taking such a large and significant project and turning it into \na local jobs project.\n  I have already stated that Nevada is one of the places that is being \nconsidered for this project, and I say ``considered'' because I do not \nknow what ultimately, when all the merits are added up, where this \nproject would go. Nevada has a shot at it, of course. But we certainly \ncannot eliminate good science and good administration and in this bill \nsimply say it is going to South Carolina. It is wrong. This is one of \nthe types of things that gives Congress the name it has now. If there \nwere ever an example of congressional pork, this certainly would be a \ngood example.\n I also realize that Nevada's chances are eliminated if we do not pass \nthis amendment that is now before the body. So, Mr. President, this is \nnot a parochial issue, it is an issue of good Government. We all agree \nthat we have to balance the budget. We have a different method of doing \nthat. We have priorities that seem to be bantered around here which \nwould be the best way to go to balance the budget. We all agree it \nshould be balanced. But one of the things we have to stop doing is \nlegislating as we are doing in this manner. We simply cannot put a \nmultibillion dollar project in a certain State or district because the \nchairman of the committee is from that State or district. That is \nwrong.\n\n  This is an issue for all of us who care about spending our limited \ndollars wisely. This is not an appropriate way to spend our money. The \namendment that I have offered to preclude the earmarking of the site \nfor this new tritium project is an amendment for good Government and \nsaving the Government money. I ask all Senators to join me in defeating \nthis attempt to bypass the ongoing process to choose a technology and a \nsite for our Nation's future tritium production.\n  The language from the bill, that is from the Thurmond amendment, \nsays, ``* * * shall locate the new tritium production facility of the \nDepartment of Energy at the Savannah River site, South Carolina,'' \nbefore we know the technology, before we know the cost, before we know \nthe suitability of the Savannah River site for the project. It is \nregardless of NEPA reviews; that is, the environmental impact that it \nwould have on that part of the country. It is regardless of the cost of \nalternatives. What if we find an alternative that will save 10 percent? \nThat is hundreds of millions of dollars. What if we find an alternative \nthat will save us 5 or 3 or 20 percent? Should we not be given the \nlatitude, should our administration not be given the latitude of \nlooking at what would be best environmentally, what would be best from \na cost basis? What about the ability of the facility to start producing \ntritium? What if one site, that is, the one in South Carolina, would \ntake 8 or 9 years to develop this production capability? And let us \nassume another one would take 2 years. Should the administration not \nlook at which would come on line the quickest? Of course.\n  But what we are doing, we are citing it in this amendment, regardless \nof the environmental impact, regardless of the cost, and regardless of \nwhen it will be able to come on board, when we will be able to start \nproducing tritium. Does this mean we are forgoing the option of using a \ncommercial reactor for tritium production? It appears that way.\n  Mr. President, we have no tritium production today. Any production \nfacility will therefore be a new facility. It seems that we have just \nprecluded the commercial reactor option; that is, are we going to use \nsome of the commercial reactors that are now available for tritium, and \nwe would buy it from the commercial producer? That is an alternative. \nShould we not be able to take a look at that to see if that is most \nappropriate way to get our tritium for our nuclear weapons? Why are we \nforcing a decision now?\n  Mr. President, the question is the answer. We all know why the \ndecision is now being forced. We are needlessly constraining the \ndecision process for what? Again, the question assumes the answer. It \nis very obvious.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the motion to table the amendment, is there \na sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a unanimous consent request that \nhas been----\n  Mr. THURMOND. After we vote on the Exon amendment, not now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion would not be in order until after \nall the time is expired or yielded back.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will make it after the time expires.\n  I rise to oppose the Reid amendment and point out to my colleagues \nthat the Savannah River site has had the tritium production mission for \nover 40 years. Why change? The U.S. Government has invested heavily in \na unique infrastructure at the site for handling that naturally \ndecaying radioactive gas and for recycling tritium throughout the U.S. \nnuclear weapons stockpile.\n  For this reason, it would not be cost effective for the new tritium \nsource to be placed at any other location regardless of the technology \nused for production. The taxpayer, who is frequently mentioned here on \nthe floor, would have to duplicate the recycling infrastructure \nrequired to handle the radioactive tritium and the gas bottles which \ncontain it in our nuclear weapons. Additionally, transporting this \nradioactive gas across the land from separated production and recycling \nsites does not make sense either.\n  The colocation of tritium recycling facilities and the new tritium \nproduction facility is the only solution that makes economic sense for \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I wish to point out to the Senate that the Savannah River site is \nlocated on the border between the States of Georgia and South Carolina. \nThe people of both States have, after the land was condemned for this \nfacility, supported this mission of the site for the past 45 years and \ncooperated fully with the Government in every way possible in its \nimportant mission to sustain the nuclear stockpile.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from South Carolina, if all these \narguments are valid, then why should we have this in the bill? If all \nhis arguments are valid, then the people who are making the decision, \nthe Department of Energy and the Department of Defense, I am sure, will \ntake all those facts into consideration. If he is right, South Carolina \nwould wind up getting it.\n  I will yield whatever time the Senator from Nevada may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my senior colleague for his \nleadership in providing this amendment, which I strongly support.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Reid has indicated, he and I clearly have a \nvested interest in the outcome of this amendment. The Nevada test site \nis also being considered as the location for a new tritium source. \nFrankly, our view is it is far superior to any other location that is \nbeing considered. But I hope, Mr. President, my colleagues will \nunderstand that this is not just a battle between two States that seek \nto acquire a new major project which Senator Reid has indicated is of \nthe magnitude of several billions of dollars.\n  The Department of Energy's efforts to build a new tritium supply is \nprobably one of the most important current programs to ensure our \ncontinued confidence in our nuclear stockpile. The tritium supply \nprogram is absolutely essential to our national security program. \nSenator Reid alluded to it, but I would like to embellish on it a \nlittle bit. Tritium is a radioactive gas and tritium is used in almost \nall of our nuclear weapons to achieve a so-called booster effect; that \nis, to magnify or to amplify the full impact of the nuclear yields. And \nour national defense planners, strategists, have come to rely \n\n[[Page S 11374]]\nupon those projections. So the premise undergirding our national \ndefense strategic deterrence is predicated upon yields that can be \nachieved only with the use of tritium.\n  Tritium, however, has a relatively short half life, a little over 12 \nyears, which means that it decays at a rate of about 5 percent a year \nand needs to be replenished on a regular basis.\n  Recent reductions in our nuclear weapons stockpile have allowed us \nduring this interim period of time to recycle tritium from retired \nweapons and has reduced the pressure to build a new tritium supply \nsomewhat. But the need in terms of a long-range supply is still quite \ncritical.\n  Even if we take advantage of the tritium made available by retiring \nweapons, if we do not have a new tritium supply on line by the year \n2011--that is just 16 years away--we will need to start to dip into our \ntritium reserve.\n  By 2016, even using the reserve, it will not be adequate to meet our \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, since I think most everybody acknowledges it will take \nabout 15 years or more to get a tritium supply facility up and \noperational, we need to act now to make sure we will have a viable \nnuclear deterrent capability after the year 2011.\n  There are two ways, as I understand it, that you can produce tritium. \nThere is the traditional way that we have produced it in the past with \na nuclear reactor, and there is a new way which offers considerable \nhope and promise. It is a linear accelerator. Scientists tell us that \neither way is feasible, and the Department of Energy is in the process \nof evaluating these two options, including an evaluation of numerous \noptions within the nuclear reactor category.\n  A decision on which technology will provide us the most confidence \nand will be the most fiscally responsible is to be announced soon by \nthe Department of Energy.\n  In addition to evaluating the technology options, the Department is \ngoing to decide where to site this new tritium facility. Several sites \nare considered including one in Idaho, Savannah River, Oak Ridge, \nPantex, and the Nevada test site. This will be primarily research \noriented. I do not consider the naming of the site at this time an \nurgent matter.\n  Nevertheless, the Secretary of Energy is committed to the announcing \nof a preferred site for the tritium supply technology in the near \nfuture.\n  The Department recognizes the seriousness of this decision and has \ndevoted a considerable amount of time and a great many resources to \nensuring that the final decision will result in a viable cost-effective \ntritium supply program.\n  Mr. President, this is not the time for Congress to meddle in what is \nessentially a technical and scientific decision process. I realize that \nsome of my colleagues may be frustrated with what they perceive to be \ndelays in moving forward with the tritium supply decision, and given \nthe Department's track record in a number of programs, it is all too \neasy to place the blame for delays in a program on the Department of \nEnergy.\n  In this instance, however, I simply do not believe the criticism is \njustified. Since 1988, when the New Production Reactor Office was \nestablished to develop a new supply for tritium, there have been \nincredible changes in the environment in which the Department is \nacting: The Soviet Union has imploded. The cold war is over, and \nPresident Bush's three announcements during 1991 and 1992 of \nsignificant reductions in the nuclear weapons stockpile program has \ndramatically changed the picture with regard to a new tritium supply.\n  When the Bush administration, under Secretary of Energy Watkins, \ndecided not to pursue the new production reactor, an entire new plan \nhad to be developed for the production of a tritium resource.\n  The Secretary of Energy was required under the fiscal year 1994 \nDefense Authorization Act to issue a programmatic environmental impact \nstatement by March 1, 1995. This draft PEIS for tritium supply and \nrecycling issued by the Department last February complied with the \nrequirement and is the latest product of a 7-year process to develop a \nrational, cost-effective, scientifically based program to ensure the \ncapability of our nuclear weapons well into the next century.\n  No preferred site or technology was identified by the February 1995 \ndocument, nor is one required under the NEPA process. At that point, \nthe Secretary of Energy committed to executing a record of decision by \nNovember of this year.\n  By Government standards, that is a reasonably quick turnaround. The \nSecretary also made it clear that a decision on the preferred \ntechnology or site may be announced prior to the November record of \ndecision.\n  That is where we stand today, Mr. President. The PEIS is on the \nstreet and the Secretary is committed to a decision by November of this \nyear. The Secretary, clearly feeling she did not have sufficient basis \nto make a decision on site or technology prior to March 1, is currently \nevaluating the technical and scientific evidence gathered through the \nNEPA process. That is as it should be.\n  To give you some indication of the magnitude of the PEIS, this \nindicates the voluminous nature of the information that is being \ncompiled, that is currently being reviewed and analyzed by the \nDepartment. These are two volumes entitled ``The Draft Programmatic \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for Tritium Supply and Recycling.''\n  It is my view that the Secretary ought to be permitted to move \nforward in that evaluating process. It is hard to understand how \nCongress, on a matter of such importance to our national defense, could \neven consider substituting its judgment on a parochial basis for the \nscientific and technical expertise that is being considered by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  I realize that the language our amendment seeks to strike only \nspecifies the site for the new tritium source. The language presumes to \nleave the technology choice to the Secretary of Energy and only \nidentifies the site for the new facility.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, it is not quite that simple. In order \nto obtain the most reliable and cost-effective results, the Department \nof Energy must maintain the flexibility it needs to determine both the \nsite and the technology for the new tritium resource.\n  As the draft PEIS makes abundantly clear, each of the sites being \nconsidered for the new tritium source has its own advantages and \ndisadvantages.\n  Should the DOE decide to build a new reactor, whether it is a so-\ncalled triple-play reactor, advocated by the senior Senator from South \nCarolina, or any other type of reactor, Savannah River appears to be \nthe most likely site. The Nevada test site is less suitable and, \nparenthetically, I would oppose building a reactor anywhere in Nevada. \nOn the other hand, given the freedom to make the most rational \ndecision, the Nevada test site would be the preferred alternate, if the \nchosen technology turns out to be an accelerator. Others would \ndisagree, and I acknowledge this is a debatable proposition, but at \nthis point, the best course we in Congress can pursue is simply let the \nNEPA process run its course.\n  In supporting the Reid-Bryan amendment, that is what the Senate is \npursuing: To allow the course which the Congress set in motion in 1994 \nby directing that a programmatic EIS be developed to make the \ndetermination as to site and technology for the new tritium supply. \nThat is what we allow to occur.\n  By leaving the language in the bill as it currently is, we preempt \nthat process, and in the interest of a parochial decisionmaking \nprocess, foreclose the Department from making a determination both, in \nmy view, on technology as well as site.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time back to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will make brief remarks on this amendment. \nI support the Senator from South Carolina and his position. Savannah \nRiver has been the tritium production complex since the dawn of the \nnuclear age. It has the infrastructure, it has the trained work force, \nit has the experience, it is a logical place for the new tritium \nfacility, whatever technology is being chosen. \n\n[[Page S 11375]]\n\n  We do not have in this bill now, as I understand this amendment--I \nhave not been a part of working on this amendment--but as I understand \nit, there is nothing in the bill now, after this amendment is adopted, \nthat would tell the Secretary of Energy what kind of reactor to have. \nShe still has that choice--the light-water reactor, the gas reactor, \nthe multipurpose reactor, heavy water or even the accelerator. All of \nthose technologies are available.\n  The Secretary of Energy said she is going to make this decision \nsometime in late summer or early fall. That means that this bill is \nbound to be in conference in September, and if the Secretary of Energy \nmakes any other decision, other than Savannah River, then certainly we \nwill have a time to study that carefully and to react to that in \nconference.\n  So I support the Senator from South Carolina on this. I urge the \ndefeat of the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield the able junior Senator from Georgia such time \nas he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as my good colleague from Georgia \nnoted, the Savannah River site has been the site for weapons tritium \nproduction for nearly half a century--specifically 40 years. Obviously, \ngiven the importance of the production of that plant in terms of our \nnuclear policy, a very large capital investment has already been made \nby the taxpayers of the United States on the Savannah River site's \nunique, extensive tritium handling, tritium bottle recycling and \nproduction infrastructure--a huge capital investment.\n  If the new tritium production facility which DOE was planning were to \nbe located at another site other than Savannah River, the large tritium \nbottle recycling facilities and the tritium production handling \nfacilities would have to be replicated, rebuilt at a new site. This \nwould be very expensive, cost-ineffective, and not wise.\n  Another alternative, I guess, would be to transport radioactive \ntritium to the Savannah River site bottle recycling from a distant new \nproduction site. This would require expensive, unique transportation, \nand would be perceived as a potential negative public health risk in \nthe States transversed. On this basis, it is both logical and cost-\neffective for the Congress to designate this longstanding facility, a \nfacility uniquely prepared to deal with this production as the location \nfor the tritium production facility.\n  The bottom line here is, if you are talking about a change, you are \ntalking about spending millions and millions of dollars, and you are \ntalking about breaking the continuity chain of preparedness that the \nSavannah River site represents.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, how much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes remaining for the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, and the Senator from Nevada has 19\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the ranking member, the former \nchairman of the committee, said the only question is what kind of \nfacility. Well, that really is not the only question. But, in fact, if \nthat were the only question, why in the world would you want to site in \nSouth Carolina, no matter what kind of facility, a reactor accelerator?\n  If the Secretary of Energy is going to make this decision late \nsummer/early fall, why would Congress want to meddle with what is \nalready in the process of being decided? If there were ever an example \nof congressional meddling, this certainly would be it.\n  Mr. President, this is a big project. I am reading from one \nnewspaper:\n\n       The new tritium production facility would be the Nation's \n     first since the 1960's. Cost estimates range as high as $10 \n     billion, and the project could create more than 2,000 jobs.\n\n  In the other body, something like this was tried and, again, I read \nfrom the Energy Daily of June 1995, where over there it was referred to \nas ``radioactive pork.''\n  Well, thank goodness the House in its wisdom got rid of that \nradioactive pork, and that was deleted from their legislation.\n  If the Savannah River site is so good, why do they not let it compete \non its merits? If the threat that I heard--namely, if the Department of \nEnergy sites it someplace else, we will take a look at it in \nconference. This is a threat to the Secretary to site it on the \nSavannah River, or we will take care of it in conference. That is \nwrong.\n  My amendment lets the system of Government work the way it should, \nnot with ``radioactive pork.'' It would be with the orderly process of \nGovernment. Let me repeat, Mr. President, the language in the \nunderlying amendment of the Senator from South Carolina that I and \nSenator Bryan are attempting to delete States, ``shall locate the new \ntritium production facility * * * at the Savannah River Site, South \nCarolina.''\n  We are subverting, standing on its head, making a mockery of the \nsystem of Government that we have, where the Director of the Department \nof Energy--the Secretary--will make a determination after due \nconsultation with the Department of Defense, with the people that work \nfor and with her, as to where it should go.\n  But in this Thurmond amendment, we are going to site it in South \nCarolina before we know the technology that will be used, the cost, or \nthe suitability of the Savannah River site for the project. There may \nbe technology that should only go to Savannah River that the Secretary \nwill decide on. Or she may find that that is technology that they want \nto use and should not go to Savannah River for many reasons. Maybe the \ncost of the Savannah River, because of all the pollution from the \nfailed reactor, for over 45 years, makes that site so expensive, so \nunreliable, that it should go someplace else.\n  This language sites it in South Carolina, regardless of the \nenvironmental concerns, regardless of the need for reviews, regardless \nof the cost alternatives, and, of course, as I have mentioned before, \nregardless of the impact on the schedule to produce tritium. What if we \nneed to get tritium produced quickly. Does this mean that we are \nforegoing the option of using an existing commercial reactor for \ntritium production? Yes, it does. That may be the decision the \nSecretary will make, saving the taxpayers of this country billions of \ndollars.\n  We have no tritium production today. Any production facility will \ntherefore be a new facility. It seems that we have just precluded the \ncommercial reactor option. That is wrong, and that is not what we \nshould want or what this Congress should be up to. We have certain \nbudget constraints that we have all been working under. This flies in \nthe face of that. Why are we forcing a decision now when we know, as \nindicated by the senior Senator from Georgia, that the Secretary is \ngoing to make this decision in late summer? Late summer is upon us. \nThis decision could come within a matter of weeks.\n  We are needlessly constraining the decision process. For what? We are \ndoing it for ``radioactive pork,'' and that is wrong.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take a minute or two more. I \nwant to just recall that in 1946, when I was Governor of South \nCarolina, the project was announced to build this plant in Aiken, SC, \non the Savannah River between Georgia and South Carolina. I moved to \nAiken to practice law. I guess I represented over 90 percent of the \nlandowners down there. They had the land condemned and taken away, \nwhether they wanted to or not. The Government said, ``We need this land \nfor this plant.'' The Government needed it. They sacrificed a lot. They \nunderwent many hardships. The plant was built.\n  Why now do we want to take away the opportunity for those people who \nsacrificed like they did to help the Government to build this plant for \nthe good of our country? We are not asking that they use any particular \nkind of technology. They can use the accelerator or they can use the \nreactor, or whatever they want to.\n  We are merely saying it should not be taken away from these people \nwho \n\n[[Page S 11376]]\nsacrificed so much in their lifetime for this plant and for the \nGovernment.\n  We feel it should not be moved, regardless of what the technology is. \nIt ought to remain at this site. It has been there for 45 years. Why \ntake it away? They have done a good job. They have the infrastructure. \nThey have the workers. They have everything to make a success.\n  I do hope that this amendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the proponents of sight infrastructure costs \nas their main argument, but this facility will produce training for 50 \nyears.\n  I say, what is the lowest life cycle cost of 50 years? Do we care? We \nshould care, Mr. President.\n  I yield to my colleague from Nevada whatever time he desires.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that we have heard what essentially \nare three arguments by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. One is that it has been there for 45 years, and \ntherefore it should continue in perpetuity for 45 years.\n  Mr. President, I think the answer to that question is self-evident. \nWe are considering prospectively what is the best location for the \ntritium production facility in the future. That is the entire purpose \nof the problematic environmental impact statement.\n  Indeed, they may make and come to the same conclusion that our \nfriend, the senior Senator from South Carolina made. But that is not an \nanalytical or rational argument for a policy that has always been \nthere, always been that way, and therefore we should continue that way \nforever in the future.\n  The second argument that my friend made was to suggest that somehow \nthe recycling operation has been at Savannah River and that by \ncolocating the new production facility, somehow we would ease or \neliminate the transportation of tritium.\n  Mr. President, that is simply not true. As my colleagues, I am sure, \nknow, we do not move nuclear bombs around the country, to have the \ntritium components of them added in second. When we are talking about \nretrofitting or adding the tritium component, you are talking about \ndoing that at a facility that has the capability of doing that.\n  That is, first and foremost, the facility at Pantex. No one should \nhave the impression that by having a recycling and production facility \nin South Carolina that we eliminate the necessity of transporting that \nnew tritium product to either Pantex, or there is a facility at the \nNevada test site that could handle the disassembly.\n  My friend makes the argument of sacrifice. While I am sure he recites \nthe history, nobody quarrels with the senior Senator from South \nCarolina when he describes the history of the state that he has \nrepresented so long and so ably, and which I know he has great personal \naffection.\n  If we are talking about sacrifice, he is talking about the few \nthousand acres at Savannah River. Nevada is the mother of all \nsacrifices--the mother of all sacrifices. The Nevada test site alone is \nlarger than the entire State of Rhode Island. Just the Nevada test \nsite. If you want to talk about Federal sacrifice, 87 percent of the \nentire land mass of the State of Nevada is under the jurisdiction of \nthe Federal Government, either the Department of Energy, the Department \nof Defense, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service.\n  I must say that I do not think any of those three arguments are \ncompelling.\n  Finally, I return very briefly to, I think, the argument that my \nsenior colleague makes so ably. That is, we started the process in \n1994. We said, ``Let's look, see how we should handle future tritium \nproduction. Let's have a problematic EIS.'' Added into that mix is the \nfact there is a new technology we want to take a look at, the linear \naccelerator technology.\n  There are different types of reactor technologies that we want to \nconsider, as well, some four technologies within the rubric of the \nreactor option, which is the other option other than the accelerator. \nAll of those ought to be considered rationally as part of an evaluation \nprocess and ought not to be the subject of micromanagement by the \nCongress.\n  Let this process work its course. We in Nevada have a vested \ninterest. We would like to see it in Nevada. I would like to see the \nlinear accelerator, but I am willing to take my chance. I think that is \nthe best policy.\n  I urge the Congress and this Senate to allow that course to work its \nway, as well, and let the experts make the decision. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2114 to Amendment No. 2111\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to make certain technical amendments to the Thurmond-Domenici \namendment. These have been agreed to by both sides. I send them to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2114 to amendment No. 2111.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Page 8, line 17 strike out ``$2,341,596,000 and substitute \n     in lieu thereof $2,386,596,000''.\n       Page 8, line 20 strike out ``$2,121,226,000 and substitute \n     in lieu thereof ``$2,151,266,000''.\n       Page 9, line 1 strike out ``$220,330,000'' and substitute \n     in lieu thereof ``$235,330,000''.\n       Page 9, line 25 strike out ``$26,000,000'' and substitute \n     in lieu thereof ``$41,000,000''.\n       Page 13, line 6 strike out ``$550,510,000'' and substitute \n     in lieu thereof ``$505,510,000''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. REID. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2114) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2113\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to table the Reid amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Could the Presiding Officer indicate what the parliamentary status is \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first vote will occur in relation to the \nmotion to table the Exon amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I am informed Senator McCain is not going to offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote on the motion to table the Exon \namendment can occur now.\n  Mr. REID. Immediately following that will be the Reid-Bryan \namendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the motion to table.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes. If I understand the agreement right, the Senator from \nNebraska has 2 minutes, as does the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I ask unanimous consent, as previously agreed to, that immediately \npreceding the vote on the Exon amendment, 2 minutes be allocated to the \nSenator from Nebraska and 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2112\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, there can be no question that we are about \nto cast a critically important vote. We will send a signal that will \nresonate around the world and have far-reaching implications on \nmankind's chances of moving further away from a reliance on nuclear \nweapons and a possible nuclear holocaust, or we can reverse course, \nabruptly and shamefully. As the world's leading nuclear superpower, we \ncan send a signal loud and clear that, notwithstanding our \nprotestations about the spread of nuclear devices, notwithstanding our \nsupposed commitment to a nuclear test ban treaty, we are going to \nreverse course. \n\n[[Page S 11377]]\n\n  The Exon-Hatfield amendment assures a constructive policy of gradual \nand very deliberate thought processes, and offers the nuclear olive \nbranch, if you will, to potential friend and potential foe alike, that \nthe United States of America offers a hand of nuclear understanding.\n  If we vote down, if we table the Exon-Hatfield amendment, it is going \nto be a significant step backward for which we will not forgive \nourselves, I suggest, for centuries to come. It is the time we \nreemphasize our restraint, our vigilance, and agree to the Exon-\nHatfield amendment as we have explained in great detail during debate \nthis morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to say that every weapons \nsystem, indeed every machine in our technological society, requires \ntesting. The hydronuclear testing is the only tool left to assess our \nconfidence in the safety and reliability of the shrinking nuclear \nstockpile.\n  Mr. President, we need to do this. We are living in a dangerous \nworld. It is important that we be informed as to the reliability and \nsafety of our weapons. They may have to be used. I do not need to cite \nthe situations that could be dangerous in various parts of the world. \nWe know about North Korea. We do not know what Russia is going to do, \nwhat China is going to do. We do not know what certain nations like \nIran or Iraq and Libya will do, the terrorist nations. We must be \nprepared. And to be prepared we have to know what our weapons will do. \nWe have to know they will be safe and reliable, and that is the purpose \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table the \nExon amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Simon, Mr. Wellstone, and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2115.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.    REPEAL OF DEFENSE FIREWALL.\n\n       (A) Strike Section 201(a) through 201(b)(1)(B) of H. Con. \n     Res. 67, as passed by \n\n[[Page S 11378]]\n     both Houses of Congress and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 201. DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.\n\n       (A) DEFINITION.--As used in this section and for the \n     purposes of allocations made pursuant to section 302(a) or \n     602(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, for the \n     discretionary category, the term `discretionary spending \n     limit' means--\n       (1) with respect to fiscal year 1996, for the discretionary \n     category $485,074,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $531,768,000,000 in outlays;\n       (2) with respect to fiscal year 1997, for the discretionary \n     category $482,430,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $520,295,000,000 in outlays;\n       (3) with respect to fiscal year 1998, for the discretionary \n     category $490,692,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $512,632,000,000 in outlays;\n       (4) with respect to fiscal year 1999, for the discretionary \n     category $482,207,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $510,482,000,000 in outlays;\n       (5) with respect to fiscal year 2000, for the discretionary \n     category $489,379,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $514,234,000,000 in outlays;\n       (6) with respect to fiscal year 2001, for the discretionary \n     category $496,601,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $516,403,000,000 in outlays;\n       (7) with respect to fiscal year 2002, for the discretionary \n     category $498,837,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     $515,075,000,000 in outlays;\n\n     as adjusted for changes in concepts and definitions and \n     emergency appropriations.\n       (b) Point of Order in the Senate.--\n       (1) In General.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider--\n       (A) any concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002 (or \n     amendment, motion, or conference report on such a resolution) \n     that provides discretionary spending in excess of the \n     discretionary spending limit for such fiscal year; or\n       (B) Within 30 days of the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the House and Senate Appropriations Committees shall meet to \n     consider the reallocation of the fiscal year 1996 \n     suballocations made pursuant to section 602(b) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I know this psychologically is a terrible \nway to open a debate, but I have no delusions about the possibility of \nwinning on this amendment. Given the makeup of the Senate right now, it \nis going to be several years before an amendment like this will take \nroot, but it will take root when the American people focus not only on \ntheir misery but what caused it.\n  Everybody here is aware of the fact that we treat defense as not only \nthe highest priority but everything else is secondary to it.\n  Not to be trite, but the truth of the matter is that we, like so many \ncivilizations, from the Israelites on, may very well find that the \nstrength of this Nation is not all in planes, tanks, and guns. How we \ntreat our people, the kind of health care they get, the kind of \neducation they get, the kind of environment they live in, those things \ndetermine what a powerful nation is, too. It usually takes me about an \nhour or two after I read the Washington Post in the morning to get \nenthused sufficiently enough to come to work. This morning it was \nespecially depressing.\n  Here were three front page stories: House votes to prohibit States \nfrom paying for an abortion in cases of rape or incest. Mr. President, \nto me, that is a form of barbarism, to say that a child who may be \npregnant by her father, or the most innocent housewife who is raped, if \nshe has the money, no problem. If she is poor, she will birth that \nchild. You remember the beatitude, ``Blessed are those who are \npersecuted.'' If that is not a form of persecution, I do not know what \nis.\n  The second story was: Senate votes to abrogate antiballistic missile \ntreaty. That is not entirely true, but figuratively and, down the road, \nliterally it is true. We will decide the interpretation of the treaty; \nwe will decide whether it is abrogated or not, and if the Russians \nhappen to disagree, so be it. The language of the bill itself said the \nSenate, not the President, will decide whether the ABM Treaty is in our \ninterest or not. We will decide whether we want to live by it or not. \nAnd that solemn document that we put our names on in 1972 will be for \nnaught. Who else wants to sign a treaty with us knowing that that is \nthe way we treat our treaties? We simply cannot give up on the cold \nwar. We just love it too much. Dr. Strangelove. Another beatitude is, \n``Blessed are the peacemakers.'' Not too many people are blessed in \nthis body.\n  The third story was: House cuts $9 billion in education, health care, \nand food for the poor. ``Blessed are the poor,'' unless one of them \nhappens to get pregnant at the age of 17. What do we do in the Senate? \nWe add $7 billion more than the Secretary of Defense and our chiefs of \nstaff want. Can you imagine that? We are adding $7 billion more than \nour defense authorization asked for.\n  It was depressing. And as I read those three stories, I pondered on \nwhat else. Medicare? No firewalls around Medicare, health care for the \nelderly; there are no firewalls there. We are going to cut $270 billion \nover the next 7 years. We are going to give the States block grants on \nMedicaid and AFDC, not necessarily because we think it is more \nefficient, but because we are going to cut back on Medicaid. All that \nis health care for the poorest of the poor.\n  We are going to cut PBS, which is one of the few things that provide \na little enrichment for our children. ``Sesame Street'' and Big Bird, \nadios. ``All Things Considered,'' which every Member of the Senate \nlistens to going to and from work on NPR, adios. No commercials. We \nneed to privatize this so we can get some commercials on PBS and NPR. I \nwant to see, right in the middle of the Civil War series, a bunch of \nyoungsters running down the beach with a Budweiser in their hands. That \nis what I call cultural enrichment.\n  And the arts--how I wish that guy Mapplethorpe had never received a \ngrant. You see, he does not have anything to do with the repertory \ntheater in my State. But we will be lucky to make it in my State with \nour symphony without some help from the National Endowment.\n  Food stamps. We did not develop food stamp programs willy-nilly. We \ndid it because we made a conscious decision that we did not want \nanybody in this country to go hungry. Everybody acts as though it was \nsome sort of a Communist conspiracy that should have never been put in \nplace. We are going to cut that. If you do not happen to have a PAC or \na $1,000 check, you are not getting anything out of this crowd.\n  Eliminate affirmative action. I have heard so many anecdotes on \naffirmative action that make my blood boil, and some of them are true. \nIt has been an abused program. But do not say that the time has come \nwhen we have a level playing field when 14 percent of the black males \nin this country are unemployed, and 40 percent of the black teenagers \nare unemployed, compared to about 5 percent white.\n  You know, if we were to eliminate this famous tax cut I hear so much \nabout--that is what the Medicare cut is, $270 billion; and $250 billion \nof that--virtually all--is for a tax cut, 70 percent of which goes to \npeople who make over $100,000 a year. When I was a young practicing \nlawyer, I yearned for the day when I would make $100,000 a year. So now \nI am going to get a nice healthy tax cut. Every Senator gets $133,000 \nor $135,000 a year, a big fat pension, a health care plan second to \nnone, and we are going to get a tax cut when 50 percent of the people \nin this country over 65 cannot sleep at night because they are in \nabject terror of getting sick and not being able to pay their bills.\n  If we just cut Medicare by half that amount and eliminate the tax cut \nand spend the other $135 billion on education and things that make us a \ngreat nation, we can still balance the budget in the year 2002 and do \nwhat we know we ought to do.\n  No, we are going to reward those who have already been richly \nblessed. And we are going to further abuse those at the bottom of the \nladder. Indeed, we will step on their hands if they happen to be \nreaching for the first rung. We have become so cynical and indifferent. \nSo we have to put firewalls around defense to make sure none of it ever \ngets out of the Pentagon into the hands of some poor soul who might \nneed it for an education.\n  Senator Kohl is going to offer an amendment later today which would \ncut the $7 billion which was added on to this bill. Even if he were to \nprevail, which he will not even come close to doing, you could not take \nthat money and use it for any other purpose.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes and 50 seconds \nremaining.\n\n[[Page S 11379]]\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will you kindly notify me when I have used a total of 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, here is a chart which shows what is going to happen \nfrom 1995 to the year 2002, in defense. We go from $264 billion in 1995 \nto $280 billion in 2002.\n  What do we do with everything else--what is known as domestic \ndiscretionary spending--education, health care, you name it, medical \nresearch, law enforcement? What happens to that? It goes from $241 to \n$218 billion over 7 years.\n  Of the spending cuts that are projected to be made over the next 7 \nyears to reduce the deficit and pay for the Republican tax cut for the \nwealthy, domestic spending, the things that make us great will absorb \n43 percent of all the cuts. What in the name of God are we thinking \nabout? We will spend $400 billion more for defense spending than \ndomestic programs over the next 7 years. Mr. President, $400 billion \nless to take care of the real needs of the people of this country, that \nwe are going to spend on defense.\n  How much are we spending on defense? Are we looking for two wars, as \nthe Bottom-Up Review said?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Not until I finish this statement.\n  This chart demonstrates what we spend for defense in comparison to \nour eight or nine most likely adversaries, Russia, China, North Korea, \nIraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Cuba--name somebody else. I do not care who \nyou name. Our defense budget is twice as big as all nine of them put \ntogether. If you add NATO, twice as much as the rest of the world.\n  What are the proponents of the bill we are considering today \nproposing? That we add $7 billion to the defense budget.\n  We get so hairy chested around here when defense comes up. Everybody \nfavors a strong defense. Nobody wants to ever be vulnerable. This is \nwhat you call piling on. You just cannot pile on enough money. Even the \nPentagon is trying to shovel it back to us, and we will not take it.\n  I appreciate the Defense Department. When we have a crisis, I am glad \nwe have aircraft carriers. I am glad we have all the sophisticated \nweaponry. All I am saying is, there ought to be some kind of balance, \nbecause it is not going to make any difference how much we spend on \ndefense if we are not careful about what we are doing back home.\n  Mr. President, I saw a poll of high school seniors about 5 years ago. \nWho are your heroes? About the only one I can remember is Tom Cruise. I \nthink Mr. T was on the list. It was a list of rock stars. Michael \nJackson was high on the list. That is who the high school seniors \nrevere in this country. Mother Theresa did not make it. The Pope did \nnot make it. Poor old George Bush did not make it. Not even mom and \npop.\n  Senators, can you imagine somebody asking you that question when you \nwere in high school, who were your heroes? I would have popped out my \nfather so fast it would make your head swim. You talk about a hero. I \nworshipped the ground he walked on. Mom and pop did not make this list. \nIf we keep going the way we have gone this year in the U.S. Congress, \nTim McVeigh and David Koresh will be on the list next year.\n  I am not trying to take the money away from the Pentagon with this \namendment. I am simply saying the people of this body ought to be more \nthoughtful about where the real strengths of the Nation are. We ought \nto be more thoughtful about people who have not had the luck we have \nhad.\n  I know a woman who is very wealthy and she is always saying, ``Can't \neverybody be rich and beautiful like me?'' The truth of the matter is, \nmost people who have made it, and especially if you come from a town \nduring the Depression with a population of 851, have had a lot of help. \nI did not become a Senator just because I am such a great person. I \ntell you why I did it. I did it because this same Congress, back when \nthey were a little more sensitive about things like this, gave me a \nfree education.\n  That is right. My brother went to Harvard. I went to Northwestern. My \nfather was a poor man. He could no more have afforded that than he \ncould fly to the Moon. I was fortunate and received a little Government \nhelp after World War II, and had a teacher who taught me to speak and \nread well, did something for my self-esteem. The main thing I did, and \nwhat most people that make it did, is choose my parents well.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say I am not trying to move money out \nof the Defense Department into any of these other programs. I am saying \nas a psychological thing we ought not to be sitting here and saying you \ncannot touch defense for anything, no matter how critical it may be.\n  If we continue the way we have started this year, and especially that \nContract With America, this country is in for a terrible shock. That is \nnot what the people were voting for, they wanted change, but this is \nnot the change they were voting for, I do not think.\n  When they begin to feel the pain, they are going to begin to wonder \nwhat they voted for. I am telling you, if we keep going the way we are \ngoing now, trying to tinker with the Constitution, spending every extra \ndime we can get our hands on on defense, that age of know-nothingism \nback in the middle of the 19th century will be known as the age of \nenlightenment.\n  As you know I have such a reverence for the freedom of religion in \nthis country, but there is a great quote of Isaiah, admonishing the \nIsraelites when they got sort of cynical about all their people.\n  He said to them:\n\n       Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, \n     judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.\n\n  Maybe that is just good for the Senate prayer breakfast or on Sunday \nmorning. It does not seem to be terribly relevant here.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will yield 6 minutes?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first let me suggest to my good friend, \nSenator Bumpers, he has given a very great speech about what he thinks \nwe ought to be doing in the United States. But I must tell those who \nare listening, very little of it has to do with the amendment he is \ntalking about.\n  The amendment he is talking about is very, very simple. In 1990 I was \nprivileged to have an idea--that I had been thinking about and worrying \nabout--become the law. In that year, 1990, and 3 years thereafter, we \ndecided that once the Congress of the United States voted in an amount \nof money that they wanted spent on the defense of the United States, \nthat during that year they only had two options regarding defense: \nFirst, if they did not want to spend all of the defense money, they \napplied what was saved on the deficit; and, second, if they want to \nspend defense money on anything else, they had to get 60 votes to do \nit.\n  That is a pretty reasonable approach, when you consider the \npropensity of legislators to want more and more for programs that they \nlove, or that they need, or that they want for their constituents. And \nyou put it up against a big defense budget and everybody can say, ``Oh, \ntake a little bit away for this. Take a little bit away for that.'' \nFrankly, if we had not seen that happen in the processes around here, \nwe would not have been concerned about it. But whenever the pressure is \ntough on nondefense spending, the nest egg of defense is looked to as \nthe savior for every other program you want.\n  Mr. President, I believe this year we did the right thing. We decided \nthat once we voted on a budget resolution, which was indeed a \ncompromise--between the House that wanted more, and the Senate that \nwanted less--once you compromised on that, you can only spend defense \nmoney if you get 60 votes in the U.S. Senate, a supermajority.\n  I believe that is very good law for the United States. It is \npractical. And if there is a real emergency and you want to move money \nfrom defense, you can get 60 votes. But otherwise you leave defense for \ndefense.\n  These arguments about how much do we spend versus the rest of the \nworld--\n\n[[Page S 11380]]\nlet me remind Americans right off the bat, we decided on an All-\nVolunteer Army, and we pay our military well. So the first thing you \nhave to do, to all the other militaries in the world, is adjust what \nthey are spending to what we are spending because we pay our men and \nwomen good wages. In fact, we are hopefully moving toward the \nmarketplace. And few other countries do that. So we are proud to pay \nour people who serve in the military a living wage and give them \nbenefits and other things, because we are depending upon them and their \nhigh quality.\n  My last point will be on Medicare and Medicaid. If it was relevant, I \nwould suggest that a comparison of the next 7 years compared to a 1995 \nfreeze will tell you that defense will go down $13 billion, Medicaid \nwill go up $149 billion, Medicare will go up $349 billion. That is the \nreality of the current budget.\n  Having said that, the truth of the matter is if you took the firewall \ndown--which is what this amendment would do--you could not spend any of \nthat money on Medicare or Medicaid in any event. These are \nentitlements. That money would be controlled by the appropriators and \nspent on a myriad of domestic programs which feel pinched and which \nMembers of Congress might decide in an appropriations process they want \nto take from defense to spend.\n  My last point, and it is quick. First of all, the Senator should know \nthe Bumpers amendment is subject to a point of order, and I will make \nthat when we are finished with our debate. That means it will take 60 \nvotes to agree to that amendment. I think that is fair, too, because it \nis consistent with the firewall.\n  But I just did some quick numbers on domestic spending versus \nmilitary spending, and I will just quickly share them with you all. In \n1990, nondefense discretionary was $202 billion. In 1995 it will be \n$274 billion. That is a 36 percent nominal change upward. Defense was \n$300 billion. It went to $270 billion, which is minus $30 billion, \nwhich is minus 10 percent during the same period of time. In fact, the \nonly part of the discretionary budget that went down is defense. \nNondefense went up.\n  I am willing to admit, as one who is familiar with the budget, that \nthe next 6 years will be tougher on nondefense. But I submit that it is \nnot right for us, during a calendar year when we have said this is what \nwe need for defense, to leave it vulnerable to an appropriations \nprocess which will take from it whenever and wherever it is deemed \nnecessary, not because of defense needs but because of other program \nneeds. I submit, in closing, the more pressure there is on domestic \nspending, nondefense, the more you ought to keep the walls if you are \nsatisfied that what you need is represented within the defense number \nfor defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this issue has already been raised and voted \non just 2 months ago on the budget resolution, as the Senator from New \nMexico said. That was the appropriate place to debate this.\n  These firewalls are part of an overall Senate and House budget \nagreement. I think just to pick out one part of it and say we are going \nto pull it apart, either from the defense point of view or overall \npoint of view--contrary to what the Senator from Arkansas may be \nassuming, these firewalls also protect domestic spending for the next 3 \nyears. There are many Members of this body in the House and the Senate \nwho feel that defense spending should be higher and are willing to take \nit out of domestic spending. We saw the House vote last night to cut $9 \nbillion out of the domestic budget. Believe me, if we take down the \nfirewalls, within a year or so you may find just the reverse, I say to \nmy friend from Arkansas, than what you assumed. Because what the \nSenator from Arkansas assumes is if you take down the firewalls, you \nare going to take money out of defense and put it in domestic. Not \nnecessarily so. That has been the indication in the past. I am not sure \nthat is the case now.\n  I think, Mr. President, though, the main point I want to make is the \nfirewalls do keep a separate account between defense and domestic. But \nthere is nothing in the firewall provision of the Budget Act that in \nany way prevents defense from being cut. Anyone who wants to cut \ndefense can come on the floor, propose an amendment to cut defense, \neither on this bill or the appropriations bill, and defense will be cut \nif a majority approve that amendment. What the firewalls do, and I \nthink this is very important, they say if you cut defense it goes to \ndeficit reduction, it does not get shifted to another spending account. \nThat is what the firewalls do. I think they are very important. I think \nthey preserve both defense and domestic spending, as the Congress \ndecides on the budget resolution.\n  It is not as if we do not make decisions here. We make decisions on \nthe budget resolution. We decide what goes within those firewalls. We \ndo it every year. So that is the key place to make these changes.\n  I urge the Bumpers amendment not be agreed to.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nrequired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered today by \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  I am concerned about defense spending levels. I have argued for years \nthat defense was under funded. Even this year's budget resolution \nrecommends defense budget levels lower than those I have advocated. As \nthe search for precious dollars intensifies, I anticipate more and more \nattempts to divert defense funds to nondefense programs. We have seen \nattempt to fund nondefense programs in the last 2 days.\n  The Department of Defense has done more than its share in the budget \nreduction efforts. Defense has contributed more to achieving the \ndeficit reductions outlined in the 1990 budget agreement than any other \nexecutive branch agency.\n  Establishing the caps will not prevent reductions in defense \nspending. It will, however, discourage raids on the defense budget by \nthose seeking to fund domestic programs at the expense of our Nations' \nsecurity.\n  With the caps on defense and nondefense spending levels, any \nreductions in these categories would have to go directly to reduce the \ndeficit. This was the case when the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 was \npassed. In fiscal year 1994, the cap on separate categories was \neliminated allowing funds to be transferred between defense and \ndomestic programs. As a result, we saw transfers out of defense to pay \nfor some domestic programs from the Defense authorization and \nappropriations bill last year.\n  Since 1990, the defense budget has been reduced more than any other. \nWe have asked thousands of service men and women to end their careers \nearlier than they had planned. DOD drastically scaled back procurement \nas well as research and development. The Joint Chiefs have testified \nthat we are on the brink of return to the hollow force of the 1970's \nand early 1980's. At the same time, we are increasing the number and \ntype of missions assigned to our forces. The Armed Services Committee \nworked very hard this year, within the defense levels in the concurrent \nresolution on the budget, to reverse these trends. In order to maintain \nthese initiatives, I support the efforts of Senator Domenici and the \nBudget Committee to establish firewalls or caps on domestic and defense \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, the Bumpers amendment would remove the protections we \nhave worked hard to achieve. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S 11381]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as he may require to the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arkansas for the reasons that have been previously stated \nrelative to the contribution of defense spending to reducing our \ndeficit over the past decade, the limitations on commitment to defense \nspending for the next 7 years as opposed to the significant increases \nin spending that will go to a number of programs but particularly to \nMedicare and Medicaid, and for the reasons stated by Senator from \nGeorgia, and the Senator from South Carolina. However, what I would \nlike to do is to discuss this proposal to allow further reductions in \ndefense spending in a broader context.\n  There are some on the left who view every defense dollar as a dollar \nthat is taken from social spending. And in all candor there are some on \nthe right who view every defense dollar as a dollar taken from deficit \nreduction.\n  I submit, Mr. President, that neither can understand why we are \nasking for more money in this legislation than the President requested, \nalbeit a very small amount more, $7 billion. Both I think the left and \nthe right are missing the big picture of history by focusing on the \nsmall print of the budget.\n  There is a great deal at stake in this debate. Defense spending must \nbe placed in a broader context. That context is outlined with \nexceptional clarity by historian Donald Kagan in his new book ``On the \nOrigins of War''. In case after case, he argues, war has been ``The \nproduct of the failure of the victors * * * to construct a solid basis \nfor peace.''\n  He goes on to say, ``A persistent and repeated error through the ages \nhas been the failure to understand that the preservation of peace \nrequires active effort, planning, the expenditure of resources, and \nsacrifice, just as war does.''\n  This historical fact should sober us. Great, victorious powers have a \nspecial burden, and are especially prone to misjudgment. They have a \ntendency, Kagan says, to be either too hard or too soft, or both in \nsuccession. They can be motivated by the highest ideals, but still lack \nthe will to secure them. In this way, leaders who desire peace can \nencourage war. Sustaining the peace is always an act of will and \ndesign--based on diplomatic and military strength.\n  The history of America has become the central feature of the history \nof the world. We did not seek that position through imperial ambition--\nbut we have been selected, nonetheless, for great responsibilities. \nThis should focus our minds, and focus this debate.\n  I'm looking at this we are not left without guidance from the past. \nEvery generation imagines itself exempt from the laws of history, and \nevery generation is forced to follow them. Those laws can be respected \nor resented, but not changed or ignored. It is a useful exercise to \nclarify and repeat them, as Donald Kagan and others have done.\n  Listen to his rules.\n  The first rule is that peace is not a natural condition. The New \nWorld Order is destined to disorder. Moments of international calm have \nnever prevented future conflict. Every prediction of perpetual peace \nhas been disappointed. The reason is rooted in human character. British \nmilitary historian Michael Howard comments, ``We have not improved as \npeople, however much we have improved as technologists.'' That should \nbe obvious from the 50 conflicts that rage in the world at this moment.\n  The second rule is that war is always a surprise. Strategies that \ndepend on long warning periods or time for preparation, are bound to \nfail. Deterrence with current power is the only adequate insurance \nagainst the unknown. During the cold war, the experts said that the \nlikely warning time of a Warsaw Pact attack on NATO was somewhere \nbetween 3 days and 3 months. After German reunification, we discovered \nthat Warsaw Pact readiness would have allowed for an attack in 3 hours.\n  Paul Wolfowitz of Johns Hopkins draws this lesson from our experience \nin Korea in 1950. Just 5 years after the height of American power in \nWorld War II, he says, ``A third-rate power almost kicked the U.S. off \nthe peninsula.'' It was not until 4 months later that General MacArthur \nwas able to launch the Inchon landing that started a 3-year fight back \nto Korea's original borders.\n  In a regional conflict, an enemy does not judge America's potential \npower, but our actual force. ``The bottom line,'' says Wolfowitz, ``is \nthat people are judging your will, your capability to deliver.''\n  The third rule is that war is prevented by creating a prohibitive \ncost for disturbing the status quo, and exacting that cost cannot be \ndone by international institutions. The United Nations is sometimes \nuseful, but it is not an alternative to American power.\n  In September of 1993, President Clinton declared that ``U.N. \npeacekeeping holds the promise to resolve many of this era's \nconflicts.'' Six days later a company of U.S. Rangers under U.N. \ncommand was decimated in Mogadishu.\n  In the last few years, we have had a short but decisive experiment \nwith what Madeleine Albright called ``aggressive multilateralism.'' \nThat experiment has failed miserably and millions of people have been \nsubjected to war and humanitarian failure.\n  Fourth, Kagan says the ability to take swift, firm, early action \nagainst aggressors is the best way to prevent large, protracted, \npainful action in the future. He argues that tentativeness among great \npowers is one of the principal causes of war. He analyzed a series of \navoidable conflicts and concluded:\n\n       Unwilling to commit themselves clearly and firmly to the \n     price of defending the peace that they so badly wanted to \n     maintain, they had to pay the price of a long, bloody, \n     costly, devastating, and almost fatal war.\n\n  The history of this century bears out the truth of that statement. \nUnable, unwilling to commit ourselves clearly and firmly to the price \nof defending peace, millions in this world in this century have been \nsubjected to long, bloody, costly, devastating, almost fatal wars.\n  Defending that peace depends, ironically, on not a defensive but an \noffensive military capability. A defensive posture, no matter how \nstrong, is not sufficient.\n  At the beginning of World War II, neither France nor Britain deployed \na credible offensive force because the Western leaders and many of \ntheir people, again quoting Kagan:\n\n       . . . did not examine their situation objectively and \n     realistically but emotionally and hopefully. They were moved \n     by the horror of war, the fear of its reappearance, and the \n     blind hope that a refusal to contemplate war and prepare for \n     it would somehow keep the peace.\n\n  Our concept of cost effectiveness must be deeper and more serious \nthan it often is today. Our choice, our real choice is not between the \nB-2, for example, and Head Start. Our real decision is between a \ncutting edge military capable of offensive operations and an \nunthinkable, immeasurable future cost in American lives and American \nresources.\n  Kagan's fifth rule is that democracies are not particularly good at \nmaking and keeping these commitments. Kagan comments that they are \nmotivated by ``an ethical system that is commercial, individualistic, \nand libertarian.'' Their governments are under continual demand to \n``satisfy domestic demands at the expense of the requirements of \ndefense.''\n  That is what we are seeing in the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas and what we have seen year after year in amendment after \namendment.\n  It can lead us to a dangerous situation, because democracies can be \nhandicapped in the maintenance and use of power. They invite \nchallenges, and when those challenges come they are often not fully \nprepared.\n  Kagan's final rule is that politicians have always had the tendency \nto interpret history to fit their budgets, not the other way around. \nThey have a vested interest in the assumption of peace because the \nassumption of peace matches domestic fiscal need.\n  These facts of history, of course, are not a strategy by themselves, \nbut they should inform our strategic approach. And I would suggest it \nis time we had a strategic approach.\n  Some of the delay in creating a vision for America's role in the \nworld is understandable. We are still emerging \n\n[[Page S 11382]]\nfrom the conceptual grip of the cold war for four decades that consumed \nour attention and consumed our creativity, but now the absence of a \nself-confident American self-image is beginning to create risks. It \ndoes not take much imagination to imagine what our threats are. Eighty \npercent of North Korea's forces are within 100 kilometers of the DMZ. \nTensions between India and Pakistan are high. Iran is more assertive. \nIraq is unpredictable. Algeria is on the edge of Islamic revolution, \nthreatening Egypt as well. Will there be conflict in Macedonia? Will we \nface a bad outcome in Russia?\n  Some of the categories of threats against international stability \nought to be evident to all of us: The proliferation of conventional \nweapons; the disintegration of political order; the proliferation of \nbiological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. All of these threats can be \ncontrolled with decisive, aggressive action, but if they are allowed to \nrun their course the consequences would be hard to contain and the \ncosts could be terribly high.\n  I suggest, Mr. President, that containing the crises that face us in \nthe post-cold-war era depends on two things. First, it depends on \nAmerican superiority in new weapons, something that is costly to \nmaintain. America, for example, has held the lead in Stealth \ntechnology. The price was high--$65 billion over 20 years. No one can \nnow argue that this investment was wasted.\n  Second, early decisive, decisive American involvement depends on a \ncommitment to act, not just react. We need to aggressively shape the \nsecurity environments of the gulf area, Asia and Europe, not just \nrespond to crisis after crisis, emergency after emergency. This is the \nbest way to minimize our future commitment.\n  This presents a challenge. America's lead in military power and \ntechnology can easily result, if we are not careful, in complacency. \nHistorically, the United States has made the error of excessive \ndownsizing again and again. Each time has resulted in tragedy, and I \nfear that we may be starting down that path once more. Never in the \nhistory of this country have we successfully downsized after a \nvictorious conflict--never. Each time, we have paid a significant price \nin terms of the loss of American lives, the commitment of resources \nthat otherwise would not have had to have been committed, the lack of \npreparedness that had led to the subsequent conflict.\n  Next year, as has been pointed out, will be the 11th consecutive year \nof real decline in defense spending. When President Clinton took \noffice, he doubled his projected defense cuts to get deficit reduction \nwithout a net increase in domestic spending. We have reduced military \npersonnel by 23 percent. We are headed for a 33 percent cut by 1999. \nOur military is a third smaller than it was just 10 years ago.\n  To suggest that the Defense Department has not done its share in \naddressing the budget deficit or freeing up funds for domestic \ndiscretionary spending is factually totally inaccurate. As was pointed \nout by the Senator from New Mexico earlier, since 1990, defense \ndiscretionary spending has decreased 10 percent and all other \nnondefense discretionary spending has increased 36 percent. In the next \n7 years, while defense will decrease $13 billion in real spending, \nMedicaid will increase $149 billion and Medicare $349 billion. How can \nwe begin to suggest that after 11 years of reductions, after reducing \nour Air Force and Navy and Marines and Army by a third, defense has not \ndone its share? I ask the Senator from Arkansas to name one program, \none Federal program that has cut anything, that has even begun to match \nwhat the Department of Defense has done. I doubt that he can.\n  In October of last year, Anthony Lake from the administration argued, \n``The Cassandras attacking our readiness are wrong.'' But just a few \nweeks later an audit revealed that one-fourth of the Army's active \ncombat divisions were less than combat ready and that one armored \nbrigade and one mechanized brigade, both quick-reaction units, could \nnot carry out their missions on short notice. With projected levels of \nspending, America could soon be short of the resources to fight on two \nfronts by 3 army divisions, 6 tactical air wings, 4 carriers, and \n40,0005 marines.\n  Meanwhile, the Pentagon is spending less on new weapons and equipment \nthan at any time in the last 50 years.\n  Let me repeat that. The Pentagon is spending less on new weapons and \nequipment than at any time in the last 50 years.\n  To suggest there is some kind of spending binge going on over at the \nPentagon is factually and totally inaccurate. In 1996, the Navy will \npurchase just three new ships. The Army will not even order one new \ntank. All four services combined will buy only 20 replacement jet \nfighters compared to 458 they bought in 1980.\n  Now, the theory behind this pattern is clear. We are living off the \nprocurement of the Reagan years, weapons that were designed in the \n1970's and procured in the 1980's. We are depending on military \ntechnology that is already in the pipeline. We are not even spending \nenough to replace existing equipment before it wears out.\n We are often preserving force structure by gutting procurement and \nresearch and development funds. All this has left us in the early \nstages of a predictable decline. American forces have more commitments \nthan ever before, but those commitments are not matched by sufficient \nresources. Our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are asked to patrol more \nbroadly, with decreasing force, while trying to keep acceptable \npersonnel rotations and operations tempo in attempting to prolong the \nlife of older equipment. It is a challenge they meet, but with great \nsacrifice, and a challenge they cannot meet forever.\n\n  The price. The price, as usual, is paid by the men and women who \nserve their country--a particular concern of mine. Deep cuts have \nreduced training, put pressure on military pay, forced longer \ndeployments. This has encouraged many able people to leave and has \nweakened the spirit of those who remain.\n  In Armed Services hearings before our committee, and in discussions \nwith personnel around this country and the world, I have heard a number \nof disturbing reports--snapshots of the military on the verge of a \nserious problem. Last year, in order to stretch its forces, the Navy \nstarted gapping its presence in the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf and \nthe Western Pacific. For a third of each year, two of those theaters \nwill have no aircraft carrier.\n  Since Navy officials were short last year of $300 million in \noperations funds----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Since Navy officials were short last year of $300 million \nin operations funds due to increased tempo of operations, they reduced \nflying hours for squadrons aboard carriers. Marines getting home from a \n6-month deployment to Somalia aboard the USS Inchon were sent to Haiti \n12 days after they reached home.\n  One general reports, ``Strategic lift in this country is broken right \nnow.'' He warns that most U.S. military capability would not begin to \narrive at a regional conflict for 3 months after it began. Yet the \nadministration pretends the charade that it has a military capability \nto respond to two major regional crises at nearly the same time.\n  The Marine Corps is using 50-year-old canvas tents and wearing boots \nfrom the Korean war era. These instances are isolated, but they are not \nuncommon. They represent an emerging trend. The inspector general of \nthe Marine Corps commented to me, ``At some point in the near future, \nthe current funding strategy will ultimately undermine the corps' \nability to meet war-fighting and peacetime presence requirements.'' It \nis the same story in every branch.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, the reason that we must be concerned is \nsimple. We cannot afford as a nation to repeat the patterns of the \npast, a pattern of American withdrawal followed by major costly \ncommitments. We need the ability to consistently shape our strategic \nfuture, not just to respond when it falls in disorder. And that \nrequires both readiness and continued technological advances.\n  There is no simple formula for avoiding war, but some things clearly \ndo not \n\n[[Page S 11383]]\nwork. Again, Donald Kagan observed, ``Good will, unilateral \ndisarmament, avoidance of alliances, teaching and preaching the evils \nof war are of no avail.'' Denying our leadership and power will not \nkeep the peace. The peace is kept by ``active effort, planning, the \nexpenditure of resources, and sacrifice.'' It is reinforced by the \npossession of superior force and the will to use it skillfully.\n  It was World War I poet Siegfried Sassoon who said 76 years ago, \n``Look down, and swear by the slain of war that you'll never forget.'' \nWe best preserve that memory by recalling how war is prevented. It is \nnot a task for the weak. It rests on a large vision of our Nation's \nrole. And it involves the inescapable necessity of American leadership.\n  We can save money by shirking from this duty. Yes, we can. But we \nwill not in the long run save the peace or save American lives. Kagan \nconcludes in his ``On The Origins of War,'' with a warning:\n\n       The United States and its allies, the states with the \n     greatest interest in peace and the greatest power to preserve \n     it, appear to be faltering in their willingness to pay the \n     price in money and the risk of lives. Nothing could be more \n     natural in a liberal republic, yet nothing could be more \n     threatening to the peace they have recently achieved.\n\n  This is worth remembering in this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. There will be no excuse.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say, the Senator from Indiana has said, name one \nprogram that suffered with the cuts that defense has taken. I am sorry \nI did not prepare for that particular question. But let me tell you why \nI am up here today. Right here on this chart--and figures do not lie; \nliars can figure--defense goes from $264 billion this year, goes up \nevery year, to $280 billion in the year 2002.\n  Where are they suffering in all these big budget cuts?\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator had incorporated figures from 1985 to the \npresent, you would see an entirely different picture. By drawing the \nline at what might happen in the next 5 years, you are ignoring what \nhappened in the last 10 years. There has been a dramatic decrease in \nreal dollars in defense spending for the last 10 straight years. But \nthat is not on the Senator's chart.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. In the next 7 years, they will more than make up. You \nsaid ``Name one program.'' I will name them.\n  Mr. COATS. Taking cuts in defense.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Nondefense discretionary spending. Of all the spending \ncuts over the next 7 years, poor little old nondefense, domestic \ndiscretionary spending--education, health care, law enforcement, you \nname it--takes 43 percent, 43 percent of the total spending cuts over \nthe next 7 years.\n  The Senator said this is not about B-2 versus Head Start. That is \nprecisely what it is about. I supported the B-2 much longer than I \nshould have. For years I voted faithfully for it. I voted for the \nTrident submarine, the F-15's, the F-16's, the F-18's, the F-111's, the \nF-B-111's, the F-117's, you name it. I voted for all of them. And I \ntried to cut a few, too.\n  I have stood at this desk for 20 years saying, for example, that we \nought not to bring 40 rust-bucket battleships out of mothballs. Boy, \nthe herd of instincts flew through here. The ``evil empire'' was about \nto come up the Potomac and get us. We even bring battleships out of \nmothballs, the ones the Japanese surrendered 50 years ago on, and we \nspent almost $2 billion on them. What do you think happened? They \nfloated the high seas for 2 years and we put them back in mothballs. \nBut our $2 billion is gone. You could not say anything here without \nbeing considered a dove.\n  Senator Domenici told you a moment ago what all would go up. He did \nnot tell you what would go down. What will go down is $250 billion a \nyear in taxes--$250 billion over the next 7-year period for people who \nmake over $100,000 a year. They get 75 percent of it. Is that where \nthis country's values are? We are going to cut Medicare for the elderly \n$270 billion and cut taxes by $250 billion.\n  He told you about nondefense discretionary spending. I just got \nthrough telling you that will take--that nondefense discretionary \nspending is going to absorb 43 percent of all the cuts. And in the year \n2002, nondefense domestic discretionary spending will fall to 2.4 \npercent of our economy, the lowest since 1954.\n  The Senator from Georgia said this same amendment was brought up on \nthe budget resolution. And it was. But it was one of those amendments \nthat could not be debated. You just had to throw it out and let people \nvote on it. And on that same budget resolution, incidentally, that came \nout of the Senate and went to conference, you know what happened to it \nin conference? It came back with $33 billion tacked onto it from the \ntime it left the U.S. Senate.\n  We gave in to the House on everything and added $33 billion to the \nbudget resolution after it left the Senate.\n  Year after year, as I stood here and said, ``Don't bring those old \nbattleships out of mothballs,'' and a host of other things, I always \ngot run over like a Mack truck. And here I am again. I always come back \nhoping that somebody across America might be paying attention, might \neven be listening.\n  But the argument always was, ``The Secretary of Defense wants this,'' \n``The President wants it,'' ``The Joint Chiefs want it.'' And this year \nI say the Secretary does not want it, the President does not want it, \nand the Joint Chiefs do not want it. And the argument on the other side \nis, ``Well, what do they know?'' It does not make any difference what \nyou do, whether you want it or do not want it, you get it.\n  Mr. President, this ought to be compelling. It ought to be absolutely \ncompelling. The figures are stark. They are staggering. I told the \nSenator from Georgia awhile ago, I do not have anything to lose. I know \nhow many votes we are going to get on this and how we are going to come \nout on it. It is going to be years before this U.S. Senate is going to \nlisten to this kind of argument. I only pray that it will not be too \nlate.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just close--and I am prepared to yield back \nmy time and let the Senator make his point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask Senator Bumpers a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are out of time. I wonder if the Senator will object \nto my taking 30 seconds at this point, and then I will make the point \nof order.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the Senator 30 seconds of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields to the Senator from New \nMexico 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think with reference to the years 1995 \nto 2002, the Senate should know that in 1995, we will spend $270 \nbillion on defense, and in 2002, we will spend $271 billion--$1 billion \nhigher 7 years later, almost 8 years later.\n  The numbers the Senator is using have to do with ups and downs in \nbetween. The truth of the matter is, we entered this budget period at \n$270 billion; we leave it at $271 billion.\n  I thank the Senator for the 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my chief cosponsor on this amendment is \nSenator Simon, who happily has laryngitis, so I get to do all the \ntalking. My cosponsors are Senators Wellstone, Moseley-Braun, Kohl, and \nFeingold. I am prepared to yield back such time as I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending amendment contains matters \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Senate Budget Committee. Pursuant to \nsection 306 of the Congressional Budget Act, I raise a point of order \nagainst the pending amendment.\n\n\n                     Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act for \npurposes of the Senate's consideration of this amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays. \n\n[[Page S 11384]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive section 306 of the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  (Disturbance in the galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the \ngallery. The clerk will resume calling the roll.\n  The legislative clerk resumed the call of the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 63, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 361 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--63\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 37 and the nays are \n63. Three-fifths of the Senators present and voting having voted in the \nnegative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is rejected.\n  The pending amendment No. 2115 contains matter within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget, and therefore violates \nsection 306 of the Congressional Budget Act. The point of order is \nsustained. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nis prepared to accept the 20 minutes equally divided time agreement; so \nI ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be recognized to offer his \namendment regarding the Olympics, and there be 20 minutes equally \ndivided prior to a motion to table, and that no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the vote on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. After that, as I understand it, the Senator from Vermont is \nprepared; if not, the Senator from Wisconsin is prepared to proceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am prepared to proceed under a time agreement. I believe \nit is similar to the one--I must admit, I was distracted on the one you \ngave about the Senator from Arizona, but it sounds about the same.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will do the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin \nfirst, then.\n  Following disposition of the McCain amendment, Senator Kohl be \nrecognized to offer his amendment; that he have 1 hour and 15 minutes, \nand 15 minutes on this side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. DOLE. No second-degree amendments will be in order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I will not object. I just \nhad a question for the majority leader.\n  I have an amendment that has been cleared on both sides. I only need \n5 minutes on my side to describe it. If we could work that in sometime \nsoon, I would be very grateful to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will there be a rollcall vote?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like a rollcall, but it could be stacked at any \ntime that managers feel is a good time to stack.\n  Mr. NUNN. We need to take a look at that amendment. I believe it is \nprobably cleared on both sides. We can get to them quicker if there is \nnot a rollcall vote.\n  Does the Senator from California have to have a rollcall vote?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes; I have been working on it for a year and a half.\n  Mr. NUNN. We will look at it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject, but if I may have the attention of the majority leader.\n  The question was asked earlier by the majority leader, and I am \nwilling to go forward on my amendment, following the Senator from \nArizona, under the same time agreement. I just had a chance to read the \nagreement made with the Senator from Arizona. I advise the \ndistinguished majority leader that I am happy to follow him with a \nsimilar agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request on the Kohl \namendment by the majority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia has been cleared on both sides. I believe she wants 5 \nminutes of discussion. I do not think we will need over 1 minute, so we \ncould get a unanimous-consent to have that in order, with about 6 \nminutes on it, and have a rollcall vote. We could do that, and perhaps \neven have a 10-minute rollcall vote after, following either the Kohl \nrollcall or the McCain rollcall.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will work that out if we can.\n  What is your time agreement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the request for 20 minutes evenly divided \nin the usual order. I would accept that, to follow after the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from California.\n  Mr. DOLE. There may be a second-degree amendment to yours. Is that a \nproblem?\n  Mr. LEAHY. My understanding is that there be no second-degree in \norder prior to a motion to table. Obviously, if the motion to table is \nlost, they reserve their rights.\n  Mr. DOLE. Can I get back to the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am just trying to be helpful.\n  Mr. DOLE. So, following the debate on the Kohl amendment, but prior \nto the vote, we will take up the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer; 10 minutes equally divided. Then we will \nhave back-to-back rollcall votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as someone who has been engaged in \nattempting to move this bill forward, I would hope Members will accept \nreasonable time agreements. We have been working long days and long \nnights for a lot of weeks now. Most of us have not been home with our \nfamilies for meals for weeks, and the Senate is going to be in session \ntomorrow. We take up the welfare debate next week, which will be a long \nweek.\n  If there is a way we can avoid the time it takes to have rollcall \nvotes on amendments that are already accepted, or if there is a way \nthat Members can reduce the amount of time they speak on issues that \nhave been debated over and over and over, time after time after time, \nand everybody knows how they are going to vote, I think everybody would \nappreciate that.\n  My experience is that no matter how articulate and eloquent my \nspeeches might be--and they are not all that articulate and eloquent--\nit does not change any votes. So to the extent any of us can summarize \nour arguments, realizing that no matter how passionate or eloquent they \nmight be, it is probably not going to do anything except make us more \ntired and irritable and probably produce more votes against us than \nwhen we started speaking. I hope everybody, in the interests of those \nof us who have families at home and would like to see them once in a \nwhile, could take those situations into their consideration.\n  To the extent we can move along with these bills and people can \nsummarize their statements in the interests of providing some comity \nfor their colleagues, I would certainly appreciate that and I am sure \nothers would also.\n\n[[Page S 11385]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. For the information of all Senators, I think it would be \nhelpful if the President might give us the sequence, now, as was just \nagreed to in the unanimous consent. Is it my understanding the McCain \namendment will be followed by the Boxer amendment to be followed by the \nKohl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. McCain, Kohl, Boxer.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. And the McCain amendment has 20 minutes with a rollcall \nand then the Kohl amendment is an hour with a rollcall and then the \nBoxer amendment is 6 minutes with a rollcall after that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Kohl amendment has a total of an hour and \na half for debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So there will be a rollcall in 20 minutes, is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, if I could say to the leader, I believe the \norder provided the McCain amendment would be disposed of, then the Kohl \namendment would be taken up and debated. Before the Kohl vote, the \nBoxer amendment would be taken up and debated, and then we would vote \non Kohl and Boxer after that.\n  So as I understand it, we will dispose of the McCain amendment first. \nThen we will have debate on the Kohl amendment and then we will have \nthe debate on the Boxer amendment and we will vote on those two \namendments after that. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I might make a suggestion, if we could \ntake Boxer after McCain, we could have a vote here on those two \namendments in about 1 hour and then have another vote in an hour and a \nhalf, after the others? I only say that because I know there are a \nsubstantial number of us who are going to be leaving here very soon.\n  Mr. NUNN. I have no objection to that. The majority leader entered \ninto the agreement. I think it probably needs to be cleared with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest we could save more time if we went ahead with \nthe unanimous-consent agreement, which I believe is my amendment. \nKeeping in mind the admonition of my dearest friend, Senator Coats of \nIndiana, I will try to be very brief, because it is a very simple \nissue. Since we have just 10 minutes on each side, I will be very \nbrief.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2116\n\n  (Purpose: To mandate the money made available to the Department of \n  Defense and used for civilian sporting events be reimbursed to the \n                         Department of Defense)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2116.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Act, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . CIVILIAN SPORTING EVENTS.\n\n       (a) No funds made available to the Department of Defense \n     may be expended either directly or indirectly to support \n     civilian sporting events, including but not limited to the \n     World Cup Soccer Games, the Goodwill Games, and the Olympics, \n     until the Secretary of Defense enters into an agreement with \n     the appropriate entity or affiliated entity or entities and \n     certifies that such funds will be reimbursed to the extent \n     available to the Department under terms and conditions \n     established by the Secretary of Defense, and that such terms \n     shall--\n       (1) not mandate any reimbursement until after the event is \n     complete and all event-related contractual obligations have \n     been met by the entity; and\n       (2) such reimbursement shall not exceed surplus funds \n     available.\n       (b) For the purposes of this Section, paragraph (a) shall \n     be null and void and of no effect if the entity or entities \n     with which the agreement was made have no surplus funds after \n     all other contractual obligations have been met.\n       (c) Surplus Funds Defined.--For the purpose of this \n     section, the term ``surplus funds'', with respect to an \n     organization sponsoring a sporting event, means the amount \n     equal to the excess of--\n       (1) the total amount of the funds received by the \n     organization for the event other than revenues derived for \n     any tax, over\n       (2) the total amount expended by the organization for \n     payment of all of the costs under the organization's \n     contractual obligations (other than an agreement entered into \n     with the Secretary of Defense under this section) that relate \n     to the event.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is extremely simple. We \nhave been through it before. It is something that I find very difficult \nto understand, why that would not make sense to most Members of this \nbody. It is simply that any money--not just on the Olympics in \nAtlanta--any money that is spent by the Department of Defense for a \ncivilian sporting event be reimbursed to the Department if the event \nmakes a profit.\n  I want to emphasize that about five times, if I might. The \nreimbursement to the Department of Defense for money that is spent out \nof the Department of Defense would only be reimbursed if the event made \na profit.\n  I do not understand the argument that the Olympics are a wonderful \nthing, because they are; and that they need security, because they do. \nOne thing I still have been unable to figure out is that I am told by \nthe opponents of this legislation, primarily, and understandably the \ntwo Senators from the State of Georgia, they do not know, they are not \ngoing to be able to tell whether they make a profit or not.\n  If they cannot figure out whether they make a profit or not, they \nsure as heck should not have gotten the Olympic games. I have done a \nlittle research. Every other Olympic games have, at the end of it, been \nable to figure out whether they had a profit or loss. And why Atlanta \nseems incapable of doing so staggers the imagination.\n  The Los Angeles Olympics made $222 million; ABC has agreed to pay \n$225 million in serving as host broadcasters. They did at the Los \nAngeles Olympics. There is a U.S. Mint coin program that has made $147 \nmillion.\n  I have a great quote from ``Making It Happen,'' the story of the Los \nAngeles Olympics.\n\n       There was always concern that someone could stand up in \n     Congress and demand that the committee reimburse the Federal \n     Government its security and other expenditures on the games. \n     This ran at least $30 million for security alone and could \n     have been estimated as high as $68 million overall. I \n     believed then as I do now that there are many important \n     programs much more deserving of Government support than a \n     sports event.\n\n  ``Made in America,'' by Peter Ueberroth.\n  Mr. President, what this is all about simply is that this Olympics, \nif it does not make a profit, will not be required to reimburse the \ntaxpayers of America. This does not have anything to do with any \nreluctance to provide the security that is necessary for these \nOlympics. We do not have to hear again about the tragedy of Munich. We \nare all aware of that. And I believe that the taxpayers of America \ndeserve to be reimbursed if the games make a profit. If not, I \ncertainly will not seek that.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask that notwithstanding the previous consent, the \nBoxer amendment be in order following the McCain debate and the votes \nthen occur back-to-back--courtesy of the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COHEN. Reserving the right to object, I inquire whether or not, \nbetween the votes, after the vote on the McCain amendment, I be allowed \nto offer an amendment that has been agreed to?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from California seek a rollcall vote on \nher amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from California does, in fact, seek a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I repeat my unanimous consent request, Mr. President. I \nask, notwithstanding the previous consent agreement, the Boxer \namendment be in order following the McCain debate, debate on the McCain \namendment, and the votes then occur back to back. \n\n[[Page S 11386]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Virginia has \ncontrol of the time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona will control the time on this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I only have 10 minutes. I spoke for about 5. Now I \nbelieve it is the other side's turn to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. For purposes of control in favor of the amendment, you \ncontrol the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am speaking for the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Georgia control the time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nAs my good colleague from Arizona noted when he began his remarks, we \ndealt with this before and, therefore, he would be brief. He is \ncorrect. We dealt with this last year, and his amendment was defeated \n77 to 21. It was defeated for several reasons.\n  One, there is an understanding that there are facilities and capacity \nthat the Department of Defense must provide for the security of the \nU.S. Centennial Olympics, which will occur in Atlanta, GA, in less than \na year. It was defeated because it was interloping on 4 years of \ncontract and arrangement. And it was thought at that time, which was 2 \nyears before the Olympics, that it was too late to intervene and \ncontravene and disrupt the very intricate process of DOD security as \nprovided to our guests--12,000 athletes, 196 countries, with venues \noccurring in five separate States and 31 villages. It was defeated for \nthat reason.\n  Here we are a year later, less than 1 year before the flame is lit in \nAtlanta, GA, and we have the same amendment back. It was not acceptable \na year ago; it certainly is not acceptable today.\n  The amendment deals with more than reimbursement. The first section \nof the amendment says no funds may be expended to the various events, \nincluding the Olympics, until the Secretary of Defense has entered into \nan agreement with the various entities involved. That means that no \nfunds could be expended, no security and preparation of this \ninternational event of this magnitude until the Department of Defense \nhas entered into an agreement with 43 separate jurisdictions--States, \ncounties, municipalities, et cetera.\n  If this amendment is adopted, it would bring the security apparatus \nenvisioned--and which all of us know needs to be in place--to a \nstandstill. We all know the process that would be underway in terms of \ntrying to deal with this and the agreements that would have to be \nsought and concluded and the morass that would surround it.\n  Mr. President, in addition, the amendment removes the accounting \nprocedure. Vast expenditures would be called upon by the Olympics--\nemployee wages, upkeep of the facilities, maintenance, electric bills, \nwhich would fall outside what would be in the accounting process.\n  The point is, in sum and short, the Department of Defense is the only \nfacility and capacity that can provide the very special security \nrequirements. This will disrupt that process and it should be an effort \nthat is entirely proactive. It would bring the security process to its \nknees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to my distinguished \ncolleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I would just say very briefly, and reserve the \nremainder of my time, that there are three problems with this \namendment. It does look like a simple amendment. I know the Senator \nfrom Arizona is sincere in his efforts to try to save money for the \nFederal Government.\n  One of the problems with this amendment--and there are three main \nproblems. First of all, it will not work. It is an accounting \nnightmare. We would have to basically call off the security for a \nperiod of weeks or perhaps months while a team of lawyers and \naccountants went down and negotiated not only with the Olympic \ncommittee but with many different jurisdictions, as my colleague from \nGeorgia pointed out.\n  So the first problem is it is not workable with an entity like the \nOlympics that is operating in five States in many different local \njurisdictions, that is not intending to make a profit, that is putting \nup a huge number of buildings and structures that would have to have an \namortization table set up because they are going to be turned over to \nlocal entities afterwards. How can you determine a property in those \ncircumstances?\n  The second problem is it is not going to save the Government any \nmoney. They do not intend to make a profit. If they see they are going \nto have a surplus toward the end of the games, they are going to try to \nput it back into the games. I have been told that over and over and \nover.\n  The third problem with it is it will probably cost the Government \nmoney. How would it cost the Government money if we adopt this and it \nbecame law? It would cost the Government money because this amendment \nsays very clearly that no reimbursement would take place until the \nevent is complete. Right now the agreement that has been worked out \nwith DOD is that anything that is not related to the security is \nreimbursed immediately.\n  So DOD does some things that are not security related that get \nreimbursed. They have already reimbursed the Government something like \n$55,000. It will probably be something in the neighborhood of $1\\1/4\\ \nmillion to $1 million before it is over. So this amendment, intending \nto save money, will end up, in my view, costing money because there \nwill be no excess.\n  The other problems--the big problem is what State and local \ngovernments do. Our States are putting at least $35 million or $40 \nmillion in. There will be events in Tennessee. Tennessee is going to be \nspending money. Once we adopt this, each State is going to say, ``We \nwant to get reimbursed for our costs before the Federal Government.'' I \ndo not know how that will play in this amendment. Perhaps someone could \nexplain it.\n  So this amendment is simply not workable. It will not save the \nFederal Government any money. It would reverse the precedent we have \nhad over and over again.\n  Mr. President, this is what is at stake here. We have 195 countries, \n100 heads of state, 15,000 athletes and officials, 15,000 media \nrepresentatives, 25,000 Olympic family and VIP's, 12 million tickets, \n350,000 visitors per day, 3,000 hours of TV coverage, 3 billion viewers \naround the world. That is what is at stake.\n  How much would Germany have paid for the security to prevent the \nslaughter that took place by terrorists at Munich in 1972? Do we want \nto nickel and dime security and have the ACOG committee, knowing they \nmay be called on for some kind of cost accounting nightmare \nreimbursement and then negotiate with our military to see what we need \nin terms of chemical warfare specialists, what we need in terms of \npeople who know about biological warfare, what we need it terms of \ncommunications?\n  Mr. President, we do not want that for the Olympics. We do not want a \nblack eye for the Olympics. We do not want to cut security to the bone \nand then end up with some tragedy or some great embarrassment.\n  So I urge the rejection of the amendment and reserve the remainder of \nthe time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 5 minutes 42 \nseconds, and the Senator from Georgia has 2 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped that 1972 would not come up again in this \ndebate. No one, no one, no one believes that 1972 should ever come up \nagain. And to relate the tragedy of 1972 and what happened in Munich \nwhen the terrorist attack took place on a request which I think is \nreasonable--and reasonable people can disagree; if the Olympics make a \nprofit, they reimburse, of course--it is just hard for me to \nunderstand. \n\n[[Page S 11387]]\n\n  The senior Senator from Georgia said it would be an accounting \nnightmare. I believe that the people of America who invest sizable \namounts of money--not just in defense--they have the right to know \nwhether this Olympics makes a profit or a loss.\n  As I said, I have done research of every single Olympic game that has \nbeen held in the United States. They come out with a profit or a loss \nas any other enterprise would. I am shocked to hear that it is \nimpossible for the Olympic games to figure out whether or not they make \na profit or a loss. I am shocked.\n  With the appropriate legislation, if there are Federal funds involved \nwith the Olympics, I am going to propose some kind of amendment that \nthe American people have an accounting. I do not think that is \nunreasonable.\n  I would like to congratulate the two Senators from Georgia. They are \nfor the Olympic games for the first time for which there is no \naccounting.\n  The second thing is they do not intend to make a profit. If they do \nnot intend to make a profit, then we should adopt this amendment by \nunanimous consent agreement by voice vote because then they do not have \na problem. If the senior Senator from Georgia is convinced that they \nare not going to make a profit, then he does not have to worry about \nthis amendment.\n  Why is he debating against it? In his words, they do not intend to \nmake a profit. That is their option. But the American people deserve an \naccounting.\n  As far as the cost to the Government to be reimbursed immediately, \nall I can say is that if we are talking about as much as $20 million to \nbe spent, $10 million last year and $10 million this year, I think the \nAmerican people deserve to be reimbursed if this enterprise makes a \nprofit.\n  Obviously, it has nothing to do with the 1972 tragedy in Munich, and \nI do not believe that cost considerations would drive any organization \nto reduce the security required to make sure, to make every effort \npossible so that the Olympic games would be made safe and secure.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 1 minute to the distinguish Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n  In concept, I have no problem at all with the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona. Having been in business, however, I have \ndiscovered that there are profits and there are profits. I remember in \nthe Los Angeles Olympics, I was living in Los Angeles at the time. \nThere were divergences of as much as $100 million as to the amount of \nprofit made by that Olympic games, depending on who was doing the \naccounting.\n  His amendment does not specify how that is going to work or where we \nare going to determine the profit or what is going to be charged or \nwhat is not. All of that is going to have to be worked out.\n  Second, the same issue applies to the question of costs, the costs to \nthe Department of Defense. Again, having been a businessman, I know \nthere are differences between costs and costs. I am told by the Defense \nDepartment that they look forward to this opportunity because it gives \nthem a training opportunity for troops that will train in a real-life \nsituation.\n  Where would the money be spent if it was not spent while they were at \nthe Olympics? I was interested in an amendment that says incremental \ncosts only that spells out the kind of problems. The amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona, in my opinion, is flawed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to help out the Senator from \nUtah. The exact amount of money in profit from the Los Angeles games, \naccording to all, including the head of the Olympic games, Mr. \nUbeberroth, was $22,716,000. No one questions that.\n  As far as the training opportunity, putting up fences is not exactly \nthe training opportunity that we want for most of our men and women in \nthe military. Regularly, when costs are incurred by the Department of \nDefense, they send bills to entities and organizations.\n  And finally, I would like to congratulate the Senator from Utah for \nthe selection of the city of Salt Lake for the Olympics.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time remains for the \nopponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute of time for the Senator from \nGeorgia and 2 minutes and 16 seconds for the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about building fences. We are \ntalking about physical security for athletic villages, an entire \ncommunications grid that only DOD can put in place, a command \ncoordination, providing site surveys, aerial visitations. It goes on \nand on.\n  Mr. President, I wish to repeat, we are less than 1 year from the \nlighting of the flame. There are 43 separate jurisdictions. This \namendment shuts it all down with less than 1 year to go while we would \nenter into 43 separate negotiations on contracts. If this amendment \nwere to prevail, it will literally shut down the planning for security \nfor one of the world's greatest events, for which there will be an \nassembly like none has ever occurred and it will be in the United \nStates of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that the Atlanta Olympic \nCommittee has made agreements with a lot of different organizations for \nservices that are provided for the Atlanta Olympics. For example, I am \nsure they have made an agreement with the post office for mail \ndelivery. I am sure they have made an agreement with many other \ncommercial organizations. I am convinced that they could do the same \nthing with the Department of Defense; that after there is a final \naccounting, upon the completion of the Olympics, the American people \ndeserve to know what the profit and loss was, that we could then \nconsider reimbursing the Department of Defense.\n  If the two Senators from Georgia are convinced there is not going to \nbe a profit, then they should not have a problem at all with this \namendment. If they think they might make a profit, I can assure them \nthat only after there would be a final accounting would a profit be \ndivided up. I would even be willing to have a certain percentage of the \nprofits go back to reimburse the Department of Defense, if not all.\n  The reason why I do this, Mr. President, finally, is because time \nafter time after time we find ways to spend taxpayers' dollars that are \nearmarked for defense on issues and areas and programs that have \nnothing to do with defense. This is just one of hundreds of examples. \nThis really does not have anything to do with national defense. It has \nto do with providing security for the Olympic games, which are fine. \nBut it has nothing to do with defending this Nation's vital national \nsecurity interests. That is why, as I say, only if there were a profit \nshould we reimburse the taxpayers of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I move to lay the McCain amendment on \nthe table.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be taken after debate on the \nBoxer amendment. The amendment is temporarily laid aside.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  \n[[Page S 11388]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2117\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a substitute for section 526, which amends a \n     provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice relating to \n        forfeiture of pay and allowances and reduction in grade)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  This will be a very brief debate because I think there is very broad \nagreement on this issue. However, I thought it was important to take \njust a few moments. I think the Senate will be very proud to vote for \nthis amendment because we are going to put an end to a most outrageous \npolicy that has gone on really without the knowledge of many of us. It \nis one of those issues that has gotten buried over the years.\n  Late last year, I learned from a series of articles in the Dayton \nDaily News that military personnel convicted of heinous crimes continue \nto be paid while they appeal their convictions through the military \ncourt system, a process that often can take many years.\n  According to data, the Department of Defense spends about $1 million \neach and every month, $1 million a month, on the salaries of more than \n600 convicts. In 1 month, the Pentagon payroll included 58 incarcerated \nrapists, 164 child molesters, and 7 murderers.\n  The individual stories of military criminals continuing to receive \nfull pay are shocking. In California, a marine lance corporal who beat \nhis 13-month-old daughter to death almost 2 years ago receives $1,105 \nevery month--more than $25,000 since his conviction. He spends his days \nin the brig at Camp Pendleton and refuses to pay a dime of child \nsupport.\n  I spoke with the murdered child's grandmother who now has custody of \nthe surviving 4-year old grandson. She is a resident of northern \nCalifornia and was justifiably outraged to learn that the murderer of \nher grandchild still receives full pay, and that is what this amendment \nis going to end.\n  Mr. President, I can stand here for hours, and you know that I will \nnot do so but, rather, in the next couple of minutes will share a \ncouple other cases.\n  The lieutenant colonel who raped young girls in a church basement has \nbeen paid more than $150,000 since his conviction. I can tell you about \nthe Air Force sergeant who tried to kill his wife with a kitchen knife \nand is still paid $1,100 a month. From inside his prison cell, he reads \nthe Wall Street Journal and watches his taxpayer-funded nest egg grow. \nHe told the Dayton Daily News, ``I follow the stock market, and I buy \nEE bonds.''\n  When I first learned that hundreds of violent criminals remained on \nthe Pentagon payroll, I immediately wrote to Secretary Perry to demand \nan end to this outrageous practice. The Secretary quickly notified me \nof the support for changing the policy. He established a working group \nto propose the necessary legal changes.\n  I introduced legislation to prohibit pay for military convicts on \nMarch 16, and my bill quickly attracted 19 bipartisan cosponsors. I am \nvery grateful for their support. The ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Nunn, offered a number of helpful suggestions to improve my \nproposal, as did the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, Senator \nCoats.\n  I wish to thank each of them for their good work and constructive \nadvice on this issue. I would say that the Armed Services Committee on \nboth sides of the aisle was very supportive. They held a hearing. We \nall rolled up our sleeves, and we got to work. The bill addresses this \nissue. The only difference with the Boxer amendment is we end the pay \nin a quicker timeframe.\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides. Again, I want to say \nto my friends on both sides of the aisle, thank you very much. I think \nwe will be proud today that we end this unconscionable practice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield whatever time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from California send the \namendment to the desk?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe the Senator's amendment is at the desk already.\n  Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays. Then I will be glad \nto yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Bradley, proposes an amendment numbered 2117.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 189, strike out line 5 and all that \n     follows through page 191, line 21, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 526. FORFEITURE OF PAY AND ALLOWANCES AND REDUCTION IN \n                   GRADE.\n\n       (a) Effective Date of Punishments.--Section 857(a) (article \n     57(a)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a)(1) Any forfeiture of pay, forfeiture of allowances, \n     or recuction in grade included in a sentence of a court-\n     martial takes effect on the earlier of--\n       ``(A) the date that is 14 days after the date on which the \n     sentence is adjudged; or\n       ``(B) the date on which the sentence is approved by the \n     convening authority.\n       ``(2) On application by an accused, the convening authority \n     may defer any forfeiture of pay, forfeiture of allowances, or \n     reduction in grade that would otherwise become effective \n     under paragraph (1)(A) until the date on which the sentence \n     is approved by the convening authority. The deferment may be \n     rescinded at any time by the convening authority.\n       ``(3) A forfeiture of pay or allowances shall be collected \n     from pay accruing on and after the date on which the sentence \n     takes effect under paragraph (1). Periods during which a \n     sentence to forfeiture of pay or forfeiture of allowances is \n     suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the \n     duration of the forfeiture.\n       ``(4) In this subsection, the term `convening authority', \n     with respect to a sentence of a court-martial, means any \n     person authorized to act on the sentence under section 860 of \n     this title (article 60).''.\n       (b) Effect of Punitive Separation or Confinement for One \n     Year or More.--(1) Subchapter VIII is amended by inserting \n     after section 858a (article 58a) the following new section \n     (article):\n\n     ``Sec. 858b. Art. 58b. Sentences: forfeiture of pay and \n       allowances.\n\n       ``(a) A sentence adjudged by a court-martial that includes \n     confinement for one year or more, death, dishonorable \n     discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or dismissal shall result \n     in the forfeiture of all pay and allowances due that member \n     during any period of confinement or parole. The forfeiture \n     required by this section shall take effect on the date \n     determined under section 857(a) of this title (article 57(a)) \n     and may be deferred in accordance with that section.\n       ``(b) In a case involving an accused who has dependents, \n     the convening authority or other person acting under section \n     860 of this title (article 60) may waive any or all of the \n     forfeitures of pay and allowances required by subsection (a) \n     for a period not to exceed six months. Any amount of pay or \n     allowances that, except for a waiver under this subsection, \n     would be forfeited shall be paid, as the convening authority \n     or other person taking action directs, to the dependents of \n     the accused.''.\n       ``(c) If the sentence of a member who forfeits pay and \n     allowances under subsection (a) is set aside or disapproved \n     or, as finally approved, does not provide for a punishment \n     referred to in subsection (a), the member shall be paid the \n     pay and allowances which the member would have been paid, \n     except for the forfeiture, for the period during which the \n     forfeiture was in effect.''.\n       (2) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of subchapter VIII of such chapter is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``858b. 58b. Sentences: forfeiture of pay and allowances.''.\n\n       (c) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to a case in which a sentence is adjudged by a \n     court-martial on or after the first day of the first month \n     that begins at least 30 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator request the yeas and nays?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 1 minute 10 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be pleased to yield to my friend, Senator Coats.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I will just take 30 seconds.\n  Senator Boxer worked carefully with the committee on this proposal. \nWhile the committee language was slightly different from what the \nSenator's amendment proposes here today, it simply accelerates the time \nin which the Department has to effect the change. It is acceptable to \nthe committee. We appreciate the Senator working with us on this, and \nwe support this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  \n[[Page S 11389]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment by the \nSenator from California. I congratulate her on her leadership in \nbringing this to the attention of the Department of Defense Armed \nServices Committee. This reaffirms a provision that the bill now has in \nit precluding pay for military prisoners who are sentenced to extended \nconfinement. I believe that term is defined as ``over 1 year.'' I also \nbelieve it changes the appeal time before the actual compensation is \ncut off. The bill has 21 days. This has 14 days after conviction.\n  This is an abuse that has gone on too long. It was not brought to the \nattention of our committee or the Department of Defense.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his leadership.\n  I urge its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield my time back, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Georgia yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. NUNN. Has the Senator from Indiana used all the time he needs?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes. We yield back our time.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield back the time.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 2116\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this last vote is ample testimony that we \nwill never stop spending the taxpayers' dollars that are earmarked for \ndefense on anything but pork and wasteful spending.\n  The very concept that if an organization makes a profit that uses \ndefense dollars, we cannot pay that back, then, Mr. President, I have \nno confidence whatsoever that we will ever be able to do what the \ntaxpayers asked us to do--that is, to use the tax dollars earmarked for \ndefense for purposes of national security.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2117\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have an amendment I am sending to the \ndesk, cosponsored by Senators Levin, Roth, Glenn, and Bingaman. It has \nbeen cleared on both sides. It deals with the acquisition of computer \ntechnology.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], for himself, Mr. Levin, \n     Mr. Roth, Mr. Glenn, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2118.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today lays the \nfoundation for real information management reform not only at the \nDepartment of Defense but at all Government agencies.\n  The amendment is based on S. 946, the Federal Information Management \nReform Act of 1995, which Senator Levin and I introduced earlier this \nyear.\n  Before discussing the details of the amendment, I want to both \ncommend and express my appreciation to Senator Roth, chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and Senator Glenn, the ranking member. \nBoth have been leaders on issues relating to information technology, \nand their contribution to crafting this amendment has been invaluable.\n  I would also like to thank my friend and colleague Senator Levin who \nI have worked closely with for over 15 years on the Oversight \nSubcommittee. I very much appreciate his counsel, cooperation, and \nsupport on this issue.\n  Finally, I want to also mention the members of these Senators' staff \nwhose valuable assistance is appreciated. Specifically, Peter Levine, \nMark Forman, David Plocher, and Debbie Cohen.\n\n[[Page S 11390]]\n\n  The amendment which would reform the Federal Government's approach to \nusing and buying information technology, is cosponsored by Senators \nLevin, Roth, Glenn, and Bingaman. Together, we have been able to \nfashion an amendment that will address many critical issues of \ninformation technology management within Federal agencies.\n  The amendment would accomplish meaningful reform, in part, by \nemphasizing upfront planning and the establishment of clear performance \ngoals designed to improve agency operations. Once the upfront planning \nis complete and the performance goals are established, other reforms \nwould make it simpler and faster for agencies to purchase information \ntechnology.\n  The need to reform how the Federal Government approaches and \npurchases information technology is well documented. The amendment \nreflects recommendations contained in literally hundreds of General \nAccounting Office and inspector general reports. The Defense Science \nBoard's and numerous other formal Government studies have also outlined \na number of problems in the current system and have made many \nrecommendations for improvement. Now is the time to act on these \nrecommendations, many of which are included in this amendment.\n  The current situation is abysmal. Last October, I issued a report \nentitled ``Computer Chaos,'' which stressed two key problems affecting \nthe $27 billion we spend each year on information technology.\n  First, much of this money is wasted buying new systems that agencies \nhave not adequately planned or managed. Consequently new systems, \nespecially high dollars systems, rarely work as intended and do little \nto improve agency performance.\n  Second, a large portion of the $200 billion spent on information \ntechnology over the last decade has been thrown away maintaining old \ntechnology that no longer performs as needed. In other words, we are \nthrowing billions of dollars away every year on technological bandaids, \nand we cannot, by virtue of the existing procurement and management \nsystem, effectively buy replacement systems.\n  Nowhere is this situation more evident than with our Nation's air \ntraffic control system. In recent months, air traffic control system \nfailures have become all too common. Passing this amendment will help \nto ensure that follow-on systems can be adequately planned and \nimplemented to replace our Nation's aging air traffic control system \nbefore we have a tragedy.\n  The Government's failure to purchase effective computer systems has \nhad significant implications for the Defense Department. The lack of \neffective information systems at the Pentagon has contributed to the \nmismanagement of billions of defense dollars. The payment of phantom \nemployees, excessive inventories, and payments that weren't matched to \ninvoices are the result of the Pentagon's inability to adequately and \nappropriately plan for and buy needed information systems.\n  In addition, defense agencies have spent billions of dollars each \nyear to keep old, inefficient computer systems running, and they \ncontinue to buy new computer systems that are poorly planned and, once \noperational, do not meet the needs of the defense agencies which use \nthem.\n  For example, 3 years ago I held hearings on the Defense Commissary \nAgency's failure to make timely and accurate payments to vendors. The \nAgency's computerized bill payment system was inadequate. Consequently, \nthe vendors that delivered goods to commissaries, ranging from Kraft to \nQuahog Lobster Co. in my State of Maine, were not getting paid on time, \nif they were getting paid at all, while other vendors were getting paid \nrepeatedly for the same invoices.\n  We do not know how much money the Defense Commissary Agency wasted \nthrough erroneous payments and added administrative expenses in an \noften futile attempt to sort out who was owed what. Although it has \ntaken the Agency and some of its vendors years to recover from this \nexperience, the whole episode could have been avoided had the Defense \nCommissary Agency invested in adequate technology.\n  Effective modernization at the Department of Defense has the \npotential to save taxpayers billions of dollars through increased \nefficiencies. In April, the Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing \nexamining how the Pentagon manages its system from processing employee \ntravel vouchers. We discovered that 30 percent of the Pentagon's travel \nbudget--some $1 billion--was being spent just to process the $3 billion \nin annual DOD travel.\n  Private sector organizations spend on average about 10 percent of \ntheir travel budgets on processing vouchers and the best private sector \norganizations spend 6 percent. By adopting travel processing systems \nthat are similar to private sector models and automating these \nprocesses, we determined that the Pentagon could save as much as $4 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  As you can see, it is critical that we encourage not only the \nPentagon but all Federal agencies to look at the way they do business, \nmake changes to these business processes, and automate. I believe we \ncan achieve a 5-percent annual reduction in Government overhead by \nadopting this strategy and, as a result, save the American taxpayer as \nmuch as $175 billion over the next 5 years. In this time of austere \nbudgets, we cannot afford not to adopt the reforms contained in this \namendment.\n  The bottom line is that the Government's current approach to buying \ncomputers is outdated and takes little account of the competitive and \nfast changing nature of the global computer industry. Markets and \nprices change daily, yet Government often gets locked into paying \ntoday's prices for yesterday's technology.\n  When the Brooks Act which governs how the Government buys computers \nwas written in 1965, the Federal Government was the dominant computer \nbuyer in the world and purchased over 60 percent of the industry's \nentire output. Today, the Federal market comprises only 3 percent of \nindustry sales. While Government is still the largest single buyer, it \nno longer moves the market.\n  Over the last three decades, the Brooks Act has produced a process \nthat has become too bureaucratic and cumbersome. It has spawned \nhundreds of pages of regulations and caused agencies to be primarily \nconcerned with conformity to a paperwork process. What the process \nfails to address are the results--more efficient and less expensive \nGovernment--and fairness to the taxpayers.\n  In addition, an adversarial culture has developed between Government \nand business. Many companies believe they won't get a fair shake. \nFederal employees are suspicious of companies because of a fear of \nbeing second guessed and having the procurement protested.\n  In short, it is a culture of little trust, less communication, and no \nincentives to use information technology to improve the way Government \ndoes business and achieve the savings that we so desperately need.\n  It is time to move the Government's use of information technology \ninto the 21st century. That is why I am introducing this amendment \ntoday so that we can significantly alter how the Government approaches \nand acquires information technology.\n  The legislation would repeal the Brooks Act and establish a framework \nthat will respond more efficiently to the information technology needs \nof the Federal Government now and in the foreseeable future. The \namendment would also eliminate the delegation of procurement authority \nat GSA, establish guidance and specific budgetary review authority at \nOMB, and establish Chief Information Officers at the major Federal \nagencies. Through the guidance and review process, OMB and the agencies \nwill be required to emphasize up-front planning, monitor risk \nmanagement, and work with contractors to achieve workable solutions to \nthe Government's information needs.\n  The amendment will also discourage the so-called megasystem buys. \nFollowing the private sector model, agencies will be encouraged to take \nan incremental approach to buying information technology that is more \nmanageable and less risky.\n  By replacing the current system with one that is less bureaucratic \nand process driven, the bill is designed to enable agencies to buy \ntechnology faster and for less money. More importantly, the bill is \ndesigned to make sure that before investing a dollar in information \ntechnology, Government agencies \n\n[[Page S 11391]]\nwill have carefully planned and justified their expenditures.\n  Similar to managing an investment portfolio, decisions on whether to \ninvest in information technology will be made based on potential \nreturn. Decisions to terminate or make additional investments will be \nbased on performance. Much like an investment broker, agency management \nand contractor performance will be measured and rewarded based on \nmanaging risk\n and achieving results.\n\n  I should note that the amendment is different from S. 946 in a number \nof significant ways. For example, S. 946 called for the establishment \nof a National Chief Information Officer at the Office of Management and \nBudget. Concerns were raised by the administration and Senators Roth, \nGlenn, and Levin, that this has the potential to become a bureaucratic \nhurdle. Similar concerns were also raised at a hearing I conducted on \nthis legislation in July. Consequently, the provision requiring a \nnational CIO has been dropped.\n  In addition, a number of changes have been made to the procurement \nprovisions. Specifically, a number of procurement reforms in the \noriginal legislation have been deleted from the amendment. These reform \nissues are currently under discussion by a Governmental Affairs/Armed \nServices/Small Business Committee working group and will be dealt with \non a Governmentwide basis in procurement legislation later this year.\n  The amendment will fundamentally shift the Government's focus on \ninformation technology from a technical issue to a management issue. \nInformation technology procurements under the current system have \nfocused on features like the speed of the computer or the type of \nprocessor. Rarely, if ever, have they focused on whether the system was \ngoing to enhance the agency's mission by, for example, reducing benefit \nprocessing time or realize savings by reducing overhead expenditures.\n  Failure to recognize information technology as a management issue has \ncost taxpayers billions of dollars in inefficiency and waste. By \npassing this amendment, we can help transform the way the Government \ndoes business. If Government is going to regain the confidence of \ntaxpayers, it must successfully modernize. And, as we all know, we \ncannot successfully modernize unless we can buy the tools which will \nenable us to automate.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is needed not only by the Department of \nDefense but throughout Government. Passing this amendment will go a \nlong way toward bringing our Government into the 21st century. Reform \nis clearly the key to creating a Federal Government that, as the Vice \nPresident has put it, ``works better and costs less.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 946, the \nCohen-Levin information technology bill, I find myself in an unusual \nposition with regard to this amendment. I had expected to work closely \nwith Senator Cohen and other members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and our subcommittee to revise and perfect this bill. \nInstead, I find myself addressing this issue on the Senate floor before \nhearings on the bill have been completed and before the bill could be \nmarked up and amended through the committee process.\n  There are serious problems with our Federal Government systems for \npurchasing and managing information technology. I believe that problems \nas far-reaching as these deserve serious consideration at the committee \nlevel. The changes proposed in the Cohen-Levin bill deserve a full \nairing in public hearings and an opportunity for input from the \nexecutive branch, the public, and all members of the committee of \njurisdiction. For this reason, I initially intended to oppose this \namendment.\n  I shall not do so, however. While I continue to have major concerns \nabout the process through which this amendment has been considered, \nSenator Cohen and his staff have made major modifications to the bill \nto address concerns raised by the administration and by other members \nof the committee. They have also agreed to delete a number of \nprovisions addressing issues that we expect to address on a more \ncomprehensive basis in the context of a later procurement bill. As a \nresult, the amendment before us would take a number of significant \nsteps to address problems with the procurement and management of \ncomputer systems without raising the concerns that the earlier bill \ndid.\n  Mr. President, I continue to believe, as I did when I joined Senator \nCohen in introducing S. 946, that it is very much time for us to \nreexamine our systems for the acquisition of computer equipment from \nthe ground up. I continue to believe that is appropriate for us to ask \nwhy procurement and bid protest procedures and standards that have met \nour needs for products ranging from toasters to fighter aircraft cannot \nalso meet our needs in the area of computer procurement. I continue to \nbelieve that it is appropriate for us to ask why we still need the \ncentralized approach of the Brooks Act, under which the General \nServices Administration is responsible for approving computer purchases \nby other Federal agencies.\n  The amendment that Senator Cohen and I are offering today would \ndramatically revise Federal procedures for the procurement and \nmanagement of information technology products and services by:\n  Repealing the Brooks Act of 1965;\n  Eliminating the requirement for a delegation of procurement authority \nby General Services Administration;\n  Ending the unique role of the General Services Board of Contract \nAppeals in information technology bid protests;\n  Clarifying the role of the Office of Management and Budget and the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs in coordinating and \nimproving Federal procurement and management of information technology;\n  Creating a new position in Federal agencies, known as the chief \ninformation officer or CIO, dedicated to the management of information \ntechnology resources;\n  Establishing a governmentwide CIO council to provide guidance to \nagencies on information technology management issues;\n  Establishing a preference for incremental purchases of information \ntechnology over a period of years, instead of unworkable megapurchases \nof huge amounts of products and services through a single contract; and\n  Establishing a pilot program to test the innovative Canadian system \nfor procuring complex computer systems.\n  The Cohen amendment also contains the provisions of S. 675, my bill \nto reduce paperwork in the acquisition of off-the-shelf products by \nproviding governmentwide, on-line access to GSA's multiple award \nschedules. The implementation of these provisions should bring \neffective competition to the multiple award schedules and make it \npossible to reduce or even eliminate the need for lengthy negotiations \nand burdensome paperwork requirements placed on vendors to ensure fair \npricing. Accordingly, we would also establish a pilot program, under \nwhich direct competition at the user level would substitute for lengthy \nand paper-intensive price negotiations with vendors. I am pleased that \nthese important provisions will be included in the Cohen amendment.\n  This amendment would not contain a number of provisions that I and \nothers found problematic in the original Cohen bill. Unlike the \noriginal Cohen bill, this amendment would not create a new chief \ninformation officer or [CIO] in the Office of Management and Budget; it \nwould not establish a new congressional committee; it would not \noverturn the prohibition on organizational conflicts of interest in \nacquisitions of information technology; and it would not provide for \nautomatic termination of contracts and solicitations, or automatic pay \nadjustments for Federal employees, based on artificial formulas.\n  Because Senator Cohen and his staff have worked hard in the last few \ndays to address substantive concerns with the earlier bill and because \nthey have agreed to include the important streamlining provisions from \nmy bill in his amendment, I ask to be included as an original cosponsor \nof the amendment. While I continue to be troubled that we are moving an \namendment of this significance without the benefits of committee \ndeliberation, I support the amendment.\n\n[[Page S 11392]]\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am glad to be a cosponsor of the Cohen \namendment and urge my colleagues to support it, as well. This amendment \ncontains two sets of provisions regarding information technology [IT] \nmanagement and procurement reform. Both are important, and both deserve \nsupport.\n  While I am cosponsoring the amendment because of its substantive \nmerit, I must add that as a matter of process, I believe the amendment \nshould have been considered more fully by the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. The amendment differs significantly from the original \nlegislation, S. 946. The one subcommittee hearing held to consider that \nbill does not suffice for a thorough review of the issues presented in \neither that bill or the revised language before us today. In my view, I \nwould have preferred for a bill as significant and important as this \none to go through the committee process so that we would have a report \nto turn to in the years ahead to know why we did what we are about to \ndo. But, given my work on these issues, I am now comfortable with the \namendment.\n  This amendment is needed because of the state of Federal Government \ninformation activities. Recent press stories about repeated failures of \nFAA air traffic computers alone should convince people of the need to \nsubstantially improve the way the Government buys, uses, and manages \ninformation technology.\n  This year Congress already took a major step toward addressing this \nissue when it passed the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This law not \nonly tackles the problem of public paperwork burdens, but also sets in \nplace new requirements for broader improvements in information \nresources management [IRM].\n  The first set of provisions in the amendment before us today \nestablishes detailed guidelines for implementation of the information \ntechnology management provisions of the 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act. \nThe administration has been moving vigorously to implement the new act \nand has found that additional requirements would be useful to press \nagencies to improve their information technology investment planning \nand control processes and to provide greater accountability for \ninformation technology acquisition and management decisions. The \nadministration supports these elements of the Cohen amendment and I \ncommend those in the administration who are showing their commitment to \nmaking significant improvements in the management of Government \ninformation resources.\n  The second set of provisions in the amendment, also supported by the \nadministration, provides related reforms in the area of procurement of \ninformation technology. These provisions are key to our buying of IT. \nThey include such provisions as modular acquisitions and pilot projects \nwhich will give us the flexibility we need to procure information \ntechnology at a pace that is consistent with its rapid development. \nAfter all, that's what this amendment is all about.\n  I would also add that the bill as originally written contained many \nmore procurement provisions than those included in this amendment. I am \npleased that Senator Cohen deferred on these provisions--which are just \nas significant to IT as they are to other procurements--so that they \nwill be considered by the acquisition reform working group. This \nbipartisan group will produce another piece of governmentwide \nacquisition reform legislation in the next couple of months to follow \nup on last year's success of the passage of the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Cohen's amendment \nand appreciate his work on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to thank my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Cohen and Mr. Levin, the authors of this amendment, Senator \nGlenn, and others, for their assistance in including my language in \ntheir amendment. Although this compromise language is not all that I \nhad hoped, I believe that it takes an important step toward ensuring \nthat the public who fund the creation of government information will be \nable to access it.\n  The amendment by my distinguished colleagues is a version of \nlegislation currently before the Committee on Governmental Affairs, S. \n946. I have serious concerns about that legislation and the impact it \nhas on issues within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, on which I serve as the ranking member.\n  The Rules Committee has worked hard over the last several years to \nensure that Government information that is disseminated electronically, \nrather than through printed documents, is readily found and obtained by \nthe public who pays to produce it. As technology allows us to move from \nthe printed page to electronic databases, the Rules Committee has the \nsame historic interest in ensuring that the public has access to that \ninformation in the least costly, most efficient form. At some point, \nmost information that is available electronically is reduced to a \nprinted form, and it is imperative that the protection of title 44 with \nregard to ensuring public access to such information be preserved no \nmatter how much technology changes.\n  Currently, we achieve that through a combination of the depository \nlibrary system and provisions of title 44 which created the Government \nPrinting Office electronic access system, enacted 2 years ago. This \nsystem maintains a directory of Federal electronic information which \ncan be readily located and accessed by the general public through the \ndepository library system.\n  The depository library system, including over 1,400 libraries located \nin every congressional district across this country, provides an \nessential link for individual and communities to their government. The \ndepository library system ensures that all government printed \ninformation, and now electronic information through the GPO access \nsystem also, is available to anyone, regardless of whether they have a \ncomputer in his or her home or office.\n  It is a system that is working and working well. It simply makes no \nsense in these times of fiscal restraint to reinvent the wheel when it \ncomes to a system by which the public will locate and access government \ninformation. That is not to say that this should be the sole method of \ndisseminating public information. But it should be the plain, vanilla \nmethod by which anyone, no matter how geographically isolated or \ncomputer illiterate, goes about obtaining government information.\n  The language I sought to have added to this measure provides that if \nan agency determines that its information technology system will be \nused to disseminate information to the public, then that information \nmust be provided to the Government Printing Office, pursuant to section \n4101 of title 44, United States Code. The GPO directory is currently \nbeing used by depository libraries across this country to provide the \npublic with a usable reference system for government information.\n  Under this provision, an executive agency will continue to determine \nwhen it will make information available to the public. But once that \ndecision is made, regardless of whether the information is reduced to \nprinted form or posted on an electronic database, the public will be \nable to find it through the GPO access system. The public is entitled \nto that information and should not have to own a computer with a link \nto the specific agency, or any other database, to find it. My language \nensures that they will not. A simple trip to their library to access \nthe GPO system is all that is required.\n  This provision is necessary to ensure that the taxpayers of America \nwho fund the creation of information technology systems which will be \nused to disseminate information will be able to access that \ninformation. This is an important link between government and the \npublic and will increase the accountability of government to the public \nit serves.\n  I appreciate the considerable assistance of my distinguished \ncolleagues, and their staff, in developing this compromise. I look \nforward to continuing efforts to ensure that no matter how much \ntechnology changes, the American public still gets their dollars worth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2118) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  \n[[Page S 11393]]\n\n  Mr. COHEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COHEN. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for yielding.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2119\n\n (Purpose: To limit to $257,700,000,000 the total amount authorized to \n                            be appropriated)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Grassley and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Brown, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bumpers, \n     Mr. Bradley, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2119.\n       On page 16, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. GENERAL LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the total \n     amount authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1996 \n     under the provisions of this Act is $257,700,000,000.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It limits the \nspending in the bill before us to the level in the Senate's version of \nthe budget resolution: $257.7 billion. On May 23, 1995, in a strong \nbipartisan vote, the Senate defeated an amendment to the budget \nresolution which would have increased defense spending above the level \nrequested by the administration. Sixty Senators voted against that \namendment to increase defense spending. Unless they have changed their \nminds, the same 60 Senators should support this amendment. It offers \nanother chance for the Senate to support the defense spending level \nlaid out in the Senate's budget resolution and to save $7 billion in \ndefense spending.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that the defense spending number \nsupported by opponents of this amendment represents an increase in \ndefense spending over last year's spending level.\n  We are spending far too much on defense. We are not at war. We are \ncoming off the defense buildup of the 1980's. The United States defense \nbudget is larger than the combined military expenditures in the next \nnine largest military budgets, and our defense\n budget is 3.5 times larger than that of the next biggest spender, \nRussia. How can we possibly justify these exorbitant spending levels to \nthe American people? How do we explain to them this hemorrhaging of \ntaxpayer dollars? At a time when we are cutting programs for the poor, \nfor students, for seniors--how can we justify giving the military money \nit has not asked for. This is not a question of national security; \nthere is no major power threatening America. This is not a question of \nreadiness, because most of the increase in spending is not to train \ntroops, it is to pay defense contractors for more military hardware. \nThe question is, do we need an extra $7 billion in this bill that the \nDefense Department says it does not want or does not need?\n\n  The President increased the defense budget by $6.9 billion before he \nsent up his fiscal year 1996 budget request to respond to some \nperceived shortfalls in readiness, and, perhaps, to head off defense \nspending increases ahead. Yet, in a move unprecedented in the last 14 \nyears, the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill increases \ndefense spending even more, $7 billion above the administration's \nrequest. And, I should note, none of the $7 billion went to pay for \nongoing military operations in and around Iraq, Cuba, and Bosnia even \nthough Secretary Perry had made an urgent request for funds to cover \nthese contingency operations. The decision not to fund these operations \nputs even more pressure on the operations and maintenance accounts and \nraises the question of how serious the Armed Services Committee is in \naddressing the readiness issue.\n  Again, I want to emphasize: A majority of this body--60 Senators--has \nalready gone on record supporting $257.7 billion for Defense. And that \nis what this amendment would do. Let me lay out some of the reasons why \nwe should support this amendment.\n  First, this defense bill, with its huge spending levels, is \nreminiscent of the cold war. Our defense infrastructure looks \nremarkably similar to what was created to stand up to the Soviet Union \nand its Eastern Bloc allies. Even though we all agree that they no \nlonger pose the same threat to our national security, we have not found \na way to reduce the tremendous burden defense spending places on our \ncountry. While the Soviet Union constituted the main security threat to \nthe United States throughout the cold war, present-day Russia is a \nshadow of its former military might. Look at the Russian military's \nrecent performance in Chechnya. The breakup of the Soviet Union has \ndeprived the Russians of military forces and defense production \ncapacity. Even if an authoritarian regime took over, readiness has \neroded so much as a result of deep\n budget cuts that it would take decades to recreate that threat.\n\n  The greatest threats we face today are less likely to be resolved \nwith military force, and more likely to be resolved through political \nor diplomatic intervention. To be sure, we need a strong defense. We \nneed to develop a strategy, and maintain a force structure, to protect \nand advance our interests in the new global environment. The difficulty \nis recognizing that our present infrastructure may not be relevant to \nthe challenges ahead. If we could start over again, and create a new \nforce structure from scratch, I am confident that we would have a \nleaner, more mobile and more efficient force at far less cost. Even \nworking with our present defense budget, CBO and others have identified \noptions to cut defense spending which could bring spending down as low \nas $150 billion by the year 2000. But this amendment is not about \nmaking deep cuts in defense spending. This amendment would make a very \nmodest cut of $7 billion from the $264.7 billion authorization bill \nbefore us, and bring us back to the spending level that 60 Senators \nsupported just 3 months ago.\n  Mr. President, there are many weapons systems in this bill that are \nobsolete. Although much lip service has been paid to the need for a new \napproach to national defense, little has changed in the last decade. \nMany of the weapons systems in the pipeline today were conceived during \nthe defense build up of the 1980's, and will do little to address the \nthreats of the post-cold-war world. There are countless big-ticket \nprograms, with dubious rationales for their continued existence, that \nrefuse to die. It is time for the Senate to recognize that we must stop \nbuying weapons systems we no longer need and can no longer afford.\n  I believe that when it comes to defense, we are not making the tough \ndecisions to reduce the budget deficit. If we truly intend to reduce \nthe deficit, no area of the budget should be held harmless. The defense \nbudget is no exception. We have not made exceptions for other areas of \nthe budget that contribute as much to the long term security and well \nbeing of this Nation as does defense. In this era of deep and painful \nbudget cuts, hitting many Americans hard, the bill before us today \nincreases defense spending above what the Pentagon has indicated it \nneeds and above last year's spending levels. Let me repeat, we are \nincreasing defense spending this year at a time when everything else is \nbeing cut: education, health care, environmental protection, Medicare, \nMedicaid, low-income energy assistance, job training, childcare and \nchild nutrition, highway funding, cancer research, elderly housing \nassistance, farm programs--everything else, but not defense.\n  Now there are those who will argue that there are defense budget cuts \nplanned for later years. However, I do not believe we will make those \ncuts because many of the proposed increases we have before us today are \ndevoted to new procurement, and new research and development projects, \nwhich lay the groundwork for increased spending down the road.\n  If we do not stop this spending now, we will have unleashed even more \nprojects that will refuse to die.\n  The Armed Services Committee report acknowledges this: let me read \nfrom page 3:\n\n       The committee remains concerned about the adequacy of \n     funding levels for national defense programs in the coming \n     years. Despite the recommended fiscal year 1996 funding \n     increase of $7.0 billion above the adminstration request, \n     budget levels proposed for future years do not adequately \n\n[[Page S 11394]]\n     fund even the level of forces required for the Bottom-Up Review Force. \n     These levels cannot meet modernization needs and do not cover \n     inflation. This shortfall will seriously impair the ability \n     of the Department of Defense to field the ready, modern \n     forces essential to our national security. The limited \n     progress reflected in this bill cannot be maintained unless \n     future funding is increased.\n\n  Mr. President, there it is in black and white; the Armed Services \nCommittee wants to spend more for defense. We cannot sustain the \nspending levels and the increased procurement in this budget unless we \nspend more for defense down the road. Experts on all ends of the \nspectrum agree on this point. Thus, a vote for increased spending this \nyear is also a vote to increase spending next year, and the year after, \nand so on.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, our amendment is not about any \nspecific weapon system or any particular defense program. I know that \nthere are colleagues who would like an amendment to target specific \nprograms. But that is not the point of this amendment. Our amendment is \nabout how much we should be spending on defense overall. This Senate \nagreed to spend $257.7 billion on defense just 3 months ago. In \naffirming that number today, this amendment is not an attack on defense \nspending. This amendment is about the amount of defense spending the \nSenate agreed was an acceptable level, which the present defense \nauthorization bill increases by $7 billion.\n  And so I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and for a \nmore responsible level of defense spending.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa. I am pleased to be a cosponsor because \nI think this is a true ``walk the walk'' amendment.\n  We have spent countless hours in the 104th Congress ``talking the \ntalk'' about fiscal responsibility. Now with this amendment we have a \nchance to back up our words by ``walking the walk.''\n  Mr. President, I considered offering a series of amendments to this \nbill to cut unnecessary spending. But I finally decided that doing so \nwould not be the best way to make what is my basic point. That basic \npoint is that we spend too much on defense because we spend it the \nwrong way.\n  Our defense budgets are still structured to fight the cold war. \nAlthough it is easy to come to the Senate floor and talk about the so-\ncalled post-cold-war world, it is a little more difficult to analyze \nexactly what that means for America's security needs. We have already \nhad two reviews that were supposed to do that, one by the Bush \nadministration, the so-called Base Force Study, and one by the Clinton \nadministration, the Bottom-Up Review. And both of those studies really \nonly tinkered at the margin of clearly looking at what we need in a \npost-cold-war world to defend the interests of this country.\n  Rather than rethinking the threats to America's security--which I \nthink includes runaway deficits and the erosion of civil society as \nwell as North Korea's nuclear program--these reviews have in fact been \nelaborate exercises in fighting the last war. Instead of taking a \nrealistic look at the world as it is out there today, these reviews \nhave trimmed a little here and trimmed a little there. But the result \nwas to conform to what I call a cold war lite approach to the world. \nThat is what this budget is, a cold war lite. It does not make any \nfundamental decisions about direction or what we need to do to defend \nthis country in the so-called post-cold-war world. It simply does a \nlittle less here, a little less there. It is cold war lite.\n  Mr. President, $257.7 billion would be left in this budget after this \namendment passed, if it did pass--$257 billion. That is a lot of money, \nmore than enough to fund our defense needs, but only if we eliminate \nprograms that we no longer need and spend the money on what we need.\n  Mr. President, I must say that looking at the debate and the budget, \nI see supporters of expensive but unnecessary weapons programs have \nseized upon the business-as-usual approach to defense budgeting, have \nseized upon the failure of both the Bush and the Clinton \nadministrations to analyze what we need in a post-cold-war world to \nsimply keep this program alive.\n  The Comanche, for example--I mean this thing just will not die. \nHaving been pruned back to $199 million and two prototypes--that is how \nfar we got this thing down at one point--it has crept back up to $373 \nmillion and eight aircraft. It is simply not needed. The Bush \nadministration tried for 4 years to kill the Osprey, for 4 years, and \nyet here it is--$762 million strong right there in the budget. It \ncannot be justified on defense needs.\n  Mr. President, too big a part of this $265 million defense budget is \nnothing more than a jobs program. Take this bill, $7 billion over the \nbudget resolution featuring $4.7 billion of unrequested add-ons; $7 \nbillion above the defense resolution; $4.7 billion that was not even \nrequested by the Defense Department or by the Clinton administration.\n  Last night the Senate voted to keep $1.5 billion in this bill to \nsustain a submarine industrial base by building a Seawolf submarine, a \nsubmarine we do not need to secure our national defense.\n  My constituents in the State of New Jersey will thus continue by the \ntaxes they pay to come to Washington, that then go to the defense \ncontractors to produce weapons systems that we do not need to defend \nour country. And my constituents in New Jersey are fed up with this \nkind of approach to our national defense.\n  Given the magnitude of the problem, it makes no sense to nickel and \ndime this bill, this little amendment here, this little amendment \nthere. I know it is being done. It probably will be done.\n  But it is much better to take the approach of this amendment offered \nby the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Wisconsin and cut a big \npiece of pork with one slice. This is the way the Senate can send a \nsignal to the administration and frankly to the Congress that the old \nway of thinking no longer works.\n  Mr. President, this, then, will be, when we vote on this amendment, a \nvote to shatter the old way of thinking, and start the difficult and \noverdue process of rethinking our defense needs and priorities in this \nworld. Cut $7 billion now, and pave the way for a better defense in the \nyears to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Thurmond for yielding this \ntime. I realize we have 15 minutes as opposed to 75 minutes on the \nother side.\n  Mr. President, no decade in this century began more auspiciously than \nthe 1990's. That gross impediment to human liberty--the Berlin Wall--\nwas breached by the stronger forces of human yearning. The central \nsecurity problem of our time--the possible clash of East and West on \nthe plains of Germany--was resolved by the dissolution of the Warsaw \nPact, the reunification of Germany, and the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion.\n  The euphoria that accompanied these events anticipated the imminent \narrival of a new world order of independent democracies engaged only in \npeaceful commercial competition with one another.\n  But the resurrection of ancient conflicts and hideous barbarism in \nthe Balkans; the reappearance of other incidents of irrational \nnationalism that had been sublimated by the cold war; the haunting \nfamiliarity of Zhirinovksy's odious appeal to a perverse patriotism; \nthe accelerating proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and the \nwaging of over 50 conflicts around the world have dimmed our hopes for \na more just and tranquil world, and reminded us that we have interests \nand values that are still at risk in this promising, but uncertain \nworld.\n  The world is still a very dangerous place. American vigilance and \nstruggle are required now more than ever. There \n\n[[Page S 11395]]\nare numerous potential threats to our national security in the world \ntoday. North Korea, one of the world's remaining communist \ndictatorships, seeks to acquire nuclear weapons, and this \nadministration has failed to exercise the decisive leadership necessary \nto halt once and for all the threat of nuclear warfare on the Korean \nPeninsula.\n  In Asia, China has laid claim to the entire South China Sea and has \nenhanced its claim with a massive buildup of its armed forces, \nincluding the acquisition of new submarines, marine forces and aircraft \ncarriers.\n  In the Middle East, Iran poses a serious threat to the security of \nthe region with their own efforts to acquire nuclear weapons, their \nlongstanding support of terrorist movements, and their aggressive \nmilitary buildup in the Straits of Hormuz. Iraq remains a potential \ntrouble spot, and Saddam Hussein maintains a stranglehold on political \nand economic power in that state. Russia's involvement in its near \nabroad, the ongoing horrible conflict in Chechnya and its advocacy of \nchange in stable arms agreements causes serious concerns. Ethnic \nconflicts continue to range from Sri Lanka to Rwanda, and in Bosnia, \nUnited States military personnel may soon be sent in harm's way to \nassist in extracting international forces from the failed U.N. \npeacekeeping effort in that state.\n  These and other examples of instability in the world today make it \nimperative that we support an adequate national defense posture in this \nNation.\n  I share the frustration and anger of many Americans as we spend \nmillions and sometimes billions on weapons systems that are unnecessary \nand pork barrel projects that frankly have no relevance to the post-\ncold-war era. But I would remind you, Mr. President, the defense budget \ndeclined 35 percent in real terms between 1985 and 1994. President \nClinton promised in his State of the Union Address in January 1994, \n``We must not cut defense further.'' Yet, his fiscal year 1996 defense \nbudget submission would cut defense for 4 more years totaling another \n10 percent decline by 1999.\n  This rapid shrinking of resources available for national defense \nfirst damaged the readiness of our forces, damage which has now nearly \nbeen repaired as a result of warnings from our Joint Chiefs and \nCongress over the past few years. Operations, training and maintenance \nfunding has been restored to needed levels in most instances.\n  Unfortunately, however, the continuing deficit in defense accounts \nwill in the future impair the ability of our military forces to be \nready to perform on the battlefield in the future. The fact is that \nwith the Clinton defense budget levels we would be unable to maintain \nnear-term readiness and also fund future force modernization.\n  Testimony from our highest ranking military officers, the four \nservice chiefs, before the Readiness Subcommittee on April 27 of this \nyear, illustrated the Hobson's choice in the Pentagon today. The chiefs \ntestified that they have halted virtually all major modernization \nprograms because of the need to devote their scarce resources to \nrestoring and maintaining near-term readiness. They also testified that \nat a consistent level of defense spending much higher than the Clinton \nadministration's defense budget, about $272 billion per year, they \nwould barely be able to fund their modernization efforts. And they \nstated unequivocally that if additional funding were available for \ndefense, their highest priority would be modernization, by the way, not \nmilitary construction. Procurement of new weapons systems has nearly \nstopped.\n  Four of our highest ranking retired military officers prepared a \nreport entitled, ``A Report on Military Capabilities and Readiness.'' \nIn this report, they illustrated the sharp decline in procurement of \nfighter and attack aircraft, tanks and combat vehicles, missiles and \nships. In all of these categories, procurement of new weapons systems \nis lower than at any time in the past 20 years.\n  This year's budget request funds only three new combat ships, 16 \nfixed-wing combat aircraft, and 60 new helicopters. It contains no \nfunding for new tanks and inadequate funding for improving existing \ntanks. Average age of equipment will continue to rise as will the cost \nof maintaining aging forces. Safety margins will narrow.\n  Under the Clinton administration budget, the technological edge of \nour military forces, which was responsible in large part for the \nvictory in the Persian Gulf war, will disappear. Without force \nmodernization, military forces in the year 2001, at the end of the \ncurrent future years' defense program, will not have the technological \nsuperiority necessary to fight and win on the modern battlefield. This \nlegislation restores some of the funding required to continue with the \ndevelopment and procurement of modern high technological weapons \nsystems which will provide the battlefield edge in the future.\n  The level of defense spending in this bill is necessary to ensure our \nNation's position in the world and the future security of our people. \nThat will provide the defense funding that is absolutely necessary to \naccomplish these goals.\n  The bill is consistent with the budget resolution and funds high-\npriority defense spending in order to maintain a viable American \nmilitary force into the next century.\n  Mr. President, the bill's level of defense spending is minimally \nadequate to ensure near-term readiness as well as force modernization \nin the future. National security remains our highest budgetary \npriority. I urge my colleagues to support our national security and \nvote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to Senator Thurmond the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, how much time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 57 minutes 24 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. \nWellstone].\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nto be an original cosponsor of this amendment of the Senator from \nWisconsin and the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what this amendment does is simple and \nstraightforward, as the Senator from Wisconsin has so stated, and it \ndeals with one of the craziest things that I have seen happen since I \nhave served in the Senate. What we have here is a defense spending bill \nthat asks for $7 billion more than requested by the President and \nrequested by the Secretary of Defense and requested by the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is just crazy. In a time when we have \nenormous debt, in a time when we keep talking about the need to reduce \nbudget deficits, now we have a spending bill that asks for $7 billion \nmore than the Pentagon says it wants. It is nothing short of an effort \nby the Congress to jam down the throats of the Pentagon more spending \nthan the Pentagon says it needs for our national defense.\n  This is almost unprecedented. I think it is crazy for two other \nreasons: first, overall global context, and then, second, the here and \nnow of what is happening in this Congress at this moment in our \ncountry.\n  Overall global context. All of our potential enemies--broad \ndefinition--potential enemies, total expenditure $121 billion. Looking \nat our outlays, $271 billion. We spend more money in our budget than \nall of our potential enemies combined for defense. If you were to add \nNATO and other allies, then altogether the United States and its allies \nspend $522 billion compared to our total potential enemies of $121 \nbillion. And now we have an effort to add $7 billion more on to this \nspending bill than the Pentagon says it needs, in a time when we are \nsupposed to be saving money, in a time in which we are supposed to be \nfiscally responsible.\n  Then finally, Mr. President, let me juxtapose this amendment--\ncritical amendment by the Senators from Wisconsin and Iowa--with the \nfront page story in The Washington Post. ``House Votes Major Cuts in \nDomestic Programs.'' Mr. President, $9 billion. They eliminated the \nlow-income energy assistance program. That is a key issue in a cold \nweather State like Minnesota for the most vulnerable citizens, and job \ntraining programs and education programs.\n  This represents distorted priorities. On the one hand we have a \nbudget before us--we have a spending bill before us that asks for $7 \nbillion more than \n\n[[Page S 11396]]\nthe Pentagon needs. It fits conveniently with a lot of Members that sit \non the Appropriations Committee or Armed Services Committee--a lot of \nadd-on projects. On the other hand, we cut into programs that are so \nkey to opportunity and the future of our own country.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude this way. I said it the other day on \nthe floor. I think I am just going to start shouting it from the \nmountaintop on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am for a strong defense. \nBut there comes a point in time when we need to understand that part of \nthe real definition of our real national security is the security of \nour local communities where there are jobs, where there is health care, \nwhere people feel safe in their homes, where people feel safe in their \nneighborhoods, and when there is a commitment to education second to \nnone. So that every boy--and for that matter every girl--can grow up \ndreaming to be President of the United States. If we do not start \nunderstanding that that is a part of our national security, and we do \nnot get our priorities straight, Mr. President, I fear for the future \nof our country.\n  So I support this amendment on the grounds of some rigor, and some \ngood fiscal conservatism and cutting where we ought to cut and not \nbeing spendthrifts when we should not be. And I also support this \namendment on the basis of what I think are the sound priorities it \nreflects.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I would like to ask my \ncoauthor and colleague of this amendment, Senator Grassley from Iowa, \nhow many minutes he would like to take initially, 8 or 10?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley].\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I do not think Senator \nBrown was listed as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that he be \nlisted as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in some ways I wish we were having the \ndebate after Labor Day. I have been in Congress a lot of times in the \nmonth of August when we take our traditional recess where after that \nrecess there is a whole different environment than there is before we \ngo on that recess. It seems that we observe, because we are close to \nthe grassroots during that summer break, that there is some change of \nopinion in Congress that takes place during that period of time.\n  I believe that when we are home this August and we hear the refrain \nabout cutting too much from Medicare, and too big of a tax cut, and \nparticularly as the Democrats might lambaste us Republicans for giving \na tax cut to wealthy, then people start realizing everything is going \nto be cut, cut, cut, but not the defense budget, that it is going to be \nincreased $33 billion above even what the President suggested for the \nnext few years, we may come back here and decide--think again, do we \nreally need to increase the defense budget by $33 billion?\n  But the debate is today before the August recess. So we are going to \nhave the benefit of that and a reflection on that. But maybe sometime \nwhen there is an impasse between the White House and the Congress on \narriving at reconciliation, there may be an opportunity to rethink \nwhether or not defense ought to get a big increase when everything else \nis being cut.\n  So we may get another look at this, I say to my friend from \nWisconsin. And I hope we do. And maybe we are setting a record for us \nto do that. Because I do not think the side that wants to spend more \nmoney has really made a justification for it because it seems like all \nthe add-ons above what the President wants spent are generally \ndecisions made by Congress to spend more money here or there. That is \npretty piecemeal. It is not how you make a studied, responsible \ndecision for our national security.\n  Now, I would feel much better in a debate talking about more money \nfor defense if I could ever hear the other side say how much is enough. \nWhen is enough, enough? I never hear that. I never heard that it was \nenough when the President of the United States on his own volition \nsaid, ``We need to spend $23 billion more than we're spending this \nyear.'' But when the Commander in Chief said that, I did not argue with \nit. Nobody on the other side that is supporting the Kohl amendment \nargued with it. We accepted the Commander in Chief's judgment. But the \nCommander in Chief has not said he needs another $33 billion. But here \nwe are tossing in $33 billion of which the $7 billion in the Kohl \namendment is the first installment of that $33 billion. So, how much is \nenough? I never hear that. I do not think ever enough is enough.\n  Well, we rejected on May 23, 1995, a proposal to pump up the defense \nbudget. And of course that was on the 1996 budget resolution, 60 to 40. \nAnd 17 of those 60 were Republican votes. If they stick with us, we \nwill win again. Sixty Senators said, ``Enough is enough.'' What the \nCommander in Chief said. Sixty Senators voted to hold the defense \nspending at that requested by the President. This Senator from Iowa \nvoted for those lower defense numbers.\n  Well, when the budget resolution went to conference in the House, the \nextra money for the Pentagon that we are trying to subtract today was \napproved. The extra money is in the bill before us. I opposed it on May \n23. I opposed it in conference. And I oppose it now.\n  One of the Republican leaders in the other body said to me privately \nduring those conferences, ``Chuck, you know, I have got a request from \nour friends in the House for another $6 billion. We just have got to \nhave more money to satisfy the people on our side of the aisle.''\n  Is that not a nice way of deciding how much we ought to spend on \ndefense, because a mass of humanity from the floor of the other body \ngoes to one of the leaders and says, ``We have got to have $6 billion \nmore''?\n  That is why I am supporting my colleague from Wisconsin to subtract \nthe $7 billion. Our amendment will bring the defense budget back down \nto the amount approved by the Senate on May 23.\n  My amendment would eliminate waste at the Pentagon. Continuing waste \nat the Pentagon undermines the credibility of the higher defense \nnumbers in this bill. Waste at the Pentagon has been a concern of mine \nfrom the beginning of my Senate career. More than anything else, those \nspare parts horror stories of the early 1980's, the $750 pair of \npliers, the $7,000 coffee pots, caught my attention, crystallized my \nthinking on defense. Those spare part horror stories were a turning \npoint, I think not for me, but for so many people. Uncontrolled waste \noffends American people. It offends me. The spare parts horror stories \nconvinced me that President Reagan's plan during the 1980's to pump up \nthe defense budget was a colossal taxpayers' ripoff. The spare parts \nhorror stories undermine the credibility of the Reagan defense buildup.\n  They turned me into a reformer and drove me to watchdogging the \ndefense, digging into fraud, waste, and abuse. I do not happen to sit \non the Armed Services Committee. I am not on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I have to admit, I never served in the military. So as a \nconservative Republican, it is not easy for me to tangle with the \nPentagon. But common sense tells me this waste is not right, so I speak \nout, and you must keep digging.\n  That is what brings me to the floor today. For unexplained and \nunknown reasons, my Republican colleagues and some Democrats seem bound \nand determined to pump up the defense budget once again without ever \ntelling us when enough is enough.\n  Their plan is to pump up the defense budget, and it does not seem to \nmake sense. It defies understanding and defies reason. They want to \nstart back up the slippery slope we did in the eighties. It is a \nprescription for more Pentagon waste and mismanagement. It is like a \nscheme to extort money from the taxpayers.\n  The principal threat to our national security, as we knew it, is \ngone. The Soviet military threat has evaporated. My good friend from \nArizona just spoke about the worries around the world that we have to \nconsider, yes, but he mentioned the former Soviet Union. Russia could \nnot even win in Chechnya. If that does not prove the cold war is over, \nwhat does?\n  Once again, I want to remind my colleagues what happened 10 years \nago. \n\n[[Page S 11397]]\nBack on May 2, 1985, the Senate rejected President Reagan's plan to \nrapidly escalate defense spending, which justification was the cold \nwar.\n  President Reagan and his Secretary of Defense, Cap Weinberger, wanted \nto push the defense budget numbers from $255 billion in 1985 to $300 \nbillion in 1986, to $400 billion in 1987 to $500 billion in 1990. \nRemember, that was at the height of the cold war, the height of the \nSoviet military power. But regardless, a Republican Senate in 1985 and \na Republican President put the brakes on. The Senate threw cold water \non that plan to go up to double the defense budget in the 5-year plan. \nThe Soviet threat was a main drive then behind those big budget \nnumbers. It is gone now. So the defense numbers should be coming down, \nnot going up.\n  True, in real terms, the numbers have dropped slightly from the cold \nwar average. Maybe by 10 percent. But that is just a drop in the bucket \ncompared to the dramatic decrease in the threat. So why are my \nRepublican colleagues trying to force the numbers to move in the wrong \ndirection? As we learned back in the eighties, higher defense budgets \nin peacetime brings higher costs, brings more overhead and more waste, \nnot more defense.\n  So long as the defense leadership remains asleep at the switch, more \nmoney for more defense when there is no real threat, no real need is \nwaste by definition. The Senate is in the process of blessing waste, \nthe mindless and careless expenditure of money.\n  The Senate is about to give the Pentagon bureaucrats huge sums of \nextra money to spend for no known purpose, for no known return and no \nknown reason. The bureaucrats at the Pentagon are licking their chops \nat the prospects. The extra money will be used to buy weapons we do not \nneed, like the Seawolf submarine, the F-22 fighter, the B-2 bombers and \nComanche helicopters, all designed to defeat a threat that no longer \nexists.\n  To make matters worse, these cold war relics are all underpriced and \nunderfunded. They are underpriced and underfunded because their \noutrageous price tags cannot be justified in the absence of Soviet \nmilitary threat. So what we are really doing is shoveling money at the \ncontractors to pay for the hidden costs. All this extra money will not \nbuy more weapons and equipment; it is going to buy more costs. It is \nthat simple. History teaches us that the cost of the future years' \ndefense program almost always exceeds the money in the budget. That is \ncalled, over program.\n  DOD budget managers like to underestimate costs and overestimate the \namount of money Congress appropriates. Their appetite is always much \nbigger than their budgets. This kind of mismanagement causes the plan's \nreality mismatch. The General Accounting Office's ongoing historical \nreview of the 5-year defense procurement program shows that DOD \nconsistently pays more but gets less. On an average, 130 percent is \npaid by the defense for 80 percent of the program, and that is what the \ndata shows.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa who has always \nbeen one of the strongest watchdogs on defense spending. I appreciate \nhis work with me on this amendment.\n  At this time, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. \nBingaman].\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Kohl-Grassley \namendment to cut $7 billion from this bill and bring it back to the \nlevel that was requested by the President. I opposed this bill when it \nwas before the Armed Services Committee, in part because I did not \nsupport this additional funding. I did not feel that the committee had \nused the additional funds wisely, even if we decided to go ahead and \nadd the funds.\n  Taxpayers are demanding, as Senator Grassley just said, and others \nhave said over many months in the Senate, that Congress reduce the \nFederal deficit. This has been the first priority in Washington since \nthis Congress convened.\n  Mr. President, the current bonanza of weapons system add-ons that is \nreflected in this bill cannot be sustained in future year budgets. The \ncommittee report admits that. Senator Kohl quoted the committee report \nin its entirety on this issue in his statement. Let me just repeat one \nsentence from that report. It says:\n\n       The limited progress reflected in this bill cannot be \n     maintained unless future funding is increased.\n\n  Sixty Senators earlier this year voted not to increase defense \nspending above the President's budget during the next 7 years. A \nmajority of the Armed Services Committee voted for the increase, and \nthe committee is now straightforwardly telling the Senate that they \nhave constructed a bill inconsistent with the budget resolution's \nfunding levels in future years. They will be back for more funding in \norder to sustain the add-ons for various weapons systems and \nprocurement initiatives in this bill.\n  Mr. President, when they come back for that additional money, I \nstrongly doubt that the Congress is going to add funding in future \nyears for defense. Instead, we are going to face a choice between force \nstructure and new weapons systems. We cannot have both within the \nbudget resolution's outyear defense totals. The committee agrees that \nwe cannot have both.\n  Adequately paying and housing and training 1.45 million active duty \nservice members in future years will require greater expenditures for \npersonnel, military construction and operations and maintenance and \nwill further squeeze the amount we have to pay for these weapons \nsystems that we are starting to buy in this bill.\n  Defense experts from both parties have pointed to the train wreck in \ndefense budgets that we are going to face before the end of this \ndecade. Let me just point out we had a very good hearing in the \ncommittee where we talked about this excess force structure. Two \nexperts there, Dan Goure of the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, and Andrew Krepinevich of the Defense Budget Project, both \nmade the point that we had to reduce the force structure by somewhere \nbetween 200,000 and 400,000 personnel.\n  Richard Perle, who many people in this body know as a fairly strong \nsupporter of our defense effort, has recently stated:\n\n       We are spending too much on a force structure that is far \n     larger than we need.\n\n  Mr. President, I am tempted to offer an amendment directing the \nSecretary of Defense to prepare for an additional drawdown in the size \nof our force structure in light of the priority that is being accorded \nto weapons systems modernization in this bill, and also the fact that \nit is very unlikely that future defense budgets will have enough in it \nfor both.\n  I am not sure how I would vote on such an amendment, but I would be \nvery interested in seeing how those who put this bill together would \ncome down on that fundamental choice.\n  George Wilson, who has long studied the defense issues in this \ncountry, wrote a very good article in Navy Times on August 7. Let me \nread a little bit from that article.\n  In talking about the present activities in the defense budget, he \nsays:\n\n       It is going to end badly. The budget balancers in Congress \n     and the executive branch, sooner or later, will conclude that \n     the hawks on the House National Security and Senate Arms \n     Services Committees and elsewhere in Congress have made \n     themselves irrelevant.\n       No later than 1997, the budget balancers will slash \n     military programs right and left because, if for no other \n     reason, this will be the easiest place to cut, barring a big \n     war.\n       Before the chaos from that budget train wreck sets in, \n     there is the even more worrisome prospect that congressional \n     hawks will succeed in their current efforts to put the \n     country into a U-turn back toward the Cold War.\n\n  Mr. President, yesterday, we dealt with the ``U-turn back toward the \ncold war'' and, by two votes, decided to make that U-turn back toward \nthe cold war. Today, Senator Kohl and Senator Grassley are giving us a \nchance to ensure that the 1997 train wreck is not made worse by our \nspending binge this year.\n  I hope the Senate will support the position it took back in May that \nadditional funding is not needed. I hope we will not see headlines in \ntomorrow's Washington Post like we saw today: ``House Votes Major Cuts \nin Domestic Programs'' and ``Senate Backs Missile Defense Network.''\n  When we are slashing Medicare, slashing Head Start and education \nprograms, slashing Medicaid for the poor \n\n[[Page S 11398]]\nand disabled, slashing environmental protection programs, I, for one, \ncannot justify the extra $7 billion in this bill for defense.\n  I urge the Senate to support the Grassley-Kohl amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \nthoughtful and balanced comments. It is not unusual because that has \nbeen the hallmark of his service in the Senate for several years.\n  How much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 33 minutes, 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield 13 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia \n[Senator Byrd].\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Kohl. He has offered a challenging amendment. It is one \nwhich I fully support. It is a post-cold-war wake-up call, a reality \ncheck amendment.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Mr. Kohl and Mr. Grassley, challenges \nthe Senate to make a choice between significant and substantial deficit \nreduction, or supporting, on the other hand, a bow wave of \nunsustainable and unnecessary bloated defense spending--unnecessary, \nbloated defense spending. This amendment would cut the $7 billion added \nto the President's request for the Department of Defense in fiscal year \n1996.\n  How much is $7 billion? I was talking to John Glenn this morning. I \nsaid, ``You went around the world on February 20, 1963, in 89 \nminutes.'' He said, ``Another way of saying that is, we were traveling \nat the rate of 5 miles per second.'' That makes it pretty clear. How \nmuch is $7 billion? How long would it take to count $7 billion at the \nrate of $1 every minute? It would take 14,000 years. Seven billion \ndollars is a lot of money!\n  The Senate has voted resoundingly for the President's level of \nspending already in this session. By a 60-40 vote, this Senate endorsed \nthis level of spending when we took up the Senate-reported budget \nresolution.\n  I believe that the overall level of expenditures contained within the \nbill, although within the limit established by the conference report on \nthe budget resolution--which I did not vote for--is higher than needed \nfor an adequate defense posture. Additionally, the spending priorities \nestablished by the committee and numerous provisions of the bill put \nthe country on a militaristic path  reminiscent  of  the  Reagan  era, \ndespite the greatly reduced threat now faced by the United \nStates.\n  I was here during the Reagan era. I voted for the increased military \nspending that was recommended by Mr. Reagan. I voted for all of his \nexotic weapons. So I come with, I think, pretty good credentials, \nhaving been a supporter of the military.\n  This spending level, though, looks in the wrong direction. It looks \nto the past, not to the present and to the future.\n  This bill doubles the funding for national missile defense systems, \nthe core of the Reagan ``Star Wars'' program. It adds funds to anti-\nsatellite programs. The Congress rejected programs for new, expensive \nASAT (anti-satellite) systems during the cold war. It turns logic and \nspending on its head to support such questionable programs now that the \nRussian threat has collapsed. This just indulges in waste!\n  This bill also adds funds to increase or expand the purchases of \naircraft and ships that were not requested by the Department of \nDefense. These are in excess of what is necessary to support current \nmilitary posture and strategy.\n  One of the great unsaid truths of the recent defense budgets that are \nwritten by Congress is that they are, in large measure, jobs programs \nin disguise. Funds are provided to buy ships, to buy aircraft and \nmissiles that support hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the \nUnited States. These ships and planes and missiles may not be necessary \nto support a rational and reasonable defense strategy, but they keep \nproduction lines open and paychecks going home.\n  These programs are supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. Like \ncaged mice on an exercise wheel, we go around and around and around, \nbuying weapons we do not need so that hard-working people are not laid \noff their jobs. No one would argue that these jobs are not important or \nnot necessary to a strong economy. Yet, this Nation cannot seem to find \na way off this wheel, so we go around and around and around. We \ncontinue to support big defense budgets and questionable weapons \nprocurement plans. And in the process, we allow waste and abuse of the \ntaxpayer's dollar. We also risk crafting a defense budget that neglects \nour real defense needs. We focused instead on keeping jobs in various \nStates, not on creating the kind of defense strategy that the Nation \nreally needs.\n  This bill contains funds for ships that are not needed now, according \nto the Department of Defense. We could do much better to spend that \nmoney on becoming the strong, prosperous, and well-educated Nation that \nother nations seek to emulate and trade with, but not to go to war \nwith.\n  Yet, funds that would provide a transition--a way to move off the \nwheel of large defense budgets--were cut in this bill. Technology \nreinvestment program funds that were intended to move defense \ntechnologies into the civilian economy, where they could be maintained \nwithout big defense spending, have been cut. Programs to transition \nmilitary personnel into education and law enforcement are under fire. \nSmall programs that encourage military personnel to help their local \ncommunities and to help troubled youth have been cut. Funds to support \narms control verification, to help both make the United States and its \nformer enemies feel more confidence about peace, security, and \nstability in the future, have been cut, cut, cut.\n  These beginning efforts were the first steps in moving the United \nStates away from the role of the world's only remaining military \nsuperpower and into a nobler role as a world economic and education \nsuperpower. I am sorry to see us slip back, to move from away from \nAthens and towards Sparta, away from the education of the mind, to the \nmolding and shaping of weapons.\n  This amendment shares the deficit reduction pain that is already \nbeing felt in the shrinking accounts for energy, agriculture, \neducation, and law enforcement programs--in all of the programs funded \nin the domestic discretionary accounts that directly and daily benefit \nevery American citizen. Boy and girl, man and woman, black and white, \nall over this country.\n  This disparity between defense and nondefense spending over the next \n7 years is eye opening. Now, the people out there beyond the beltway \nhear about it, they hear about these cuts that are being made in \ndomestic programs. They read about the cuts that are being made in \ndomestic programs. On television they see reports of the cuts that are \nbeing made. But they have not yet felt the cuts. Wait until they feel \nthe pain. It is coming. It is coming.\n  Mr. President, I think of Croesus, the King of Lydia, who was \ndefeated by Cyrus at the battle of Thymbra, in the year 546 B.C. This \nwas Cyrus II, Cyrus the Great. In 559 B.C., he became king of Ashan. He \nruled all of Persia from 550 to 529 B.C.\n  Cyrus desired to add the kingdoms that were ruled by the Sythians, in \nsouthern Russia, to his vast territory. So he launched a great invasion \nagainst the Massagatae, whose ruler was a queen named Tomyris. Before \ncrossing into the territory of the Sythians, he called his generals and \nadvisors about him and asked their advice. He had kept Croesus on at \nhis court as an advisor, this great king who had been one of the \nrichest kings in history. Cyrus asked Croesus for his advise, and \nCroesus said this: ``There is a wheel on which the affairs of men \nrevolve, and its movement forbids the same man to be always \nfortunate.''\n  Mr. President, that same wheel turns for us. That wheel is going to \nturn in this country, and when the people begin to feel these cuts and \nsee the nation's infrastructure falling apart, the bridges falling \ndown, the railroads deteriorating, and the highways filling with \npotholes, when the people begin to feel the cuts in health and \neducation, the worm is going to turn. Mark my word, the wheel will \nturn!\n  The Department of Defense should not be growing fat on $70 billion in \nthe unneeded calories of defense pork--beginning with $7 billion this \nyear-- while education, law enforcement, transportation, and all other \ndomestic \n\n[[Page S 11399]]\ndiscretionary accounts are starved by $183 billion. I hope that my \ncolleagues will stand up to the challenge posed by the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, and vote to cut the fat from this bill in favor \nof cutting the deficit.\n  Piling another $7 billion on top of the defense budget, for an array \nof non-essential, nice-to-have new weapons makes a mockery of our \nrhetoric to balance the budget.\n  While raising defense spending, we are cutting nondefense \ndiscretionary to the bone--to the bone. I know. I meet in the \nappropriations subcommittee hearings, and in the subcommittees as they \nmark up the bills, and I sit in the full Committee on Appropriations \nwith Senator Hatfield, and you should hear the groans there among the \nMembers. As Senator Hatfield said today in markup, ``Just wait. If you \nthink it is bad now, wait until 1997.''\n  So just wait, Senators. You are going to hear from the people back \nhome. The worm is going to turn. And it is going to bite you! When it \nbites, you will feel the pain.\n  If Senators really mean it on deficit reduction, the most compelling \nevidence of how serious they are will be an aye vote on the Kohl \namendment. Start here. Start now.\n  We hear that advertisement on TV, ``Do it here; do it now.'' Well, \nSenators, now is the time. Do it here; do it now!\n  I take a back seat to no one when it comes to adequately preparing \nfor our national defense. That is our first priority in this country. \nIt ought to be.\n  As I have said, I voted for all the weapons during the Reagan era. \nYou name them, I voted for them. That time has passed. It has come and \ngone.\n  What we are seeing here is the coming of a shadow--a shadow--of the \nnondefense discretionary budget, in order to pay for more military \nweaponry that we do not need, and in order to pay for a $250 billion \ntax cut that is utter folly! Folly!\n  Yes, the worm will turn. I respect Senators who do not agree with me; \nI respect their viewpoint. But the American people are going to wake up \none morning and find that it ain't just like they have said it would \nbe. It is going to be different. When that worm turns, Senators are \ngoing to see a turning of the viewpoint in this Senate.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa for their leadership.

I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his powerful \nstatement, which lends tremendous credibility and impetus to this \namendment. I appreciate his coming to the floor and appreciate his \nspeaking in its behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me compliment the Senators from \nWisconsin and Iowa and others who have spoken so eloquently in support \nof this amendment.\n  If we were to skip ahead 100 years from today, we would not be able \nto tell very much about what we were about except historians could look \nback at this group of Americans and evaluate what we felt was important \nand our values, by what we decided to spend our resources on. They \ncould, in fact, look at the Federal budget and decide what we thought \nwas important for the future of this country.\n  It is sad to say that the priorities these days are priorities not to \ninvest in the human potential of the American people that will produce \nbig rewards and big dividends in the years ahead. I refer to priorities \nlike educating our children, like helping people up and out of poverty, \nlike providing the kind of health care that senior citizens need, and \nother things. Instead, as we find all too often, it is building things \nwe do not need with money we do not have. Never is that more evident \nthan in this bill.\n  I support a strong defense. I think it is important to our country's \nsecurity. But I am disturbed when I see legislation brought to this \nfloor in which $7 billion is added on and $4.7 billion just written in \nfor new procurement--most of it, I am sure, with inadequate hearings or \nvirtually no discussion. Instead, somebody just writes it in and says, \n``We know you are not asking us to buy this, Mr. or Mrs. Pentagon, but \nwe insist we do.''\n  Take page 125 of the report, $60 million is written in here, $60 \nmillion for blimps--blimps. It does not say blimps. It talks about \nlighter-than-air air ships. These folks are talking about writing in \n$60 million for the Hindenburg to defend against cruise missiles, I \nguess. Blimps.\n  I just got stuck on the subway, a little subway that runs 2 blocks \nbetween the Capitol and the Senate office building. I sat in that \nsubway because the subway would not go anymore, the doors would not \nopen. That is high tech. It is a brand new subway, as a matter of fact.\n  The weapons program acquisition in this bill, includes $4.7 billion \nof add-ons. I could go down the whole list of high-tech weapons. We \nhave a subway that does not work. All these things, I guess, are going \nto work even without full hearings. We are going to write them in and \nsay, ``We are going to build them, just have confidence.'' Among the \nweapons is a blimp.\n  I do not know, maybe if we hear Saddam Hussein has started a cavalry, \nthen perhaps we would go out and start buying horses. I just do not \nunderstand what people are thinking about. I do not have the foggiest \nnotion what they are thinking about. They say we should add $7 billion \nextra for defense which the Secretary of Defense says is unneeded?\n  And then every single day in every way they come to this floor and \nsay, ``We cannot afford to give a poor kid an entitlement to a hot \nlunch in the middle of the day at school. We just do not have the \nmoney. We can afford blimps. We cannot afford medical care for the \nelderly. We are sorry. Tighten your belt, Grandma and Grandpa. We \napologize. We do not have the money.'' But we can buy blimps, I guess.\n  We say to the middle-income families, ``We are sorry we are going to \nmake it more expensive to send your kids to school because we just \ncannot afford it.'' But we can go resurrect Star Wars. Star Schools are \nnot important. Star Wars is important. \n\n[[Page S 11400]]\n\n  I do not have the foggiest notion what is going through the heads of \npeople who think that this represents America's priorities. Kids are \nour future. Investment in human potential is our future.\n  Yes, defend our country. But how on earth can you say to the \nSecretary of Defense, when he says, ``Here is what is necessary to \ndefend our country,'' you do not know? And therefore you say instead, \n``By the way, take this $7 billion. We do not care whether you want it \nor not. It is jobs in our States. It represents weapons programs we \ninsist you build. It is ships and submarines, it is fighter planes that \nyou say you do not need, you do not want, but we insist you build \nthem.''\n  What on earth are people thinking of? Someone once said that 100 \nyears from now it will not matter much how big your house was or how \nmuch income you made. But the world might be a different place because \nyou were important in the life of a child.\n  I would like to hope that one of these days we get our priorities \nsufficiently straightened out so we can be important in the lives of \nchildren in this country. I hope we can stop saying to children and \nothers, ``We cannot afford the things you need,'' but then come to the \nfloor with a bill full of blimps, Star Wars and other nonsense, and \nshove down the throat of the Pentagon $7 billion they did not ask for \nto build things we do not need. This in a country where we are up to \nour neck in debt.\n  This sort of thing has to stop. This is the place to stop it. Right \nhere, right now, today, with this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Dorgan. It was an eloquent statement he \nmade. As usual, he is right on target.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of how those Senators voted in May when we fixed defense \nspending at $257 billion.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Sixty senators who voted to maintain defense spending at \n     $257.7 billion on May 23, 1995.\n\n                               NAYS (60)\n\n       Democrats (43 or 93%):\n       Akaka, Baucus, Biden, Bingaman, Boxer, Bradley, Breaux, \n     Bryan, Bumpers, Byrd, Conrad, Daschle, Dodd, Dorgan, Exon, \n     Feingold, Feinstein, Ford, Glenn, Graham, Harkin, Hollings, \n     Inouye, Johnston, Kennedy, Kerrey, Kerry, Kohl, Lautenberg, \n     Leahy, Levin, Mikulski, Moseley-Braun, Moynihan, Murray, \n     Pell, Pryor, Reid, Robb, Rockefeller, Sarbanes, Simon, and \n     Wellstone.\n       Republicans (17 or 31%):\n       Bond, Brown, D'Amato, DeWine, Domenici, Gorton, Grassley, \n     Gregg, Hatfield, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Lugar, Packwood, \n     Pressler, Roth, Simpson, and Specter.\n  Mr. KOHL. I will yield some time to the other side if they wish to \nspeak. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 9 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from South Carolina has 7 minutes and 56 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KOHL. Would the Senator like to use a few minutes on his side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the able Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I was not intending to come down and \nspeak on this, but after listening to the last couple of speeches, I \ndecided I had to speak up and comment.\n  I heard the Senator from North Dakota, back in my office, say that \nwhat we are doing here is neglecting to invest in human potential. If \nthere is anything we are doing here with the defense bill--and by \nprotecting our country--we are, in fact, doing just that. Look at all \nof the wars we fought and the people who have died and suffered and the \ncountry that has suffered so much through our wars. What human \npotential has been lost on the battlefield? You talk about human \npotential, look at the young men and women who have died. Look at that \npotential. That is gone. Educated, hard-working, bright people, \ntrained, who gave up their lives because, in many cases, we were not \nready. We did not invest in our armed services to do the fundamental \nmission that this Government was created for, to protect and defend \nthis country.\n  Do not talk to me about wasting human potential. This prevents the \nwaste of human potential more than any single thing we can do. To \nsuggest otherwise, that through some feel-good Government program, if \nwe push out more money to people to invest in their potential it is \ngoing to change the world, somehow refresh America--you know, that some \nnew Government social welfare program is going to save money, which is \nwhat the other side would have you believe we should invest in, is not \nthe answer.\n  The answer is, by creating peace and prosperity you will loose the \nhuman spirit and potential of every American and give them the \nopportunity, in a peaceful world, to reach their dreams. If you want \nhuman potential invested in, then you give a peaceful environment where \npeople do not have to worry about going to war but worry about going to \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to make a comment or observe that when Senator \nByrd talked about $7 billion, he talked about what an enormous sum of \nmoney that is. I do not know if he said it or not, but it is true that \nhere in Washington we spend $7 billion as if, sometimes, it were $7,000 \nor $700. That is because we are used to dealing with such large sums of \nmoney, so it is not acceptable but it is understandable. But it is not \nacceptable.\n  Mr. President, $7 billion--I come from the city of Milwaukee, State \nof Wisconsin, but I live in the city of Milwaukee. Milwaukee is a \nmiddle-size city in our country which has a host of problems which are \ncharacteristic of the problems in our country today: crime problems, \ndrug problems, problems with our educational systems, problems with our \ninfrastructure, problems with our inability to train people for jobs \nthat are availables. All the problems that exist in our society--to the \ndegree we are not satisfied with the conditions of life in America--\nexist in Milwaukee.\n  Mr. President, for $1 billion--not $7 billion--for $1 billion, which \nis an imaginative sum for the city I come from, but for $1 billion we \ncould change the face of Milwaukee for 50 years in all the areas I just \ndiscussed: The areas of crime, drugs, welfare, job training, education, \ninfrastructure, with just $1 billion out of the $7 billion that we are \ngoing to be spending on defense unnecessarily in this next year if we \ndo not defeat that proposal. And $264 billion is on the table. For $1 \nbillion we could change the face of Milwaukee for the next 50 years.\n  So we are talking about a lot of money that could be used to improve \nthe quality of life throughout our country without in any way taking \naway from the level of necessary defense which all of us support.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a minute, Mr. President, I \nnoted the Senator from Pennsylvania referred to my discussion.\n  I would observe for the benefit of the Senator from Pennsylvania that \nthe list of $4.7 billion in unrequested add-ons for weapons procurement \nin this bill includes the following: $650 million for 2 destroyers, \n$564 million for Navy fighters, $216 million for Navy EA-6 aircraft, \n$125 million for helicopters, and for the Senator's home State, a $33.9 \nmillion procurement add-on for Army improved recovery vehicles.\n  It occurs to me that, at least with procurement, especially of \nweapons programs, it hardly protects this country's security to buy \nsomething that the Secretary of Defense has indicated he does not need. \nWith respect to feel-good programs, I suspect that the add-ons in this \ndefense bill might make some feel good. But, frankly, when we are \npurchasing what the Secretary of Defense is not asking for, it does not \nin my judgment make the taxpayers feel good.\n  We can have a longer debate about what improves or what does not \nimprove this country's social programs or defense programs. I, too, \nbelieve we ought to have a strong defense. The point I was simply \nmaking is that purchasing what the Defense Department indicates it does \nnot need for America's military hardly improves this country's \nsecurity. But it certainly does add to the Federal budget deficit. We \n\n[[Page S 11401]]\nare up to our neck in debt, and we have a budget deficit problem. And \nit seems to me that all of us ought to be concerned about that when we \ntalk about what we purchase from whom and where and when.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I would like to yield 4 minutes to the fine Senator from Colorado, \nSenator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment for one very \nsimple straightforward reason.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield him 1 minute to express himself.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, as I read the numbers from our budget, rather than \nreduce the deficit for next year, we are in danger of increasing it. \nHopefully that is not the case. Hopefully my estimate is wrong. But it \nis quite clear that rather than showing significant deficit reduction \nnext year that the overall budget stands perilously close to showing an \nincrease. I think that is a more important factor that Members ought to \nweigh because part of the dropping interest rates in the international \nmarket and part of the confidence that is so important in retaining the \nvalue of the dollar and part of the momentum of our moving forward is \nbased on the belief that Congress is addressing this situation and it \nis addressing the problem.\n  I have great praise for the distinguished chairman of the committee \nand the distinguished ranking member who have worked hard to bring this \nbill to the floor, and to make sure the money is spent wisely.\n  Do we all agree with everything that has been done? Of course not. \nBut the overall important thing is I think for us to ask this question: \nWill the deficit drop next year? Will the American people be convinced \nwe are doing our part to bring it into line? And do we have at last \ncredibility?\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that our credibility and our ability to \ncontrol the deficit depends on us passing this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I know time is tight. There are other Members who wish \nto speak.\n  I yield whatever time remains.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Colorado for coming down to speak \nin behalf of this amendment. His words are appreciated.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I was under the impression the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado was on our side. I ask unanimous \nconsent that what he said be charged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from \nWisconsin, and thank him for offering this amendment today. He has been \na consistent vote for deficit reduction, and I compliment him for his \nleadership on this issue today.\n  If any one amendment can highlight the absolute absurdity of the \ndefense budget represented in this bill, this is it.\n  Just 3 months ago, during consideration of the budget resolution in \nthis Chamber, 60 of our colleagues--Democrats and Republicans \ntogether--voted against an amendment to increase spending above the \nPresident's request for $257 billion. The vote spoke to the \noverwhelming sentiment in this body that defense spending should not be \nincreased at precisely the time several arms control treaties are \ncoming into force, and we are drastically cutting valued and needed \ndomestic programs.\n  Nevertheless, the conference committee on the budget increased the \nallocation for defense spending by $7 billion. Does that mean that we \nare bound to spend the full $264.7 billion? Absolutely not. In fact, if \nwe are to be consistent with what we voted in May, and if we are going \nto be consistent with all the rhetoric about deficit reduction, we \nshould be authorizing, at most, the $257 billion we accepted just 3 \nmonths ago.\n  This amendment forces us to be faithful to the principles we voted \nfor earlier in the name of fiscal restraint. It would indeed be \nhypocritical to have supported that ceiling before, but now oppose the \nKohl amendment.\n  This $7 billion increase in this bill is especially distressing given \nwhere this money seems to be going. In December 1994, the President \nannounced that he would propose an additional $25 billion for the \ndefense budget over the next 5 years to cover the so-called readiness \ngap.\n  Indeed, the committee report expresses deep concern for the shortfall \nreadiness inherent in the administration's request, but then itself \ndoesn't fund it. In effect, it continues the same irresponsible \nbudgeting pattern it criticizes the administration for. So, we see that \nthe excess budget isn't helping what some were crying wolf about last \nyear.\n  Instead, it seems to be going largely to homestate projects. This \nbill authorizes over $5 billion in unrequested weapons programs. \nAccording to an analysis by Council for A Livable World, a staggering \n81 percent--or $4.1 billion--of that $5 billion plus goes to States \nwhose Members serve on either the Subcommittee on Defense \nAppropriations or the Armed Services Committee.\n  For instance, the Pentagon's request for F-18 jets was fully doubled \nby the committee, as was the request for Aegis destroyers. In one case, \nthe committee authorized a $1.3 billion ship for no strategic reason \nother than that it serves the hometown needs of its local \nrepresentatives.\n  These add-ons, in most cases, amount to robbery of the Federal \nTreasury. While I hardly endorse a philosophy that Congress should \nsimply rubber-stamp the Pentagon's budget request, I find it hard to \nfathom that the Pentagon underestimated its requirements by a whopping \n$5 billion. In my opinion, it didn't. Instead, the committee plussed up \nthe budget in order to please Senators who wanted to deliver money--any \nmoney--to their hometowns.\n  If we are going to balance the Federal budget, Mr. President, we are \nall going to have to sacrifice. That is what we all committed ourselves \nto during the balanced budget amendment debate. But when it comes to \nactually resisting the excesses, I see little self-restraint.\n  That is how we get a defense bill that is $7 billion above the level \nwe approved 3 months ago. With the Kohl amendment we have the \nopportunity to correct that problem, and recommit ourselves to deficit \nreduction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kohl amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Our time is tight here. I yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, one of the myths that we are dealing with here in the \ndebate on this defense bill is the fact that we are asking for more \nthan what the Pentagon requested. That is technically true. The $7 \nbillion is over and above the budget request. But member after member \nof the Joint Chiefs and others who testified before our committee \nindicated that they are complying with the number that was given to \nthem by the administration.\n  The Defense Department and the spokesmen for the Defense Department \nhave said time after time after time that there is more they need to \nmeet the requirements for defense and to meet the strategy but they are \nconstrained by budget numbers. Therefore, they are good soldiers, \nsalute, and provide us with a budget that comes within the top line of \nthe administration's budget level. But there has been testimony from \neveryone from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on down that we are on the \nrazor's edge of readiness, that we are in need of research and \ndevelopment into new technologies, that our modernization program is in \ndeep jeopardy, that we will not have the equipment necessary to meet \nthe threats of the next century.\n  General Shalikashvili has been quoted as saying so, the head of the \nMarine Corps has been quoted as saying so, and the Secretary of Defense \nhas intimated as such, and on and on it goes.\n  So this mantra that we are hearing from the other side that this is \nsome kind of a wasted expenditure that the Department of Defense has \nnot requested this, and does not need this, simply belies the truth, \nbelies the facts \n\n[[Page S 11402]]\nof what is necessary to provide an adequate defense for this country \nand what the Department of Defense really needs. They are just simply \ntaking orders from the boss upstairs.\n  Mr. President, I gave a long dissertation on this very subject \nearlier. I will just simply say ditto to what I said earlier in the \ninterest of time, and yield back the time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nrequired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered today by \nthe distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Early today you heard my statement relating to defense spending \nlevels. I have continually stated the need to ensure our national \nsecurity and that defense was underfunded. The budget resolution \nrecommends defense levels lower than I believe are necessary to \nmaintain the readiness of our forces. The Department of Defense has \ndone more than its share in the budget reduction efforts.\n  The proposed amendment reduces defense spending below the levels \nnecessary to maintain our forces. Defense spending as a percentage of \nGDP is at 1940 levels. Procurement accounts have been reduced 71 \npercent since 1985. Continually, the Joint Chiefs have testified that \nwe are on the brink of returning to the readiness levels of the 1970's \nand early 1980's.\n  Mr. President, our forces continue to have to deal with higher \noperating levels, while force structure continues to be reduced.\n  The Armed Services Committee worked very hard this year, within the \ndefense levels of the budget resolution, to reverse these negative \ntrends.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say that I was here when President \nReagan was President. President Carter had let our defenses go down. He \nwas a good man, but that is what happened. When President Reagan came \nin, he asked the Congress to increase defense. He said we needed it to \nprotect this country. Congress responded favorably and increased \ndefense.\n  Then the Soviets felt they had to increase theirs to compete with us, \nand in doing so, though, they could not increase their defense and also \ntake care of the local economy, and that is the reason the Soviet Union \nwent down the drain. It was President Reagan's action to increase our \ndefense which the Soviets could not meet, and the Soviet Union went \ndown the drain.\n  We must keep a strong defense. We are living in a dangerous age. We \nshould not think about cutting this $7 billion. We need it. Our \nsoldiers need this. They need better quarters. They need more training. \nWe need more ships and more planes, and we need more tanks. How are we \ngoing to get those? How are we going to defend the American people?\n  After all, the primary purpose of Government is to protect its \ncitizens. How can we better protect our citizens and keep a strong \ndefense? Under our Constitution, our people have more freedom, more \njustice, more opportunity and more hope than any people in all of \nhistory. How are we going to keep that if we go cutting defense down \nbelow what it ought to be?\n  I say to the people who do not favor, who do not understand defense, \nyou better study. You better study history. Why did we lose people in \nWorld War I, World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war? Simply \nbecause we were not prepared. If we had been prepared, we would not \nhave lost so many thousands of people. We must keep this country \nprepared.\n  I say to those in the Senate here today, the most important thing we \ncan do is to keep this country prepared.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, [Mr. \nLautenberg].\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, just very briefly, because we are out of time, but the \ntime that remains is the time during which we ought to think very \ncarefully about what we are doing.\n  When most people talk about budget cuts, they talk about the cuts \ncontained in programs, frankly, that are going to hurt middle- and \nlower-income Americans, cuts in taxes which will benefit the richest \namong us. But while most areas of spending have been cut, one has been \nincreased, and that is, of course, the defense bill, the defense bill \ndesigned to be $7 billion over that which was originally requested, $25 \nbillion more over the period of time, $25 billion that could go to fix \nMedicare or fund education or protect the environment or build needed \nhousing--$25 billion, a lot of money.\n  But apparently it was not enough. The House version of the budget \nresolution boosted defense spending by another $7 billion in fiscal \n1996, and this was such an overreaching case that even the Republicans \nin the Senate repudiated it when we considered our budget resolution. \nThe Senate rejected an amendment that raised defense spending to the \nHouse level, and yet during the conference the House number survived--\nno compromise by splitting the difference, just a total victory for the \nHouse position.\n  The amendment by Senators Kohl and Grassley would take us back to a \nsensible level.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will do that and reduce this bill by $7 \nbillion. The one thing that we do know is that if we are going to build \nstrength, strength that survives, strength that endures, you have to \nbuild it internally. No matter how much you build externally, you will \nnever be a safe, strong country unless you invest in the society \ndomestically.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Lautenberg for his outstanding comments. We \nappreciate them very much.\n  I would like to yield 1 minute to a senior member of the Armed \nServices Committee, the Senator from Nebraska, [Mr. Exon].\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. I will be supporting \nthe amendment that he has offered.\n  This is the same debate as with the amendment that was offered by \nmyself and my colleague, Senator Grassley, last year on a very similar \nmatter. There has been a lot of heated rhetoric today. As a hawk, I \nstand here and tell you that this Defense authorization bill is a fat \nturkey. But we have not really talked about the real fat. The $7 \nbillion is a drop in the bucket. If you will look at what is \ninaugurated in this bill, it is billions if not trillions in the \nfuture. I am fearful that unless the people who are supporting this \nagree to raise taxes, of all things, you are going do see a decline in \nthe quality of people who serve in the Armed Forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. It is going to defense contractors and not where it \nbelongs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Nebraska. We appreciate very \ndeeply his comments.\n  Before I speak, does the Senator from Iowa wish to wrap up for a \nminute?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have heard, Mr. President, about the needs being so \ngreat and that people in the Pentagon, regardless of what the President \nsays is our level of expenditure, regardless of what the Commander in \nChief says should be our level of expenditure, say we can always use \nmore. It reminds me of the days in the State legislature; the president \nof the university would come in and say the needs are so great----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And from that day I never heard anybody say when enough \nis enough.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And I never heard anybody say in this debate when \nenough is enough. We have reached the point where we have to start \nputting priorities first.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And our priorities ought to be where we get to a \nbalanced budget, meet the basic defense needs of our country and \nbalance the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if the \nSenator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  \n[[Page S 11403]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. Has the Senator from Wisconsin asked unanimous consent for \nan additional minute above the time that was allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COATS. And is it not correct the Senator has already had 1 hour \n15 minutes and this side has had 15 minutes? Is that the correct \nallocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I certainly want to accommodate anybody I can, but we \ngave the opposition 1\\1/2\\ hours. We only took 15 minutes. I object to \nany further extension of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The question is now on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are going to get time agreements on three \namendments here so that some of our colleagues who have obligations off \nthe Hill for the next hour and a half can do that and come back and \nhave the votes stacked at that time.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa, [Mr. Harkin], concerning burden sharing be considered under the \nfollowing time limits: 35 minutes; 25 minutes to Senator Harkin and 10 \nminutes to Senator Thurmond; and further, that no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The Levin amendment on the Guard-Reserve package I ask \nunanimous consent be considered under the following time limitation: 30 \nminutes; 20 minutes to the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, and 10 \nminutes to Senator Thurmond; and that no second-degree amendment be in \norder prior to a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. And Senator Glenn from Ohio wanted an hour, so I ask \nunanimous consent the amendment of the Senator from Ohio, Senator \nGlenn, concerning service academies be considered under the following \ntime limitation: 40 minutes, divided between Senator Glenn, who has 30 \nminutes, and then Senator Thurmond has 10 minutes; and no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. That would mean 1 hour 45 minutes, if all time is used. \nMost of it is apparently used around here. Members can plan their \nreturn if they are leaving.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to say that we plan to \nfinish this bill tonight. We have a lot of amendments yet, and as short \na time as we can take on each, we will get through quickly. We do plan \nto finish this bill tonight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2121\n\n(Purpose: To provide for reduction of U.S. military forces in Europe in \n    relationship to any deficiency in allied defense burdensharing)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] for himself, Mr. \n     Abraham, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 2121.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 371, after line 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1062. REDUCTION OF UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES IN \n                   EUROPE.\n\n       (a) End Strength Reductions for Military Personnel in \n     Europe.--Notwithstanding section 1002(c)(1) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note), but \n     subject to subsection (d), for each of fiscal years 1997 and \n     1998, the Secretary of Defense shall reduce the end strength \n     level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in \n     accordance with subsection (b).\n       (b) Reduction Formula.--\n       (1) Application of formula.--For each percentage point by \n     which, as of the end of a fiscal year, the allied \n     contribution level determined under paragraph (2) is less \n     than the allied contribution goal specified in subsection \n     (c), the Secretary of Defense shall reduce the end strength \n     level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations \n     of NATO by 1,000 for the next fiscal year. The reduction \n     shall be made from the end strength level in effect, pursuant \n     to section 1002(c)(1) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, 1985 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note), and subsection (a) of this \n     section (if applicable), for the fiscal year in which the \n     allied contribution level is less than the goal specified in \n     subsection (c).\n       (2) Determination of allied contribution level.--To \n     determine the allied contribution level with respect to a \n     fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense shall calculate the \n     aggregate amount of the incremental costs to the United \n     States of permanently stationing United States forces ashore \n     in European member nations of NATO, and the foreign labor \n     compensation costs of United States military installations in \n     European member nations of NATO, that are assumed during that \n     fiscal year by such nations, except that the Secretary may \n     consider only those cash and in-kind contributions by such \n     nations that replace expenditures that would otherwise be \n     made by the Secretary using funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available in defense appropriations Acts.\n       (c) Annual Allied Contribution Goals.--\n       (1) Goals.--In continuing efforts to enter into revised \n     host-nation agreements as described in the provisions of law \n     specified in paragraph (2), the President is urged to seek to \n     have European member nations of NATO assume an increased \n     share of the incremental costs to the United States of \n     permanently stationing United States forces \n\n[[Page S 11404]]\n     ashore in European member nations of NATO and the foreign labor \n     compensation costs of United States military installations in \n     those nations in accordance with the following timetable:\n       (A) By September 30, 1996, 37.5 percent of such costs \n     should be assumed by those nations.\n       (B) By September 30, 1997, 75.0 percent of such costs \n     should be assumed by those nations.\n       (2) Specified laws.--The provisions of law referred to in \n     paragraph (1) are--\n       (A) section 1301(e) of National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 106 Stat. 2545);\n       (B) section 1401(c) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 107 Stat. \n     1824); and\n       (C) section 1304 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337; 108 Stat. 2890),\n       (d) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Minimum end strength authority.--Notwithstanding \n     reductions required pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary \n     of Defense may maintain an end strength of at least 25,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to \n     permanent duty ashore in European member nations of NATO.\n       (2) Waiver authority.--The President may waive operation of \n     this section if the President declares an emergency. The \n     President shall immediately inform Congress of any such \n     waiver and the reasons for the waiver.\n       (e) Allocation of Force Reductions.--To the extent that \n     there is a reduction in end strength level for any of the \n     Armed Forces in European member nations of NATO in a fiscal \n     year pursuant to subsection (a), the reduction shall be used \n     to make a corresponding increase in the end strength levels \n     of members of each of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     assigned to permanent duty ashore in the United States or in \n     other nations (other than European member nations of NATO). \n     The Secretary of Defense shall allocate the increases in end \n     strength levels under this section.\n       (f) Incremental Costs Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``incremental costs'', with respect to \n     permanent stationing ashore of United States forces in \n     foreign nations, has the meaning given such term in section \n     1313(f) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337; 108 Stat. 2895).\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might I inquire as to the time? I understand we have 25 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment is about \nburdensharing, but more importantly, it is about fairness. It calls on \nour allies in Europe to share more of the financial burden of their own \ndefense.\n  This year, American taxpayers are being asked to pay $6.1 billion for \nnonpersonnel costs associated with keeping our troops in Europe. At a \ntime when we face large budget deficits, when we are considering large \nreductions in investments in our own people's education, health, \nhousing, transportation, everything else, we clearly can no longer \nafford to bear such a large part of the costs of our well-to-do allies' \ndefense.\n  Therefore, our amendment would require that our NATO allies pay for \n75 percent of the incremental costs. That is, the extra cost of our \nbasing our forces in Europe, and 75 percent of the cost of foreign \nemployees of U.S. forces based in Europe.\n  Mr. President, this is a very moderate amendment, a bipartisan \ncompromise. We are not demanding that they pay 100 percent of the \ncosts. We are not even asking them to bear 75 percent of all of the \ncosts as the other body did by a wide margin last month.\n  As I said, we are not demanding they pay 100 percent of the cost, or \neven 75 percent of all of the cost. That is what the other body did \nlast month. In an honest bipartisan effort to begin to make the \ndistribution of costs fairer, our amendment requires a two step \nincrease to 75 percent in payments by our allies of the added cost to \nU.S. taxpayers of keeping our troops overseas and paying foreign \nnationals who work on our bases overseas.\n  Under this amendment, our allies' share of these costs would rise to \n37.5 percent in 1997, 75 percent in 1998 and thereafter. Today, they \npay much less.\n  If our allies then do not cover the incremental costs, we would \nwithdraw 1,000 of our troops for every percentage point less than their \nrequired share, but leaving a minimum of 25,000 troops in Europe.\n  Mr. President, payments by European nations would come to about $6 \nbillion over the 4-year period from 1997 to the year 2000. If they met \nnone of their increased requirements and we had to bring our forces \nhome under this amendment, the American taxpayers would still save \n$1.45 billion over the same 4 years because it costs less to base them \nin the United States.\n  This is truly a modest amendment. As I said before, the House DOD \nauthorization bill includes a much broader provision. That passed by \n117 votes in the House, 273-156.\n  Now, the House version requires they pay 75 percent of the entire \nnonsalary costs of our troops. The House version also called for a \nreduction of U.S. forces equal to half of those soldiers who might \nreturn to the United States because of a failure of the Europeans to \npay a fair share of the costs.\n  Mr. President, if this was a pure business deal and the United States \nwas a police agency providing security for a client, then we would be \nclearly justified in charging our allies for all of the security \noperation and not just 75 percent of the incremental cost.\n  Mr. President, we are all justifiably proud of the role we played in \nEurope, both during World War II and after World War II.\n The Marshall plan stands as a monument to American generosity and the \nconcern for our fellow citizens around the world.\n\n  Now our European allies are doing much better--their standard of \nliving is equal to ours, in many cases better than ours. But we have \ncontinued to ask the American taxpayer to bear a disproportionately \nlarge part of the cost of Europe's defense. Europeans, frankly, and \nsimply, are not paying their fair share.\n  We Senators have different priorities but we agree on two things. We \nagree we must move toward a balanced budget, and we know it is going to \nbe a painful process with many programs being cut.\n  I know we will hear arguments about our need to maintain our forces \nin Europe. Those same arguments were made when we put strong \nrequirements on Japan. Japan is now paying close to a fair share \nbecause we took a strong position. Japan can afford it. So can the \nEuropeans.\n  Right now, in cash payments for United States forces, Germany paid a \nmere $61 million in 1995. Mr. President, $44 million of that was to pay \nfor the labor costs of their own nationals working on our bases.\n  They are really not paying much. The United Kingdom, Italy--the \nUnited Kingdom paid $40 million, Italy only paid $6 million \nrespectively, and again most of that went for the employment of their \nown people on our bases.\n  Let us compare that to what we did with Japan. After it became clear \nthat our troops might be withdrawn from Japan, Japan came across. Right \nnow, they are paying $918 million a year cash for the cost of their \npeople employed on our bases, and paying over $3 billion a year in \nother costs.\n  If we did not make them do it they would not do it, of course not.\n  Those ongoing payments is money the Armed Services Committee does not \nhave to authorize. It is money the Defense Subcommittee, on which I \nserve, does not have to appropriate. And, most important, it is money \nthe American taxpayers do not have to come up with.\n  As we move to reduce our expenditures and balance our budget, as we \nask college students to take cuts, our elderly, our children, is it not \ntime we ask our European friends to pay a little bit more for the \nburden of their own defense?\n  It is a very modest amendment, a very modest one. It will make it a \nlittle bit fairer.\n  Again, I summarize, Mr. President. Here is what this amendment does. \nIf it costs $1 to station a troop in the United States and it cost \n$1.20 to station that same troop in Europe, then our European allies \nwould only have to pay 75 percent of the 20 cents. They would only have \nto pay 15 cents of that incremental cost. Plus they would have to pay \n75 percent of the costs that we incur to employ their own people \nworking on our bases.\n  There are two parts of this. They would have to pay 75 percent of the \nincremental costs and they would have to pay 75 percent of what it \ncosts to employ their own people on our bases.\n  If they do not meet this requirement by October 1, 1996, they have to \npick up 37.5 percent; by October 1, 1997 they would have to pick up 75 \npercent. If they do not meet those two goals, then we would bring back \n1,000 troops for every percentage point under that--either under the \n37.5 percent, beginning \n\n[[Page S 11405]]\nnext year, or the 75 percent beginning in 1997.\n  But we would leave a bottom line level of 25,000 troops in Europe.\n  If that happens, if Europe pays under this very modest provision, if \nEurope pays, our taxpayers will receive $6 billion over those 4 years.\n  Mr. President, again I ask to have printed at this point in the \nRecord a letter from a Mr. Stephen Daggett, Specialist in National \nDefense, from the Congressional Research Service.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Congressional Research Service\n\n\n                                       The Library of Congress\n\n                                    Washington, DC August 3, 1995.\n     To: Hon. Tom Harkin, Attention: Richard Bender\n\n     From: Stephen Daggett, Specialist in National Defense, \n       Foreign Affairs and National Defense Division.\n\n     Subject: Potential savings from increased allied host nation \n       support contributions.\n\n       This is in response to your request for an estimate of \n     potential savings to the United States if European allies \n     agree to provide increased host nation support contributions. \n     Specifically you asked how much would be expected if the \n     allies were to pay increasing shares of (1) incremental costs \n     of U.S. forces deployed in Europe and (2) costs of foreign \n     national labor at U.S. facilities in Europe. Allied shares \n     would be 37.5% in FY 1997 and 75% each year thereafter.\n       It is possible to provide only a very rough estimate of \n     incremental costs of U.S. forces deployed in Europe. \n     According to testimony in the past by senior U.S. military \n     officials, the U.S. European Command has estimated that it is \n     10 to 20 percent more expensive to deploy U.S. troops in \n     Europe than in the continental United States. The most recent \n     Defense Department report on funding of U.S. forces overseas \n     projects direct costs of troops in Europe of $9.8 billion in \n     FY1997, including costs of military personnel, operation and \n     maintenance, family housing, and military construction. (For \n     a discussion of incremental costs and sources of data, see \n     ``Defense Budget: Alternative Measures of Costs of Military \n     Commitments Abroad,'' CRS Report 95-726 F, which is \n     attached.) These costs should remain stable in the future, \n     since the U.S. troop level in Europe will, under current \n     plans, stabilize at 100,000 from FY1997 on. If incremental \n     costs are assumed to be 15% of the total, then they would \n     amount to roughly $1.5 billion per year.

I yield the floor and I yield whatever time the Senator \nfrom Maine would require.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join in cosponsorship with Senator \nHarkin and Senator Abraham, from Michigan, on this very important \namendment. I think Senator Harkin certainly explained the framework of \nthis amendment and the reason for having such an important amendment to \nthis defense authorization.\n  It is a very simple, straightforward amendment. The question is why \ncan our allies not pay more for their own defense?\n  In response it has been argued in the past and rightfully so that the \nthreat against NATO was compelling and that our allies were spending \ntheir fair share by what they invested in their own forces. Moreover, \nwe recognized the ominous threat the allies were facing from the Warsaw \nPact nations as well as the threat from the Soviet Union. So, obviously \nit was not an appropriate time to discuss that we will fairly apportion \nthe cost of our troops in Europe. Certainly it was in our mutual \nsecurity interests. It certainly was not a time that we should say we \nare going to withdraw our forces from Europe unless they pay more for \nthe support. That certainly could have, potentially, split the alliance \nat the time when unity was needed to face down the Soviets.\n  NATO has been a very successful alliance, the most successful \nmilitary alliance in the history of the Western World. It was designed \nwith a single purpose, to confront and deter the Soviet military threat \nto Western Europe. We all recognize now that level of threat has been \ndramatically diminished with the collapse of the Soviet empire and the \ncollapse of the Berlin wall. We now have to decide, and NATO is \ndeciding, its future mission. But in the meantime we have a right to \nexpect more from our allies, in terms of providing for the support of \nour troops in Europe.\n  What we are talking about in this amendment is the aggregate of the \nincremental costs in the foreign labor costs associated with having \nAmerican troops in Europe. The total cost is estimated, in 1997 to be \n$9.8 billion. If, as has been estimated, the incremental costs are to \nbe anywhere from 10 to 20 percent we are talking about $1.5 billion.\n  We are asking our allies by the year 1998 to pay 75 percent of those \nincremental costs. So that is about $1.1 billion for each year \nthereafter.\n  Then of course the foreign labor costs. There are tremendous \ndisparities in terms of how much Japan pays for the costs of our troops \nto be stationed in that country, compared to our European allies. In \n1990, we reached an agreement with Japan that they now pay 77 percent \nof the costs of our troops there. They have stepped up their \ncontributions dramatically. They are assuming the burden. We had the \nsame arguments then that we are going to, I am sure, have now with \nrespect to opposition to this amendment. But Japan currently pays 77 \npercent, approximately $4.2 billion of the United States military \nnonpersonnel costs incurred by the stationing of our troops in Japan.\n  In contrast our European allies collectively contribute 24 percent of \nthe military costs. To put it another way, Japan pays the Department of \nDefense in direct contributions, $3.466 billion for 45,938 American \npersonnel stationed in Japan, or an average of $75,450 per American \nsoldier.\n  On the other hand, Europe pays the Department of Defense only $60 \nmillion direct contributions for the 116,190 American military \npersonnel stationed in European NATO nations, an average of just $516 \nper soldier.\n  So now we are asking the allies to assume a greater share of the \ncost, 37.5 percent by fiscal year 1997 and 75 percent for every year \nthereafter.\n  I think it is an important issue in a year in which we passed a \nbudget resolution that establishes a framework for a balanced budget by \nthe year 2002. It becomes all the more important to achieve those \nsavings, and in a year in which we are going to be considering a Base \nClosing Commission's report in which many communities will be seriously \nimpacted by the closure of bases all across this country, in which \nthese savings could help to ease that economic impact, in a year in \nwhich we are bringing down the cost of our own defense, we think it is \nimportant to be able to even provide some of these savings towards the \noperation and maintenance accounts of our Armed Forces.\n  There are many uses that we could provide with the savings that would \nbe \n\n[[Page S 11406]]\noffered by this requirement if our allies were to have more of our fair \nshare. Frankly, I think this amendment would give strength to the \nnegotiations between the United States and our allies with respect to \nincreasing their contribution to the support of our troops abroad.\n  I think this is only in the interest of the American taxpayer. The \nend of the cold war certainly should really result in savings for us as \nwe have drawn down and will continue. But it does provide for a \nthreshold of troops abroad. It also provides a waiver authority for the \nPresident in the event of an emergency.\n  But the fact of the matter is, I think we are talking about \nresponsibility. This amendment is not about isolationism. It is not \nabout withdrawing our troops from Europe. What it is about is shared \nresponsibility. And, frankly, I think our European allies have been \navoiding that responsibility.\n  So at a time when we are supposed to be tightening our belt because \nof the cuts we will have to make, in a time when community and local \nand State governments are going to face reduced contributions from the \nFederal Government, I think is only fair and reasonable to ask our \nEuropean allies to do the same.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nIowa in offering this amendment linking U.S. force levels in Europe to \nthe effort our European allies make in sharing the costs of NATO \ndefense. For too long we have applied a cold war rationale for the \nUnited States to carry the European burden, when the underlying, U.S. \nnational security interests no longer apply.\n  It costs us 10 to 20 percent more to station a soldier, sailor, \nmarine, or airman in Europe than it does to keep him in the United \nStates. Furthermore, we hire thousands of civilian foreign nationals to \nwork for the U.S. military forces in Europe, civilians who pay taxes to \nthe host government, spend their money in the host country, and never \nwill spend a cent in the United States. This amendment addresses this \ninequity by requiring our European allies to pay for a portion of the \ndefense we provide them.\n  I know the House recently passed a measure similar to this, but \nincluded all nonpersonnel costs incurred by U.S. forces in European \nNATO countries as the basis for their burdensharing calculations. My \nfellow sponsors and I do not believe this is fair, as it requires the \nEuropeans to incur obligations for costs we would incur if these same \ntroops were stationed in the United States. We have therefore changed \nthat language accordingly to incremental costs. But even then, \nsignificant revenues can be derived.\n  The Congressional Research Service has calculated U.S. incremental \ncost in Europe as roughly $1.5 billion per year. This would provide \napproximately $1.125 billion in host-nation support contributions per \nyear under this amendment's formula. Furthermore, having the Europeans \ncontribute 75 percent to the foreign national labor compensation costs \nincurred by the United States would yield an additional $575 million \nper year by the year 2000, for a total of host nation support \ncontribution of $1.7 billion per year.\n  This is not an unreasonable demand. We, for too long, have sought \nnegotiated settlement and passed sense-of-the-Congress resolutions that \nthe Europeans should pay more for the costs we incur in defending their \nlands. Last year's Defense Authorization Act called for the Europeans \nto ``assume an increased share of the nonpersonnel costs so that by \nSeptember 30, 1996, those nations have assumed 37.5 percent of such \ncosts.''\n  This goal is far onerous than that provided by this amendment. It is \nnot fair to expect our European allies to absorb a portion of all our \ntroop costs, but it is fair to expect them to absorb a portion of those \ncosts unique to operating in their countries, that is, incremental \ncosts. This amendment does just that, but also introduces another \ncritical source of host nation support.\n  In fiscal year 1995, Germany provides only 6 percent of the foreign \nnational labor compensation costs incurred by the United States in \nGermany, while the United Kingdom provides 9 percent and Italy provides \n16 percent. Japan, on the other hand, contributes 94 percent of the \nUnited States foreign national labor compensation costs.\n  When the United States agrees to keep 100,000 troops in Europe to \nprovide the Europeans with that added sense of security, it is \npreposterous to expect the United States to pick up over $725 million \nin wages. This is not another U.S. jobs program, and the Europeans \nshould not expect the United States to pick up this tab.\n  Now I know the administration is opposed to this measure because the \nEuropeans are supposedly suffering from particularly acute economic \nproblems, that they contribute to other programs such as the NATO \nInfrastructure Program, and that previous host nation support \nrequirement proposals would fall disproportionately on Germany and the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  I disagree strongly with this rationale. I challenge any of my \ncolleagues to stand up and claim the United States should bear the \nbrunt of a modern industrial economic state's economic well-being given \ntoday's strategic environment. Can anyone honestly state that it is our \nresponsibility to cover European defense costs because they suffer from \nhigh unemployment? That, Mr. President, is simply international \nwelfare.\n  But even if we accept that responsibility, we already are bearing \ndisproportionate costs of European defense. While the United States \nspends over 20 percent of its Federal budget on national defense, the \nEuropeans pay only 6.2 percent. Furthermore, while the United States \nexpends 4.4 percent of our gross domestic product on national defense, \nthe Europeans spend only 2.5 percent on national defense. This \ntranslates to the United States spending over 250 percent more per \ncapita on defense than the Europeans. I could understand the objections \nto this proposal if the Europeans were closer to matching us on defense \nspending. But the fact of the matter is, they aren't even close, and \nthat is just not fair.\n  What makes this amendment unique to previous requests for greater \nEuropean host nation support is its enforcement mechanism. This is not \na proposal aimed at further reducing our presence in Europe. Rather, it \nrecognizes the value the Europeans place upon the presence of U.S. \ntroops, and utilizes them to compel European burdensharing. There is no \nreason the Europeans cannot share in those costs unique to our troops \nliving and operating in their countries. This presence directly and \nmaterially contributes to the national security of our European allies \noutside of any NATO context. Considering the markedly lower level the \nEuropeans pay for their national defense, it would appear they need our \ntroops to provide a measure of their security. Therefore, European cost \nsharing can most efficiently be compelled by the threat of troop \npullouts.\n  We have passed sense-of-the-Senate resolutions over the last 15 years \nrequesting the administration seek greater European defense spending \nand host nation support, yet we still find ourselves bearing the lion's \nshare of NATO spending, even when accounting for relative size and \nnational security interests. I believe the Europeans have come to \ndepend on the United States to provide for their common defense, even \nwhen they are fully capable of providing at least a greater portion of \nthat defense themselves. It is not fair to the American taxpayer to \nforce their taxes to go to Europe in what is essentially international \nwelfare to strong, democratic, industrially advanced countries.\n  It is because of the savings provided by this amendment to the \ntaxpayer that Citizens Against Government Waste supports this \namendment. They understand this issue: it is not fair to the American \ntaxpayer to allow the Europeans a free ride on something as critical as \nnational defense, when they are fully capable of paying their fair \nshare. Furthermore, the only instrument that will work in forcing \nEuropean support is the threat of U.S. troop pullouts. Finally, the \nrequirements this amendment places on European support are fair, \nreasonable, and easily attainable. Therefore, Mr. President, I call on \nall my colleagues to stop this coddling of our European allies and tell \nthem to pay their fair share. Vote for the Harkin-Abraham-Snowe \namendment to rectify this inequity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S 11407]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nThis amendment has the potential of possibly reducing our current \n100,000 troops in the European theater by as much as 50 percent.\n  Mr. President, let us go immediately to what that impact would be in \nmany areas of that region.\n  United States troops are stationed in Europe not simply because of \nthe interests of NATO. But they are there in the need of other areas of \nthe world. That is often lost. They are there primarily with our allies \nin NATO for such missions as may be assigned to NATO, an example being, \nof course, that in the Bosnian region today. But they are there at the \ndirection of the President of the United States and with the \nconcurrence of the North American Council to operate in other areas of \nthat region when it is in the strategic interest of the United States. \nThey not only contribute to the stability of Europe but also allow us \nto more rapidly respond to contingencies in this region.\n  For example, in the recent past United States troops stationed in \nEurope have responded on a moment's notice to the Iraqi invasion of \nKuwait, the humanitarian crisis in Somalia and Rwanda, and a variety of \noperations in the former Yugoslavia. Currently, United States European-\nstationed troops are involved in Operation Provide Comfort to assist \nthe Kurds in northern Iraq, Operation Southern Watch to monitor Iraq \nactivities in southern Iraq, Operation Deny Flight to enforce the no-\nfly zone over Bosnia, Operation Able Sentry in Macedonia, and Operation \nSharp Guard in the Adriatic.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, while it may have some fiscal \nattractions on its face, would devastate absolutely, unequivocally, the \nability of this President and any future President to respond very \nquickly to many contingencies in that region. And, therefore, I \nvigorously oppose the amendment.\n  I would like to yield such time as my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia may require.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from Iowa a \ncouple of questions about the amendment and make sure I understand it.\n  As I understand the amendment, the Senator is setting up a formula \ntied to the incremental cost of stationing U.S. forces in NATO. Is that \nright? Is it confined to NATO countries?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. It is confined just to NATO countries.\n  Mr. NUNN. The incremental costs--how would the Senator from Iowa \ndefine incremental costs?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Over and above what it costs to base them here in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. NUNN. Do we have that kind of base cost anywhere? Has anybody \ncomputed incremental cost so that we know what that incremental cost is \nor how they compute the incremental cost?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am told it was defined in last year's DOD \nauthorization, that it would have to be computed by the Department of \nDefense.\n  Mr. NUNN. Would the Secretary of Defense decide the incremental cost \nwould be based on what it would cost to station those troops at Fort \nStewart, GA, or would he pick out Fort Lewis, WA, or would he pick out \nwhat it would cost to station them right outside New York City?\n  There is a variation in the cost all over the United States. If you \nstationed United States troops in Hawaii near an impacted area, or San \nDiego, the costs are much higher than someplace else in the United \nStates--I suspect higher than in Europe.\n  Does the Secretary of Defense have total discretion to determine \nunder this amendment what is an incremental cost and then determine \nwhere these troops would be stationed as a comparative basis in the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just respond that when I asked the CRS to do some \nstudies on this--I will read from it, and I will put it in the Record. \nI thank the Senator for yielding to me on this.\n\n       It is possible to provide a rough estimate of incremental \n     costs of U.S. forces in Europe. According to the testimony in \n     the past by senior U.S. military officials, the U.S.-European \n     command has estimated that it is 10 percent to 20 percent \n     more expensive to employ U.S. troops in Europe than in the \n     continental United States.\n\n  I can only assume they did this on some kind of weighted average \ndepending upon what the average was based on in the United States, and \nadd it all, take an average, then take a look at Europe and add it up. \nSome places in Europe are more expensive than others; add it up, add \nthe average, and add the average here, and that is the incremental \ncost.\n  Mr. NUNN. It would be based on the average cost and add the \ndifferential cost, and the baseline year would be what year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry. I believe that the baseline year would be \n1996.\n  Mr. NUNN. The first year of application would be what year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. 1997, October 1.\n  Mr. NUNN. Would that be a fiscal year calculation or calendar?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Fiscal year.\n  Mr. NUNN. The other question I would ask my friend from Iowa is, who \nis the responsible party to pay for this? Is this an alliance \nrequirement? Is this the whole NATO alliance that would be required to \npay this, or is this country by country?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It would be paid by countries. But the assessment is \nshared.\n  I might add for my friend from Georgia that we did the same thing in \nJapan. So we can model it basically after what we have done in Japan. \nWe have experience in this.\n  Mr. NUNN. Would, for instance, the Germans pay for all the \nincremental costs if you have United States forces stationed on the \nground in Germany?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Germany would pay. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. NUNN. I do not read the amendment that way. That is the reason I \nam asking. I read it as an alliance obligation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry, what was that question?\n  Mr. NUNN. I am trying to see whether this is an obligation of the \nalliance. For instance, we do not have any forces in Norway. We have \nvery few forces in the southern flank of Turkey. We now have forces in \nItaly related to Bosnia.\n  Let us just take that, for example. We have a number of Air Force \npersonnel in Italy related to the Bosnian situation. That is an \nalliance obligation. Italy allows units to use bases there for the \npurpose of flying those protective Bosnian flights, Deny Flight. Would \nItaly be responsible for reimbursing the United States for those \nincremental costs or would the whole NATO alliance be responsible?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think that is something that could be worked out \nbetween Italy and the other member countries in that case. If in fact \nother countries were basing their planes there, if it was a NATO \nrequirement that they use a base in Italy to fly out of, then I would \nthink that all countries in NATO would be responsible for that. This \ncan be, and would be negotiated.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Iowa, that is the way all the \nforces that we have in Europe are viewed by the NATO alliance. They are \nviewed as military personnel that really are there for an overall NATO \nmission.\n  So, for instance, the Germans would, I would imagine, be rather \nresentful at this stage of us saying that those troops that we have in \nGermany are all there to protect Germany.\n  There is no longer a threat to Germany as we have had in the past. \nOur forces are in Europe primarily, as the Senator from Virginia said, \nbecause we feel that having forward-based forces in Europe allows us to \nplay a worldwide role, not just a NATO role. For instance, the forces \nin Europe that we had there were forces that deployed to the Middle \nEast in Operation Desert Storm. Would we expect Israel to pay part of \nthe cost of forces in Europe or would we expect Saudi Arabia to pay \npart of the forces in Europe because those forces are likely to go \nthere in the event of conflict, or do we want Germany to pay the cost \nof those forces when they are not primarily at this stage to defend \nGermany; they are there basically for a much broader purpose?\n  That is the problem with this amendment, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could----\n  \n[[Page S 11408]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. We have shifted considerable in the mission of U.S. forces \nin Europe. It used to be they were there specifically to protect \ninvasion from the Warsaw Pact. Now they are there, about a third the \nnumber; we have drawn down from 300,000 to 100,000. So we have now \nsupposedly leveled off.\n  The amendment, as I understand it, could conceivably, if nobody was \nwilling to pay this cost, take our forces down to 25,000. Is that \nright?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the time within the control \nof the Senator from Virginia be increased by 3 minutes, with a \ncorresponding increase for the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 9 minutes and 29 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will just close out.\n  That is the last question. The 25,000 would be the level below which \nthe Senator would not go even if there was a total failure of them to \npay the burden share?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Precisely.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, if I could just close, I understand where \nthe Senators are coming from on this, and I agree with their overall \nthrust. I would like to see our allies pay more. But this amendment is \na cold war amendment that is based on the concept that we are defending \nevery country where our troops are stationed and that they should \ntherefore pay their part, when these countries are not going to view it \nthat way.\n  That may be the way the authors of this amendment view it, but that \nis not going to be the way the Germans view it or anyone else. If you \nask someone in Poland, for instance, what they think about the United \nStates drawing down our forces to 25,000, they will tell you in a \nminute that that is going to be destabilizing. But Poland is not going \nto be expected to pay any part of this. If you ask someone in \nCzechoslovakia should we draw down our forces, not from 300,000 to \n100,000, but on down to 25,000, they will tell you in a minute we do \nnot want you to draw down your forces. We feel they are needed there in \na critical way now for stability purposes. If you ask someone in \nHungary the same question, they will tell you the same answer.\n  So this is a much broader application. We are not there simply to \nprotect Germany. We are there because we are a world leader. We play a \nbig role in the world. If we want to see things destabilize, then we \ncan bring all our forces home and then watch the chaos take place as we \nwatch what is happening in Bosnia today.\n  Mr. President, I understand the motive of this amendment, but I urge \nits defeat. I think it needs to be thought through a lot more carefully \nthan is apparently the case at this point in time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 1 minute and 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President I would like to pose a question to our \ncolleagues to be joined by my distinguished partner here, the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  As we look at this amendment, this is an alliance-wide type of \namendment, is that correct?\n  Now, there are 16 nations in NATO of which we are one. So with the \nother 15, let us take, for example, that 10 or 12 of the other 15 reach \nthe requirements in the Senator's amendment but there were one or two \nthat failed. The way we read the amendment, it does not make any \ndifference if 14 of them met their requirements and one failed; the \namendment is triggered.\n  So I ask the question to my colleague, am I not correct in that \nanalysis?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might respond----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, the Senator has 9 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will answer on my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 5 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator asks a legitimate question. To a certain \nextent he is partially right. Let us say they came up with 60 percent, \nand they were only 15 percent short. Then other countries could come in \nand pay that 15 percent. It would be legitimate.\n  Now, again, the amendment envisions that in the case of what the \nSenator from Georgia said, where you had, let us say, Poland might be a \nlittle disturbed or some other country that was not perhaps in NATO or \nsomething, well, this allows room for negotiation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The amendment is designed to allow other countries to \nparticipate in payment of those costs, for example to assist Germany. \nThere is nothing complicated about this amendment. The Department of \nDefense issues a report on host nation support. I bet they could figure \nit out. It is not that complicated. We are asking them to pay a fair \nshare. They know what they pay; we know what they pay; and it is not \nenough. We are asking them just to pay more. It costs us $9.8 billion. \nThe U.S.-European Command determines that incremental costs are 10 to \n20 percent higher. We are saying we want you to pay eventually 75 \npercent of that 10 to 20 percent incremental cost. And it can be \ndetermined. It was laid out in last year's DOD bill.\n  I think there are tremendous disparities. We are looking at Japan \nthat pays 77 percent. Korea pays 62 percent. We cannot ask our allies \nbecause somehow it becomes a complicated formula to pay more than 24 \npercent collectively?\n  Yes, it is for the alliance, but they have an obligation to \ncontribute to the alliance as well. That is what this is all about.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. She makes a good point. We heard \nthese same arguments on Japan--heard the very same arguments. We heard \nit on Korea, too. It is not just for Japan; it is our interests all \nover Asia--China, North Korea. We heard the same arguments, that we \ncannot ask Japan to pay more. We did. They are paying more. They are \npaying more. And what is different?\n  Why, if that is the case with Japan, I might just ask rhetorically, \nwhy not ask the Philippines to pay? Why not ask Thailand, Malaysia? Why \nnot ask other of our friends in that area? Why do they not help Japan \npay the costs of our troops? Because obviously our troops there provide \nstability in that region, too.\n  Ms. SNOWE. If the Senator will further yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Look at the foreign national labor costs that are also \nincluded in this amendment, the aggregate and incremental amount of \nforeign national labor costs: Germany 6 percent; Great Britain 9 \npercent, and Japan pays 94 percent toward those additional costs.\n  It is obvious we have been able to figure it out with Japan and Korea \nfor that matter. But we are now saying in this amendment--it is very \nclear--the Secretary of Defense would calculate the aggregate amount of \nthe incremental costs to the United States of permanently stationing \nU.S. forces ashore in European member nations of NATO, and the foreign \nlabor costs also attributed to those forces.\n  I think it is only fair, and I just want to congratulate the Senator \nfor offering this amendment because I do think it is important and I \nthink, frankly, it is a post-cold-war amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Maine for the support and for \nbringing out these points and clearing it up.\n  You can ask this question or that question and make it seem like it \nis unworkable. But as I said, these are the same arguments made on \nJapan, same thing. You heard the same arguments. But when we came forth \nand got tough, as the Senator from Maine pointed out, they are paying \n94 percent of their national costs. We are not asking Europe to do the \nsame thing. We are not asking our allies to do the same thing in \nEurope.\n  What is the difference? Why have one standard for Japan and South \nKorea and another standard for Germany?\n\n[[Page S 11409]]\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Could I answer that question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 8 minutes, 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NUNN. Very briefly, the main reason is because the Japanese do \nnot have military forces. Our NATO allies do. The Japanese have a very \nsmall percentage of their budget. That ends up being a lot higher \npercentage of their money because of the GNP, but they did not spend \nmore than 1 percent. They did not have much of a security role anywhere \nelse in the world.\n  Our allies like Britain, France, and even now Germany, they are \nmoving and helping in Bosnia and are contributing military forces. So \nit has always been thought that the Japanese ought to do more in the \noffset area since they are doing less in the military area relative to \ntheir GNP.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does the same hold true for South Korea? South Korea has \na big defense force. They put a lot of their money in defense forces. \nYet they pay more for our troops stationed there than Germany pays for \nour troops in Germany.\n  Mr. NUNN. This is what the post-cold-war environment is all about. \nDuring the cold war I sponsored burden-sharing amendments. At the same \ntime we were protecting Germany, which was divided, there was a large \nWarsaw Pact force.\n  Germany had a threat. The Koreans have that kind of threat. They have \n9,000 artillery tubes looking down their throats in Seoul. So we are \ndirectly protecting our national security.\n  What I am saying to you is that our forces in Germany today are not \nthere directly and primarily to protect Germany. They are there for \nstability in all of Europe and the Middle East. So it has shifted \nfundamentally.\n  I think there may be a way to get at this, but I do not think this \namendment does it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would grant, the Senator is right. I think we are all \nright on this issue. I do not argue with the need for our stability.\n  What I would say is, does anyone really believe that if we only asked \nthem to pay 75 percent of the incremental costs or to pay 75 percent \nfor their own people that we employ on their bases, that somehow they \nare going to kick us out of the country? Give me a break. They love \nhaving our troops there. We have all been to those bases in Germany and \nItaly and Great Britain. They love having those troops there.\n  It provides employment and it provides stability. It provides all the \nthings that the Senator said. All we are saying, the Senator from Maine \nand I are saying, is it is time for them to pick up a little bit more \nof the cost of basing those. I might point out the House of \nRepresentatives passed by a margin of 117 votes something a lot \nstronger than this, a lot stronger. And that was done bipartisan; \nRepublicans and Democrats voted for it.\n  I thought we ought to be a little more modest and only have the \nincremental portion, whatever it costs to base them overseas, have them \npick that up rather than the full cost, which is what they did in the \nHouse. So, again, this is a very modest amendment.\n  Again, I want to respond on the Saudi Arabia thing. If Saudi Arabia \nneeds our troops to come in there, then it seems to me that our NATO \nallies should go to Saudi Arabia and say, ``Look, you are using the \nU.S. troops. You ought to help us pay a little bit for keeping our \ntroops in Italy and places like that.''\n  Hey, come on. We are all friends. We do negotiate. These things are \nnegotiable. It seems to me Germany or Italy or Great Britain could \nnegotiate with Saudi Arabia and say, ``Look, we are sending troops down \nthere or planes down there based in Italy. You ought to help us pay a \nlittle bit.'' You could negotiate that out. I do not think this is \nrocket science, to tell you the truth. I think it is very simple and \nvery straightforward.\n  Mr. President, might I ask how much more time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes, 48 seconds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would yield to the Senator from Maine whatever time she \nneeds.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to make another point with respect to who \nspends what on defense. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \ntestified before the Foreign Relations Committee recently and happened \nto indicate that Japan has the third largest defense budget--Japan. \nThey certainly have made a great effort toward spending on defense.\n  Our European allies spent 2.5 percent of GDP whereas the United \nStates spent 4.4 percent of GDP. So they are not making as great an \neffort, obviously. We make 2\\1/2\\ to 3 times greater effort toward \ndefense than our European allies do collectively.\n  So I do not think that there is any excuse in this regard. We are \nonly talking, if you just analyze what we are talking about--as a \nresult, the bottom line of this amendment is $1.1 billion per year, \ndepending on those incremental costs. If you assume 15 percent as an \naverage--$9.8 billion--you are talking about $1.1 billion a year. That \nis not asking too much, given what we are asking everybody else in \nAmerica to do with respect the Federal cutbacks.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Again, I just, in closing on our side, want to say, Mr. President, \nthis is a very modest amendment. It is not complicated. It is \nstraightforward. I believe it could be worked out.\n  I again would say with emphasis, we heard the same arguments for \nJapan and South Korea. We have interests around the world. I believe \nour European allies, with the standard of living and income they have, \nought to pay a little bit more. That is all we are asking for.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Nebraska asks if he might be allowed, \nunder a unanimous-consent request, 1 minute to oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, he is such a great friend of mine, if I \nhave any time remaining I will yield the time to him off my own time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will get 1 minute from Senator \nHarkin's time.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Iowa.\n  Ordinarily I would be in strong support of the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa and by the Senator from Maine. But this is not an \nordinary time. I wonder what is going through the minds of our European \nallies today when they hear what is going on day after day after day on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. We zapped them good on a bipartisan vote \nthat I thought was a horrible mistake on Bosnia. Now, as we zap them \nagain at this particular time, after zapping them and leaving them \nadrift on a vote that we took a few moments ago with regard to nuclear \ntesting, they might give up.\n  I simply say at another time this might be a good amendment. I urge a \nvote against this because I think we have hit our allies all we dare \nhit them at this particular juncture.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I might remind my friend that I supported his amendment \non nuclear testing.\n  Mr. EXON. You did not on Bosnia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a very modest amendment, very modest indeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been expired----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is my understanding that under the \ntime agreement, this vote will be stacked with other votes at a \nsubsequent time this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, Madam President, the time agreement, as I \nunderstand it, now turns to the amendment from the Senator from \nMichigan Mr. [Levin]. And that will be under the control of the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. Thurmond. \n\n[[Page S 11410]]\n\n  Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Is a motion to table in order for the Harkin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion will be in order at the time of the \nvote.\n  Mr. WARNER. At the time of the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I wonder if I might, without taking any \ntime from anybody--I will take it out of my leader time--propound a \nunanimous-consent request that has been cleared on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized for that \npurpose.\n\n\n                 Unanimous-Consent Agreement--H.R. 2020\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m. on \nSaturday, the Senate begin consideration of H.R. 2020, Treasury, Postal \nService appropriations bill, and at that time the pending business be \nthe committee amendment on page 76, line 10 through page 76 line 17, \nand that it be limited to the following: 3 hours to be equally divided \nbetween Senators Nickles and Mikulski, or their designees; and that \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto vote on or relation to the committee amendment, and that no \namendments be in order during the pendency of the committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2122\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize funds for procurement of equipment for the \nreserve components according to their highest modernization priorities)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2122.\n       At the end of section 105, insert the following:\n  The reserve components shall choose the equipment to be procured with \nthe funds authorized herein according to their highest modernization \npriorities.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment which is now pending is \naimed at allowing the Guard to make some choices in terms of their \nmodernization equipment according to their highest modernization \npriorities.\n  This has been the effort in the committee for the last 3 years. It \nhas been a struggle, and we might as well acknowledge openly just how \ndifficult a struggle this is.\n  But for the last 3 years, starting in the 1993, 1994, and 1995 \nbudgets, we have not divided the Guard and Reserve modernization funds, \nwhich we have been able to find, into specific line items in our \nreport.\n  We had totals for each of the forces and allowed them to allocate \naccording to their highest modernization needs.\n  The reason we do it this way is because we avoid the obvious desire \nof each of us to fight for our own home States, giving serious \nadvantage to the members of the committee over nonmembers of the \ncommittee.\n  When we get a budget in February, we have a number of months to look \nat the line items in that budget. We have about 4 months to look at \neach of the items that is proposed that we buy when it comes to the \nactive duty forces.\n  But then near the end of the process, near the end of our \ndeliberation, when it comes to the Guard and Reserve package, as we \ncall it, when we try to find some funds for modernization for the Guard \nand Reserve, we face an issue every year: Do we specify by line \nspecific items, which each of us might want for our own home State \nGuards, or do we allow the Guard and the Reserves to use some \ndiscretion as to what their highest modernization needs are.\n  Year after year for the last 3 years, we have fought in the Armed \nServices Committee to keep this generic, to avoid some of the back-home \nstresses and strains, but to keep it generic when it comes to the Guard \nand Reserve, because we have not had the time to make the kind of \ndecisions relative to line-by-line items as we do for the active duty \nforces. That is the difference. For active duty forces, we have 4 \nmonths to look at the budget request, and we make decisions line by \nline.\n  When it comes to the Guard and Reserve, I do not know that we had \nmore than 4 hours this year to look at a proposed allocation that the \nmajority delivered to us of $770 million. That is not the way to \nbudget. It is wrong for the country, it is wrong for the security of \nthis Nation to be making line-by-line decisions for the Guard based on \nless than 1 day's consideration. I think literally it was about 16 \nhours before a package of $700 million line by line was presented to \nthe full committee and the time that the decision was made on it. It is \njust not the way to budget. It is wrong.\n  A number of years ago, we did it this way. But for the last 3 years, \nwe have resisted this temptation. For the last 3 years, we have been \ngeneric in the Senate, and we have gone to conference. At conference, \nwe always face the House which always does it line by line, and we \nfight it out in conference.\n  The good Government way to do this is to do it generically, because \nwe do not have the adequate time to do it line by line and do it right \nand to try to avoid some of the back-home temptations, which we all \nhave, to provide the specific items for our own back-home units in the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  Merit-based review is what the budget process should be all about, as \nmuch merit as we possibly can build into a budget process. We ought to \ninsist upon it. When it comes to this Guard package, because it is done \nat the last minute, we do not know how much money we are going to have, \nand we have not gone over the line-by-line, specific items. It is \nsimply not in the Nation's security interest to divide it up the way \nthis committee report does.\n  We see those line by line on page 92 and 93 of the committee report. \nI am sure there is a good case to be made for every one of them. The \nGuard and Reserve, as a matter of fact, give us about $12 billion in \nfunding requirements each year. So I am sure a case can be made for \nevery one of these. But that is not the way that process worked. The \ncase was not made for any of these. No opportunity existed in any real \nsense for the committee to take a look at these line by line, go over \nthem the way we did all the other lines for 4 months and decide what is \nthe highest priority for this Nation, what is the highest priority for \nthese Reserve and Guard units.\n  The Appropriations Committee did it generically, and I want to pay \nthem the compliment because they did do it generically. We ought to do \nthe same thing in the authorization bill as closely as we can come. And \nthis language which I have sent to the desk in this amendment is aimed \nat making the point in a straightforward way and not a technical way.\n  During the consideration of this bill, Senator Coats sponsored an \namendment which had a lot of merit and is in this bill. It is section \n1007 of the bill, and it says the Secretary of Defense in next year's \nbill should focus on and separately identify funding for Guard and \nReserve equipment.\n  So what we are doing for next year's bill is telling the Secretary of \nDefense we want the Secretary to focus on specific items for Guard and \nReserve and to separately identify funding for us so we can consider \nthat as part of our budget deliberation. But that is next year. The \nquestion we face is whether to do it this year, and we should do it.\n  Next year, the Department of Defense as a whole is going to be able \nto focus more closely on requirements and the relative urgency for \nfilling those requirements. If we allow them some leeway and keep this \ngeneric, they will be able to do it this year.\n  Under the Coats language, which applies to next year, there is going \nto be an opportunity for the Department of Defense to exercise some \njudgment in sending us some recommendations\n unless we keep this generic this year. If we do this line by line, \nspecifically, they are not going to have that opportunity which is so \nessential this year relative to the application of $777 million.\n\n  So I think just good Government requires us to give some discretion \nto the Department of Defense to allow them to apply some judgment--not \nto specify line items, but to keep this generic, as the Appropriations \nCommittee has \n\n[[Page S 11411]]\ndone, to allow the Department of Defense to apply some talent and some \npriorities to this money. That has been the pattern in the last 3 \nyears.\n  Again, it is not easy to hold this. We had a very close vote in \ncommittee on this. I think the first vote we had on it was lost by a \ntie vote. The second vote, I think, we won by one vote. The third vote \nwe lost by, I believe, one vote. So this was a very close vote in \ncommittee.\n  I hope that the full Senate will do what the Appropriations Committee \ndid and what the Armed Services Committee did in the last 3 years, \nwhich is to keep this as generic as possible, so that the Department of \nDefense and the Guard and Reserve can apply their best talent to giving \nus the highest modernization priorities which may include many of \nthese, but not necessarily, and instead will reflect more the needs of \nthe Guard and Reserve and less the back-home wish list of each of our \nGuard and Reserve units.\n  Madam President, I do not know if I have any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 7 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I yield myself such time as may be \nrequired.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Michigan offered this same \namendment during our committee markup. It was opposed by all Republican \nmembers of our committee and defeated. The proponents of this amendment \nsuggest it would be more appropriate to provide a sum of money to the \nDepartment of Defense and let them decide how to spend the money.\n  Madam President, I disagree. It is the job of the Congress to decide \nhow these funds should be used. The Senate will make decisions on this \ndefense authorization bill affecting the spending of $265 billion. I do \nnot know why we should treat the funds we added for the National Guard \nand Reserve equipment differently from the rest of the bill.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Michigan has indicated that we \nshould let the National Guard and Reserve components decide how to \nspend this money. He knows full well that if we simply turn a sum of \nmoney over to the Department of Defense, then the bureaucrats in the \nDepartment of Defense will decide how the money will be spent.\n  It is interesting to note, Madam President, that those who now want \nthe Pentagon to decide these matters began to adopt this position about \nthe same time they gained control of the administration in 1993.\n  Madam President, it is our responsibility and our duty to make the \nhard decisions on how we should spend defense dollars, including those \ndollars we add to the budget for specific purposes. The funds we added \nfor the National Guard and Reserve equipment package certainly fit this \ncategory. I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this package for \nthe National Guard and Reserve components and vote to sustain the \nposition of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to join with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, in opposing this \namendment. I bring to the floor the text of our colleague's letter just \nreceived from the National Guard Association. The first paragraph says:\n\n       Dear Senator Thurmond, the National Guard Association urges \n     your support for the equipment designated for the Army and \n     Air National Guard in the Armed Services Committee report, S. \n     1026, the National Defense Act for Fiscal 1994.\n\n  This is a critical part.\n\n       We believe it is essential for the Congress to specifically \n     identify equipment for the modernization of the National \n     Guard. Such action has been very effective in the past and \n     has allowed the National Guard to remain a full partner in \n     the total defense forces of our Nation.\n\n  As the chairman said, what is the distinction between the active and \nthe Guard and Reserve? It is a total force concept to be utilized and \nemployed that way. National Guard forces, particularly the Air Reserve \nGuard forces, are on duty all over the world flying missions, many of \nthem into Bosnia during the course of this debate. Therefore, I \nstrongly urge that we resist this amendment.\n  I would like to ask my distinguished colleague a question. Given the \nlimited time, I hope he will answer it on his time. I would pass to my \ncolleague last year's report--it is for fiscal year 1993. If the \nSenator looks at the highlights, the yellow markings, there are a \nnumber of items. At the time, my distinguished colleague was in the \nmajority, and a number of items were specifically cited. I point out \nthe C-20 and the 130. Does the Senator see those highlighted, \nespecially for his benefit?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think we receded to the House on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Whatever. The package was put together such that those \nitems were put in there with great specificity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I answer the question by saying that, in 1993, the Senate \nArmed Services Committee did this generically before the election of \nBill Clinton, may I say. In 1994, we did this generically before the \nelection of Bill Clinton, may I say.\n  So the chairman's reference to the Democratic President is not \nappropriate. We have done this now for 3 years generically. The first 2 \nyears were prior to the Democratic administration. We did it \ngenerically in the Armed Services Committee. Yes, in conference there \nwas give and take. It was not our choice. It was the House's choice.\n  Mr. FORD. Would somebody give me 60 seconds?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, as Cochairman of the National Guard \nAssociation, I would like to make one point. Last year, we had $25 \nmillion in there for upgrade of the helicopters in the National Guard. \nIt all went into one pot.\n  Did we get to the upgrade of the helicopters? Of course not. They \ntried to use it some other way. And we were crying for help to make our \nhelicopters better and bring them up to speed for training. The 123d in \nLouisville, KY, is all over the world, with C-130H's. We had to fight \nto get them and make them specific in the budget. And now they have a \ntop grade in the whole United States.\n  That is the National Guard for you. That is the support and the teeth \nand tail that we talk about in the military. So let us not cut the \nNational Guard. There are 66 Senators in this Chamber that are members \nof the National Guard caucus. I just hope they listen and vote to \nsupport the National Guard.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could pose a question to my colleague. From his many \nyears of experience, has it not been the case that the National Guard \npackage has been left to the Congress, year after year, to decide?\n  Mr. COATS. Exactly.\n  Mr. WARNER. And it has been up to the Congress to ensure that be \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, how much time is available on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Thurmond has 3 minutes 48 seconds; \nSenator Levin has 9 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. I appreciate the Senator from Virginia reading the letter \nand the comments of the Senator from Kentucky relative to the National \nGuard Association and their interests.\n  The Senator from Virginia commented on paragraph 1 of that letter. \nLet me add to that by reading a little bit of paragraph 2:\n\n       We are opposed to efforts which would merely identify a \n     lump sum dollar amount for equipment which would then be \n     referred to the Department of Defense for distribution. In \n     almost every instance the work of the members of the \n     committee and the committee staff has resulted in \n     identification of the highest priority unfunded equipment \n     requirements for the National Guard.\n\n  Now, we are sensitive to the question raised by the Senator from \nMichigan. That is why we have incorporated in the bill a request by the \ncommittee that the Department furnish us with a report indicating that \nthey will begin to make determinations, as they submit to us on \nrequests for the regular appropriations for the active Army and \nmilitary, that they will begin to do this for the National Guard.\n  For years, the practice has been to defer this decision to Congress. \nWe will have that report before the Senate. We \n\n[[Page S 11412]]\ncan evaluate that next year. We ask for it to be submitted with the \nbudget, so we will do it concurrently with the budget and evaluate it \nat that time.\n  Do not forfeit now the practice that has been undertaken by the \nCongress on the request of the Guard and in support by the Guard, \nallowing DOD to defer that decision to us. We have made that decision \nfor this year, and we will evaluate the report next year and be back \nwith a recommendation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I must say that my dear colleague from \nIndiana is a little modest, because that was the provision that the \nSenator fashioned and submitted for the Armed Services Committee. We \naccepted it at the very time we debated this issue and decided, as a \nmajority of the committee, we would take the action which is \nincorporated in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Madam President, I think the Guard and Reserve are among \nour highest priorities. I am pleased we have a package here for the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  As I understand the Levin amendment--and I want the Senator to \nclarify this if I am wrong--I note the letter from the National Guard \nAssociation says, ``We are opposed to efforts which would merely \nidentify a lump sum dollar amount for equipment which would be referred \nto the Department of Defense for distribution.'' That is the letter I \nbelieve the Senator from Virginia read from.\n  It is my understanding the Levin amendment does not do what that \nletter was opposed to. The Levin amendment leaves it up to the Reserve \nand Guard components to make that choice individually--Army National \nGuard, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force \nReserve, and Marine Corps Reserve.\n  This amendment leaves it to the Department of Defense to make the \nchoice, and if they want the items we have selected here, they could \nselect every one of those.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is exactly right. The language of the \namendment is very clear. The Reserve component shall make that choice. \nAnd they can, of course, choose the exact items that are in the \ncommittee report, should they choose.\n  There is no reduction in funds for the Government Reserve.\n  Mr. NUNN. My position is I support the package in the bill, but I \nbelieve the Levin amendment is a better way to go about it because, we \ndo not go over these line items as we do in the regular budget.\n  The regular budget comes over, the Department of Defense has scrubbed \nit, the Office of Management and Budget has looked at it closely, each \nof the military services has basically come up with their request. It \nis gone over and over and over. The Guard and Reserve package is \nneeded, in my view, but it is an add-on package. We do not have the \nkind of attention paid to these items that we do in the regular budget, \nbecause they are add-on items.\n  I think in 1993, 1994, and 1995 that this is what we did. It would be \nbetter to leave this up to the Reserve components for their priority. I \nbelieve the Levin amendment makes sense. No one should misunderstand \nthis amendment. It does not cut the Guard and Reserve. It leaves it up \nto them to make that determination.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 37 seconds on your side; 6 minutes \n47 seconds on the side of Senator Levin.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask if my colleague from Michigan would answer, on his \ntime, the following question. This amendment reads as follows: The \nReserve component shall choose the equipment to be procured with the \nfunds authorized here, and according to the highest modernization \npriorities.\n  That means some Reserve officer will make the decision. The Secretary \nof Defense has no input. The Secretary of the Army has no input. The \nCongress, then, is denied any specific input other than the allocation \nof funds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment says that the Army National Guard shall make \nthat allocation, the Air National Guard shall make the allocation, the \nArmy Reserve shall make the allocation. The head of each of those \ncomponents has a commander. And so forth. We do not cut the money. We \ndo not change the money. What we do is take the amount of money which \nis allocated in section 105. We leave it exactly as it is. Army \nNational Guard, $209,400,000, Air National Guard, $137,000,000. We do \nnot touch any of that money.\n  What the committee has done for the first time in 4 years, in its \ncommittee report, is to allocate line by line within each of those \nitems.\n  The problem is exactly as the Senator from Georgia said. We had less \nthan 1 day to even see what the allocation of the majority was here. We \nhave avoided that temptation for the last 3 years. We ought to resist \nthat temptation here.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is right. The Guard is a critically needed \nfunction. This money is essential for the Guard. I have asked General \nBaca, the Chief of the National Guard, point blank, whether or not he \nsupports leaving this generic, or whether or not he wants the specific \nline-by-line item in this committee report. He said he wants it \ngeneric. I asked him in my office.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 38 seconds on your side; 1 minute \n37 seconds on the side of the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time of \nthe quorum not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time to the Senator from Nebraska?\n  Mr. EXON. Are we under controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the order before the \nSenate at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Levin amendment No. 2122 is the order.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is that there is about a minute left \nunder Senator Thurmond and 3 minutes under the Senator from Michigan. \nIs that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, will the manager yield for a question?\n  We have colleagues who are anticipating a vote at 8:10, and \nunderstandably that schedule slipped somewhat. In order to advise \ncolleagues what they might anticipate, is there any up-to-date estimate \non when the three votes might be held?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, we will proceed with the next amendment \nin a matter of just a few minutes. Then three votes would be stacked.\n  Mr. DOLE. How much time do you have on the Glenn amendment?\n  I guess about 8:40.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At 8:40 the votes would start.\n  I thank the leader. I thank the managers.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I thank my friend from North Dakota. That is exactly what I was \ntrying to find out. Now we have moved from 8:10 to 8:40. It has been a \nvery convenient arrangement that the Senate has been going through \ntrying to meet accommodations. I will try to be back at about 8:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we yield back the remainder on our side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point in time it is the intention of the manager \non this side to have a motion to table at the appropriate time, which I \nunderstand would be at the time of the vote.\n\n[[Page S 11413]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Under the unanimous-consent request, we now proceed to \nthe next amendment. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. So the Chair will lay aside this pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nLevin amendment, and the motion to table will be in order at a later \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman be added as \na cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Levin amendment is set aside so that \nSenator Glenn may offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2123\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I rise today to offer this amendment \nbecause I am concerned about the provision in this year's bill that \nwould reduce the active duty service obligations for service academy \ngraduates from 6 to 5 years.\n  To do this reduction from 6 to 5 years without waiting for the study \nthat is required in this legislation, we are asking for information but \nwe are taking action before we even get the information to know what \nthe impact would be from the experts at the Pentagon and at the service \nacademies.\n  In other words, it is sort of like ready, fire, aim, instead of the \nother way around.\n  The current policy, which requires graduates to serve 6 years, has \nbeen in effect since 1991 and it ensures that American taxpayers \nreceive a high return on investment for the other three-quarters of a \nbillion dollars.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. Without losing the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. The time has not started running until you offer the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has not sent his \namendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DOLE. The time starts to run for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is fine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2123\n\n(Purpose: To strike out the reduction in the period of obligated active \n          duty service of graduates of the service academies)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2123.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 154, strike out line 4 and all that \n     follows through page 155, line 20, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 502. REVIEW OF PERIOD OF OBLIGATION ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE \n                   FOR GRADUATES OF SERVICE ACADEMIES.\n\n       Not later than April 1, 1996, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall--\n       (1) review the effects that each of various periods of \n     obligated active duty service for graduates of the United \n     States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, and \n     the United States Air Force Academy would have on the number \n     and quality of the eligible and qualified applicants seeking \n     appointment to such academies; and\n       (2) submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate \n     and the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives a report on the Secretary's findings together \n     with any recommended legislation regarding the minimum \n     periods of obligated active duty service for graduates of the \n     United States Military Academy, the United States Naval \n     Academy, and the United States Air Force Academy.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, as I say, I rise because of concern about \nreducing the active duty service obligation for service academy \ngraduates from 6 to 5 years without even waiting for the required study \nwhich asks for information on which we could make a good judgment on \nwhether this is a wise move or not.\n  The current policy, which requires graduates to serve 6 years, has \nbeen in effect since 1991, and it ensures that American taxpayers \nreceive a high return on investment for the over three-quarters of $1 \nbillion that we spend each year on our service academies. The actual \nfigure is about $754 million. It also ensures that the candidates we \nselect to attend the academies are committed to at least considering a \ncareer as a military professional.\n  The change in this year's defense authorization bill is particularly \ntroubling in two areas. First, it changes successful legislation that \nhas still attracted top-notch students to the academies. At the same \ntime, it directs the Department of Defense to submit a report that \nprovides the information needed to make such a change. In essence, what \nwe are doing, as I said, is shooting first and asking questions later. \nWe are making the change. Then we are seeing if we can get the data to \nback it up, and that is the wrong way to make intelligent decisions.\n  I received a letter the other day requesting my support of the 5-year \nobligation. One of the sentences in this letter said, and I quote, ``My \nguess is that with a 5-year obligation the Navy can attract more \ncandidates from which to select.'' The key word here, Madam President, \nis ``guess.'' We should not change legislation because we guess it will \ndo something.\n  My amendment corrects that. All it does is say that we want the \ninformation, that we will continue the present policy until we get the \nstudy next year. It provides us with the time and information we need \nto make an educated decision. It provides us with the opportunity to \nmake this decision without guessing.\n  A second problem I have with the language in this bill is that this \nchange will open up the possibility of attacks from groups that would \nlike to see us totally shut down the service academies. I am not the \nonly one who shares this concern. A former State Department official \nwho recently stepped down from the Naval Academy's Board of Visitors \nsaid in a December 1994 Baltimore Sun article that he was also against \nlowering the service requirement because that move, he said, would \nraise the possibility of budget cuts at the Academy by those who \nbelieve we do not need academies, he said that ROTC, OCS, et cetera, \ncan just as well provide our officer corps. In other words, if we get \nless use of the product, that is, newly commissioned officers, then why \ngo to all the expense of spending all this money, a quarter of a \nmillion that we spend on each Academy graduate.\n  Madam President, I have long been a supporter of the academies. I am \nnot an Academy graduate myself, but I am a big supporter of it. I think \nthey are necessary for our military. Although we allocate a great deal \nof money to run these institutions, I think it is worth it. We spend up \nto $272,000 per student. But I still believe this money is wisely \nspent.\n  Some of our very greatest military leaders, including Eisenhower, \nMacArthur, Marshall, Patton, Bradley, Halsey, Nimitz, and Vandegrift \nare academy graduates. And if I believed for one moment there was a \nproblem attracting qualified candidates to these schools, I would be \nthe very first in line to make the changes necessary to keep the seats \nat the service academies filled.\n  The fact is we have not had a problem finding qualified applicants to \nfill these seats. We have highly qualified applicants, more than we can \npossibly take care of. Over 30,000 young people in our country, as I \nunderstand it, apply to the academies each year, and we do not have any \nproblem getting good people to fill the seats at the academies.\n  In fact, an article in the September 16, 1994 edition of the Record \naddresses the kind of students applying to the academies, and it says \nthe academies ``offer high-quality education as well as demanding \ntraining in military skills and discipline.'' A further quote, ``The \nbig problem is getting in with so many well-qualified students \napplying.''\n  Madam President, there has been a decline in applications. I repeat \nthat. There has been a decline in the number of applications to the \nservice academies. But that decline has not impacted the quality of \nyoung people attending these schools. There are quite a lot of other \nreasons why the numbers have gone down, and I will address that. But we \nhave not in any way changed the high standards required to \n\n[[Page S 11414]]\nqualify for admittance to these fine institutions, institutions that \nrank with the best schools in our country, indeed, the best schools in \nthe world.\n  Also, the decline in the number of high school students seeking an \nacademy education started dropping in 1988, 3 years before the 6-year \nobligation was put into effect. I repeat that. The decline in the \nnumber of high school students seeking an academy education started \ndropping in 1988, 3 years before the 6-year obligation was put into \neffect.\n  Now, I think there are a lot of reasons why we have experienced a \ndrop in applicants but none of them have anything to do with service \nobligation, or very, very little. I think a headline from an article \nabout the Air Force Academy points to one of the real problems on why \nwe are having problems attracting young people to the Academies. It \nsays, ``Applications to Academy Plummet 50 Percent. Job security blamed \nfor big decline since record high in 1988.''\n  No doubt about it, there has been a decline in interest in the youth \nof America in serving in the military. And over the last few years we \nhave dramatically reduced enlisted and officer positions in the \nmilitary, and a lot of young people are getting very concerned about \njob security in a military career. Indeed, I would point out they have \na right to be concerned because during an Armed Services hearing this \nyear, witnesses told us that we should continue our reduction in \nmilitary force structure.\n  We started at a peak of about 2.1 million active duty military \npersonnel in this country. We are down below 1.6, around 1.5 million \nright now, and we will go down to the current goal of 1.425 million, or \nthey are proposing even going down to 1.2 or 1.1 million.\n  Taking this into account, who on Earth would want to start a career \nin an organization that is laying off people after only 6 or 8 years of \nservice? In fact, a West Point spokesman, Maj. Jay Ebbeson, said in a \nDecember 1994 article, ``Kids may want to have a stable employer. We \njust don't think the 6 years is the reason.''\n  A major reason the Air Force Academy is having problems is that there \nhas been a decline in opportunities to go to flight school. We have \nfewer cockpits to fill. Most of the applicants to the Air Force Academy \nwant to fly airplanes, and when they hear that only 25 percent of the \ngraduates will go on to flight training, it is not surprising they \ndecline in favor of attending a civilian institution.\n  Another reason for declining applicants is that academy graduates are \nno longer guaranteed active duty commissions. After graduation, they \nreceive a Reserve commission and then they are forced to compete for a \nlimited number of active duty positions with other officers coming out \nof the OCS and the ROTC programs.\n  Madam President, the argument that bothers me the most on why we \nshould reduce service obligations is the one that says this policy is \nhaving a severe impact on the academies' ability to recruit high-\nquality applicants, the kind that are required if our academies are to \nbe successful in division 1A football and basketball.\n  Lest we think this is just a spurious thing I am tossing in here, \nback in 1990 when we were thinking about passing this legislation, I \nhad visits from alumnae associations of the academies, and 2 out of 3 \nof those academies made a major point of this, that what I was doing \nwas interfering with the ability to recruit high-quality athletes for \nthe academies when I was advocating putting the required service up to \n6 years.\n  Well, I do not think there is any question that the 6-year obligation \nhas had a severe impact on the competitiveness of our academy teams in \nthis conference. As the excerpts from the New York Times and the \nBaltimore Sun on a chart that I have in the office--that I was going to \nbring over and did not bring--point out, the 6-year obligation has been \na major factor for football players who may have aspirations for \nturning pro, or basketball players.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Recruiting quality athletes has been a problem, been such \na problem that even some groups are saying, ``We should waive the \nimmediate military service obligation for academy athletes, should they \nbe good enough to play pro football following graduation.''\n  Well, I do not buy those arguments. We have a purpose for the \nacademy. We know what that purpose is. It is not to be a minor league \nfor the professional sports. Maybe it is time we take another look at \nhaving the academies compete in NCAA Division I-AA. I am not proposing \nthat. But I think when something like the professional sports thing and \nhow we have a problem getting people in because they are not willing to \ncome in if they have to make a commitment after they get this education \nand over a quarter of a million dollars spent for their education, they \nwill not come because it will interfere with their pro career, maybe we \nhave to look at a different direction. However, Mr. President, I do not \nthink you will find a lot of support out there for going to Division I-\nAA because college football is a big money business.\n  In a June 1994 report from the Defense Advisory Committee On Service \nAcademy Athletic Programs, the committee advised the academies not to \nmove to a lower division so as to not lose income from big time \nfootball.\n  There is no wonder there are organizations out there pushing for a \nreduction in active duty obligation. Mr. President, although I believe \ncollegiate sports play an important part in development of our \ncountry's future leaders, I have to agree with Adm. Charles Larson, \nSuperintendent at the Naval Academy, who said in a Washington Post \ninterview:\n\n       Having a winning football program is something which all of \n     us here at the Naval Academy would like to see. However, it \n     is important to stress that our primary mission is not to \n     produce professional athletes. Our mission is to produce \n     future Navy and Marine Corps officers with character, men and \n     women who are prepared to lead and show the highest standards \n     of honesty, integrity, and professional performance.\n\n  In other words, what we are looking for, Mr. President, are those \nyoung men and women that have stars in their eyes, men and women of all \nraces and religions who are ready to make a sacrifice for their \ncountry, young, hard-charging individuals who really do not make the \nfact whether it is 6 or 8 or 10 years the major factor in their service \nto this country. They are people that want to lead, people that want to \ncommand aircraft squadrons, infantry battalions, people that want to \nfollow in the footsteps of some of our country's greatest leaders.\n  We do not want those who are looking just for a free meal ticket, \nthose who are looking for a way to beat the system, those who basically \nare asking, what can my country do for me? We need people who want to \ndo something for their country. These people, Mr. President, are not so \ncompletely focused on service requirements that the 5 or 6 makes a \ndifference. Yet we get much more for the taxpayers' money with that \nextra requirement that is the law now.\n  I get over 1,300 applications each year from high school students in \nOhio who would give their eyeteeth to attend one of the service \nacademies. I can tell you these are not average students. They are \ncream of the crop. Most of them, if not selected for an academy seat, \nstill end up attending some of the very finest civilian schools in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I want to read an editorial from the January 10, 1995, \nedition of the Baltimore Sun, titled ``An Honor and a Bargain,'' that \nso accurately reflects my feelings on this issue.\n\n       We fail to understand the hand-wringing at the U.S. Naval \n     Academy over the drop in admission applications.\n       According to a recent Sun article by reporter Tom Bowman, \n     the academy's advisory Board of Visitors is asking President \n     Clinton to reconsider a new requirement that increases the \n     time academy graduates must serve in the military. The board \n     says that by increasing the graduates's service obligation \n     from five years to six, some of the nation's top students \n     have been discouraged from applying to the academy.\n       ``These kids don't think past a burger Saturday night,'' \n     the dean of admissions said. And they're saying, ``That's 10 \n     years of my life.''\n       Maybe some students are turned off by the six-year \n     requirement, but we believe it should remain.\n       It costs $250,000 to educate a young person in a service \n     academy. The additional year was added to a graduate's \n     military service to give taxpayers more for their money. In \n     today's political climate, it would be unreasonable to demand \n     less.\n       But there are other reasons to leave it intact. The decline \n     in applications to the academy is no tragedy because it comes \n     at a time \n\n[[Page S 11415]]\n     when the institution is under orders to pare the size of the brigade \n     anyway. Academy enrollment, which reached a high of 4,500 \n     midshipmen in 1990, must be reduced to 4,000 by next \n     September, Currently, a little more than 4,100 midshipmen \n     attend the academy.\n       Understandably, U.S. Naval Academy officials want to \n     attract this country's best and brightest young people, but \n     an applicant's dedication to a military career ought to be \n     considered as well as scholastic performance.\n       Maybe some young people cannot look beyond the next \n     weekend, but they are not the kind of people we want to be \n     training as military officers. For a young person aspiring to \n     a military career, a service academy education is a \n     tremendous bargain as well as an honor.\n       A midshipman at Annapolis receives one of the best \n     educations in the country--for free. Even more important, a \n     graduate from the Naval Academy is guaranteed a good job as a \n     military officer. That is more than many young people can \n     expect upon graduation from traditional college and \n     universities these days.\n       We don't think it is too much to ask that Naval Academy \n     graduates serve their country for six years in return.\n\n  Mr. President, I am sure that a few of my fellow Senators will argue \nthat the length of obligated service for academy graduates should be \nreduced from 6 to 5 years. However, I believe there is more than enough \nevidence that justifies why we should not change our current policy.\n  No matter how you feel about this issue, I strongly believe we would \nbe making a terrible mistake to change this legislation before we \nreceive the analytical data required to make an informed decision on \nthis matter.\n  The informative data that we are asking for, the analytical data, is \nrequired to be reported to us by next April by the legislation that we \nare working on here now. So it is not a matter of whether we are going \nto do it or not. They are going to make that analytical data available \nto us after having studied this matter as to what the impact would be. \nYet we are proposing here to go ahead and make a change before we get \nthe information. So delaying a change in this policy until we receive \nthis report makes sense and is the right thing to do.\n  That is all we require with this amendment, is just say the present \n6-year requirement will not be changed back until we get the \ninformation. And then next year, depending on what that information \nsays, I may be leading the charge next year to reduce this requirement \nmyself. But I want to make that recommendation only on the basis of the \nbest information. If the study recommends that length of active duty \nservice should be 6 years, which I believe it will, then next year we \nwould be forced to revisit the issue and reverse our position for the \nthird time in 6 years. And that makes no sense.\n  It seems to me that while we reinvent Government and ask Government \npersonnel to do more with less, we cannot tell the military academies \nto do less with more. So I hope all our colleagues will support this \namendment to maintain the current active duty obligation that has \nattracted top-notch candidates to our service academies.\n  Now, Mr. President, I know that one of things we brought up will be \nin a letter from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force \nManagement Policy. I sent a letter over there asking their response--I \nrequested their views on this matter of section 502 of S. 1026. And \nthey wrote back and responded that--it is in response to my letter. \nThey say:\n\n       Enactment of this section would reduce the active duty \n     obligation . . . of service academy graduates from six to \n     five years.''\n\n  They said:\n\n       As you are aware, the current six year [active duty service \n     obligation] was mandated by the National Defense \n     Authorization Act . . . for Fiscal Year 1990, and will be \n     effective for graduates of the academies beginning in 1996.\n       Neither this mandate--\n\n  This is a key section.\n\n       Neither this mandate nor section 502 of S. 1206 were \n     requested by DOD.\n\n  Very correct.\n  And then the next paragraph says:\n\n       A review of the history of the mandate to change the ADSO--\n\n  The active duty service obligation.\n\n     reveals that the Department appealed the Senate provision \n     during the Senate-House conference.\n\n  In other words, they had doubts about it at the time, and during the \nconference between the House and the Senate they asked that not go in. \nThen to quote again from their letter:\n\n       Despite that appeal, the Senate's provision to change the \n     ADSO from 5 to 6 years was sustained.\n\n  In other words, their request lost.\n\n       Further, the underlying rationale for the decision was \n     apparently based on the significant defense investment in \n     service academy graduates.\n\n  Absolutely correct. That is correct.\n  Then there last sentence:\n\n       The Department maintains its original position on this \n     matter.\n\n  I am sure that will be taken to mean the Defense Department opposes \nthis, but that is not the case. They do not say that the new system has \nnot worked well. They do not say that we are getting a lesser qualified \nacademy applicant. They do not say they have even studied this matter. \nThey do not give any data whatsoever, yes or no on this. They do not \nsay whether it is a better deal for taxpayers or not which, as they \ncorrectly said in here, was based on the significant defense investment \nin service academy graduates.\n  What I am saying is, they have not addressed the problem yet and they \ndo not say they have addressed the problem yet. So what I say is we are \nasking them in this legislation to address the problem, do a study, \nreport back to us by next April 1.\n  I will say, if they cannot say when they do that for us, they will \nstudy and let us know what the best way to go is next year, that is the \ntime to be reducing or increasing or remaining the same on the ADSO, \nthe active duty service obligation, of academy graduates.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes and 27 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense be printed in the Record at the end of \nmy comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think there has been a misperception on a \nlot of these things, why recruiting is getting harder. There was a \nstudy done, called the ``Enlistment Propensity.'' There has been a \nmisconception that the youth of the military are no longer hiring \nbecause the military is a declining industry and a lot of other events \nrecently: Drawdown, personnel cuts, base closure, press reports of \nunfavorable events, such as Tailhook and so on, reduced importance of \nmilitary life, domestic issues, crime, health care, economy, jobs, \ndecline in defense-related industries in the communities, and so on.\n  There are many reasons why some people are not applying to the \nacademies. But we do not have any study, other than some anecdotal \nevidence, that shows we have a real decline in the quality of people we \nare getting. In fact, quite the opposite.\n  I will state out of one of the studies we do have on this subject, \nthe class of 1997 at the military academy, as far as scholastic \naptitude tests go, on SAT scores, had an average for the class of 1997 \nof SAT scores higher than the classes of 1989 through 1992 and 1995. \nThey were only 2 points below the classes of 1993 and 1994. So in \nregard to scholastic aptitude, education and intelligence, we do not \nhave a problem recruiting highly qualified applicants.\n  Grade point average for the Air Force, to use another example. The \ngrade point average for the class of 1998 at the end of the freshman \nspring semester was higher than the classes of 1992 through 1994 and \nequal to the class of 1995. The grade point average for the class in \n1997, at the end of both the sophomore fall and spring semesters, was \nthe highest in the last 6 years. The grade point average for the class \nof 1996 at the end of the junior fall semester was the highest in the \nlast 5 years.\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no information whatsoever, except \na few anecdotal stories, that indicate that the 6-year requirement has \nadversely affected the type people we are getting at the academies.\n  I think it is incumbent upon us to say keep it at 6, do the study \nthis year and then we will know what we are doing when we get that \nstudy next year. And if it is required that we put it down to 5 to get \nthe kind of people we need, fine, but we will have data, we will have \nthe study by the Pentagon of \n\n[[Page S 11416]]\nall the academies, not just one--not just Navy, not just West Point, \nnot just the Air Force. We will have studies from all the academies, \nand then we can make an informed decision of what to do.\n  All this amendment does, I repeat once more, is say that we will \nawait the study that is required before we make our decision to reduce \nthe active duty service obligation. That to me is so common sense that \nI hope we can almost adopt this by unanimous consent. I know that is \nnot going to be the case.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Assistant Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Glenn: This is in response to your request for \n     the Department's views on Section 502 of S. 1026.\n       Enactment of this section would reduce the active duty \n     service obligation (ADSO) of Service academy graduates from \n     six to five years.\n       As you are aware, the current six year ADSO was mandated by \n     the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year \n     1990, and will be effective for graduates of the academies \n     beginning in 1996. Neither this mandate, nor Section 502 of \n     S. 1026, were requested by the DoD.\n       A review of the history of the mandate to change the ADSO \n     reveals that the Department appealed this Senate provision \n     during the Senate/House Conference. Despite that appeal, the \n     Senate's provision to change the ADSO from five to six years \n     was sustained. The underlying rationale for the decision was \n     apparently based on the significant Defense investment in \n     Service academy graduates.\n       The Department maintains its original position on this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Francis M. Rush, Jr.,\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the appropriate committee is on the \nfloor, and I will yield to him or just take a brief couple of minutes \nhere and then let him discuss this amendment.\n  Let me just say that we discussed this in great detail in committee \nand in examining it, and as chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I \nconcluded that moving the time obligation from 6 years to 5 years after \ngraduation from the academies was a desirable thing to do.\n  I base that decision primarily upon information that I received from \neach of the Superintendents of the academies. I have with me copies of \nletters from the Superintendents of the academies. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Office of the Superintendent,\n\n\n                               United States Military Academy,\n\n                                   West Point, NY, August 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Dan Coats,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Subcommittee on Personnel, Committee \n         on the Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coats: When legislation to extend the Active \n     Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) for Academy graduates was \n     proposed in the FY 1990 Defense Authorization Bill, all the \n     Services opposed the change. We believed the extension was \n     unnecessary.\n       Retention rates for Academy graduates were historically \n     well above the Service objectives. In addition, the 5-year \n     ADSO coincided with the probationary period for Regular \n     officers and the promotion ``up or out'' point to Captain \n     (Lieutenant in the US Navy). Finally, we were concerned that \n     the longer obligation would harm recruiting of high school \n     students who had many other college and career options \n     (especially minority applicants).\n       To date we have not observed significant adverse \n     consequences in the recruiting arena which can be directly \n     attributed to the extended ADSO. However, for all the reasons \n     cited above, we still believe the 5-year obligation is a \n     better requirement. It helps the recruiting effort and it \n     supports sound officer management policy.\n       On this basis we support the proposal to restore the 5-year \n     ADSO. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute our \n     perspective to your deliberations on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Howard D. Graves,\n\n                                    Lieutenant General, U.S. Army,\n     Superintendent.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  United States Naval Academy,\n\n                                    Annopolis, MD, August 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Daniel R. Coats,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coats: I wanted to take this opportunity to \n     express my position as Superintendent on the Active Duty \n     Service Obligation for service academy graduates. As you know \n     the SASC mark of the FY-96 Authorization Bill contains \n     legislation to reduce the current six year obligation to one \n     of five years for all service academies. Our admissions \n     statistics indicate that the FY-90 extension of the Active \n     Duty Service Obligation has had a negative impact on the \n     total number of applicants and on the number of young men and \n     women seeking congressional appointments. Since 1989, the \n     number of applicants decreased from 14,014 to 10,422, a 25 \n     percent decrease. During the same time frame the number of \n     congressional nominations, a strong indicator of interest in \n     attending a service academy, has decreased 22 percent from \n     6,148 to 4,756. A recent survey of those applicants who \n     declined an offered appointment to the Naval Academy \n     indicated that twenty-three percent did so because of the \n     six-year service obligation.\n       I strongly believe, as these statistics indicate, that the \n     Active Duty Service Obligation issue is one of recruiting, \n     and not retention. The Naval Academy Class of 1989 had a five \n     year obligation, yet our records show that 75% of them are \n     still on active duty at the six year point. We are losing \n     good applicants by legislation that targets the 25% who get \n     out before reaching the six year point, a false economy. If \n     we can get the best people admitted, the challenge is to \n     motivate a large percentage to stay 10 or 20 years, which we \n     have done with great success over the years. A five year \n     obligation will help in this effort.\n       Thank you for your continued support of the Service \n     Academies and especially for your support for the return of \n     the five year active duty service obligation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  C.R. Larson,\n\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy,\n     Superintendent.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Air Force Academy,\n\n                           USAF Academy, Colorado, August 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Dan Coats,\n     Chairman, Personnel Subcommittee,\n     Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coats: We understand the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee is recommending to restore the Active Duty Service \n     Obligation for Service Academy graduates from 6 to 5 years. \n     We support that position.\n       The propensity for young people to serve in the Armed \n     Forces has declined significantly in the post-cold war era. \n     For example, our applications in the past 7 years are down \n     nearly 50 percent. We believe the increased service \n     commitment to 6 years has contributed to this trend. Over the \n     past 3 years, in telephone interviews with those who declined \n     appointments to the Academy, over 20 percent stated that the \n     6-year military obligation was a major factor in their \n     decision.\n       We believe returning to the 5-year service obligation will \n     enhance our efforts to recruit quality students.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Paul E. Stein,\n\n                                         Lieutenant General, USAF,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have letters from the Superintendent of \nthe West Point U.S. Military Academy, from the Air Force Academy and \nfrom the Naval Academy. Let me just quote from those letters:\n\n       Dear Senator Coats: When legislation to extend the Active \n     Duty Service Obligation for academy graduates was proposed \n     for the FY 1990 defense authorization bill, all the services \n     opposed the change. We believed the extension was \n     unnecessary.\n\n  Now they have had some experience with this and, as a result of that, \nthey write to us and say that there are concerns that the longer \nobligation would harm the recruiting of high school students who have \nmany other college and career options, especially minority applicants. \nThey were concerned at the time when this was put in that this would \nadversely affect them.\n  The Superintendent of the military academy goes on to say that ``we * \n* * believe the 5-year obligation is a better requirement. It helps the \nrecruiting effort and it supports sound officer management policy.''\n  General Stein, Superintendent of the Air Force Academy, says:\n\n       The propensity for young people to serve in the Armed \n     Forces has declined significantly in the post-cold-war era. \n     For example, our applications in the past 7 years are down \n     nearly 50 percent. We believe the increased service \n     commitment to 6 years has contributed to this trend. Over the \n     past 3 years, in telephone interviews with those who declined \n     appointments to the academy, over 20 percent stated that the \n     6-year military obligation was a major factor in their \n     decision.\n\n  Finally, Admiral Larson, Superintendent of the Naval Academy says:\n\n       Our admissions statistics indicate that the FY 90 extension \n     of the Active Duty Service Obligation has had a negative \n     impact on the \n\n[[Page S 11417]]\n     total number of applicants and on the number of young men and women \n     seeking congressional appointments . . . A recent survey of \n     those applicants who declined an offered appointment to the \n     Naval Academy indicated that 23 percent did so because of the \n     6-year service obligation.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we need to listen to the people who run the \nacademies. They are the ones who are in charge of the recruiting of \ntop-flight high school graduates to attend the academies. Each of them \nhas specified to us that the 6-year obligation is not only unnecessary \nbut it hurts their recruiting.\n  As they call and interview, those who they have selected to be at the \nAcademy, and ask them, ``Why did you turn down a free education,'' we \nare finding that one-fifth or more of those who rejected the \nappointment have said the 6-year obligation was simply too long.\n  There are a lot of opportunities for bright, young people today. The \npeople that are applying for the Academies are top-flight people that \nhave other options, not only in terms of their educational and academic \noptions, but in terms of employment opportunities when they leave. \nThose individuals are saying, ``I am not prepared at this point to \ncommit to 6 years.''\n  Now, the logical response to that is, well, then that means they \nwould not stay on as officers in the respective services. If they are \nconcerned about a 6-year obligation, why should the taxpayer pay for \ntheir education only to have them leave 5, 6 years later? But just the \nopposite is true. Those individuals who do accept and graduate from the \nAcademy, a vast proportion, and very high percentage of those graduates \nchoose a career of service in the military.\n  The difference is that when you are an 18-year-old making a decision, \n6 years seems like an eternity. But once you have received the \neducation, gone through the academy and graduated, begun to serve in \nthe service, the decision is to stay in the service. So that is not a \ndeterrent.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona who \ninitiated this proposal and was instrumental in urging the committee to \nadopt it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do the proponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 4 minutes, 36 seconds. The \nproponents have 2 minutes, 56 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nIndiana for the outstanding work he has done as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Personnel, especially the personal interest he has \ntaken in the service academies. I know of no one who has taken more \ntime and effort to be involved in the issues surrounding the service \nacademies than the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, in case the Senator from Ohio did not hear about it, I \nreceived information concerning candidates for the Naval Academy. In \n1994, applicants for that class, in a comparison between the 94 and 99 \napplicants from the State of Ohio for the Naval Academy, dropped 21.5 \npercent. Candidates--those selected and then asked to be members at the \nNaval Academy--dropped 22.5 percent.\n  I am not sure where the Senator from Ohio is getting any figures. But \nwe have received information which I will make part of the Record from \nall three service academies that both applicants and candidacies have \ndropped. It is a fact of life.\n  Mr. President, also, in the letter that the Senator from Ohio made a \npart of the Record from the Assistant Secretary of Defense, it clearly \nstates, in a rather weaselish way, that the Department of Defense did \nnot approve of the increase when it was enacted, and they stand by \ntheir original position on this matter. I think it is clear that they \ndid not approve of it then and they do now.\n  Let me tell you what this is all about, Mr. President, and I will get \nright down to it. We are in an all-volunteer force. Today, a majority \nof the men and women in the services who are enlisted are minorities. \nToday, Mr. President, the overwhelming majority of the members of the \nofficer corps are white individuals. There is a significant and \ndramatic imbalance between the makeup of the enlisted corps and the \nofficer corps in the military today.\n  The service academies have worked night and day to try to correct \nthat imbalance by attracting minority individuals into the service \nacademies. It is entirely appropriate that there be some reasonable \nbalance between the numbers of minorities, percentages of minorities in \nthe officer corps and in the enlisted corps. I do not have to explain \nto Members the kinds of contradictions that evolve from that.\n  What the service academies are finding is that if a minority person \nis qualified to enter a service academy, that same person is qualified \nto get a scholarship to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Berkeley, Stanford, \nor any other major college or university.\n  We are having significant problems, Mr. President--when I say ``we,'' \nI mean the service academies. They are having significant difficulties \nin recruiting members of minorities into the service academies. They \nare not able to reach their goals. In fact, there was a steady increase \nfor a while, and that has now leveled off and even declined.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not disrespect the view of the Senator from \nOhio. But I have to tell the Senator from Ohio that I respect the view \nof the people who are running the admissions programs in these service \nacademies more than I do his. Why the Senator from Ohio is hung up on \nthis issue is not clear to me, because we are dear friends.\n  But I would ask the Senator from Ohio, who pretends to be an expert \non this issue--which he is not--to listen to the people that are the \nexperts on this issue and then this issue would be quickly resolved.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved a \nprovision in the Defense authorization bill that would restore to 5 \nyears from 6 the minimum active duty service obligation for Service \nAcademy graduates. We believe that this position will go a long way to \nhelp reverse the alarming decline in the number of applicants for the \nService Academies.\n  Opposition to lowering the active duty service obligation comes from \na mistaken belief that a longer service obligation will absolutely \nresult in more officers making the military a career. Historical data \nshows, however, that there is no direct correlation between the length \nof the service obligation and the decision to make the military a \ncareer. In fact, in the past when there was no service obligation or a \nconsiderably shorter obligation, the military was very successful in \nmotivating a large percentage of Service Academy graduates to remain \nfor 20 years.\n  The real objective of restoring the service obligation to 5 years is \nto enhance recruiting efforts at the Service Academies. With the \ncurrent 6-year service obligation, we are losing many good applicants. \nA 5-year service obligation will focus instead on getting the best \npeople admitted. As a clear indication that a 5-year obligation is not \ndetrimental to efforts to keep officers in the military, it is \nsignificant that 77 percent of graduates from the U.S. Naval Academy \nClass of 1989, which had a 5-year obligation, are still on active duty \nat the 6-year point.\n  The real issue here is recruiting, not retention, of officers from \nthe Service Academies.\n  Mr. President, it may be useful to explain to this body some of the \nhistory of Senator Glenn's amendment on the 6-year active duty \nobligation. During the 1991 legislative session, Congress increased the \nactive duty obligation of Service Academy graduates from 5 to 6 years.\n  Mr. President, my amendment steals an old argument from 1991, when \nthe Congress recommended a provision that would require all \ncommissioned officers to be initially appointed as reserve officers. \nThe Congress felt that regardless of commissioning source, that all \nofficers should compete for regular commissions on the basis of their \ndemonstrated performance and potential. Additionally, those that argued \non the side of debate for reserve commissions stated that competition \nis healthy and consistent with equal opportunity which allows the best \nofficers to enter the regular component. Although, this provision was \nconsidered to be leveling the playing field with respect to reserve \ncommissions; legislation also was included with respect to an \nacademies' length of obligated service in the Armed Forces which would \nrequire a graduate to serve on active duty for at least 6 years \n\n[[Page S 11418]]\nimmediately after commission. In comparison, an ROTC graduate's length \nof obligated service in the Armed Forces is only 4 years immediately \nafter their commission.\n  Mr. President, the country receives an adequate return on its \ninvestment with the 5-year obligation. However, the delicate balance \nbetween accession and attrition in the military manpower world may soon \ntilt for the worse when the academy classes of 1996 graduate and they \nincur a 6-year active duty service obligation. Because of the pyramidal \nshape of the officer corps, for example the progressively smaller \nnumber of officers in each rank as rank increases, we only need to keep \n55 percent of our academy graduates beyond the 5-year point. History \nshows us that when there was little or no obligation, all the services \nwere exceeding this 55 percent retention requirement. If too many \nofficers are retained beyond the 5-year point, then the desired shape \nof the officer corps pyramid becomes distorted, there aren't enough \nmeaningful jobs for junior officers, there is a demoralizing increased \npromotion pass-over rate, personnel management flexibility is reduced, \nand there are morale problems because of disgruntled officers who feel \nthey are being kept on active duty beyond a reasonable pay back period \nfor education.\n  Mr. President, the Services' own study of the 6-year active duty \nobligation shows that the increase in active duty obligation at the \nacademies reduces the number and quality of young persons applying to \nthe academies. This is because top-notch youngsters at age 17 or 18 are \nsimply not sure what career they wish to devote their lives to and they \nare not willing to obligate their lives to one field, military or non-\nmilitary, for a long period of time. This naive uncertainty is only \nexacerbated by the changing face of the military as it goes through \nexcruciating cutbacks and is buffeted by the shifting winds of what may \nbe called the leadership theory of the day. These teenagers want to \nkeep their options open.\n  Mr. President, many fine young people will enter the Service \nAcademies out of a spirit of patriotism and are proud to serve on \nactive duty for 5 years with the expectation that they may make the \nservice a career. But obligations in excess of that amount will drive \nthem away from Service Academies to civilian colleges, who eagerly \ndesire these quality youth and require no obligation after graduation, \neven after public funding. Many businesses are offering highly \nqualified young people free college educations today with work pay back \ncommitments considerably below the Service Academy 6-year obligation. \nThe adverse impact of the increased active duty obligation will become \nmore pronounced as the 18-year-old age population in\n our country continues to decline beyond 1994.\n\n  Our challenge in the military is to attract the best youth we can to \nthe service academies and then through good leadership and career \nsatisfaction inspire them to stay in the service, rather than require \nthem to stay in.\n  More importantly, Mr. President, the increase obligation has an even \ngreater impact on minority and women applications. Minorities and women \nare well aware that the services were once white, male bastions and \nalthough they are patriotic and wish to serve the country, they are \nskeptical about a military career. A long obligation deters minorities, \nas well, from applying to the academies out of a concern that they \nwould be irrevocably committed to something they may not like for a \nlong period of time.\n  Mr. President, qualified minorities and women are highly sought after \nby many colleges in the country. With a 6-year obligation the service \nacademies will not be competitive in minority recruiting. The military \nurgently needs to increase the number of minority officers. For \nexample, today the U.S. military has 20 percent of African-Americans in \nthe enlisted force and only 7 percent of African-Americans in the \nofficer corps. Even more disturbing, the U.S. Navy has only 3 percent \nof African-Americans in the officer corps. Mr. President, service \nacademies with their own preparatory schools to assist minorities, who \nrequire additional academic preparation, are the best way to increase \nminority officer representation. I firmly believe this. Many of you in \nthe Senate know me to be a strong supporter of the service academy \npreparatory schools. In fact, that is because over 50 percent of the \nAfrican-American students at the academy enter the academy through the \npreparatory schools. If a minority graduates from the service academy \npreparatory school, goes through the academy in 4 to 5 years, and has a \n6-year service obligated commitment on top of his education, then that \nequals 12 years of military service. This is a near lifetime for a 17-\nyear-old prospective candidate.\n  The different active duty obligation of service academies and ROTC \nprograms, 6 versus 4 years, will create difficulties. First, high \nquality young people who would otherwise apply for the service \nacademies will now seek entry into the ROTC or may not seek a career in \nthe military. Second, having officers from the services' two prime \ncommissioning sources, with different obligations, serving side-by-side \nin their various assignments, causes difficult morale and career \nmanagement problems. Next, a longer obligation for service academy \ngraduates than ROTC graduates conveys to ROTC officers that the \nmilitary wants academy graduates more than them, causing them to become \ndemoralized and possibly decide against making the service a career. A \nviable officer corps requires that the services attract career officers \nfrom all the commissioning sources. We must carefully avoid the \nperception that one source is favored over the others.\n  In summary, the 6-year obligation provides no advantages. It is a \ndetriment in every respect. The service academies had little or no \nactive duty obligations for over 100 years, and their graduates served \nthe country well.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment to return the \nacademy active duty service obligation to 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time for Senator Coats.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes, 56 seconds. There \nare 31 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the idea of minorities being influenced \nmore by going from 6 to 5 years or 5 to 6 years, and making that \nparticularly applicable to minorities, is a bit disingenuous, I submit. \nWe have talked to the people at the Pentagon, who have indicated to us \nverbally--and I am sorry I did not get a letter--that there has not \nbeen any decline in minority applicants. The percentages remain about \nthe same.\n  As far as being experts, that brings up the key point of this \namendment. This amendment says to do the study, get the experts, do not \ngo with anecdotal evidence, like a single letter from the head of an \nacademy, but do an honest-to-goodness study that breaks it down into \nminorities and SAT scores, and all the other things needed to get good \nacademy applicants. We will know what we are doing.\n  Next year I may join my friend to reduce it to 4 years to get the \ntype people we need. But now we are saying ``ready, fire, aim.'' We are \nsaying, ``OK, we are going to take it upon ourselves to say we will go \nfrom 6 back to 5.'' In this bill, it says we will do the study, and it \nis due in next April, and we are making the decision now even though \nthe real study that gives us all the information will come later.\n  That just, to me, does not make any sense. What I would much prefer \nto do is do a study. It will let us know definitively what the problem \nis, if there is a problem, if we are having a problem recruiting \nminorities, or anybody else, and then next year, we can make a very \ninformed decision as to whether we reduce the required time or not.\n  I was very disappointed in the letter that the Senator from Arizona \nreferred to that came over from the Pentagon, because it certainly did \nnot express what I had been told verbally from the Pentagon before as \nto what the situation was. It was my understanding that there was \ngeneral support over there for the 6 years. Maybe I misread some of \nthat. But let them do a study and it will be better information for the \nPentagon as well as for us, also. Until we know what we are doing, let \nus not decide before we have the study done. That makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona made a mistake. He \nsaid the Senator from Indiana has \n\n[[Page S 11419]]\nworked the hardest on this. That is not true. The Senator from Arizona \nhas been passionately interested in maintaining top quality at the \nacademies. Nobody cares more about attracting the kind of people we \nneed to lead our armed services than him. That is why he is concerned, \nbecause we are not getting those people. The people who run the \nacademies are saying one of the primary reasons we are losing people is \nthe 6-year obligation. We are trying to defer to the wishes of those \nwho run the academies and admit the students, and they are telling us, \ndrop it from 6 to 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time on the amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not take second place to anybody on \nthis. The academies deserve to get the best students. It is not \nathletics, it is combat we are preparing people for. So our military \ndeserves the very finest leadership possible.\n  This amendment does not say keep it at 6. It says to do the study, \nthen decide next year. And a study is already required in this \nlegislation. I do not have to put that in.\n  All I am saying with this legislation is, take the commonsense \napproach of getting the information before we make the decision, and do \nnot rely just on anecdotal data. I believe all time has run out. I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nfirst vote in the voting sequence there be 4 minutes for debate, to be \nequally divided in the usual form between each succeeding vote, and \nthat succeeding votes also be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 2121\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin].\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Harkin amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] \nand the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion to table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate there are two more votes in \nthis series. Under the order, there will be 4 minutes, if necessary. \nMost of us were here and heard the debate. I do not see why it is \nnecessary to have 4 minutes. Maybe somebody wants to take the 4 minutes \nand have 2 minutes on each side to review the amendment before the \nvote.\n  We will move to table the Levin amendment. But before we do that, I \nwanted to indicate that there have been a number of us here through the \nevening trying to determine how many more amendments will be offered by \nMembers on this side of the aisle and on that side of the aisle so we \ncan put together a finite list. We started off with 185 this morning. \nWe have worked through a number of those. There are 26, I think, now in \nthe process of being cleared, and 16 have been cleared, and there are \n10 in the process. There may be additional amendments that can be \ncleared.\n  We are trying to determine whether we want to stay all night and \nfinish this, if it is possible to finish it if we stay until 5 or 6 \no'clock, or whether we can work out some agreement here and get some \nsmaller list, stack some votes and have those votes following \ndisposition of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill tomorrow. There \nare a lot of people--probably 50, 60, or 75 relevant amendments--\nRepublicans and Democrats who have put ``relevant.'' We do not know \nwhat the amendments are or whether they intend to be offered. We \nlearned from one Senator who has six, he is going to offer all six. I \nhope he wins the prize so somebody else will not try to be 100 percent.\n  But, in any event, during these next two votes, if people have \namendments they are going to offer, I wish they would tell Senator Nunn \nor Senator Thurmond so we can make some announcement following the last \nvote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2122\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to table the Levin amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator yield back the time?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. May we hear an explanation of the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are about $770 million in a Guard and \nReserve package. Literally in the last few hours of the deliberations \nin the committee, an earmarking of this $770 million was presented to \nthe committee dividing it all up for particular projects. In the last 3 \nyears the Armed Services Committee has been generic. We have done this \ngenerically so that the Guard and Reserve could do the most important \nmodernization work. We did not divide it up line by line in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. The House tries to do that each year. We have \nresisted that for the last 3 years.\n  So this really is a good amendment so that all of our States will \nhave an opportunity to weigh in for this money.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  There should be order so we can hear the Senator explain the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My amendment is supported by Senator Nunn and others. It \nis very close to what the Appropriations Committee did in this area, \ntrying to leave this generic so that all of our State Guard and Reserve \nunits will have an opportunity to provide all of these components--the \nArmy, Navy, and so forth--as to what the highest priorities are.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will use 2 minutes. \n\n[[Page S 11420]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee reviewed this \npolicy very, very carefully by a majority of votes and decided it would \nbe the Senate of the United States that made the decision of how these \nfunds should be expended, not simply some two-star Reserve or Guard \ncommander. It is as simple as that. We are not about to relinquish that \ndecision to a two-star general. There it is.\n  We strongly urge that the Members of the Senate back the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, a majority of the members of that committee, and \nmove to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion of the Senator from Kansas to lay on the table \nthe amendment of the Senator from Michigan. On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] \nand the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from Arizona [Mr. Pryor] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2123\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio. There are 4 minutes of debate, evenly divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield myself such time as may I require.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. In 1990, we required \nacademy graduates to do active duty service beyond their academy years. \nWe moved that requirement from 5 years up to 6. The bill this year \nrequires the study of that, whether it has worked well, whether we are \nstill getting good people or not, what the status is. And my idea was \nthat we wait until we get the study before we go ahead and make that \ndecision, so we will know what we are doing. We just have anecdotal \ninformation unless we do that.\n  What was put into the bill was that the bill reduces from 6 back to 5 \nwithout getting the study. And, to me, that is like ready, fire, aim. \nIt puts the cart before the horse, or any other cliche you want to have \nin there.\n  I think we should have the best study we can. There is anecdotal \ninformation that varies all over the lot. Basically, the information I \nhave is that the SAT scores for academy students across the average of \nall three academies for 1996, 1997, 1998 is 323 points higher than the \nnational average. The class at the military academy had scores higher \nthan previous classes. Some of the falloff in the number of applicants \nstarted in 1988 because of some of the downsizing of the military. We \nhave the Air Force Academy in particular; their scores have remained \nvery, very high. The grade point average at the end of the freshman \nspring semester was higher than the class of 1992-1994.\n  All I am proposing is that since we are not under duress in this \narea, since all the SAT scores appear to be back--I may lead the charge \nnext year to reduce it to 5 or 4, if there is a problem. But let us do \na definitive study and then decide. Let us not decide now to reduce the \nnumber and then get the study next spring. That is keeping things in \nthe wrong order.\n  All I say is, get the study. We will decide next year. It is that \nsimple.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the evidence is in. We do not need another \nstudy. It was originally raised from 5 to 6 years by the Senator from \nOhio without a study. But the superintendents of the three academies of \nWest Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy in Colorado have all \nsaid--they are the ones who are in charge of bringing the applicants to \nthe academy and making sure that we have the top-flight people--they \nhave written to us. And each have said that they support the reduction \nfrom 6 to 5.\n  The reason they do so is they are losing top-flight academy \napplicants. When they follow up with interviews of those who are \naccepted to the academies, the ones that do not come, and ask those \nindividuals, ``Why didn't you come?'' More than 20 percent in two \ndifferent surveys and studies conducted by the academies have said, \n``The 6-year requirement is too much.''\n  Now, the logical question is, well, if they do not want to commit to \n6 years, and we are paying for their education, they will not stay and \nbe career officers. Just the opposite is true. To an 18-year-old trying \nto make a decision, a 6-year commitment on top of a 4-year academy \nexperience seems like a long, long time. But once they go through the \nacademy, and once they serve in the services, the vast majority of \nthose, nearly 80 percent or more, become career soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen.\n  So I think we should listen to the superintendents. They are the ones \nthat are in charge of getting the quality people to the academy. They \nare the ones that are saying, ``We need this help to recruit the top-\nflight candidates. Please drop this from 6 to 5.''\n  The committee supported that position. I hope the Senators will do \nthat.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE: I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GLENN. Time has not run out yet. Will you withhold the tabling \nmotion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on both sides has expired.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I understood the time had expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  If the Senator would want to make a point, he can do that.\n  Mr. GLENN. One additional minute for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. The point I want to make is we spent a quarter of a \nmillion dollars on the people in the academy for the 4 years. This is \nnot a small expenditure.\n  We require time for doctors who are going through training. We \nrequire additional years, I think it is 8 years or something like that, \nfor flight training now. This is normal. This is not something unusual. \nIf we make this big investment, we are expecting the academies to be \nthe leaders of our military in the future. If they are not willing to \nmake a commitment going in, I think we are shortchanging.\n  We do not have any information that indicates we are getting a lesser \nquality academy applicant these days than we were in the past. I think \nit is a good deal for the taxpayers. We stay at 6, not go back to 5, \nunless we have a study that shows otherwise.\n\n[[Page S 11421]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 2123. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand, I have been told by the \nminority leader there will not be any more time agreements--which I \nthink is unfortunate--on any amendments. It will just take us longer. I \nassume that we can finally reach a point where we will be able to \nfinish this.\n  If we can put together a list of the real amendments--we thought we \nhad a list, and we were told it was not an accurate list. I do not know \nhow many additional amendments have been added. Maybe we can make a \nreasonable judgment. Otherwise, I do not know what alternative the \nleader has. We are trying to complete action, and we are not given any \nassurance there is ever going to be any end to it--how many amendments \nand no time agreements.\n  How much time will the Senator from Pennsylvania need?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond, I am advised that this \nwill be accepted. I will speak for not more than 6, 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I understand the Senator from New Mexico may be prepared to \noffer amendments. Is he prepared to offer amendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me respond to the original comment \nmade by the majority leader. We have polled our Members, and based upon \nconversations I have had in the last 10, 15 minutes, I would say we \nhave somewhere between 45 and 60 amendments. Most of our members, at \nthis point, are unwilling to agree to time agreements. The next \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico is an \namendment that deals with tobacco. I do not know how long that will \ntake. We cannot agree to a 30-minute time agreement on our side. A lot \nof Members will want to be heard on that issue.\n  For that reason, I guess I am not able to provide any understanding \nat this point beyond what I have already shared with the majority \nleader about how long it will take to finish.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will just proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2081\n\n (Purpose: To provide authority for the surrender of fugitives and the \n  provision of judicial assistance to the international tribunals for \nYugoslavia and Rwanda, in accordance with the obligations of the United \n    States under certain resolutions of the United Nations Security \n                                Council)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2081.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 403, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1095. JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL \n                   FOR YUGOSLAVIA AND TO THE INTERNATIONAL \n                   TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA.\n\n       (a) Surrender of Persons.--\n       (1) Application of united states extradition laws.--Except \n     as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the provisions of \n     chapter 209 of title 18, United States Code, relating to the \n     extradition of persons to a foreign country pursuant to a \n     treaty or convention for extradition between the United \n     States and a foreign government, shall apply in the same \n     manner and extent to the surrender of persons, including \n     United States citizens, to--\n       (A) the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia, pursuant to \n     the Agreement Between the United States and the International \n     Tribunal for Yugoslavia; and\n       (B) the International Tribunal for Rwanda, pursuant to the \n     Agreement Between the United States and the International \n     Tribunal for Rwanda.\n       (2) Evidence on hearings.--For purposes of applying section \n     3190 of title 18, United States Code, in accordance with \n     paragraph (1), the certification referred to in the section \n     may be made by the principal diplomatic or consular officer \n     of the United States resident in such foreign countries where \n     the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia or the \n     International Tribunal for Rwanda may be permanently or \n     temporarily situated.\n       (3) Payment of fees and costs.--(A) The provisions of the \n     Agreement Between the United States and the International \n     Tribunal for Yugoslavia and of the Agreement Between the \n     United States and the International Tribunal for Rwanda shall \n     apply in lieu of the provisions of section 3195 of title 18, \n     United States Code, with respect to the payment of expenses \n     arising from the surrender by the United States of a person \n     to the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia or the \n     International Tribunal for Rwanda, respectively, or from any \n     proceedings in the United States relating to such surrender.\n       (B) The authority of subparagraph (A) may be exercised only \n     to the extent and in the amounts provided in advance in \n     appropriations Act.\n       (4) Nonapplicability of the federal rules.--The Federal \n     Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \n     do not apply to proceedings for the surrender of persons to \n     the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia or the \n     International Tribunal for Rwanda.\n       (b) Assistance to Foreign and International Tribunals and \n     to Litigants Before Such Tribunals.--\n      Section 1782(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting in the first sentence after ``foreign or \n     international tribunal'' the following: ``, including \n     criminal investigations conducted prior to formal \n     accusation''.\n       (c) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (1) International tribunal for yugoslavia.--The term \n     ``International Tribunal for Yugoslavia'' means the \n     International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \n     Responsible for Serious Violations of International \n     Humanitarian Law in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, \n     as established by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     827 of May 25, 1993.\n       (2) International tribunal for rwanda.--The term \n     ``International Tribunal for Rwanda'' means the International \n     Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for \n     Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International \n     Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and \n     Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such \n     Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighboring States, \n     as established by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     955 of November 8, 1994.\n       (3) Agreement between the united states and the \n     international tribunal for yugoslavia.--The term ``Agreement \n     Between the United States and the International Tribunal for \n     Yugoslavia'' means the Agreement on Surrender of Persons \n     Between the Government of the United States and the \n     International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \n     Responsible for Serious Violations of \n\n[[Page S 11422]]\n     International Law in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia, signed at \n     The Hague, October 5, 1994.\n       (4) Agreement between the united states and the \n     international tribunal for rwanda.--The term ``Agreement \n     between the United States and the International Tribunal for \n     Rwanda'' means the Agreement on Surrender of Persons Between \n     the Government of the United States and the International \n     Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for \n     Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International \n     Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and \n     Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such \n     Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighboring States, \n     signed at The Hague, January 24, 1995.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I had stated a few moments ago, it is \nmy understanding that this amendment has been cleared on both sides. It \nis an important amendment. It is to provide authority for the surrender \nof fugitives and the provision of judicial assistance to the \nInternational Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, in accordance with \nthe obligations of the United States under certain resolutions of the \nUnited Nations Security Council.\n  Mr. President, as it is well known, there has been considerable \ndebate in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives on the \natrocities in Bosnia, and the actions there leading this body and the \nHouse to call for the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. And while \nthere is some substantial controversy as to what ought to be done on \nthat subject, with the disagreement with the President and prospective \nveto and possible override effort, there is unanimity that the action \nof the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia, and also by \nimplication for Rwanda, is something which really ought to be carried \nout in an efficient and rigorous and really tough manner.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have seen extraordinary atrocities in \nBosnia, with the ethnic cleansing, the summary executions, the \ntortures, massive and systematic rape, attacks on medical and relief \npersonnel, and the estimates show that some 200,000 people, mostly \nBosnian Moslems, have been killed or are missing; 2.2 million are \nrefugees, and another 1.8 million have been displaced in Bosnia.\n  We have seen the photographs of young women in their teens and early \ntwenties hanging themselves by the trees in the Bosnian forest because \nthey prefer suicide to facing the Bosnian Serbs. We have heard reports \nverified about the Bosnian Serbs entering the U.N. safe havens and \ntaking 11-year-old boys, slicing their throats and leaving them in \nlarge mounds on the streets in an effort to stop the next generation of \nBosnian Moslems looking ahead. It is just an extraordinary and horrible \nsituation.\n  I personally have pushed, in the course of the past decade, \nresolutions to establish a general International Criminal Court which I \nthink ought to be done. It ought to be done on international drug \ntrafficking and on terrorism, where we have situations where nations \nwill not extradite to the United States. Colombia is an example. If we \nhad an international criminal court, we could have extradition.\n  This is a subject that I have worked on for many years as District \nAttorney of Philadelphia on a microcosm as to what I submit ought to be \ndone internationally. But we have had the United Nations resolutions \nwhich have provided for International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia \nand Rwanda.\n  With respect to the atrocities in Rwanda, this amendment would \nprovide authority for fugitives to be surrendered, because we have no \ncurrent extradition treaties with the International Court, and would \nprovide authority for the United States to turn over evidence to the \nInternational Criminal Court.\n  The circumstances here are really extraordinary, Mr. President. Our \ncolleague, Senator Kohl, recently repeated a saying that the loss of a \nsingle life is a tragedy, while the loss of 1,000 lives is a statistic. \nRegrettably, we are treating the atrocities in Bosnia and Rwanda as \nstatistics, without really focusing on the individual tragedies.\n  There will be a hearing next Wednesday jointly by the Foreign \nRelations Committee and by the Senate Intelligence Committee to shed \nsome additional light on the atrocities in Bosnia.\n  I submit this is a very important amendment, Mr. President. We need \nto get it enacted so we will have the authority to extradite these \nfugitives to the International Criminal Court and turn over the \nimportant evidence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. On this side of the aisle we are willing to accept the \namendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. We are willing to accept the amendment on this side. If the \nSenator from Pennsylvania could enlighten us, I understand this is \nsimilar to the administration's legislation they have been seeking.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This is legislation which the administration is seeking, \nif I may respond.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I recommend this be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further question, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2081) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could have the attention of the managers, I \nunderstand it is in order for me to submit my landmine amendment with a \n10-minute time agreement equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct, but I wish to note \nthat I will vigorously oppose the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2124\n\n(Purpose: To support proposals to implement the United States' goal of \neventually eliminating antipersonnel landmines; to impose a moratorium \non use of antipersonnel landmines except in limited circumstances; and \n  to urge imposition of certain sanctions against foreign governments \n                  that export antipersonnel landmines)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senators Lugar, Graham of Florida, Kassebaum, Simon, Inouye, \nJeffords, Reid, Hatfield, Ford, Harkin, Sarbanes, Feingold, Kohl, \nLautenberg, Dodd, Kerry, Bradley, Moseley-Braun, Bumpers, Kennedy, \nBoxer, Pell, Chafee, Dorgan, Mikulski, Wellstone, Daschle, Murray, \nSimpson, Bryan, Moynihan, Kerrey, Feinstein, Akaka, Conrad, Johnston, \nPryor, Breaux, Exon, Campbell, Robb, Rockefeller, Lieberman, Levin, \nByrd, Gorton, Specter, McConnell, Bingaman, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] for himself, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Simon, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Ford, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dodd, \n     Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bradley, Ms. Mosley-Braun, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Pell, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Dorgan, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Bryan, \n     Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kerrey, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Exon, Mr. \n     Campbell, Mr. Robb, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Specter, Mr. McConnell, and \n     Mr. Bingaman propose an amendment numbered 2124.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LANDMINE USE MORATORIUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 26, 1994, the President declared that it \n     is a goal of the United States to eventually eliminate \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (2) On December 15, 1994, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution sponsored by the United States \n     which called for international efforts to eliminate \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (3) According to the Department of State, there are an \n     estimated 80,000,000 to 110,000,000 unexploded landmines in \n     62 countries.\n       (4) Antipersonnel landmines are routinely used against \n     civilian populations and kill and maim an estimated 70 people \n     each day, or 26,000 people each year.\n       (5) The Secretary of State has noted that landmines are \n     ``slow-motion weapons of mass destruction''.\n\n[[Page S 11423]]\n\n       (6) There are hundreds of varieties of antipersonnel \n     landmines, from a simple type available at a cost of only two \n     dollars to the more complex self-destructing type, and all \n     landmines of whatever variety kill and maim civilians, as \n     well as combatants, indiscriminately.\n       (b) Conventional Weapons Convention Review.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that, at the United Nations conference to \n     review the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention, including \n     Protocol II on landmines, that is to be held from September \n     25 to October 13, 1995, the President should actively support \n     proposals to modify Protocol II that would implement as \n     rapidly as possible the United States goal of eventually \n     eliminating antipersonnel landmines.\n       (c) Moratorium on Use of Antipersonnel Landmines.--\n       (1) United States Moratorium.--(A) For a period of one year \n     beginning three years after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the United States shall not use antipersonnel landmines \n     except along internationally recognized national borders or \n     in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is \n     monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate \n     means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.\n       (B) If the President determines, before the end of the \n     period of the United States moratorium under subparagraph \n     (A), that the governments of other nations are implementing \n     moratoria on use of antipersonnel landmines similar to the \n     United States moratorium, the President may extend the period \n     of the United States moratorium for such additional period as \n     the President considers appropriate.\n       (2) Other nations.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should actively encourage the governments of other \n     nations to join the United States in solving the global \n     landmine crisis by implementing moratoria on use of \n     antipersonnel landmines similar to the United States \n     moratorium as a step toward the elimination of antipersonnel \n     landmines.\n       (d) Antipersonnel Landmine Exports.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that, consistent with the United States moratorium \n     on exports of antipersonnel landmines and in order to further \n     discourage the global proliferation of antipersonnel \n     landmines, the United States Government should not sell, \n     license for export, or otherwise transfer defense articles \n     and services to any foreign government which, as determined \n     by the President, sells, exports, or otherwise transfers \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (e) Definitions.--\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Antipersonnel landmine.--The term ``antipersonnel \n     landmine'' means any munition placed under, on, or near the \n     ground or other surface area, delivered by artillery, rocket, \n     mortar, or similar means, or dropped from an aircraft and \n     which is designed, constructed, or adapted to be detonated or \n     exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person.\n       (2) 1980 conventional weapons convention.--The term ``1980 \n     Conventional Weapons Convention'' means the Convention on \n     Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain \n     Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively \n     Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects, together with \n     the protocols relating thereto, done at Geneva on October 10, \n     1980.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand there are 5 minutes to a side with no second-\ndegree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are few issues that I have ever felt \nmore strongly about than the cruel devastation of whole societies by \nlandmines. They are the worst of human depravity, a coward's weapon. At \n$2 or $3 dollars each, landmines like this one I am holding are sold by \nthe hundreds of thousands and even millions.\n  There are 100 million unexploded landmines in over 60 countries. \nArmies leave, tanks withdraw, guns are unloaded, cannons are destroyed, \nthe fighting ends, people even forget what the fighting was about, but \nthe landmines stay, sometimes for decades.\n  In one country, they describe clearing the landmines an arm and a leg \nat a time. The children are often the innocent civilians. Every 22 \nminutes, somebody is horribly maimed or killed.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment is adopted overwhelmingly by \nthis body to send a message to the world, so the United States can take \nthe moral leadership as we did 3 years ago, as we did in the United \nNations this past fall.\n  My opponents will say my amendment will endanger our troops--the same \nargument that was made against the chemical weapons ban.\n  Mr. President, our troops and civilians everywhere have far more to \ngain by what we do here.\n  Landmines are a weapon of choice in the very countries where our \ntroops are likely to be sent in the future. A $2 mine can blow the legs \noff an American soldier as easily as it can pulverize a child.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat. This is not a prohibition, it is a \nmoratorium that does not begin for 3 years. It does not cover Claymore \nmines. It does not cover antitank mines. Our troops have every weapon \nthat shoots or explodes. We have far better ways of tracking the enemy \nthan ever before. We have the most accurate weapons.\n  We are dealing with a global catastrophe. People everywhere are \ndemanding an end to this madness. The U.S. Senate has led the way. We \nshould continue to lead. This is not a weapon we need for our national \nsecurity. It is a terrorist weapon used most often against the \ninnocent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several documents related to this matter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Department of Social\n\n\n                                  Development and World Peace,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: We understand that the landmine issue will \n     soon be before the Senate. As you know, at our General \n     Meeting in June, the Catholic Bishops of the United States \n     approved unanimously a pastoral reflection entitled Sowing \n     Weapons of War: A Pastoral Reflection on the Arms Trade and \n     Landmines. In it, the U.S. Bishops joined Pope John Paul II \n     and bishops from around the world in calling for an end to \n     the manufacture and use of anti-personnel landmines.\n       Two months ago, the Holy Father stated, ``I should once \n     again like to make a vigorous appeal for the definitive \n     cessation of the manufacture and use of * * * `anti-personnel \n     mines'.'' The 100 million landmines that are strewn around \n     the world kill an estimated 500 people per week, most of whom \n     are civilians. Landmines cannot differeniate between civilian \n     and soldier or between periods of peace and war. From \n     Cambodia to Angola, they render large areas uninhabitable, \n     prevent refugees from returning home, inhibit post-war \n     reconstruction and development, and remain a long-term threat \n     to innocent life.\n       The bishops welcome the current U.S. moratorium on exports \n     of anti-personnel landmines and urge the United States to \n     take steps ``to further retrict its own use of landmines, \n     while it pursues with urgency and persistence international \n     agreements to restrict use globally.'' The Landmine Use \n     Moratorium Act (S. 940) would contribute to this goal by \n     prohibiting U.S. military exports to countries that continue \n     to export landmines and by imposing a one-year moratorium on \n     use by the United States of anti-personnel landmines, except \n     along international borders in monitored minefields. These \n     measures are a reasonable response to a serious problem that \n     affects millions of lives around the world.\n       We urge you to support Sen. Leahy's measure and to oppose \n     any amendments or substitutes that would weaken it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                               Most Reverend Daniel P. Reilly,\n\n                                              Bishop of Worcester,\n     Chairman, Committee on International Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Land-Mine Ban Woes\n\n       In 1994, about 100,000 land mines were removed from former \n     war zones at a cost of $70 million. At the same time, another \n     2 million mines were deployed elsewhere.\n       These and other sobering, frustrating statistics came out \n     of a three-day international conference in Geneva last week \n     on mine-clearing.\n       The daunting prospect of new mines being sown at a rate 20 \n     times faster than they can be removed is matched by the \n     apparently futile attempts to ban the sale and manufacture of \n     these inexpensive weapons.\n       There is some momentum to enact an international ban, with \n     25 nations adopting moratoriums on mine exports and three--\n     Mexico, Sweden and Belgium--calling for comprehensive bans on \n     their sale and manufacture. But in Geneva, it was concluded \n     that banning land mines must be a long-term goal.\n       Despite the clear evidence that these weapons often can \n     serve as everlasting and deadly vestiges of wars long \n     resolved, some countries demand the right to keep them in \n     their inventories.\n       The nations that want to have land mines in their \n     inventories typically are not the same 64 countries where \n     collectively 100 million land mines kill or maim 500 persons \n     each week. If they were, perhaps a comprehensive ban would \n     not be so elusive.\n                Sanity May Take Root in Land Mine Debate\n\n       Far too many of us still see the hurt and disbelief in the \n     eyes of someone who has just been hit by a land mine. The \n     eyes that still bore into my mind are those of a little \n     Vietnamese girl who set off a mine while washing clothes on \n     the bank of the Perfume River in Hue in 1990--a full 15 years \n     after the war was supposed to be over for her and everyone \n     else.\n       The girl lay in a hospital bed in Hue with bandages over \n     most of her body. Her mother was attending her because of the \n     shortage of nurses. The mother looked up from her bedside \n     chair and asked me through a translator why the ``booms'' \n     were still going off. Her daughter just stared at me in \n     searing silence.\n\n[[Page S 11424]]\n\n       I had no answer then, but have something hopeful to say \n     now. The U.S. Senate, perhaps this week but certainly this \n     summer, will confront the scourge that maims or kills \n     somebody in the world every 22 minutes. As many as half of \n     the victims are children like the one I saw in Hue.\n       Soldiers know how to detect and disarm mines. Children \n     don't. Sowing mines is like poisoning village wells: The \n     soldiers on both sides realize the danger, drink from their \n     canteens and move on. Not so with the villagers.\n       Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., and more than 40 Senate co-\n     sponsors have drafted legislation that would declare a one-\n     year moratorium on sowing mines on battlefields, starting \n     three years from now. Claymore mines, which infantrymen \n     spread around their positions at night and use in ambushes, \n     would be excluded from the experimental, one-year ban. So \n     would anti-tank mines. Also, international borders, like the \n     demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, could still \n     be sown with mines.\n       The Leahy proposal is but a short step toward the goal of \n     inspiring an international agreement to ban land mines the \n     way the nations managed to ban the use of poison gas and dum-\n     dum bullets. But it is a symbolic step. It will at least \n     force the Congress, the military and the public to confront \n     this uncontrolled sowing of poison seeds.\n       In the Senate, Leahy plans to tack the moratorium \n     legislation onto another bill on the floor, perhaps the \n     defense authorization bill.\n       In the House, Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a Marine grunt from \n     1969 to 1971, is pushing a similar measure but has not \n     decided when to push for a vote. The hawkier House--which \n     seems determined to give the military almost anything it \n     wants--almost certainly will reject the amendment until the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff say they favor it.\n       This hasn't happened despite expert testimony that it would \n     do the U.S. military more good than harm if land mines were \n     banned. No less a soldier than Gen. Alfred Gray Jr., former \n     Marine Corps commandant, has said:\n       ``We kill more Americans with our mines than we do anybody \n     else. We never killed many enemy with mines--. . . What the \n     hell is the use of sowing all this [airborne scatterable \n     mines] if you're going to move through it next week or next \n     month . . . I'm not aware of any operational advantage from \n     broad deployment of mines.''\n       Leahy warns that ``vast areas of many countries have become \n     deathtraps'' because 62 countries have sown between 80 \n     million and 110 million land mines on their land. ``Every day \n     70 people are maimed or killed by land mines. Most of them \n     are not combatants. They are civilians going about their \n     daily lives.''\n       Yet mines are so cheap--costing as little as $2--that small \n     armies all over the world are turning to them as the poor \n     man's equalizer. American forces increasingly are being sent \n     to these developing areas and would be safer if land mines \n     were banned.\n       ``The $2 or $3 anti-personnel mine hidden under a layer of \n     sand or dust can blow the leg off the best-trained, best-\n     equipped American soldier,'' Leahy notes.\n       At the United Nations last year, President Clinton called \n     on the world to stop using land mines. He could weigh in \n     heavily on the side of the one-year moratorium and push the \n     chiefs in that direction. But don't count on it. He seems \n     determined during his re-election drive not to offend the \n     military and its conservative champions.\n       Belgium and Norway this year forbade the production, export \n     or use of land mines. Leahy and Evans hope the upcoming \n     debate will create a climate for a similar stand by the \n     United States. Lest you conclude the land mine moratorium is \n     being pushed by peacenik lawmakers, note that among the \n     senators supporting it are decorated war veterans Daniel K. \n     Inouye, D-Hawaii, J. Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., John F. Kerry, D-\n     Mass., and Charles S. Robb, D-Va.\n       The case for the Leahy-Evans moratorium is overwhelming. \n     Even so, Congress probably will lose its nerve and refuse to \n     enact the moratorium this year. But I think I could tell that \n     little girl in Hue, if she lived through her maiming, that \n     reason is beginning to assert itself. Man is beginning to see \n     the folly of fouling his own nest with mines. There is at \n     least a dim light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I lend my strong support to Senator Leahy's \namendment to push for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel \nlandmines. Senator Leahy has been a long-time champion of this cause, \nand I admire his perseverance and hard work.\n  Landmines, which have been used in warfare for more than 200 years, \nare cheap, insidious, silent predators that continue to kill long after \nthe cessation of conflict. Worldwide, 26,000 people are killed annually \nby landmines.\n  Landmines hold hostage the people, the land, and the economies of \nthose countries in which they are used. At the end of conflicts, often \nthe most immediate need is to return and reintegrate refugee \npopulations. Landmines inhibit the travel of refugee populations. They \ninhibit the travel of relief and assistance organizations. They reduce \nthe amount of land available to be inhabited by returning refugees. \nThey kill and maim that population upon their return. Upon \nresettlement, landmines will inhibit the population from earning a \nliving for many years to come.\n  As Americans, we believe that the cost of transitioning from conflict \nto peace is greater than the cost of continued conflict. Landmines \nmultiply the cost of the transition from conflict to peace, straining \nthe limited resources of both the country in question and the \ninternational donor communities. Moreover, uncleared landmines \njeopardize new, always fragile, peace agreements by extending the \ncauses of conflict--poverty, hunger, and despair.\n  The proliferation of landmines are an obstacle to economic \ndevelopment and political stability. Landmines prevent farmers from \ntilling the land--they undermine food security and create famine. They \ndestroy the agricultural industry of a country.\n  Landmines undermine the national infrastructure and impede national \ndevelopment. They isolate transportation networks, powerlines, bridges, \nand waterways from reconstruction, repair, and maintenance. The quality \nof national infrastructure either supports or impedes economic activity \nand development. When railways and roadways are disrupted, the end \nresult is heavy inflationary pressure on the currency because the costs \nof transporting goods and services always rises. It only takes a few \nlandmines to render a roadway impassable. People will not choose to \ntravel a road that is known to be mined.\n  Landmines create health care and other costs that strain the national \nbudgets of developing countries. The maimed victims of\n landmines require medical treatment, physical rehabilitation, \nartificial limbs and prosthetics, and vocational training. Reduced \nworker productivity, additional expenditures for mine awareness \ntraining and demining activities are all financial burdens on countries \nattempting to recover from the ravages of war.\n\n  The sheer cost of removing landmines can be an insurmountable \nobstacle to economic growth. In Cambodia, the United Nations estimates \nthat the aggregate cost of landmine clearance is from $200 to $1,000 \nper mine. Cambodia's annual per capita GDP is $200. To demine Cambodia \nwould consume every penny produced in that economy for 1 to 5 years.\n  As you know, the continent of Africa presents some of the greatest \nchallenges for sustainable development on the globe. Africa, a \ncontinent that has seen far too much of its share of disasters, must \ncontend with the disasters of landmines every day:\n  Angola: With a population of 13 million, Angola has between 9 and 15 \nmillion landmines--about one for every man, woman and child in the \ncountry. There are between 150 and 200 landmine victims every week. \nAngola has more amputees per capita than any other country in the \nworld.\n  Mozambique: The United Nations reports that all 28 major road systems \nin the country are blocked by uncleared landmines. Mozambique has about \n1 million uncleared landmines.\n  Ethiopia: Has about 500,000 landmines and even more pieces of \nunexploded ordnance.\n  Liberia: After 5 years of civil war, Liberia is estimated to have \n1,000 mines.\n  Rwanda: Has about 50,000 landmines that were implanted during their \ncivil war.\n  Sudan: Has about 1 million landmines as of 1993. That number is \nexpected to have grown and to continue to grow as the conflict \ncontinues.\n  Zimbabwe: Though the civil war in Zimbabwe ended over a decade ago, \nthere remain areas that are not authorized for settlement due to the \npresence of uncleared landmines.\n  In addition to the social and developmental consequences of landmines \nI have mentioned, the basic fact about landmines is that they kill--\neasily and indiscriminately. I urge support for the Leahy landmine \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as the Senator from Virginia may \nrequire.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no Senator that would not like to \nsee this weapon removed. But where do you start in the series of \nweapons? Where do you start and where do you end? \n\n[[Page S 11425]]\n\n  Military history shows that whenever we move into an area--and mind \nyou, in most instances, our troops must deploy forward, often into \nunknown country, against an adversary who is in place--if we were to \nagree to an international conference such as this, the enemy would know \nexactly where the mines would go, and we would lose an advantage.\n  Furthermore, when we deploy into an area, we, in number are less in \nmany instances than the adversary who is in place. We need to have an \nadvantage. We need to seal off what is known in military parlance as \n``avenues of approach'' and do it very quickly, if necessary, by air, \nto drop landmines and other ordinances to seal off an avenue of \nreproach.\n  This would stop that. We are tying our hands. Therefore, we simply \ncan not, with due respect to my distinguished colleague, agree to this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the last thing I want to do in war is tie \nour hands, but that is not the issue. We are the most powerful nation \nhistory has ever known. This amendment allows us to use antitank mines. \nIt allows us to use claymore mines, to use mines along borders and in \ndemilitarized zones. It simply says let us take a step so we and other \ncountries can get rid of these hidden killers.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, the people who are a danger \nare the agronomists from the University of Virginia or the doctors from \nthe University of Vermont or the missionaries from Tennessee or any \nother State who try to go to these 60 countries that are infested with \nmines. They are the ones, they are the ones in danger.\n  It is usually the civilians who suffer. Face it, is somebody going to \nmarch across the Canadian border against the United States or across \nthe Mexican border? It is the child walking down the jungle path who \nloses a leg. They are who clear landmines an arm and a leg at a time. \nIt is the people in Chechnya who die from them. It is the Afghans, a \nmillion and a half of whom are on the border of Pakistan, because they \ncannot go back to their own country. It is the 100 million landmines \nthat make it impossible for countries to develop. It is the landmines \nthat the president of the International Red Cross speaks about.\n  It is the landmines that the Pope and the American bishops and so \nmany others are opposed to. What I am asking is that we take a small \nstep, a small step.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the landmines currently employed by the \nU.S. forces have a self-destruct mechanism, which means after a period \nof time, which can be fixed, they self-destruct and are no longer \nharmful to anyone.\n  That is as far as we can go, I say to my good friend from Vermont. \nThat is as far as we can go.\n  I yield such time as the Senator desires.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time remains? I would like to ask a \ncouple of questions, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, could I ask my friend from Vermont, I think \nall of us agree with the purpose and motive, what he is trying to do \nhere. But I have two or three questions.\n  Do we already have a prohibition on export that is in the law that \nthe Senator from Vermont sponsored? Do we not have that in the law so \nthe United States does not export any?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Not a prohibition, we have a moratorium, as do over 20 \nother countries.\n  Mr. NUNN. If I could just ask, we do have a moratorium on export?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Leahy amendment, once it goes into effect, would it \npreclude the allied forces, United States and Korean forces, having any \nmines in the DMZ in Korea?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, in fact it specifically permits the use of mines in \ndemilitarized zones.\n  Mr. NUNN. Because of the international border?\n  Mr. LEAHY. It refers to demilitarized zones.\n  Mr. NUNN. Now, what if we were in Somalia? At night we used mines \naround the bases in Somalia to protect our troops. Would that be \nbarred?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Claymore mines would be used for that, and they are \npermitted. There is an exception for them by definition.\n  Mr. NUNN. Claymore mines are excepted. We have mines around \nGuantanamo Bay, would that be excepted?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That would be excepted. It is also in a border area that \nis marked and guarded.\n  Mr. NUNN. My counsel says those are not exceptions. Your counsel says \nthey are.\n  I hope this legislative record will help clarify that.\n  The Senator is saying the DMZ would be excepted, and Guantanamo Bay \nwould be excepted?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Claymores and antitank mines would be excepted under any \ncircumstances, anywhere, whether on such a border or not.\n  Mr. NUNN. When we were in the Persian Gulf war and we had an exposed \nright flank, we laid down a considerable number of mines to prevent the \nIraqis from hitting our exposed right flank. Would that be precluded \nunder the Leahy amendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Antitank mines are excepted.\n  Mr. NUNN. What about antipersonnel?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Antipersonnel mines would not be.\n  Mr. NUNN. Antitank mines are excepted but antipersonnel mines are \nnot?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct.\n  Mr. NUNN. Could the Senator tell us the difference between a claymore \nmine and any other?\n  Mr. LEAHY. A claymore mine is one where you make the determination \nwhether it goes off. You trigger it with a triggering device.\n  Mr. NUNN. My counsel says that is not excepted in this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. By the definition, I am told by counsel, by the definition \nit is excepted.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, there is considerable confusion about this \namendment. Whatever happens on this vote, I think we are going to have \nto do some work on it in conference, if it passes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n3 minutes to be given to each side for purposes of debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me read to the Senate exactly what our \ndistinguished colleague has in his amendment.\n\n       The United States moratorium. For a period of one year, \n     beginning three years after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the United States shall not use antipersonnel landmines \n     except along internationally recognized national borders or \n     in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is \n     monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate \n     means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.\n\n  Mr. President, with no disrespect for my colleague, it is simply \nimpossible to go to war under these rules. We are asking our young men \nand women to take risks which are just not fair to them as individuals. \nIt says nothing about the other forces, be it the enemy or such allies \nas we may have working with us.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague, I do not think this amendment \nhas been well thought through. We all recognize and join in our desire \nto stop this type of weaponry throughout the world, but this simply \nwill not do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is indeed a well thought out \namendment. It is an issue we have spent years working on. There have \nbeen debates here. There have been debates at the United Nations. The \nPresident of the United States has called for the eventual elimination \nof antipersonnel landmines. The United States has joined with other \nnations, virtually all other nations, in calling for that.\n  We cannot pass laws and tell other countries what to do, but we can \nsay that we will start to limit our use of antipersonnel landmines, to \nchallenge other countries to do the same.\n  It is not a question of putting our young people at risk in war. It \nis a question of trying to protect our young people today. Today we \nhave far more of our people in danger of being killed or maimed by the \nproliferation of landmines in parts of the world where we send \npeacekeepers, where we send medical personnel, where we send USAID \n\n[[Page S 11426]]\npeople. Can anybody imagine what it is going to be like in the former \nYugoslavia, if the fighting ever stops and we have to go in and help \nclean up well over a million landmines?\n  Even with the millions that were strewn in the Persian Gulf war, that \nwas not what won that war. Most were Iraqi mines. But in the aftermath \nwe saw Kuwait, a wealthy country, spend $1 billion to try to clear a \nportion of the landmines there, and 85 people died doing it--after the \nfighting. Not during it, but after the fighting, from clearing \nlandmines.\n  As one who testified before the Senate, a relief worker from \nColorado, said, when a landmine went off under his Jeep he sat there \nwith his foot in his hand, trying to put it back on.\n  Those are the people damaged. This amendment permits 3 years, as we \ntold the Pentagon to do, to develop alternatives to landmines.\n  Mr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for a brief question? I think it is \nimportant. I think the Senator will agree the mines he was talking \nabout that the Kuwaitis cleared were not the United States mines, they \nwere the ones laid by the Iraqis. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct.\n  Mr. NUNN. The U.S. mines were the ones that self-destructed.\n   Mr. LEAHY. No, there were mines of ours, too.\n  Mr. NUNN. But those mines did not cause the Kuwaitis any problem \nbecause they self-destructed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am told by the Pentagon, and you would have access to, \nat least, the same numbers, at least 1,700 of the self-destruct mines \nnever detonated. We can put down 100,000 self-destruct mines and have \nat least 90 percent of them work and you still have about 10,000 that \ndo not.\n  We have exceptions for some mines. We have 3 years to develop \nalternatives, as the Pentagon says it is doing. During those 3 years, \nif they are unable to, I will be happy to join with my colleagues, I \nwill be here during those 3 years, to talk about other methods.\n  The fact of the matter is, one of the reasons why virtually every \neditorial writer from the left to the right, why virtually every human \nrights group, every church group, every medical group, veterans and \nothers, have called for passage of this, is because they know the \nthreat exists, not during the battle, the threat exists for decades \nafterwards.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 57 seconds. The \nSenator from South Carolina, 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let us go ahead and vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment, No. 2124.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Gregg], the Senator from Indiana, \n[Mr. Lugar], and the Senator from Alaska, [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                 usuhs\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is an issue relating to the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences which I would like \nto raise with the senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn].\n  As the Senator knows, I have advocated closing down the Uniformed \nServices University of the Health Sciences because I feel there are \nmore cost-effective means of supplying our military with physicians. I \nhave introduced legislation to close the school both in the 103rd \nCongress and in the 104th Congress.\n  This Administration, and previous administrations, have advocated \nclosing USUHS and legislation has passed in the other body to \naccomplish this purpose.\n  During last year's consideration of the fiscal year 1995 Defense \nAuthorization bill, I was prepared to offer an amendment, based on the \nlegislation I have introduced, that would have phased-down USUHS. \nHowever, as the Senator from Georgia recalls, pursuant to an agreement \nwith the distinguished Senator, as well as the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. \nInouye] and the Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], I instead agreed \nto a provision directing the General Accounting Office to review \ncertain aspects of USUHS, and to report back by June 1, 1995, in time \nfor this coming fiscal year's cycle of Defense authorization and \nappropriation bills.\n  As the Senator knows, the GAO did not complete its work by the \nstatutory deadline, and the resulting delay means that the USUHS study \nwill not be finished in time for floor consideration of the fiscal year \n1996 Defense Authorization bill.\n  Even though I am satisfied that there are more cost-effective \nalternatives to USUHS for our military's physicians, given the \nagreement we made last year, and the subsequent delay in the GAO's \nwork, I am withholding offering an amendment with respect to the \nmedical school at this time.\n  However, I want to make it very clear that I believe it is critical \nthat this issue be confronted by the Congress in the very near future. \nGiven the pressure to achieve a balanced budget, programs like USUHS \nare increasingly difficult to justify. Year after year, USUHS appears \non target lists for elimination for this very reason.\n  In light of the fact that the GAO report is expected to be presented \nnext month, there will be additional opportunities to revisit this \nissue before the end of the session. I hope the committee will joint me \nin pressing GAO to make sure there is no further delay in completion of \nits assignment.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his comments on this \nmatter. I know he has had concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the \nUniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and I understand \nhis frustration with the delay in the GAO's review of the school.\n  I also want to thank the Senator for approaching this issue in a \nstraightforward and thorough manner. I think it is appropriate for this \nbody to have the benefit of the GAO's work before acting on the school, \nand I appreciate the Senator from Wisconsin's willingness to wait for \nthat anaylsis.\n  I assure the Senator that I fully support his resolve to have GAO \ncomplete its report at the earliest possible time so that the Congress \ncan have the benefit of its input during this session, as \n\n[[Page S 11427]]\ncontemplated in the agreement relating to the Senator from Wisconsin's \namendment regarding USUHS.\n\n\n need for a congressional debate on national security requirements in \n                            the 21st century\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout my view of the role of Congress in shaping the debate on our \nfuture national security.\n  The Congress is accustomed to dealing with national defense policy \nand funding in the context of annual authorization and appropriations \nbills, and in the process, we often lose sight of the framework in \nwhich our deliberations play such an important part. Today, because of \nthe great volatility and complexity of relations among nations, it is \nimperative that we broaden our focus to reassess the role of the United \nStates and its military forces in the world in the next century.\n  After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was clear that a \nreassessment of U.S. national security strategy and military forces was \nneeded. The Bush Administration undertook a preliminary reassessment of \nour strategy and proposed the first wave of reductions in military \nforce levels, termed the new base force. Then, in 1993, Secretary of \nDefense Les Aspin attempted to initiate and innovative and much-needed \nanalysis of our military force structure in light of the changes \nbrought about by the end of the cold war.\n  The concept of the Bottom Up Review [BUR] was excellent; \nunfortunately, the result was not as innovative as many had hoped. What \nwas advertised as a critical review and reshaping of a new military \nforce instead became just another top down review, unduly limited by \nfiscal constraints and bureaucratic inertia. It became largely an \nexercise in defending existing force levels and composition within \nestablished levels for future defense budgets, rather than a new \napproach to military strategy and requirements in a changed world. To \ncomplicate matters further, independent assessments of the cost of the \nBUR force show that it exceeds the funding levels in the Future Years \nDefense Program [FYDP] by $42 to $488 billion.\n  What is needed today is another attempt at conducting a bottom up \nreview, but this time, we must not artificially and arbitrarily limit \nthe scope of the study. We certainly cannot ignore the fiscal realities \nof our debt-ridden Federal Government, but we would be foolish to \npredetermine the defense budgets of the future in conducting this \nanalysis. Instead, we should follow a logical thought process, starting \nwith an analysis of potential threats, formulation of a strategy to \ndeal with those threats, and a determination of force structure \nrequirements, which should then drive resource allocation decisions.\n  I should note the significant work already undertaken in this area by \nthe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Earlier this \nyear, CSIS published a document entitled ``Defense in the Late 1990s: \nAvoiding the Train Wreck'', which concluded as follows:\n\n       . . . there is a profound crisis in security planning and \n     the near certainty of a defense ``train wreck'' should the \n     U.S. defense program continue on its present course, that is, \n     inadequate funding of a force too large for the limited \n     objectives for which the administration seeks to employ \n     military power.\n\nThe report states that insufficient defense budget levels combined with \na flawed foreign policy approach have isolated the United States from \nits allies and friends.\n  As a nation, we face the challenge of defining the role of the United \nStates in a world of continually shifting alliances and relationships. \nWe face the challenge of moving beyond tactics and philosophies \ndeveloped painstakingly to counter the apocalyptic threats of cold war \nadversaries. We face the challenge of planning for future threats in a \nworld where the only constant is uncertainty. Finally, we face the \nchallenge of sustaining or, in the view of some, regaining the courage \nto lead.\n  The Congress has an important oversight role in this process, well \nbeyond the familiar but narrow choices between funding one program or \nanother with the limited resources available for defense. We should \nbegin to think about these ``big picture'' issues--identifying \npotential future threats, developing a national security strategy to \naddress them, and building the right mix of forces to implement that \nstrategy.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to outline very \nbriefly some important points to consider as we study the issue of our \nnational security posture in the 21st century.\n  The threats of the future fall into four general categories: the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem, the rise of radical Islamic fundamentalism, and the increase in \nregional and ethnic conflicts. Another area of concern is electronic \nand information warfare, where the potential for disrupting global \ncommunications and world trade could rest in the hands of one \nindividual.\n  Clearly, these potential threats are more diverse, less deterrable \nthrough conventional means, and less easily defeated. Our potential \nadversaries are less easily identified, as are our allies. We have seen \nover the past decade that the adversary of today may become the ally of \ntomorrow. This uncertainty requires\n a national strategy that broadly encompasses our national interests \nand goals, yet is quickly adaptable to changes in the threats to \nfacilitate early and effective action to defuse any potential crisis.\n\n  Finally, our military must be designed as a ``cache of capabilities'' \nfrom which an appropriate response to any threat to our security can be \nformulated. An appropriate response is one designed to affect the \noutcome of a situation in a manner favorable to our national interests \nand objectives. An appropriate response need not always entail the \ndeployment of U.S. military personnel. Instead, an appropriate response \nmight be as simple as redirecting overhead reconnaissance assets, \nproviding precision-guided munitions and targeting data, selected \nintelligence-sharing, or providing military planning assistance.\n  Selectively and correctly utilizing our unique capabilities and \ntalents may allow us to leverage the outcome of a conflict, without \nrequiring the commitment of American lives and capital in an ongoing \ncrisis. Acquiring the specialized capabilties--the tools--that would \npermit this type of selective response will allow our leaders to create \nand deploy a trained and equipped force, when necessary, or to tailor a \nlesser commitment of U.S. technological expertise to effectively defend \nagainst any threat scenario and to respond to any potential type of \ncrisis.\n  To this end, I suggest a series of questions which must be answered \nif we are to plan properly the force of the future.\n  Two Major Regional Contingencies (MRCs) versus New World Disorder. Is \nthe BUR force too rigidly structured for the two-MRC scenario? Can the \nBUR force respond to the potential threats of the future? Does the two-\nMRC strategy deal effectively with the financial and readiness drain of \nOperations Other Than War (OOTW), as well as the political difficulties \nof abandoning OOTW to respond to two MRCs? Is the two--MRC planning \nconcept broad enough to cover the wide variety of challenges that \ntoday's world is likely to generate?\n  Airpower. What role doe we expect tactical air forces to play in \nfuture conflicts? How should we conduct battle management and optimize \nthe use of these resources? Which munitions should be procured? What \ntype and mix of aircraft platforms are most likely to be required in \nthe future?\n  Naval Forces. What type of Naval force will be required to counter \nfuture threats? What will be the lead ship of tomorrow's Naval Battle \nGroup? How should we distribute emphasis among ship platforms?\n  Army Modernization. How long can the Army maintain its readiness with \nonly upgrades and modifications of existing\n equipment? What is planned and scheduled for procurement in the \nfuture?\n\n  Expeditionary Forces. Will the expeditionary force truly become a \n``911'' force? What equipment will expeditionary forces require? Will \nwe find ourselves facing more deployment requirements than we have \nforces available? How will expeditionary forces adapt to joint \noperations, and how will other services adapt themselves to support \nthese forces?\n  Reserve Forces. What is the appropriate role of the reserve \ncomponents? \n\n[[Page S 11428]]\nShould we cease funding units that have proven to be undeployable in \ntimes of crisis? Should we restructure the missions assigned to the \nreserves to focus on activities that are directly related to civilian \noccupations, such as airlift, medical support, public affairs and \ninformation services? Should we move noncombat support functions into \nthe reserve, maintaining only combat and combat support missions for \nactive duty personnel.\n  Recapitalization versus Readiness. What are we doing to balance near-\nterm readiness requirements against our need for future modernization? \nWhat is our R strategy? Are we correctly differentiating between \nmodification and modernization of existing systems, and next generation \nsystems?\n  Missile Defenses. What emphasis needs to be placed into funding this \ncategory and with what priority? What threat will be posed to the \nUnited States and our allies and friends by ballistic missiles in the \nfuture and how will we respond? Will defense of allies from ballistic \nmissiles require us to maintain Aegis upper tier ships on station in \nthe same manner as we now maintain carrier forces abroad?\n  Nonproliferation and Counter Proliferation. Are our non-proliferation \npolicies and programs effective? What improvements should be \nundertaken? Will we emphasize unilateral or multilateral efforts to \ncontrol proliferation? What programs are required to protect against \nthe failure of nonproliferation policies?\n  Nuclear Weapons. What role will nuclear weapons have in the near-\nterm? The far-term? What is the most effective means of eliminating the \nneed for nuclear weapons, and of monitoring other nation's nuclear \nforces? How should we plan for their eventual elimination? How should \nwe plan to maintain safe and reliable nuclear weapons until they are no \nlonger necessary?\n  Industrial Base. What goods or services are unique to military \nreadiness that cannot be supplied by the private sector, immediately or \nrelatively quickly? What can not be provided for by a freemarket?\n                              Base Closure\n\n  When should we mandate another round of base closings? Do we need to \nsee the shape of the future military before proceeding with further \nclosures? Do we really understand how to close bases and achieve \nsavings? How can we improve the current process to respond better to \nthe needs of both the military and the local communities?\n  With these questions in mind, we must now step up to the task of \nanswering them, and the many other important issues that I have not \nmentioned. In its oversight role, the Congress shares in the \nresponsibility of providing adequate forces, properly trained and \nequipped to deal with whatever consequences a changing world portends \nfor the United States. We have an opportunity to chart a new course for \nnational security, and we cannot afford inaction when offered a chance \nto abandon ``business as usual''.\n  Starting this fall, I plan to undertake a series of hearings in the \nReadiness Subcommittee to explore the questions discussed above. The \nobjective of the hearings would be to formulate recommendations for a \nnational security strategy and military force structure for the 21st \ncentury.\n  This year, the Readiness Subcommittee held several broad-based \nhearings entitled ``Readiness 2001'' which were designed to assess the \nreadiness of our current force to meeting the projected threats of the \nfuture. The results of those hearings were not encouraging. We must \nrecognize, as we approach the watershed of the next century, that our \nmilitary forces cannot remain static in a changing world. The hearings \nI am proposing for this fall will attempt to divine an appropriate \nforce structure for the future at an affordable price.\n  I believe the subcommittee should solicit testimony from a wide \nvariety of national security experts, like the CSIS, as well as \nAdministration officials, to ensure all viewpoints are considered. \nWhile I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this matter with \nChairman Thurmond, I look forward to working with him and with the \nother subcommittee chairmen with expertise in many of these areas.\n  As we undertake this effort to develop a new national security \nvision, we must recognize that we will fail the American public if we \ncontinue to ignore the reality of decreasing defense funding. Because \nof the need to balance the federal budget and reduce our nation's \nmassive federal debt, the debate in the future will focus ever more \nnarrowly on ``guns versus butter''. I believe that, when the \nsubcommittee's review is complete, we may well find that less money is \nneeded to maintain a smaller, smarter military force that can adapt to \nthe changing threats to our security in the future.\n  We cannot continue to fund every new program with a unique or \ninteresting capability. Instead, we must thoroughly assess the threats \nfacing our nation, determine our national security interests, and then \ncarefully select only those programs which are directly relevant to \nprotecting those interests and which are affordable in the future.\n  If we do not make the hard choices in entering into commitments with \nour allies and friends, and if we then fail to prioritize among weapons \nsystems to enable us to support those commitments, we will fail in our \nmost basic responsibility--protecting the security of the American \npeople.\n\n\n                               elk hills\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, S. 1026, in compliance with the Budget \nResolution, requires selling the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 \n(Elk Hills) no later than the end of fiscal year 1996. The \nAdministration recommended that the sale take place over at least two \nyears to ensure enough time to finalize the equity shares, conduct an \noutside evaluation of the quantity of hydrocarbons in the reserve and \nthe value to the taxpayers, and carry out a competitive bidding \nprocess. I commend Senator Bingaman for his efforts in the amendment he \ncosponsored with Senators mcCain and Campbell to title XXXIII of the \nbill to ensure that the government will receive full value for the \nassets when sold. The Elk Hills property currently generates net \nrevenues to the Treasury in excess of $400 million a year. I hope the \nArmed Services Committee and the Senate as a whole will take a hard \nlook during the reconciliation process at how this extremely valuable \nnational asset is sold in order to meet near term budget goals.\n                           Amendment No. 2112\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am in strong support of the Exon-Hatfield \namendment to strike the $50 million authorization for hydronuclear \ntesting. This provision is a waste of money and is not necessary, and \ncould potentially damage our ability to achieve a truly Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.\n  Many of my colleagues have cited the report released yesterday by the \nJASONs--the country's top nuclear experts--who find that ``a \npersuasive case has not been made for the utility of hydronuclear tests \nfor detecting small changes in the performance margins for current U.S. \nweapons.'' After one thousand nuclear tests over 50 years, we have \nsufficient experience from which to assess the safety and reliability \nof our nuclear stockpile.\n  As I read the study, the conclusion is clear--we do not need \nhydronuclear testing. Any benefits that could be derived from further \ntesting are resoundingly dwarfed by the benefits to our security \nachieved through a comprehensive test ban. The arguments for \nhydronuclear testing relate to technical measurements and scientific \ncuriosity. The arguments against it relate to nonproliferation and the \nlong-term security of the United States and the world. There simply is \nno reason for this program.\n  Mr. President, I urge support for the Exon-Hatfield amendment, and \nfor a true comprehensive test ban.\n\n\n                        military exchange stores\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, section 372 of Senate Bill 1026 \nproposes to eliminate certain restrictions on the purchases and sale of \nitems in military exchange stores. In particular, the bill prohibits \nany restriction on cost, prices, categories, or size of items offered \nfor sale. I strongly oppose this provision, as does the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses which represents small business \nowners nationwide.\n  While I initially intended to offer an amendment to strike this \nsection of the bill, I have since spoken with Senator Coats who is \nchairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. \nI am confidant that the chairman understands my \n\n[[Page S 11429]]\nconcerns and that they will be addressed in conference. In the interest \nof making progress in completing action on this bill, I will not offer \nmy amendment. I would, however, like to briefly express my concerns \nabout section 372 of this bill.\n  If enacted as currently written, this bill would permit a military \nexchange to sell virtually any product. As it stands, a military \nexchange does not have to pay rent, pay taxes on revenue, or obtain \nlocal licenses. Without these requirements typically faced by private \nstore owners, a military exchange enjoys an unfair competitive \nadvantage. In addition, because a military exchange does not collect \nState sales tax, local businesses are further disadvantaged.\n  As a consequence of this preferential treatment, private businesses \ncannot afford to offer the same low prices as a military exchange. If--\nas this bill would allow--a military exchange is permitted to sell a \nvirtually unlimited variety of products at prices which are lower than \nthose available at comparable private sector stores, then the \nconsequences for small business owners will be devastating.\n  I believe that the existing regulations--while not perfect--do impose \nsome restrictions to protect local private sector vendors against \nunfair competition from military exchanges. At the same time, existing \nregulations also ensure that military personnel have access to \nnecessary goods at reasonable prices. I am grateful to my friend and \ncolleague Senator Coats for working with me to address my concerns.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if the managers might be in the position to \nindicate now if they have any opportunity to find out how many \namendments are remaining and if we can reach some agreement on the \nnumber of amendments.\n  As I understand, there are no amendments on this side. Well, I think \ntwo exceptions--one, I think, may be part of the managers' amendment; \none may be offered by the Senator from Colorado. He has been \nnegotiating with the other side. So, I would say at most there are \nmaybe two or three amendments on this side of the aisle.\n  I do want to commend the managers. We wasted 5 hours yesterday on \nthis bill. Then we had 7 hours--was that yesterday?--so long ago, the \nday before, I guess. We had 7 hours on one amendment. So I think if you \ntake out those 12 hours, we made a lot of progress on this bill. But I \nget the strange feeling that there are a number of people on the other \nside who do not want the bill to ever pass. If that is the case, they \nmight as well be up front about it, and we can take the next step.\n  So we are down to about at least two or three amendments on this \nside.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I do not know, I guess I would have to go \nback and look and see how many amendments are offered every year on \nthis bill normally. I would guess it is somewhere between 80 and 100.\n  I have been able to poll most of our colleagues. Two or three are not \nhere and had specifically listed a number of amendments. But we have \nbeen able to tabulate the number. It is at least 41. And to my \nknowledge, except for Senator Bingaman, there are no Senators on our \nside who are prepared tonight to enter into a time agreement.\n  So, this bill will be debated for some time to come, if each of these \nSenators can be accommodated. But that is where we are right now.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would say, as far as absent Senators, if we are going to \nstart accommodating absent Senators, we will never get anything done \naround here. We accommodated Senator Bumpers because of the special \ncircumstance. I understand Senator Pryor has an amendment on the bill \ntomorrow. We are trying to accommodate him because of an illness in the \nfamily. I am not suggesting that.\n  But if absent Senators are going to determine what the rest of us do \nwho stay here, then we will never finish any bill. But it is pretty \nclear from the leader there is no intention to let us pass this bill. \nThat follows the pattern we have had all year long, to slow down every \ntime you get close. ``Wait a minute. Let's don't pass this. We don't \nlike the ABM vote. We don't like some of the other votes.'' It makes it \nvery difficult for the majority leader, whether it happens to be a \nDemocrat or Republican, when there is no cooperation.\n  And we do not have much leverage except for nominations and other \nthings that we can hold up. And we will do that. We will do that. But I \nwould rather work something out where we do precisely--can we get a \nlist of the 41 amendments? That would be fewer than the 105 amendments \nwe had earlier. Can you identify the 41 amendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think we would be prepared to list them. In fact, they \nare listed.\n  Mr. DOLE. It says ``relevant.''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is as good as we can do. We cannot list the \nspecific issues in some cases because the Senators have not been \nprepared to list them tonight. No one told them tonight they had to \nlist exactly what the topic is or the time agreement of which they \nwould have to debate the amendment. All they were required to do is \nlist the fact that they were relevant. They have done that. We are \nprepared to give that list to the majority leader and go from there.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will somebody hand it to me? Who has it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We are going to have to work through the longer list \nthat we had. We have been able to get to the point where I think we \nhave a list of 41.\n  Mr. DOLE. We ought to vote tonight. Are there any amendments on this \nside that we can get a time agreement on?\n  Does the Senator from Arizona have an amendment? We will work on this \nside of the aisle, if they do not want to work on that side of the \naisle.\n  The Senator can offer his amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. I can say to the majority leader one little note of at \nleast slight encouragement. There has been a crosswalk between the ones \nthat we have both been working on to clear and the 41 listed. We have \n16 that we know we cleared on both sides. We can handle those tonight. \nAnd we have 10 more that we are working on to clear. That is 26 total \namendments. The last 10 have not all been cleared. Some of them--we \nthink that most of them will be cleared. So that is 26 amendments. We \nhave a correlation between that list and the 41 amendments listed here. \nThat can be done. When it is done you can have a different picture. You \ncan have, instead of 41 amendments, you could conceivably have half \nthat number.\n And that gets within reach.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. There were about 18 cleared last night. It is not that we \nhave not taken care of a lot of amendments for, I guess, Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. I think the managers are prepared to look at \nothers, if they can be negotiated; is that correct?\n  Mr. NUNN. Right.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not know what the correlation is. Are there amendments \non this side of the aisle?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, I am prepared to offer one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2125\n\n (Purpose: To clarify restrictions on assistance to Pakistan and other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment. I send it to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2125.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section--\n\n     SEC.   . CLARIFICATION OF RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       Subsection (e) of section 620E of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195) is amended:\n       (1) by striking the words ``No assistance'' and inserting \n     the words ``No military assistance'';\n       (2) by striking the words ``in which assistance is to be \n     furnished or military equipment or technology'' and inserting \n     the words \n\n[[Page S 11430]]\n     ``in which military assistance is to be furnished or military equipment \n     or technology''; and\n       (3) by striking the words ``the proposed United States \n     assistance'' and inserting the words ``the proposed United \n     States military assistance''.\n       (4) by adding the following new paragraph:\n       (2) The prohibitions in this section do not apply to any \n     assistance or transfer provided for the purposes of:\n       (A) International narcotics control (including Chapter 8 of \n     Part I of this Act) or any provision of law available for \n     providing assistance for counternarcotics purposes;\n       (B) Facilitating military-to-military contact, training \n     (including Chapter 5 of Part II of this Act) and humanitarian \n     and civic assistance projects;\n       (C) Peacekeeping and other multilateral operations \n     (including Chapter 6 of Part II of this Act relating to \n     peacekeeping) or any provision of law available for providing \n     assistance for peacekeeping purposes, except that lethal \n     military equipment shall be provided on a lease or loan basis \n     only and shall be returned upon completion of the operation \n     for which it was provided;\n       (D) Antiterrorism assistance (including Chapter 8 of Part \n     II of this Act relating to antiterrorism assistance) or any \n     provision of law available for antiterrorism assistance \n     purposes;\n       (5) by adding the following new subsections at the end--\n       (f) Storage Costs.--The President may release the \n     Government of Pakistan of its contractual obligation to pay \n     the United States Government for the storage costs of items \n     purchased prior to October 1, 1990, but not delivered by the \n     United States Government pursuant to subsection (e) and may \n     reimburse the Government of Pakistan for any such amounts \n     paid, on such terms and conditions as the President may \n     prescribe, provided that such payments have no budgetary \n     impact.\n       (g) Return of Military Equipment.--The President may return \n     to the Government of Pakistan military equipment paid for and \n     delivered to Pakistan and subsequently transferred for repair \n     or upgrade to the United States but not returned to Pakistan \n     pursuant to subsection (e). Such equipment or its equivalent \n     may be returned to the Government of Pakistan provided that \n     the President determines and so certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that such equipment or equivalent \n     neither constitutes nor has received any significant \n     qualitative upgrade since being transferred to the United \n     States.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is not the amendment I hoped to offer \nearly this evening. I hoped to offer a comprehensive settlement of the \noutstanding question we have with Pakistan, and that results over a \n$1.4 billion paid to us for military hardware which has not been \ndelivered because of restrictions and sanctions under our current law.\n  They are in the circumstance of--one of our best allies and most \nfaithful friends--having paid their money, $1.4 billion, but not \ndelivered the equipment that they paid for. I am sure every Member is \nuncomfortable with treating a friend that way.\n  There is, indeed, a reason for those sanctions. They relate to our \nfirm commitment as a country to nonproliferation. I do not rise to \nexpress concern about that. But that aspect of our settlement with \nPakistan is in dispute. There are Members who feel very strongly that \nany compromise on the shipment of military hardware is inappropriate. \nSo I have not chosen to offer that aspect.\n  All that is offered in this amendment is the exact language that came \nout of the Foreign Relations Committee. It passed 16 to 2. We have been \nassured by the interested parties, at least most of them, that they do \nnot object to it. What it includes is an authorization for cooperation \nwith Pakistan for the suppression of the narcotics trade.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, that effort of suppressing the----\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senate is still not in order. Will Senators take their \nseats?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \ntake their seats. Please take conversations off the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, that effort of suppressing the narcotics \ntrade is very much in our country's interest. It talks about allowing \nus to proceed in dealing with them in terms of suppressing terrorism. \nThat effort is very much in our country's interest.\n  Two things I think are worth emphasizing. This amendment does not in \nany way deliver the disputed arms that are subject to debate and which \nI hope to offer at a different time. It does not in any way repeal the \nPressler amendment, and its restrictions on military sales continue on. \nBut it does in the economic area try and allow discourse between the \ncountries that we think is important.\n  OPIC is allowed to operate, suppression of narcotics is allowed to \noperate in our cooperative programs, efforts to suppress terrorism are \nallowed to operate with those programs. This was considered in depth by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. It was passed out on a vote I believe \nof 16 to 2.\n  Mr. President, I want to simply add one other thing. We have a \ndispute with Pakistan. It is based on very sincere and important \ngrounds. But it is also important that we have a way of continuing \nrelations with that country. They are a country that has stood by the \nUnited States through thick and thin. They were there when it counted \nfor us.\n  Some may remember when Francis Gary Powers flew his observation \nmissions over the Soviet Union. It was from Pakistan that his plane \ntook off.\n  Some may remember that the United States, when it sought to build \nSEATO, found one of its first members in Pakistan at a time when other \ncountries in the region were lucky to align themselves with the United \nStates.\n  Some may remember the pivotal war in Afghanistan that preceded the \nfall of the Soviet Empire. Pakistan put themselves and their country on \nthe line for us when that came about.\n  Time after time after time, when the United States has sought help \nfrom Pakistan, they have been there to work with us.\n  When we asked for troops to cooperate in Somalia, it was Pakistan who \ncame forward and sent their troops and, incidentally, suffered large \ncasualties. When we talked about troops in Bosnia, they came forward. \nWhen we talked about troops in Haiti where there were not a lot of \nvolunteers, Pakistan came forward.\n  I mention all these things, Mr. President, because while there is a \ndispute and a legitimate dispute about whether or not those arms should \nbe delivered, there should not be a dispute that is to our advantage to \nhave some discourse with Pakistan. There should not be a dispute that \nthey have been good friends through difficult times.\n  All Members may remember the threats that the leaders of the Soviet \nUnion issued against Pakistan, and yet they stood firm by this country \nthroughout the cold war.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a very small step. It only deals with \neconomic matters, basically, but it is important, I think, as a step of \nmoving toward developing a continuing relationship with one of \nAmerica's oldest and dearest friends.\n  I might mention at this point the words of President Clinton as he \nshared them with the Prime Minister of Pakistan. President Clinton \nsaid:\n\n       I don't think what happened was fair to Pakistan in terms \n     of money . . . I don't think it is right for us to keep the \n     money and the equipment. That is not right. And I am going to \n     try to find a resolution to it. I don't like it.\n\n  The President is referring to the payment of $1.4 billion and not \ngetting the equipment and not getting their money back. That is now \nresolved by this amendment. But to let this moment pass without any \neffort to extend our hand in friendship to Pakistan, without any effort \nto recognize that this is a relationship that we should not throw away, \nI think, would be a mistake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support this proposal to make \nwhole our obligations to Pakistan, a country which is an ally of the \nUnited States.\n  The Pressler amendment halted the transfer of F-16 planes and other \nmilitary equipment for which the Government of Pakistan has paid in \nfull. I believe we have an obligation to equitably resolve this \noutstanding transaction.\n  Mr. President, I want the United States to be seen as a country that \nkeeps its word. We entered into a contract with Pakistan to sell \nmilitary equipment, and we accepted more than $1 billion for that \nequipment. Likewise, the United States has made it quite clear that we \nwill not do business with countries that proliferate. We all understand \nthat the transfer of the F-16's cannot be completed because Pakistan \nhas chosen not to work with the United \n\n[[Page S 11431]]\nStates on proliferation issues. However, the United States cannot \ncontinue to retain both the planes and the money.\n  Since the sale cannot be completed, I believe we have an obligation \nto come to an agreement to reimburse the government people of Pakistan. \nThe President has offered a thoughtful proposal, which is being offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Colorado. I support this proposal to \nprovide recompense the people of Pakistan.\n  This proposal does not send the F-16 planes to Pakistan. The \nadministration will seek an alternate buyer for the planes, and only \nafter the sale is completed will the proceeds be forwarded to Pakistan. \nThis proposal also transfers to Pakistan the $370 million in other \nmilitary equipment, which, I am told, will not alter the balance of \npower in the region.\n  Mr. President, I believe this proposal is fair. It is certainly just. \nI will vote in favor of the Brown amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I reluctantly must rise in opposition to \nthis amendment. Let me say that in 1985, when we adopted the Pressler \namendment, it was supported by Pakistan. Frankly, it was the Reagan \nadministration's amendment to settle the dispute. At the time, Pakistan \nsaid they had no nuclear program, and the Foreign Relations Committee \nwas considering the Cranston amendment to shut off aid. My colleagues \nwill recall the Carter administration had previously shut off aid. Our \nformer colleague from California had sought a complete cut-off. This \namendment, which conditioned aid on an annual certification, was a \ncompromise put forth by the Reagan administration. George Bush was very \nmuch involved in it, and Pakistan supported the original so-called \nPressler amendment.\n  At that point, they began buying planes and other military equipment \nknowing that they, at the same time, were developing nuclear weapons. \nBut they were telling George Bush in his trips over there just the \nopposite. George Bush was very disturbed about this matter.\n  When he became President in 1990, the United States CIA had certified \nthat Pakistan, in fact, had been lying and had a nuclear weapon. I know \nPakistan has done a lot of things for us. I have been in there many \ntimes and want to be friends with the Pakistanis. But the fact of the \nmatter is we acted in good faith. We adopted an amendment they asked us \nto adopt, and it was Reagan administration policy.\n  Then at that point in time, in 1990, we could no longer deliver a \nprevious order of military equipment under an agreement that they \nsought with us. And that is how the now infamous fleet of F-16's came \nto be parked on the tarmac. Those planes were part of a $1.4 billion \ncontract of military equipment that was made prior to the Pressler \namendment, but could not be delivered after Pressler was invoked.\n  Recently, I proposed a plan so that the Pakistanis could be paid back \ntheir money. I proposed that the President of the United States could \noffer for sale these planes to Taiwan or to the Philippines or to \nanother third party, and the President has done this. That is a \npositive step. That is moving forward. The rationale for not seeking \ntheir delivery is obvious: F-16's are nuclear delivery vehicles. We \nwould be more than waiving the Pressler amendment if the F-16's were \ndelivered. We would be striking at the very heart of our Nation's \nnonproliferation policy.\n  I have been critical of both India and Pakistan in the nuclear area. \nIn recent weeks, we have received more disturbing news: The New York \nTimes and Defense News reported last month that Pakistan received from \nCommunist China key components that could be used in M-11 ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Without question, a nuclear war between India and Pakistan would be \ncataclysmic. The names of the perpetrators and their accessories would \nbe cursed for a millennium. To its credit, Mr. President, the U.S. \nSenate has taken the initiative to promote peace and stability in South \nAsia, and the core of that is the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  A decade ago, under the chairmanship of the Senator from Indiana \n[Senator Lugar], we voted to adopt an amendment that allowed United \nStates aid to Pakistan to continue as long as the President can certify \nthat Pakistan was not in possession of a nuclear device. That is how \nthis came about. Why did the committee, and ultimately the Congress, \ntake this action? Pakistan was the third-largest recipient of United \nStates foreign assistance, receiving as much as $600 million annually. \nPakistan was, and is today, an ally of the United States. The brave \npeople of Pakistan were instrumental in channeling resources to Afghan \nrefugees and rebels as they sought to repel Soviet invaders. United \nStates officials rightly were concerned that the Government in \nIslamabad was interested in developing a nuclear weapon, a course of \naction not in our national interest.\n  Therefore, given the vast amounts of United States aid made available \nto Pakistan, we believe that the threat could be used to further two \npolicy goals: First, to give Pakistan an incentive to ensure that the \nnuclear program serves a peaceful purpose, or the American people will \nstop subsidizing Pakistan. In short, the so-called Pressler amendment \nwas designed to send one message: Nuclear proliferation has a price.\n  In addition, I urge my colleagues to look at some of the recent \nintelligence reports. I might say that there is available a transcript \nin this building of a recent briefing for Senators on Pakistan by the \nCIA. Obviously, I cannot state what that said. But I will say what the \nNew York Times and Defense News reported last month--that Pakistan has \nbeen receiving from Communist China key components that can be used in \nmaking M-11 ballistic missiles.\n  To conclude my argument, it is this. This was an amendment that \nPakistan asked for in good faith. George Bush went over and met with \nthem when he was Vice President. He was very involved in this \namendment. This was a Reagan-Bush amendment. And the truth has not been \ntold and is still not being told today. That is the problem we have \nhere.\n  I wish it were otherwise because I want to have good relations with \nboth Pakistan and India. I have traveled to Pakistan and India several \ntimes. This problem will go on and on until the Pakistanis are willing \nto be honest with us in our dealings and to say what our intelligence \npeople say and has been published in the New York Times and Defense \nNews, and so I must very reluctantly oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I appreciate the Senator's leadership on this issue and \nhis speaking out. My hope is to at least identify where the concerns \nare. Subparagraph (A) makes it clear that the prohibitions in the law \ndescribed in the Pressler amendment do not apply to international \nnarcotics control. This would allow us to cooperate with them in \ncontrolling international narcotics.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I have no problem with that, but the larger problem is \nthat we are not seeking any concessions from Pakistan on the \nnonproliferation front.\n  Mr. BROWN. That is one of the primary functions. The second one--I \nthink, the second most important--is making it clear that the Pressler \namendment would not prohibit peacekeeping and other multilateral \noperations. Paragraph (B)----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Facilitating military-to-military contact, training--\nincluding chapter 5 of par II of this act--and humanitarian and civic \nassistance projects.\n  I think that has to go into Senator Mitch McConnell's appropriations \nSubcommittee on Foreign Ooperations. I believe if we have the time to \nstudy this and the other proposal we discussed in private, we could \nresolve this issue.\n  Mr. BROWN. Part B, as I read it, facilitating military-to-military \ncontact, training, and humanitarian and civic assistance projects.\n  Would the Senator have concerns about allowing military-to-military \ncontact for the purposes of civic assistance projects?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. It depends on what the training means. If it is limited \nto humanitarian and civic assistance projects, I personally would not \nhave a problem.\n\n[[Page S 11432]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN. That is the intent. Under (C) it says, ``Peacekeeping and \nother multilateral operations--or any provisions of law available for \nproviding assistance for peacekeeping purposes.''\n  Does the Senator object to us being allowed to cooperate with the \nPakistanis for the purpose of peacekeeping purposes?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No, of course not. Once again, we are getting no \nconcessions from Pakistan in the area of nuclear non-proliferation. I \nam basically opposed to this because it is unconditional. We are \ngetting no concessions on nonproliferation. Indeed, according to what \nis happening, we are getting less cooperation lately. You can go \nthrough each of the lines, but the larger, fundamental problem remains.\n  Mr. BROWN. I mention that because this is not military, does not \ninvolve a package of military equipment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. It says, ``The President may return to the Government \nof Pakistan military equipment paid for and delivered to Pakistan and \nsubsequently transferred for repair or upgrade.'' So we are getting \ninto a whole host of things here.\n  Mr. BROWN. Well, if I----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I think we can get a solution if we sought the \nassistance of the Senator from Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, and his \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations. I believe we can work on this \nthrough him. Again, I am opposed to it because it is unconditional. We \nare getting no concessions.\n  Mr. BROWN. Would the Senator allow me to clarify the point he raised?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Well, there is another question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to get recognition in my \nown right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to speak in a broader \ncontext with respect to this issue, because I think there is a failure \nto understand the Pressler amendment and what it did.\n  The Pressler amendment, at its time, was a special exception for \nPakistan. The Pressler amendment, at its time--the consequence of it \nwas to enable the United States Government to send aid to Pakistan, \nwhich otherwise would have been prohibited since the nonproliferation \nlaw said that there was no United States aid to any country that \ndelivers or receives nuclear materials or technology, except under IAEA \nsupervision and safeguards.\n  Now, what the Pressler amendment allowed was a special exception just \nfor Pakistan that allowed the President to waive the law if he \ncertified that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device, and \nthat United States aid would reduce the risk that Pakistan would get \none. No other country received this special waiver.\n  Subsequently, through the 1980's, there were other special waivers \nfor Pakistan from the nonproliferation laws. I say to the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado that maybe the American taxpayers should get back \nthe money they gave to Pakistan during this period, on the premise that \nPakistan would not go nuclear. That was the premise. And the Pressler \namendment allowed this aid to flow from 1985, when the Pressler \namendment went into effect, through 1990, when President Bush concluded \nhe could no longer make this certification that Pakistan did not \npossess a nuclear explosive device. The Pressler amendment allowed $3.3 \nbillion in direct U.S. aid to flow to Pakistan, even though Pakistan \nhad violated our nonproliferation laws. Over $2 billion of that aid \nfrom 1985 to 1990 went to buy weapons. And the express purpose of \nmaking that money available to buy weapons for Pakistan was so that it \nwould not need or seek nuclear weapons. In other words, the deal was \nthat we do not want you to go nuclear. We know you are acquiring \nnuclear materials and technology, not conforming to the \nnonproliferation laws, but we are going to provide this military aid in \norder to keep you from going nuclear. That was the deal.\n  Now, the Pressler amendment was clearly explained, it was fully \npublicized. Pakistan knew the consequences if it decided to pursue \nnuclear weapons, despite our aid and our warnings. Yet, what they did \nis they took the money--almost $3.5 billion over this 5-year period, \nand more than $2 billion in military aid--and, at the same time, went \nnuclear.\n  This has to be understood because it is portrayed as though some \nterrible unfairness were done and he even quoted the President to that \neffect. But the fact of the matter is, is that the Pressler amendment, \nat its time, gave Pakistan an exception to the nonproliferation law.\n  The premise was we will provide them very significant economic and \nmilitary assistance, seek to strengthen them, greatly enhance their \nconventional defensive posture as part of a deal that they not go \nnuclear.\n  As long as the President could continue to certify that they did not \nhave a nuclear explosive device, they would continue to receive \nassistance.\n  Now, what happened is in 1990 President Bush finally said, ``I can't \ncertify this any longer. I can't certify it.'' They have gone to a \nnuclear device, contrary to the deal that was contained in the Pressler \namendment. I invite the Senator from South Dakota, if I am misstating \nthe situation, to correct it.\n  As a consequence, what Pakistan did, they accepted this aid and they \ncontinued their nuclear program anyhow. That was not part of the deal. \nThey, in effect, flouted our laws, took our money, and then complained \nwhen we finally said ``enough is enough,'' when President Bush said, \n``I cannot certify this any longer,'' and we cut off the aid.\n  Now, people say this was a terrible unfairness to Pakistan. The \nunfairness, if I may say so, was to the American taxpayers who provided \n$3.5 billion on the premise that Pakistan would not move to acquire a \nnuclear explosive device. They took the money. They went ahead and \nacquired the nuclear explosive device anyhow, and now they say, ``We \nwere treated unfairly.''\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend would yield for a question, he is stating \nit exactly correctly.\n  I might say, with some sense of humor, when this was working in the \n1980's, it was known as the Reagan-Bush amendment; it was only when it \nbecame controversial that they started calling it the Pressler \namendment, I point out.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I think the discussion we have had has been \nvery helpful in giving background.\n  Let me emphasize a couple of things. What is offered here is not the \ncompromise proposal that the President had asked to resolve the \nsituation over, $1.4 billion military equipment. That is controversial. \nI understand there are strong feelings on both sides. I have not \noffered that.\n  I would like to offer it at a future point, but I have not offered it \nin deference to getting things resolved on this bill quickly tonight. \nWhat is offered is solely the portion that was worked out with the \nadministration and with the Foreign Relations Committee. It passed 16 \nto 2 out of committee, and what we literally did was try and eliminate \nanything that was controversial.\n  What this does is try and go through the Pressler amendment and \nclarify areas where it may not apply.\n  Let me emphasize something. It does not repeal the Pressler \namendment. It does not deliver military equipment.\n  Specifically, Members should know there are six things this amendment \ndoes. No. 1, it allows us to participate with Pakistan in international \nnarcotics control. I cannot believe there is a single Member of the \nSenate that would object to that.\n  No. 2, it allows military-to-military contacts for the purposes of \nhumanitarian and civic assistance. I have a difficult time believing \nanyone here would object to that.\n  No. 3, it allows peacekeeping and multilateral operations.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have gone to Pakistan and asked them as a \nfavor to us to participate in these operations. When volunteers went to \nHaiti, they were not in abundance, Pakistan responded to our request. \nWhen people were losing their lives in Somalia, Pakistan responded with \nthe largest \n\n[[Page S 11433]]\ngroup. When people were asked to go to Bosnia, which is not a pleasure \nscene, Pakistan responded.\n  The third thing that it does is allow peacekeeping operations. They \nhave been at our request.\n  No. 4, it allows us to cooperate with antiterrorism activity. That is \nin our interest. That is desperately in our interest. They have \nreturned terrorists to us and they have worked with us.\n  The language of the Pressler amendment does not make it clear that \nthey can cooperate and we can cooperate with them in those areas. That \nis why this amendment is necessary. It is necessary because the \nexisting language does not clearly state that these activities can \nstill be carried on.\n  There are two other items this amendment does. It allows the \nPresident--and it is may, not mandatory language--to pay for the \nstorage costs. It simply gives him that authorization, something the \nPresident asked for, for the items of military equipment that they have \npaid for but not received.\n  Appreciate what has happened, Mr. President. We not only have \ncontracted with them for the equipment and had it built and gotten \ntheir money for it and refused to deliver it, but we now charge them \nstorage on the equipment that we refuse to deliver to them.\n  Last, Mr. President, it allows the return of other military equipment \nthat the administration was comfortable with returning that was not \ninvolved in the sale, that was owned by Pakistan, that was returned to \nthe United States for repairs, and it was caught in the breach. That \nis, returning equipment they have always had title to and was simply \nhere to be repaired. I do not believe that is a major controversial \nitem either with the administration or with India.\n  We have talked with the Indian Ambassador about this package \nspecifically. The Indian Ambassador, I understand, has expressed less \nthan full endorsement of the package to Senator Pressler. In my \ndiscussions with the Indian Ambassador, he indicated his concern was \nabout the sale of the planes which are not included in this, and not \nwith regard to the package.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear to Members, the items that are \nin this, I believe sincerely, are noncontroversial and to our \nadvantage. They are meant to make it clear that the Pressler amendment \ndoes not prohibit us from cooperating with the Pakistanis in these \nareas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it accurate to say that this passed 16 to 2 through \ncommittee?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, it voted out 16 to 2.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Exact same package?\n  Mr. BROWN. Exact same language. Nothing has been added to what the \nForeign Relations Committee worked on.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator be ready to enter into a time agreement \non this?\n  Mr. BROWN. I am happy to enter into any agreement that those \nconcerned about the amendment would wish.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask if the distinguished minority leader would be \nprepared to propound a time agreement.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are making an inquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like to ask before I respond whether the Senator \nfrom Colorado would tell us whether or not the question of the delivery \nof M-11's to Pakistan is a question he has resolved in his own mind, \nNo. 1. If so, whether he would tell the Senator from Michigan whether \nor not such a delivery would violate the missile technology control \nregime. And if so, whether or not sanctions should then be applied to \nPakistan rather than a resolution such as this.\n  The answer to those questions are very relevant in terms of the time \nagreement, if I can say so to the leader, because we recently had a \nbriefing on this issue up in 407 and that document is very, very clear \non this subject. It is very important, that if, in fact, my questions \nare answered a certain way by this Senator or other Senators, then that \nbriefing and the thrust of that briefing be made available to this \nSenate in executive session.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me respond to the Senator by quoting to those who are \nin a much better position to know than I. This was a July 28 statement \nby Secretary of State Warren Christopher. He said, ``At the present \ntime, although there is a fairly large body of evidence, we do not \nthink that there is the evidence that would justify the imposition of \nsanctions.''\n  Now, let me say to the Senator, he raised an important question, and \nI think he is rightly concerned about the missiles. Let me emphasize \nsomething: This amendment does not bar in any way sanctions or \ninterfere with sanctions in any way. If they are justified under the \nPressler amendment, they go ahead.\n  This will not restrict or shortchange that at all. But it does say, \nwhen we are trying to stop terrorist activity, that we are at least \nallowed to cooperate with the Pakistani Government to stop narcotics, \nto stop terrorism, to allow them to participate in peaceful forces.\n  So I know the Senator has legitimate concerns, and I do not mean to \nshortchange them at all. I do quote the Secretary of State because I \nthink he studied this and has looked at it and is in a better position \nthan I. But let me emphasize, this amendment does not in any way \ninhibit sanctions, should they be justified under existing statutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator. But the evidence that was presented--\nand I am not free in this setting to disclose what that evidence is--in \nS-407 is very relevant to that issue. And it is very critical that \nMembers of this Senate, I believe in executive session, read what the \nbriefing was on this issue. And I cannot say much more than that. But \nwe hear of a resolution in front of us, which is presented suddenly to \nus tonight--I am not on Foreign Relations, and we were talking out in \nthe hallway about a different formula of a resolution, and I thought \nthere was going to be a different resolution presented to a group of \nsix of us--suddenly this resolution is on the floor.\n  But the question of the delivery of M-11 missiles from China to \nPakistan is the most fundamental question of missile proliferation. We \nare worried about missiles. We all are. That was what the debate was \nall about yesterday.\n  My question to the Senator from Colorado is this. If, in fact, we are \nsatisfied that M-11's have been delivered to Pakistan, whether or not \nthat would trigger sanctions under the Missile Technology Control \nRegime? That is my question to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. The MTCR, Missile Technology Control Regime, does provide \nfor sanctions for violation. Let me assure the Senator, that has \nnothing to do with this amendment. Those would take place if they are \njustified, and not take place if they are not justified. This amendment \nin no way interferes with those sanctions at all.\n  I would simply also add to the Senator, I think he is to be commended \nfor his urgings to the Members. I think that briefing he suggested is \nvaluable and worth going to.\n  Second, I think he is right to be concerned about the issue. I would \nnot come to this body and urge that we ignore the Missile Technology \nControl Regime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My specific question however is this. If the M-11 were in \nfact delivered by China to Pakistan, if that were true, would sanctions \nthen be triggered under the MTCR?\n  My question is not a general one, whether MTCR provides for \nsanctions. My question is, if we are satisfied that the M-11 were \ndelivered by China to Pakistan, would sanctions then be appropriate \nunder MTCR? That is my question.\n  Mr. BROWN. Under our statutes, the President is charged with the \nenforcement of the MTCR. I read a quote from the Secretary of State. \nBut let me assure my colleague that, at least in my understanding, is \nin the hands of the President. I assume it would be properly enforced \nif he feels there is a violation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It seems to me----\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. I am just going to ask a question of the Senator from \nMichigan. If we were satisfied that the missiles were in fact \ndelivered, the question I \n\n[[Page S 11434]]\nwould have for the Senator from Michigan, would he conclude that the \nlaw requires us to apply sanctions against China? I mean, there are \nmany violations. I know the Senator has been attacked--or accused; not \nattacked--criticized for bringing this amendment up because it flies in \nthe face of what we were seeking to do, namely to dissuade the \nPakistanis from acquiring nuclear weapons. I think most of us voted for \nthat, along with Senator Glenn.\n  But the notion that somehow the Pakistanis have deceived us does not \nput them in a unique category. I think we can talk about the Indians, \nfor example, who for years said, ``We are conducting peaceful nuclear \nexplosions,'' only to find out years later that they were, in fact, \ndeveloping a nuclear capability.\n  We now have the Russians, with whom we have relations, who are also \nconducting, I believe, experiments in a field that should be of concern \nto this body, in the field of chemical weapons and biological weapons. \nThe same thing with respect to China.\n  I think the Senator from Colorado raises a valid point this evening. \nHe is not seeking in any way to repeal or modify the Pressler \namendment. What he is seeking to achieve is maintain the kind of \nrelations, as I understand it, with Pakistan, that they have maintained \nwith us. He did not mention, by way of specificity, at least, the name \nYusef. Here we had a major international terrorist, as such, who was \ninvolved in the terrorist bombing in New York. It was Pakistan who \nhelped us get him back.\n  I think what he is trying to achieve, namely, to maintain a \nrelationship with Pakistan that does not contradict or undermine the \nPressler amendment, is something that is very worthy of our \nconsideration this evening, tomorrow, however long it takes.\n  But I think, if we are talking about whether we are going to trigger \nthe Missile Technology Control Act, we have to look at those who are \nselling it as well. That would involve China and perhaps even other \nnations.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say this to the Senator from Maine, if I could, by \nway of clarification. In discussions with the administration, they \nindicated to us that there were real questions with the Pressler \namendment as to whether or not they were allowed to participate in \nnarcotics control operations with Pakistan, real questions about \nparticipation in humanitarian assistance, real questions about allowing \nthem to participate with them in peacekeeping, real questions about \nallowing them to cooperate with them in antiterrorism activity.\n  It was my belief that there was value in clarifying the Pressler \namendment in these specific areas.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What about the other areas?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the Members would feel comfortable that these are \nthings that are to our advantage, and ones that I would think--at least \nmy own view is they probably are not ones the Senator from South Dakota \nmeant to outlaw. But, obviously, he would be a far better spokesman on \nthat.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator also think there are real questions \nwith respect to the application of the Pressler amendment with respect \nto the storage costs and the application of the Pressler amendment to \nthe other arms he was talking about providing under his amendment, as I \nunderstand it?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes. I think the Senator is right to point those out \nbecause they are slightly different.\n  The return of military equipment is a question with nothing to do \nwith the purchase of the military equipment, as I am advised by the \nadministration. What it involves is military equipment which Pakistan \nowned and which needed repairs, and they sent parts or whole pieces of \nequipment back to the United States, as, of course, this country would \nlike to have done, to be repaired and sent back. So these were things \ncaught in the transition. I think that fairly falls in an area of \nclarification. But I think the Senator could well question that.\n  The question of storage costs, though, I think the Senator is \nabsolutely accurate. It is a different thing. It was something \nrequested by the administration. But I must tell the Senator I do not--\nif there are Members who object to our trying to work out something on \nthe storage cost for equipment they paid for that we did not deliver to \nthem, obviously, I hope they will speak forth on this issue. But I \nthink the Senator is right, the storage cost question is different.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, they got $2.5 billion--over \n$2 billion from us to buy military equipment. We gave them that $2 \nbillion under a special exception to the nonproliferation law, the \nPressler amendment, or, as the Senator from South Dakota pointed out \nearlier, called the Reagan-Bush amendment. I think the Senator was \naccurate in doing that. We gave them this money in order to buy \nweaponry, not to go nuclear. And the premise upon which the money was \ngiven was that they would not go nuclear.\n  They took the money and went nuclear anyhow. That is the problem, and \nthat is why President Bush finally, in 1990 said:\n\n       I cannot do this certification anymore, in terms of waiving \n     the law, because I cannot waive the law because I cannot \n     certify that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive \n     device.\n\n  So they took their money and they went nuclear anyhow.\n  I would like to raise a question, why does Pakistan not give us back \nthe money which they took on the premise that they would not go \nnuclear, since they have since gone nuclear?\n  Mr. BROWN. I want to assure the Senator, if he is successful in this, \nhe has a lot of other countries we want him to talk to in that area, \nand could well balance the budget if we move in that area.\n  Let me respond to the Senator's first question because I think he \nraises--the Senator is an expert in this area and I think all of us \nvalue his counsel. Specifically, he is pointing out as to why \nassistance may have been offered to Pakistan through the 1980's. My \nview is a bit different. And by stating that, I do not mean to compare \nmy expertise to that of the Senator. But let me, at least, share what \nmy view is of the primary motivation of why the United States offered \nmilitary equipment during that period.\n  Members may remember that the Soviet Union and the cold war had \nreached an intense point. At that period of time, which the Senator \ndescribed, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan. As all Members \nknow, they are neighbors next to Pakistan. Pakistan played a critical \nrole in helping the Afghans resist the invasion and turn back the \nSoviet tide. They did so for their own interest in protecting their \ncountry. But they also did so at great peril to their nation, and \nseveral Soviet leaders specifically contacted the Pakistani leadership \nand threatened their very existence as a country if they continued to \nprovide that. They never flinched. They never backed down.\n  When we needed them, when we really needed them, they were there for \nus. I do not dispute in any way the suggestions that there are problems \nand that their government at the time was not truthful in some regards.\n  But, Mr. President, I think we would be remiss to think that the aid \nthat we gave them during that period was solely to urge them not to \nhave a nuclear program. I think the aid we gave to them was \npreliminarily related to our own survival and our own interest and our \nown hope that the Soviet expansionism could be stopped, and they stood \nup for it. They put their neck on the line. And when you are half a \nworld away from the United States and right next to the Soviet Union, \nthat takes guts.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I had risen earlier to see if there was any \nchance of getting a time agreement on this amendment. There are a \nnumber of Senators apparently who want to speak.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. GLENN. We thought we were making some progress a little while \nago, as the Senator from Michigan said a little while ago out in the \nlobby. And \n\n[[Page S 11435]]\nI understood that we were going to have some language drawn up, and we \nhad all agreed to determine if we could have an agreement on. The next \nthing I know this was going on with the Senator from Colorado on the \nfloor presenting it.\n  I think just from what has happened here so far, we see this is a \nvery, very complex issue. There was a report out of the Washington Post \nyesterday morning that because of MTCR violations, we should put more \nsanctions on Pakistan. He is right here if we want to have an executive \nsession. I am not saying it is true. I think I would recommend that we \ngo with the tone set by the Senator from Michigan a few moments ago. \nThis claims that the MTCR has been violated. There is no doubt about \nit. This is only one item.\n  I have a whole file full of things that I was going to talk about on \nthe floor if this came up. The Senator is not guaranteed that we will \nbring up the arms matter later on. This is just dealing with the \neconomic matters here. But I think in the context of this particular \nbill that we are on here, the defense authorization bill, this is an \nextremely complex matter, and I could not personally agree to any time \nagreement on it or even give an estimate of the number of hours we \nwould have to talk about it. This is extremely complex.\n  I am happy to have this brought up at a separate time and go into \nexecutive session and go into all of these things and get the same \nintelligence reports that some of us have been into, as I know other \nMembers have at the agency, or whatever. But this is not something that \nis going to be solved I think on this.\n  I would have to object to any time agreement. I hate to do that. I do \nnot like to delay. But this is a very serious matter.\n  Let me just add one other thing, if I might. The Senator from \nMaryland talked about waivers. He did not even get into them. I have \nnine specific waivers where we went into things for Pakistan. Each one \nof those should be the subject of thorough discussion here on the \nfloor. I would be glad to go into them tonight, if you want to. But I \ndo not think we can make any agreement for time on this at all.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be happy to yield. It seems rather obvious to me \nthat we are not going to get a time agreement. It is a very serious \nmatter. I am not suggesting there should be. I am trying to find out if \nit is possible. If not, then I would hope we could have some other \ndisposition.\n  Is the Senator from Iowa a supporter of the amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This Senator is supportive of the Brown amendment. I \nwould like to speak on it. I feel very strongly about it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield so I can put one quote \nin the Record, because I think it is very important to get the context \nof this correct.\n  The Senator from Colorado suggested that the purpose of the aid was \nnot to dissuade them from acquiring a nuclear explosive device. I \nsimply want to quote from letters to the Congress from President Reagan \nand President Bush who said:\n\n       The proposed United States assistance program for Pakistan \n     remains extremely important in reducing the risk that \n     Pakistan will develop and possess such a device. I am \n     convinced that our security relationship and assistance \n     program are the most effective means available for us to \n     dissuade Pakistan from acquiring nuclear explosive devices. \n     Our assistance program is designed to help Pakistan address \n     its substantial legitimate security needs, thereby both \n     reducing incentives and creating disincentives for Pakistani \n     acquisition of nuclear explosives.\n\n  So that was clearly the rationale. The nonproliferation laws would \nhave banned any aid to Pakistan. The Pressler amendment provided an \nexception to that. The rationale for doing that was to try to dissuade \nPakistan from going nuclear, and they took almost $3.5 billion as part \nof that deal and went nuclear anyhow.\n  So, finally, in 1990, President Bush says, ``I cannot do this waiver \nanymore. I cannot make this certification.'' And that is when the \nassistance stopped.\n  I have a number of other quotes from high officials in both the \nReagan and the Bush Administrations during this period making exactly \nthis point in terms of the rationale for this.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I wonder if I might suggest that we set aside this \namendment, and the discussion that was going on beforehand might be \ncontinued either tonight or tomorrow. There apparently is some progress \nbeing made with all the people involved. If that is satisfactory with \nthe principal sponsor of the amendment, I would suggest we set this \namendment aside and that perhaps there could be a further discussion. \nIf they cannot agree, it would be back before us.\n  Would that be satisfactory?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that amendment be set aside.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the majority leader tell us when we are going to get \nback to this? I have not had the chance to talk about this amendment. I \nfeel very strongly about it. It seems like the other side wants to bash \nPakistan. They have had their chance.\n  Mr. DOLE. There are a number of people who support the amendment. But \nI think just in the interest of trying to move along here, it is 11:30 \np.m., and we need to decide what to do with the other 61 amendments \nthat are directly related to the Defense Department authorization bill. \nThis is not directly related, and I assume the others here, for the \nmost part, are.\n  So I would have no objection if we are going to be here for some \ntime--the Senator, even if it is set aside, could still speak to the \namendment.\n  So if there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am glad it is going to be set aside. I \nquestion whether this amendment is appropriate on this bill. This bill \nis a defense authorization bill. This amendment appears to be one that \nwould be pertinent to the foreign operations bill; in other words, the \nforeign affairs bill. It seems to me that, if we are going to bring up \nall kinds of amendments that do not concern this defense bill, we could \nbe here days and days. I think the amendment ought to be withdrawn and \nbrought up later on an appropriate bill, and that would be a foreign \naffairs bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I think probably it is \nmore appropriate, in the long run, on the State Department \nauthorization bill. But if we are unable to get that, it will be on the \nforeign operations bill later on.\n  But I think that Senator Brown has agreed to set it aside, and have \nfurther discussion with those who are directly involved. And I know it \nis very, very controversial and very, very complicated. I have learned \na lot just listening to the debate on the floor.\n  I hope we can maybe have an opportunity to discuss that tomorrow and \nsee whether it will be resolved.\n  Mr. President, I have been handed by the Democratic leader a revised \nlist of the amendments on that side. As I understand, the total number \nis 61, and I think 5 of the 61 have already been cleared, others are in \nthe clearance process as I understand it. I do not know how many more \nmight be in the process, but maybe another 5 or 10.\n  Mr. NUNN. My guess is of the 61 there are probably around 15 or more \nthat have been cleared or are in the process of being cleared. And I \nalso would say that there are a number of those 61 that I do not \nbelieve will require a vote. I think a number of those will disappear. \nSo I really think we are talking about a list that is much shorter than \n61.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think what I need to determine, because we have to decide \nwhat course of action to follow--if it is the intent not to let us pass \nthe bill, then there is not much reason in trying to even take up the \n61 or any of the 61 amendments.\n  But it would seem to me, if we are serious about this bill, if we \nintend to pass this bill and we come back to it tomorrow after \ndisposition of the Postal, Treasury bill, then I would be prepared to \nrecess and take up Postal, Treasury, come in at 8:30 and have opening \nstatements. Then at 9 o'clock we will have the first amendment offered \nunder a 3-hour time agreement. \n\n[[Page S 11436]]\n\n  But I might ask the distinguished Democratic leader, is there a \npossibility we can finish this bill tomorrow?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I can say in all sincerity, it is not my \nwish to make the job, which is extremely difficult for the majority \nleader, any more difficult than it already is. He has been fair, and I \nrespect his desire to want to finish this bill.\n  Let me be as candid and as frank as I can. We have had debate on some \nvery consequential amendments in the last couple of days. On the basis \nof the outcome of those amendments, frankly, a lot of Members on this \nside believe there ought to be more discussion, more debate. We have \nbeen in consultation with the White House, and I have just received a \nletter from the assistant to the President for National Security \nAffairs, Anthony Lake. I only read the last sentence:\n\n       Unless the unacceptable missile defense provisions are \n     deleted or revised and other changes are made to the bill \n     bringing it more in line with the administration policy, the \n     President's advisers will recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  I know that for a lot of Members who would like to see a conclusion \nto this bill, perhaps there are other ways and other opportunities to \ndebate this issue but for many of our Members this is a very, very \ncritical issue. There are other amendments. We are $7 billion over \nbudget, and a lot of our Senators would like the opportunity to see if \nwe can bring that cost down. They are concerned about the fact that \nthis is $7 billion more than the administration requested. And while I \nam somewhat apologetic for the fact that we are having a debate here at \n11:30 at night, just in the last 20 minutes I have asked my staff to \nshare with me what has happened in past years.\n  In 1989, we spent 7 days and 105 amendments on this bill; in 1990, it \nwas 105 amendments; in 1992, we spent 5 days with 87 amendments; in \n1993, 5 days and 105 amendments; last year we spent 5 days on this bill \nwith 123 amendments. We have been on this bill for a couple half days, \nand then yesterday virtually for the whole day, and today.\n  And so, Mr. President, again let me reiterate it is not my desire to \ncomplicate the life of the majority leader, but I must say in all \nhonesty that we have some real serious problems with this bill. There \nare a lot of Senators who believe that we ought to debate it a lot \nlonger--I am not suggesting necessarily a filibuster, but they believe \nthere are some very significant issues that still have not been \naddressed to our satisfaction.\n  So we are not inclined at this point, frankly, to want to accommodate \nthe majority leader, as much as I would like to personally, because of \nthe concerns that people have for the legislation. And that is as frank \nan answer as I can give the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I appreciate that. I know that--at least I suspected there \nwere a couple of amendments here that troubled the administration and \ntroubled some Members on the other side. But, of course, the bill has \nto go to conference. Obviously, the President has great leverage in \nconference--the administration--because there are not enough votes to \noverride a veto. The ABM vote was 51 to 48, 49. The other vote was five \nor six votes apart.\n  So it would seem to me what we ought to do is go through the process, \ngo to conference, and then the President can decide when it comes out \nof conference to veto the bill. But to tell us at half the way, unless \nthey get everything they want, they are going to veto the bill, in my \nview is not the wise course to follow.\n  There are a number of Members on both sides of the aisle who have \nspent weeks and weeks and months and months on this legislation, and \nthey have been in good faith. We were going along at a pretty good \npace, thought we would see the finish line, and then someone moved it. \nAnd I do not suggest that that has not happened before. We had 190-some \namendments this morning. Now we are down to 61. So it would appear \neither they have disappeared or we have disposed of 130 of them, and \nmany of these are in the process of being disposed of.\n  Even though all of these are disposed of, if we agreed right now that \nthe two managers, which I would not object to, get up and say, ``We \naccept all these amendments,'' then could we go to third reading?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We would not be prepared to go to third reading.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think that answers my question. There is no desire to \npass this bill. And I do not fault the Democratic leader. I have \nprobably stood on this floor in the same position, saying, ``We do not \nwant to pass this bill.'' But I would like to pass some bill.\n  I know there are a lot of frustrations about August, and I put in the \nadjournment resolution as honestly as I could that we would like to be \nout of here by August 19. I would like to be out of here before August \n19, like next weekend. But I do not believe that the majority leader \nhas any choice, if we cannot complete our work by next Friday--and that \nwould be this bill, the Treasury, Postal bill, DOD appropriations bill, \nand some disposition of welfare, and the Interior Appropriations bill--\nthan to say we will be here the week after next. I may be the only one \nhere, but we will be here, because it seems to me that this is very \nimportant business.\n  I hope the President will let us at least go through the legislative \nprocess, have the conference and then make a decision. But apparently \nthat will not happen. So I think the only--this is sort of a finite \nlist of 61 amendments? There will not be any, cannot be any additions, \nI guess.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Under the unanimous consent agreement, as I understand \nit, there would not be any additional, but that is a finite list.\n  Mr. DOLE. So could I send this to the desk and say this is the new--\ndo we have any amendments on this side? Are there any amendments to add \nto this?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just clarify, that is as \nfinite a list--I do not think we would be prepared to enter into a \nunanimous consent agreement because, frankly, we cannot even reach a \ncouple Senators whose other amendments may or may not be added to that \nlist. But I wanted to accommodate the majority leader as best as I \ncould and to give him the most accurate information.\n  Having had the consultations I have had with virtually all of the \nMembers of our caucus--there were some we could not talk to, could not \nreach--61 is my best estimate. But I would want to protect Members that \nI have not had the opportunity to talk with, so I would not be prepared \ntonight to enter into any agreement that would preclude others from, \nwho were originally protected from being protected after this list had \nbeen submitted. Mr. President, I made reference to the letter from Mr. \nLake. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, August 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: On July 31, the White House issued a \n     Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on S. 1026, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. In \n     that SAP, the Administration warned that S. 1026 raises \n     serious constitutional, national security, budget and \n     management concerns, and that the President will not support \n     the bill unless those concerns are addressed.\n       As I made clear in my remarks to the Democratic Senators \n     policy lunch on Tuesday, first and foremost among our \n     concerns about the bill are the unacceptable provisions \n     relating to the ABM Treaty and National Missile Defense \n     (NMD). In our view, these provisions, if enacted into law, \n     would effectively abrogate the ABM Treaty by mandating \n     development for deployment by 2003 of a non-compliant, multi-\n     site NMD and unilaterally imposing a solution to the on-going \n     negotiations with Russia on establishing a demarcation under \n     the Treaty between ABMs and theater missile defenses (TMDs). \n     The effect of such actions would in all likelihood be to \n     prompt Russia to terminate implementation of the START I \n     Treaty and shelve ratification of START II, thereby leaving \n     thousands of warheads in place that otherwise would be \n     removed from deployment under these two treaties. For this \n     reason, Secretary Christopher, Secretary Perry and General \n     Shalikashvili have made their objections to these provisions \n     clear in separate letters to the Senate.\n       On Thursday, the Senate voted on an amendment offered by \n     Senator Levin and cosponsored by Senator Nunn and many other \n     Democrats that would have struck the ABM and NMD provisions \n     in the bill that are the most objectionable. On behalf of the \n     President, I would like to commend Senator Levin, Senator \n     Nunn, and all the other Democratic and Republican Senators \n     who \n\n[[Page S 11437]]\n     made such cogent speeches in support of the amendment. Regrettably, it \n     was defeated 51-49.\n       I understand that debate on S. 1026 will continue today and \n     perhaps into next week and that other amendments relating to \n     ABM and NMD may be offered. I hope that our serious concerns \n     about these issues as well as others outlined in the \n     Statement of Administration Position may yet be addressed. \n     But let me be clear: unless the unacceptable missile defense \n     provisions are deleted or revised and other changes are made \n     to the bill bringing it more in line with administration \n     policy, the President's advisors will recommend that he veto \n     the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Anthony Lake,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11372-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 1026, the \n     Department of Defense authorization bill:\n       Bob Dole, Strom Thurmond, John Warner, Bob Smith, R.F. \n     Bennett, Spencer Abraham, D.

So, Mr. President, I do not see any reason to keep my \ncolleagues here any longer. But it is fairly clear to this Senator that \nfor reasons stated by the Democratic leader, we will not complete \naction on this bill tonight. But it will be the intention of the \nmajority leader that after, hopefully, disposition of the Treasury, \nPostal bill we will go back to this bill tomorrow afternoon.\n  There will be votes tomorrow. There will be a lot of votes tomorrow. \nI do not want anybody to leave town thinking, ``Oh, well, we have got \nthat taken care of.'' But, again, let me say to my colleagues, I would \nhope that we could cooperate here in the next 4 our 5 days and try to \nget out of here for at least part of the August recess. And I know \neverybody has plans or would like to have plans. Everybody asks, ``Why \ncan't we say now we can leave next Friday?'' This is a good reason why \nwe cannot say we can leave next Friday. We could have finished this \nbill by this morning or tomorrow afternoon, but we are told that is not \npossible. If we took all these amendments we could not go to final \npassage.\n  It is pretty obvious that there may be enough Members on the other \nside to prevent us from obtaining cloture. And even if cloture is \nobtained, you have 30 hours. That would take some time.\n  So there will be no more votes this evening. And we will do our best \nto proceed tomorrow on the Treasury, Postal bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11437-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11437-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11437-S11438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             LOOKING TO THE FUTURE OF VERMONT'S ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most important aspects of the \nquality of life in my native State of Vermont is the quality of our \nenvironment. We can swim in our lakes, fish in our streams, camp on \npublic lands, hike through the woods, and breathe fresh air without \nrisking our health. The quality of Vermont's environment is recognized \nnationally and drives much of the economy for us in Vermont.\n  Vermont's environmental quality depends on Federal environmental laws \nto set standards and fund cleanups--this is an undisputed fact. The \nClean Air Act has reduced air lead levels by 99 percent, carbon dioxide \nemissions by 50 percent, sulfur dioxide by 40 percent, and acid rain \nchemicals by 27 percent. However, many cities have experienced ozone \nlevels this summer that are twice the maximum healthy limit. Some \nAmericans simply cannot take an afternoon walk without experiencing \nbreathing troubles. Polluters do not have the right to deprive people \nof an afternoon walk, and as a Senator from a State downwind of one of \nthe country's biggest ozone generators in the country, New York City, I \nam concerned. Clearly, we have more work to do.\n  In 1970, 60 percent of Vermont's communities discharged raw sewage \ninto the State's waterways and bacteria consumed so much oxygen that \nmany of the State's streams could not support fish. Through the Clean \nWater Act and other efforts, we have provided at least secondary waste \ntreatment facilities for all communities and reduced point-source \nphosphorus pollution by 80 percent. With the Department of \nAgriculture's help, more than 400 Vermont farmers have contributed a \ntotal of $5.8 million to match $13.4 million of Federal funding to \nreduce the phosphorus runoff from farms. On the other hand, 1,500 \nhazardous waste sites in Vermont threaten the groundwater for some of \nthe 120,500 public and private wells, and the State recently had to \nissue a mercury warning for Vermont fish. We still have work to do to \nprotect our children and our communities from water pollution.\n  Vermont's fish and wildlife populations are relatively healthy \nbecause of international wildlife treaties and domestic efforts to \nprotect habitat in Vermont. Where we once had abandoned farms and \nwoodlots during the Depression, we now have the Green Mountain National \nForest--350,000 acres of habitat for black bears, songbirds, and even \nAtlantic salmon. In 1985 Vermont had its first nesting pair of \nperegrine falcons since the 1950's; last year 11 pairs fledged 31 \nperegrine chicks. Still, nine species of native mussels are threatened \nby the zebra mussel, and heavy metals such as cadmium have been found \nin moose and deer liver. Without constant vigilance, certain fish and \nwildlife populations may slip into decline as they have in other parts \nof the country.\n  I am proud to share these successes, and  hope  that  others  will  \njoin  me  in enjoying the fruits  of our efforts to \nprotect  the environment. The results of our hard \nwork have made Vermont a better place to live for families. \nVermont's quality environment provides activities like \nswimming, snowmobiling, boating, fishing, hunting, hiking, and camping \nthat keep us refreshed and entertained all year long. Many of these \nactivities are Vermont traditions which have been passed from \ngeneration to generation. I do not want to give these up.\n  I also want to make people aware, however, of an effort to turn back \nthe clock on these successes. There is a new four-part strategy in \nCongress to dismantle environmental protections in our great country. \nThe antienvironment lobbyists and some Members of Congress are using \nindirect, backdoor efforts to gut the statutes that have helped us \nclean up and protect our environment. I want people to understand what \nthe new majority is doing so that we can turn back these attacks.\n  The first step in this strategy is to cut the funding of \nenvironmental and natural resource agencies. This year alone, the House \nof Representatives cut the Fish and Wildlife Service by almost 25 \npercent, the National Biological Service by 30 percent, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's [EPA] enforcement budget by 50 \npercent. Without officially repealing the Endangered Species Act, the \nClean Water Act, or the Clean Air Act, the new majority has made it \nnearly impossible for the Government to carry out these goals.\n  Their second step is to create regulatory gridlock. The so-called \nRegulatory Reform Act forces agencies to do study after study, each one \nsubject to lawsuits from well-financed corporate industries. The EPA \nestimates that the studies will require hundreds of new staff and delay \nnew environmental rules by several years, if not indefinitely. By \ncutting the budget but increasing the workload, it is clear that some \npeople want to tie the hands of the EPA so it is powerless to protect \nthe environment. They are saying, ``Go ahead and pollute because we \ndon't give a hoot.'' \n\n[[Page S 11438]]\n\n  The third part of the attack on the environment is the unfunded \nmandates law that the 104th Congress has already passed. This bill says \nthat the Federal Government cannot ask State governments to enforce \nenvironmental laws unless the Federal Government provides the funding \nnecessary to implement and enforce them. While the bill does not affect \ncurrent laws, we would not have our Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean \nWater Act, or Clean Air Act if this law had been in place 25 years ago.\n  The final piece of the four-part attack is the so-called takings \nlegislation. This legislation is based on the premise that anybody can \ndo anything they want on their land, regardless of what the impact is \non their neighbors, their community, and their country. Senator Dole's \ntakings bill forces the Government to pay cash to landowners who are \nasked to do something to protect the environment, such as putting a \nfilter on a smokestack or not cutting trees within 50 feet of a river. \nEssentially, the bill forces the Government to pay a landowner not to \npollute, not to harm endangered species, and not to fill in wetlands. \nSince our Government has a deficit already, it is clear that the \nproponents of takings legislation believe that the bill will force the \nGovernment to allow polluting since we cannot afford to pay people to \nstop.\n  This is only the tip of the iceberg. There are other bills to open \nhundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness to mining and oil \ndrilling, perpetuate the golden giveaways in the 1872 mining law, turn \nover more public land to subsidized ranchers, and suspend environmental \nlaws that regulate national forest logging. I am afraid that we face a \ndifficult challenge protecting the environment in the 104th Congress. \nBut I know that the environment is important to the American people. \nAnd I believe people will not tolerate these attacks. Everyone who \nshares even a remote concern for the environment and the world our \nchildren will inherit needs to be aware of the efforts underfoot. There \nare many ways that Americans can come together to stop the \nantienvironment effort. The people of this country did not ask this \nCongress to turn back the clock. They should not try and we should not \nlet them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11437-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11438-S11445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSTUDENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FEDERAL COLLEGE \n                                  AID\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we continue to navigate the budget \nprocess and make difficult decisions about spending cuts, we must look \nharder at our priorities and make sure that our choices are sensible.\n  It is easy to fall into the trap of looking at budget numbers in an \nabstract way and forget about the very real consequences that cuts in \nstudent aid will have on young men and women in this country.\n  The most compelling arguments for the preservation of student aid are \nmade by the recipients of that aid whose lives have been changed for \nthe better by the education they have received. My office has received \nover 1,500 statements from students or former students responding to \nthe proposed cuts of that aid. Almost to a person, they say that aid is \ncrucial. I ask unanimous consent that a sample of these statements may \nbe printed in the Record. The States where these students live or \nattend college are listed, but other identifying information has been \nremoved.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                 ALASKA\n\n       When my oldest sister went to college grants were offered \n     to lower income students. Today, loans are the only offers in \n     abundance. Education for America's future is not a priority. \n     It should be.\n\n\n                                ALABAMA\n\n       1) After having gone bankrupt and losing a lot of my \n     material goods in 1993, college did not appear to be in any \n     way even close to an option. At that time I was not familiar \n     that someone of my age could even apply for financial aid. I \n     did apply. I was awarded with financial aid. I have been on \n     the president's honor roll now for three out of five quarters \n     at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. My major is Social \n     Work with an emphasis in working with people with \n     disabilities. I am also learning sign language. With the \n     internalized experiences that I now have--in putting my life \n     back together--I have too much to offer the field not to go \n     in that direction. I hope one day to open a vocational \n     training center in wood working and welding for the deaf. I \n     will succeed.\n       I can certainly empathize with congressional constituents \n     in attempting to cut the budget. It cannot be an easy task I \n     know. But the last place that I would think that you would \n     want to cut would be education.\n\n\n                                ARIZONA\n\n       (1) I am now a Junior at the University of Arizona, and I \n     am studying Material Science and Engineering. I come from a \n     single parent household, and at the age of 18, I left home \n     because my mother could not afford to keep up the rent on the \n     home we lived in. Without the financial aid I get, I would \n     have to work about 30 hours a week instead of the 12-15 hours \n     that I do work now in order to support myself. Living with my \n     mother's boyfriend is not an option because we do not see eye \n     to eye on many things, and living there would put too much \n     undo strain on all parties involved.\n       I am a first generation American of Mexican descent, \n     therefore my mother didn't attend college and from what I \n     have heard, my father didn't graduate from high school. I \n     have an opportunity to be the first member of my entire \n     extended family to attend a university and earn a degree. \n     Financial aid is vital to my survival here.\n       I know there are more out there with my story, so please \n     don't cut financial aid, it will hurt those of use who really \n     need it. I can't afford to work many hours and go to school \n     at the same time; not when I am working for an Engineering \n     degree.\n       (2) My story is quite simple, really. I would not have gone \n     to school without student aid. It is just that simple.\n       I graduated in 1993 from the University of Tulsa with a BS \n     in Economics. I graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa. \n     Currently, I am employed as a market analyst with WilTel, the \n     fourth largest telecommunications company in the US.\n       None of these opportunities would have been possible \n     without the SEOG and Pell Grants I received. My father was \n     working class and only had an income of $16,000/yr while I \n     was in college. I worked 30 hours a week at various jobs, \n     including a pawn shop and a financial planning firm, to cover \n     my living expenses through school. Without the grants, \n     however, my only option for paying tuition would have been \n     loans. Mind you, I took $8,000 in loans to cover tuition that \n     was not paid by my grants, so I did not get a free ride. But \n     borrowing much more than that would have made college costs \n     prohibitive.\n       I am a pretty pragmatic person. Considering today's job \n     market for college graduates, I could not have justified \n     borrowing $15,000 or $20,000 to go to school as my earning \n     potential would not have been enough to cover my loan \n     payments upon graduation. Furthermore, there was no guarantee \n     of a job upon graduation. Borrowing that amount of money \n     would have been a poor risk. Without federal support, my life \n     would not have succeeded as it has. Please support continued \n     funding for student loans.\n\n\n                               CALIFORNIA\n\n       (1) I grew up in rural California in a town called \n     Laytonville. My high school consisted of 180 students. I \n     graduated with 35 other individuals, about 10 of whom have \n     gone on to postsecondary education. Of those people, I don't \n     know of one who would be able to continue their education \n     without federal financial aid. Due to unsustainable logging \n     practices, the Laytonville economy (which used to be based on \n     logging) is almost non-existent. The few legal jobs available \n     are in education or in catering to the needs of wealthy \n     tourists or the marijuana farmers that support most of the \n     town. By continuing my Stanford education, I hope to be able \n     to make meaningful contribution to society. I hope to work to \n     improve the logging practices that destroyed the economy of \n     my hometown.\n       My father commutes three hours a day to work as a paralegal \n     and my mother makes under $15,000 a year as a clerk in a \n     clothing store. They cannot afford to pay for my education. \n     Without federal support I would have to return home and \n     choose between dodging police helicopters to make a decent \n     living growing marijuana or barely subsisting on the wages of \n     a gas station attendant. I have worked hard to reach \n     Stanford. I would hate to have to spend the rest of my life \n     knowing that my government was more interested in making \n     missiles to sell overseas than in helping me to make a \n     meaningful contribution to my country.\n       (2) I cannot even begin to express my gratitude to the \n     programs that have allowed me to have the financial ability \n     to pursue my education. Everyday I feel so fortunate to be \n     able to have this opportunity, I always knew that I would go \n     to college, but I never really thought about what a financial \n     burden it could be.\n       My mother depends on her meager income and assistance from \n     our immediate family to keep us financially stable. She came \n     to this country from the political oppression of Vietnam in \n     search of a better future. But, as her daughter, I wonder if \n     it is any better for her as she endures 12-hour days, six \n     days a week, as a manicurist, with no vacation, no health \n     insurance, and no pension. My mother waits by the mailbox \n     everyday to see if my financial aid will be as helpful next \n     year as it has been this year. She has given up on her future \n     and knows that she must work to survive. But, for me, she \n     hopes not just for survival, but possibilities. When I was a \n     child, \n\n[[Page S 11439]]\n     she would grab my hand and feel them to see if they were calloused like \n     hers. Her one wish is that the hands of her children will be \n     free of those callouses and they will be able to use their \n     minds, rather than be condemned to a life of hard labor.\n       That is what it comes down to. You are talking about more \n     than just monetary amounts; you are talking about \n     possibilities. With the price tag of around $13,000 to go to \n     a University of California school, those with meager incomes \n     are alienated from the institutions of higher learning. This \n     is not right.\n       Why should children try if there will be no one to \n     recognize the pure merit of a desire to learn? Take something \n     else away, but do not take away the opportunity for people to \n     better themselves.\n                                COLORADO\n\n       My husband and I have an adopted 17 year old son, just \n     beginning his senior year of high school. He wants very much \n     to attend college. My husband is a blind customer-service \n     representative for a large company. Just before Christmas, my \n     husband's company told him and some other employees that if \n     they wanted to keep their jobs they would have to take a \n     rather large pay cut. From the beginning, we did not feel \n     that the public schools in this area could give our son the \n     basics in education that he needed. We elected to spend our \n     money on his tuition and thought that he would be able to \n     apply for aid when he got ready to consider college. We \n     struggled to put our son through private school, from \n     kindergarten through high school, because we feel that a good \n     education is a worthwhile expenditure. It is all we can do to \n     handle our bills, especially now with the pay cut. I just do \n     not see how our son can manage to attend college if aid is \n     not available.\n       I am certain that there are other families who feel that \n     education is a vital part of the future of our country. How \n     can we have leaders if our children can't get the education \n     they need to prepare them? Please do not cut aid to students.\n\n\n                                GEORGIA\n\n       1) In 1994, I made the decision to quit my job, leave home, \n     and borrow $10,000 to finance my first year of education as a \n     returning graduate student. My situation is not unusual. \n     Because of the demands of graduate study most students are \n     required--either by department regulations or by the demands \n     of their workload--to abandon their sources of income.\n       Before arriving at my decision--to abandon my home and \n     income--I had to be sure that my debt would be manageable \n     both during and after my graduate education. Had the current \n     structure not been in place, I would not have been able to \n     seek my degree. America would have had one less instructor to \n     help our students be competitive and one more bartender to \n     mix drinks and pour beer.\n       As a teacher, I will not be making the doctor's salary \n     quoted by Rep. Goodling. To me, a $100 to $400 increase in \n     loan payments is not ``pennies a month.'' My situation is not \n     the exception, but the rule. Please leave the loan system \n     intact. Do not prevent those of us who need it most the \n     chance to improve ourselves and, through our work, improve \n     the nation.\n       2) My name is David Lamar Brand, Jr., and I am a second \n     year student at Mercer University School of Medicine in \n     Macon, GA. If it were not for federal subsidized student \n     loans, I would not have been able to attend college. My \n     parents, who themselves never attended college, were not able \n     to finance my education. With the help of need-based student \n     aid including scholarships, grants, work-study, PLUS loans, \n     and federal subsidized student loans, I attained a Bachelor \n     of Science in Engineering degree from Tulane University in \n     1989. Without the help of the student loans I would have been \n     just another high school graduate looking for a mediocre job.\n       Currently in medical school, I am still depending on \n     student loans for my survival. This year alone I borrowed \n     nearly $36,000 to finance my tuition, books, equipment, and \n     personal expenses. At the end of my medical education I will \n     owe approximately $250,000 including my loans from college \n     and the accrual of interest on my current unsubsidized loans.\n       I leave you with two thoughts. The first being that the \n     interest subsidized by the federal government will be repaid \n     later in the form of tax dollars that I as a doctor will pay \n     for the rest of my life compared to the tax dollars from the \n     high school graduate with a mediocre job that I would have \n     been if it were not for these loans. Please do not deny \n     others the same opportunities that I had.\n       Second, we must remember that education is the gateway to a \n     better life for disadvantaged youths and adults. If we do not \n     provide help to those seeking an education, we will end up \n     paying for it with some other type of government assistance. \n     Do not deny an affordable education to those who need this \n     assistance. This country would lose many great minds and \n     achievers if that were to happen.\n\n\n                                 IDAHO\n\n       1) I'm a veterinarian who is completing a second degree \n     (Ph.D) so that I can teach veterinary medicine and conduct \n     research in reproductive physiology.\n       Vet school required taking out very large loans. Although I \n     worked at regular and work-study jobs throughout four years \n     of college, I graduated $26,000 in debt and very tired. I \n     have been working 80-100 hours weekly for 4 years trying to \n     get my PhD. I am now looking at entry-level teaching jobs \n     that pay $25,000 yearly, and post-doctoral positions that pay \n     even less.\n       I consider myself very fortunate to be able to do what I \n     have done with my life and I would never complain about a \n     system that allows me the freedom to do this. It's been \n     great--but I know that paying back my loans will be a \n     struggle for me, and for many like me. I think we should \n     encourage education and not make financial aid more limited \n     than it is now. I urge Congress to take responsible action to \n     continue federal funding of student aid.\n\n\n                                ILLINOIS\n\n       I come from an underprivileged background: I grew up on \n     welfare in an atmosphere of drugs and severe domestic \n     violence. I never received any incentive or support \n     (financial or emotional) from my family to attend college. I \n     financed my education myself, and worked very hard as a \n     college student. I graduated from the University of \n     California at Berkeley as the valedictorian of my department \n     (summa cum laude with a 4.0 GPA). I decided to pursue a Ph.D. \n     so that I could become a teacher and inspire students to \n     improve their lives and the world around them as my college \n     professors had inspired me.\n       The University of Chicago, whose tuition and living \n     expenses total more than $30,000 per year (more than my \n     parents' income combined), is only affordable due to \n     assistance from the Javits Fellowship. If this fellowship is \n     eliminated, I WILL HAVE TO QUIT GRADUATE SCHOOL!\n       Elimination of the Jacob Javits Fellowship will force many \n     of the best, most talented humanities graduate students in \n     this country out of school and prevent us from achieving our \n     goal of improving society through education. Please, do not \n     let this happen.\n\n\n                                INDIANA\n\n       1) I'm writing to protest the proposed financial aid cuts \n     for higher education.\n       I am a single parent who struggled from 1986 through 1990 \n     to earn my BA in sociology, and I have a son who will be \n     applying to college next year.\n       During my undergraduate career I worked 10-30 hours per \n     week in a factory in addition to taking a full course load. I \n     am also the sole parental role model for my two sons, now \n     aged 21 and 16. At that point there had already been \n     substantial cuts in federal financial aid. I am now strapped \n     with a sizable student loan debt!\n       With the planned cuts, I am worried that my sons futures \n     may be jeopardized by lack of financial aid. Please remind \n     Congress that student aid is the key that unlocks the \n     financial door to education.\n       2) As a mother of five with husband on disability/\n     retirement income, I can only work enough hours to provide \n     food, shoes, and haircuts. The kids are all above average \n     students and I expect them to earn scholarships as well as \n     handle part-time jobs, but this will not cover the total \n     costs of college.\n       My oldest daughter attends Loyola U. of Chicago which costs \n     $19,900 a year. A $4,000 a year scholarship was needed to \n     allow her to attend. Next year our second daughter is going \n     to Ball State . . . once again only possible because of \n     financial aid.\n       Without financial aid both daughters would be working at \n     McDonald's without much of a future in sight. Help keep my \n     family's dreams alive.\n                                  IOWA\n\n       1) I live in Iowa City, and I grew up in rural western \n     Illinois. My parents were poor and I did not know anything \n     about financial aid when I graduated from high school in \n     1968. Because I thought I would not be able to afford \n     college, I went to junior college for a year and then decided \n     to get involved in the changes going on around me.\n       I got involved with my community and homeless people. I \n     worked and lived with homeless people as a Catholic worker in \n     the midwest. When I was 35 years old I decided I really \n     needed to have an education.\n       I went to a junior college for a year on financial aid and \n     worked at night as a switchboard operator. Then I went to \n     Marycrest College in Davenport, Iowa and got a degree in \n     Social Work. I continued to work nights at the hospital as a \n     switchboard operator and continued to go to school. I would \n     not have made it through school if it had not been for the \n     financial aid I received.\n       2) I was born and raised on a small dairy farm in Iowa--the \n     same quarter section farm on which my father was born and \n     raised and still lives; the same farm which my great-\n     grandparents purchased when they emigrated from Germany in \n     the 1870's. As the eldest of five children, I worked \n     alongside my parents on the farm from an early age. My \n     parents went to work full-time when they graduated from 8th \n     grade--my father as a farmer and my mother as a domestic \n     worker. As most loving parents do, they wanted their children \n     to have a better life than they had, so they were supportive \n     of our educations. Even with all the farm work there was to \n     be done, we still had time to study.\n       When I was a high school student and began to speak of \n     attending college, my parents sadly and gently informed me \n     that college was an impossible dream. The University was too \n     far away (this was Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa, just \n     180 miles from where we lived), it was too expensive, and \n     ``people like us'' just didn't go to college.\n       I was a National Merit Scholar, a member of the National \n     Honor Society, and I graduated from high school with a 4.0 \n     gpa. \n\n[[Page S 11440]]\n\n       I did win several scholarships, but without the other \n     student aid I received--including grants, work-study, and \n     guaranteed student loans--I would never have been able to \n     attend even an inexpensive state university. My parents were \n     only able to contribute less than $1,000 to my education.\n       I graduated with honors and distinction from Iowa State in \n     1985. I earned a National Science Foundation Fellowship and \n     received a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     in 1991.\n       Cutting financial aid for undergraduate and graduate \n     education will make it much harder, and in some instances, \n     impossible, for people from working class and working poor \n     backgrounds to receive formal educations and to ``move up the \n     socio-economic ladder'' in this society.\n\n\n                                 KANSAS\n\n       Although I was a class salutatorian, a Kansas state \n     scholar, and a National Merit semifinalist, I could not have \n     attended college without financial aid. I worked from twenty \n     to forty hours a week, attended classes, and valiantly tried \n     to participate in extracurricular activities. Without \n     financial aid, I would not have made it. Even with some aid I \n     struggled quite a bit: not with classwork, but with finances.\n       I went to the University of Kansas. I remember wishing so \n     hard that I could audition for plays there, or play my \n     clarinet in the band--but I had to work, and work every day. \n     It took me five years to obtain my undergraduate degree, even \n     though I'd started my undergraduate years as an Honors \n     student and a Watkins-Berger scholar.\n       I hope that you will enhance student financial aid and not \n     reduce it at all. I met some students from working class \n     families at the university level, but most students came from \n     more privileged backgrounds. Lucky people who have not known \n     hunger sometimes do not understand what it's like to have \n     very little in a land of plenty, and they overlook the needs \n     that they have not known. I worry that lawmakers may choose \n     to remain ignorant and ignore the needs of intelligent people \n     who lack money. I think that self-supporting students deserve \n     governmental support as they strive to create opportunities \n     beyond birthright.\n\n\n                                KENTUCKY\n\n       I am originally from Knox County, Kentucky. Knox county is \n     a very poor county in the southeastern part of the state. I \n     suppose that in most people's mind Knox County would be their \n     vision of ``Appalachia.'' Although most of my extended family \n     graduated from high school, no one had attended college \n     before.\n       Because of my disability, I believed that if I were to \n     succeed in fulfilling my dreams, I needed to go to college. \n     We did not have any money to pay college tuition, books, room \n     and board or any of the other expenses typically incurred by \n     college students. Like most other folks in Knox County, we \n     worried about food and housing from month to month.\n       Thanks to student aid programs (and the support of many \n     people), I work every day and continue to pay back those \n     student loans. I'm very thankful for that opportunity. \n     Without the student aid support I would not have attended \n     college at all. I can only speculate on my fate if I had not \n     been able to take advantage of federal student aid programs. \n     Because of my disability, socioeconomic status, and other \n     social factors, I would suspect that I would still be in \n     southeastern Kentucky dreaming my dreams--without any means \n     to fulfill them.\n\n\n                                MARYLAND\n\n       1) I am a 26 year old single black male who is the first in \n     my family to come this far in education. Most of the funding \n     for my undergraduate education came from federal financial \n     aid. Any money saved, earned, or given from my family went to \n     supplement the federal aid.\n       My funding for medical school is solely dependent upon \n     financial aid, without which school would be an impossible \n     goal for me. Even when financial aid is given it is usually \n     just to cover school costs, i.e. tuition and fees, etc. So \n     covering costs for basic needs such as food, shelter and \n     clothing becomes a hardship. I am not selfish in thinking \n     that I am the only one who have these difficulties in trying \n     to better themselves. If financial aid is cut the government \n     will be doing all of us a dis-service.\n       2) I'm a native of Baltimore and come from a blue-collar \n     background (proudly, I might add); my father has been a \n     barber for most of his life; my mother stayed at home to care \n     for me and my brother when we were in school. I got a great \n     deal out of my early education; I grew not only \n     intellectually, but also as an individual. I decided to \n     continue my education and go to college.\n       I was a first generation college student. I qualified for \n     almost every form of federal student aid and after graduation \n     I owed approximately $5,000. I went to graduate school so \n     that I could ``give back'' to a community which gave me so \n     much. After I received my degree I had a total of $32,000 in \n     debt.\n       Now it's 1995, and I've done what I set out to do. I \n     currently work at the Catholic University of America in \n     Washington, DC in the Career Services Office. My salary, \n     unfortunately, has not eased the financial burden of my debt. \n     Consider this: I've been paying my student loans, on time, \n     for almost 5\\1/2\\ years; I still owe approximately $27,000 \n     dollars. I've paid, to date, over $18,000 in student loans on \n     a balance of $32,000, and I still owe $27,000! There is \n     something wrong with this! If the Republicans get their way, \n     I'll be considered a lucky one. There's got to be a better \n     way. Imagine what my payments would be if the interest had \n     begun accruing on the receipt of the loans.\n       Many of the people in my generation are probably not going \n     to be able to afford to send their children to college. A \n     college education will be something for the elite few, not \n     the majority of the people. Someone like myself, who had the \n     desire to attend college and the obstacles to prevent that \n     from happening, won't be able to go. If we want to remain a \n     country of opportunity, then we must make opportunities not \n     only available, but available to everyone.\n       3) I am currently a senior majoring in theater who will \n     have $20,000 in debt when I graduate. If Stafford Loans are \n     eliminated, or if there are any cuts in my student aid, my \n     future education plans will be impacted. My future education \n     plans are to work after graduation so that I can pay off my \n     loans and then return to school for an Masters in Fine Arts. \n     I would like to teach another generation of theater \n     professionals.\n       Senator Kennedy, when you talk on Capitol Hill to other \n     members of the Senate, please tell them that cuts in student \n     aid will cause me to have to drop out of school because the \n     aid, especially the loans, make it possible for me to \n     continue my education without having to do without some of \n     the other essentials like food.\n                             MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       1) Two years ago I discovered that I had a tumor on my \n     spinal cord. My life as a shipbuilder ended that day and my \n     life as a student began again. I applied for Federal \n     financial aid and received a Pell Grant and a $700 \n     scholarship. In January of 1994 I started my first semester \n     towards an Associate's Degree in Civil Engineering. I have \n     been attending school on a fulltime basis (as my impairment \n     allows) ever since. I have re-applied for another grant for \n     the next fall semester. I have also applied for a grant in my \n     son's name, who with any luck, will be my classmate next \n     semester.\n       My illness has wiped out my family's savings and the income \n     from my job. To make a long story short, it hasn't been a \n     very productive or pleasant two years since the first \n     operation. If it hadn't been for the Pell Grant and the \n     scholarship I received, the devastating effects of my illness \n     would have been compounded. Because of them my life has a new \n     direction, and my children have a chance at furthering their \n     education as well. To lose these benefits now would be like \n     sentencing my kids to prison. They have suffered enough \n     because of my misfortune. The Pell Grant and other grants and \n     scholarships won't put them through Harvard, but they will at \n     least afford my children the opportunities they richly \n     deserve.\n       2) My mother always taught me that education was the key to \n     advancement. She also made an example of this by returning to \n     night school to receive her college degree as a single parent \n     with three children. I am sure that financial aid had a \n     significant part to play in helping her achieve her goal. My \n     childhood was spent in subsidized housing and the food in my \n     house was bought with food stamps. Though I never discussed \n     money with her in my childhood, I have gleaned from later \n     conversations with her friends that the four of us lived well \n     below the poverty line. It is very clear to me that one of my \n     mother's strongest motivations for pursuing her degree was to \n     escape the welfare system, and I am positive that she could \n     not have done that without government aid.\n       I, like my mother, believe that education is the key to \n     advancement. Without the support of government aid, I would \n     not have the opportunities to prove my theory. My mother died \n     when I was thirteen and I have not spoken with my abusive \n     father since I was four. Although I have legal guardians, \n     they are not responsible for financing my own education. \n     Since I am solely responsible for financing my own education, \n     any deduction in grant monies or loans made available to \n     students has far reaching repercussions for my future.\n       My dreams have brought me to where I am, and my hard work \n     has kept me here. I urge you to do all that is in your power \n     to help me and others like myself to continue to reach our \n     goals. We are America's future, but without learning the \n     proper tools in the present the future will be able to build \n     will not be an improvement on today's world. Please don't \n     stop us before we have begun. Please don't allow federal \n     student aid to be cut.\n       3) It is difficult growing up when one's parents are \n     separated, but my brother and I managed to do reasonably well \n     despite financial limitations. We worked hard to save money \n     for our college costs, delivering papers and mowing lawns. We \n     worked at a beef packing plant during the summer before our \n     junior years.\n       During my first year in college, I worked cleaning other \n     students' rooms to help supplement the scholarships and \n     minimal financial aid I received. At the beginnning of my \n     sophomore year a majority of these scholarships disappeared, \n     as is the nature of most grants earned in high school \n     competitions. I began working three simultaneous jobs on \n     campus so that I could remain in college. The only advantage \n     of this circumstance is that I certainly learned frugality, \n     though I think I'd learned that in my first 18 years. If \n     there were more financial aid, I might have \n\n[[Page S 11441]]\n     been able to work only two jobs, and dedicated more time to my studies. \n     With less financial aid, there is no way I would have been \n     able to obtain my degree.\n\n\n                                MICHIGAN\n\n       1) I am a law student at Syracuse University. I graduated \n     from the University of Michigan undergraduate program. I am a \n     24 year old African American male. I was born and raised in \n     Flint, Michigan (one of the worst places for a young minority \n     to grow up). My father and sister are incarcerated, my other \n     sister is a recovering crack addict and my mother is \n     currently taking care of 6 grandchildren.\n       Over the years, I have tried to do all that I could for my \n     family and am the first in my family to attend college. \n     Without financial aid, this would not have been possible, and \n     without continued financial aid I will not be able to pursue \n     my dream of becoming an attorney. Where I am from role models \n     carry guns, flash money, and kill over a pair of sneakers. \n     There are many youngsters ready to fill the shoes of those \n     ``role models.'' I want those who choose to fill my shoes to \n     have every opportunity and help to do so. Do not cut \n     financial aid! If anything, increase it.\n       2) I was a migrant farmworker in the early 1970's in Texas. \n     I traveled to Michigan, and in 1978 was accepted to the \n     University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Because of the poverty of \n     my family, I've had to work very hard for every nickel that \n     I've ever earned. I was also motivated and inspired by my \n     teachers to look at education as my primary goal.\n       I have done this. I am a successful professional working at \n     Grand Valley State University as an advocate for other \n     students coming up the pipeline. In all cases financial aid \n     is the bottom line issue on which decisions are to go to \n     college.\n       Today, however, government tries to make education a \n     commodity which only the rich can attain. Even in the 1970's \n     I had to work 25-30 hours a week to support my education and \n     continue to contribute to my family.\n       I knew that financial aid was the factor that made college \n     possible for me. With the rising costs of tuition, every \n     student must face this issue. The cost of a college education \n     continues to rise much more quickly than the inflation rate. \n     Students therefore must work to supplement their loans, and \n     often stay many more than 4 years.\n       The burden of the costs weigh on students long after \n     graduation. They must pay off expensive loans for years.\n       Let's not make financial aid a political issue. It should \n     not become a political tool that helps to perpetuate poverty \n     and create a permanent underclass.\n       An education not only help individuals become productive \n     citizens, but also helps maintain America's high quality of \n     life. As financial aid becomes more difficult to access, it \n     is more difficult for me to convince young people that \n     education is a worthwhile investment.\n\n\n                               MINNESOTA\n\n       I am currently a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of \n     Technology. It has been a dream come true to be able to \n     attend this university. I am from a rural town in Minnesota, \n     and no one in my high school usually goes farther than the \n     Minnesota/North Dakota area for college. After being accepted \n     here last year, I still thought that school at MIT was a \n     dream that would not come true, because of the $28,000 a year \n     price tag.\n       After filling out every scholarship application I could \n     find, I received awards of $6,900 for this year, but that \n     still left a big gap in finances. My parents make \n     approximately $45,000 a year, and I also have two younger \n     siblings, so my parents told me they could not help me for \n     school other than transportation to and from school. After \n     receiving my financial aid package, MIT assessed that my \n     parents could pay approximately $5,000, and I could pay \n     approximately $1,400, as well as $2,500 in work study, and \n     $5,500 in government subsidized loans. This made MIT more \n     affordable, but I still had to pay both my parent's and my \n     portions of the bill. So, I worked over 65 hours a week last \n     summer, saving every penny for school.\n       I made it through this year with not too many loans, but if \n     government cuts are imposed, I may not be able to afford \n     school here, especially if my loans are not subsidized while \n     I am in school. I would have to take out loans to make \n     monthly payments on other loans! Mounting tuition only adds \n     to the problem.\n       I urge you and other members of Congress to keep supporting \n     higher education to your fullest capabilities. Forcing bright \n     students to leave good schools because of mounting costs not \n     only cheats them out of a good education, it also cheats our \n     country. I hope you will support America's future.\n                                MISSOURI\n\n       Here is my student aid story. I hope it helps.\n       I grew up in Joplin, Missouri--the eldest of three \n     daughters in a lower-middle-class family. Neither of my \n     parents was a college graduate, but my mother instilled in me \n     a love of reading, which led me to pursue a B.A. in English \n     at the University of Missouri/Columbia. Although my parents \n     wanted me to go to college, they could not contribute very \n     much. My first semester at U.M.C., on December 4th, my father \n     committed suicide. I was devastated by his sudden death and \n     considered dropping out of college. However, with the \n     encouragement of many professors who felt that I had \n     potential, I made it through college with government grants \n     and loans--as well as countless part-time jobs--as a \n     waitress, a maid, a cook, a technical writer, and a tutor. I \n     graduated from college in three and a half years, and then \n     earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. in English. Now I teach technical \n     writing and literature at Kansas State University. I've paid \n     back all of my loans.\n       In short, financial aid eventually allowed me to be self-\n     sufficient, which in turn assured that my youngest sister \n     could attend college ``without'' financial aid. Nobody wants \n     to depend of government aid if funds are available elsewhere. \n     Perhaps your children haven't needed it because your college \n     educations ensured that you earned adequate salaries. But for \n     those children whose parents haven't had the advantages of a \n     college education, government aid is often essential.\n\n\n                                MONTANA\n\n       I am the director of Student Financial Aid at the College \n     of the Great Falls in Great Falls, Montana. I am a graduate \n     of Rice University in Houston, Texas. And to be frank, my \n     degree would not have been possible without the benefit of \n     Federal Title IV Aid. More important, in the course of my \n     undergraduate career I borrowed--and REPAID--$2750 in Federal \n     National Direct Student Loan monies, and $5000 in Stafford \n     Loans. In addition, I received Federal Pell Grants in each of \n     the seven semesters that it took me to earn my B.A.\n       Beyond these resources I worked forty to fifty hours a week \n     year-round to pay the remaining expenses of my college \n     education because my parents could not afford to send me and \n     my sisters to school at the same time.\n       Do I appreciate what I have received? Emphatically, yes! I \n     know where my help came from. In return I have given the last \n     ten years of my life to students working as a student \n     financial aid administrator to assist others achieve their \n     educational dreams, as you helped me from 1980 to 1984.\n       I believe in this system: the federal, state, and \n     institutional financial aid delivery system. I believe that \n     educating this generation of Americans is the key to success \n     of this nation in the next * * *.\n\n\n                             NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n       I am a sophomore at Dartmouth College and am extremely \n     concerned about the Republican's proposed cuts to financial \n     aid. Although Dartmouth is known for its wealthy student \n     body, about sixty percent of its students are on financial \n     aid, and couldn't possibly do without it. I belong to this \n     majority of students who are in need of financial aid. Not \n     only has financial aid allowed me to get an education that \n     challenges and fosters my intellectual growth and curiosity, \n     but it has allowed me to go to college. Without aid, I simply \n     wouldn't even be able to go to any college.\n       I graduated from a high school that boasted of many \n     graduates who have gone on to higher education. A friend and \n     I both graduated fifth in our class. Her family is quite \n     wealthy, so a Harvard tuition was a feasible investment. My \n     family, on the other hand, could not even afford a state \n     school education for me. Financial aid and federal loans make \n     up all of my tuition.\n       When I was in high school, college was a viable dream. I \n     knew that if I could demonstrate my intellectual capacity and \n     potential, I would be able to continue my education from \n     financial aid. If I had known that financial aid would be \n     reduced and that I couldn't afford to go to college no matter \n     how intelligent I proved to be, I wouldn't have been inspired \n     to do as well. Are America's brightest students destined to \n     receive only a high school education and work only menial \n     jobs for the rest of their lives simply because they can't \n     afford higher education?\n\n\n                               NEW JERSEY\n\n       1) I am a Junior at Princeton University. I am from Chicago \n     and I attended a public high school located in the heart of \n     the city.\n       My family has always taught me to work my hardest, \n     regardless of the odds. I take great pride in saying that my \n     family is very close. When it came time to apply to colleges, \n     I wasn't even thinking of Princeton. My father then said to \n     me, ``you know, maybe you should start shooting for better \n     schools.'' I thought I might as well give it a try. I applied \n     and was accepted. It was the biggest thrill of my life. I had \n     been recognized as someone who had worked hard enough to \n     attend one of the best schools in the world.\n       The only way I could afford to attend Princeton is through \n     financial aid, which makes up more than half of my tuition. \n     Every day that I walk down the sidewalk to classes, I take a \n     moment to appreciate my life. I realize that few are given \n     this opportunity.\n       Reducing financial aid is the biggest mistake that Congress \n     could make. I strongly support and trust our federal \n     government, but reductions in federal aid would be a great \n     injustice to that trust. Please find another place to make \n     federal cuts because the federal financial aid program, and \n     the student it serves, cannot afford it.\n       (2) I am an assistant professor of English at Princeton \n     University and I am writing to express my dismay at the \n     possibility that federal funding of student aid at both the \n     graduate and undergraduate levels might be cut. I am the \n     recipient of such aid--through student loans--at Howard \n     University (where I earned my B.A.) and later at Stanford \n     University (where I earned my Ph.D in English Literature). \n     Without those loans, I could \n\n[[Page S 11442]]\n\n     not possibly have earned my degrees, and would not now be one \n     of the very few African-American female academics employed by \n     an Ivy League institution.\n       I am one of eight children born to an African Methodist \n     Episcopal minister and his wife. I was raised in western \n     Pennsylvania in a small coal mining and steel mill region \n     outside of Pittsburgh. While my father's salary was small, \n     and my mother did housework for pay, all of my parents' \n     children finished high school and four of the eight finished \n     college. All of them did so with the help of some form of \n     federally funded student aid: three of the four who finished \n     college did so on the GI bill; I am the only non-veteran and \n     the only one to have earned a Ph.D.\n       The way to that Ph.D was neither continuous nor smooth. I \n     have worked and attended school at the same time since I was \n     in the 10th grade--I held clerical jobs at my high school \n     during the school year (part-time), and worked in various \n     local firms during the summers. But while I was accustomed to \n     having to work and go to school at the same time, I found \n     myself in great difficulty once I started undergraduate \n     school. I worked 32 hours a week to pay for my education and \n     dropped out of undergraduate school in the middle of my \n     second year because I could not continue working the long \n     hours and keeping my grade point average up at the same time. \n     During the next eight years I worked various jobs in \n     Washington, D.C.: I was a waitress, a line worker at the \n     Government Printing Office, a bookstore clerk at the \n     Smithsonian Museum of History Book store, a receptionist, \n     secretary, and word processor at various research firms, and \n     a night shift work processor at various law firms in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       I could have continued doing clerical work, but I really \n     wanted to finish my college education. To that end, I \n     enrolled at Howard University and finished my undergraduate \n     degree in June of 1979 because, and only because, I was able \n     to borrow a subsidized undergraduate student loan that helped \n     me pay for my tuition and fees at Howard. I worked 40 hours a \n     week and took care of my child because while the loan helped \n     me with my college costs, I still had to pay rent, buy \n     groceries, pay for child care; in short, I had to work to \n     sustain life for my child and myself, therefore, the loans \n     were absolutely necessary in order for me to pay for and \n     finish my college education.\n       During my first year of graduate school while at Howard \n     University, I applied to Stanford University's graduate \n     program in English and was accepted. I received a graduate \n     fellowship from Stanford which paid my tuition and fees, but \n     which only supplied enough of a monthly stipend for a single \n     person to live on very frugally: The living amount (beginning \n     in September of 1980) was approximately $5,000 per year. \n     While I could have half-starved my way through graduate \n     school as many of my friends did, I could not take care of my \n     child on that money. Once again the federal student loan \n     program came to my rescue. I borrowed from the student loan \n     program for six of the seven years I was in graduate school. \n     My seventh year I won a national doctoral fellowship at \n     Williams College and finished my dissertation there before \n     successfully going into the job market.\n       When I finished my Ph.D. in August of 1987, I was \n     considerably in debt. However, I was also immediately \n     employed by the University of Texas at Austin where I taught \n     three years. I have been employed by Princeton since \n     September of 1990. And I have, without pause, continued to \n     pay my student loans. I continue to pay them even as I write \n     this. They were the best investment that I could have made in \n     my future; and they represent an investment in me that my \n     country made. Now, I am a gainfully employed, tax-paying \n     citizen in a higher tax bracket, and my son has just \n     completed his first year of college at the University of \n     Maryland. I guess you (or anyone else) could say that I'm a \n     federal student loan success story; but more than that, I am \n     paying back interest that will help to underwrite other such \n     successes.\n       Please do not allow this program to be cut. I could not \n     have gone through school without that aid. And if we care \n     about ensuring that inherited wealth--or even simply \n     inherited middle class standing--are not the only roads to \n     success, then federal funding of student aid is one of the \n     very few ways, that ambitious and hard-working citizens, not \n     fortunate enough to have been born in wealthy families, can \n     make themselves part of the productive forces of this \n     country.\n       3) I am writing to stress my opposition to cuts made in \n     federal funding of student aid. I am very concerned for the \n     future of this country, and the direction it is heading. \n     Reducing funding for student is potentially dangerous for the \n     future of this country, for individuals self-esteem and \n     image, and the cycle continues.\n       I returned to school as a single mother, in Flint, \n     Michigan--and without the aid of the government I would never \n     have gotten an education, never graduated at the very top of \n     my class-and asked to deliver the commencement address at \n     University of Michigan last year and I would not be in \n     graduate school right now, at Rutgers University.\n       As a former welfare mother, a woman who has no family \n     support, as a committed citizen I would never have realized \n     my potential and never discovered the importance of giving \n     back to society if society had not first invested in me. The \n     struggle has been long, tedious, discouraging enough given \n     the political opinions about both welfare and single mothers. \n     With cuts in student aid, my life as I know it, and the \n     future possibilities for my son as I now foresee it, would be \n     non-existent. I urge you to do everything possible to stop \n     the cuts. In fact, I would encourage increased funding in \n     student aid. It has made all the difference in the world for \n     me.\n                                NEW YORK\n\n       1) I am recent college graduate. My student loans have left \n     me with an $18,000 debt.\n       Please tell the Senate that cuts in student aid will change \n     the face of education as we know it. Very few families can \n     afford tuition. I come from a middle class family. Because my \n     parents' salaries were deemed higher than the typically \n     financially disadvantaged family, I was not given much \n     financial aid from any school. High tuition forced my parents \n     to take out loans for themselves in addition to my loans. \n     They also dipped into their retirement accounts. No family \n     can afford to take out $18,000-$25,000 out of their yearly \n     income. Without help of student loans, higher education in \n     quality institutions would be a pipe dream for many families.\n       2) Thank you for your continued opposition to the \n     Republicans' efforts to cut funding for student aid. This \n     policy, which sacrifices long-term investment in human \n     capital for a short-term and limited savings, is extremely \n     misguided. Student aid provides upward social mobility for \n     working class, poor, and immigrant people. It's not welfare, \n     it's not a giveaway, it's an investment. But instead of \n     giving you statistics, let me relate how the combination of \n     student aid and guaranteed loans has helped me.\n       In 1981, I was 28 years old and was alternately collecting \n     unemployment or working a dead-end job in a copy shop for \n     $4.25 an hour. I got tired of trying to make ends meet so I \n     decided to return to school and applied for admission to \n     Baruch College, the business college of the City University \n     of New York (CUNY), to study about computer information \n     systems. I didn't know much about student aid resources at \n     that time, and CUNY was just barely affordable. Because of my \n     income status, I was able to receive a deep discount on my \n     tuition (although at that time CUNY's tuition was less than \n     $500 per semester) through Pell Grants. I was also able to \n     make ends meet through a combination of National Defense \n     Student Loans (which I have since paid back in full) and New \n     York State Guaranteed Student Loans (which I will have paid \n     back in one more year, at 9% interest, so it is not a \n     giveaway!)\n       I was able to continue from Baruch's bachelor's in business \n     administration program to its masters program, and in 1985 I \n     graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Information \n     Systems Degree. I most likely could not have finished these \n     studies without the support of the government student aid \n     programs.\n       I have since earned my Ph.D in Computer Science (which I \n     was able to pay for without government student aid) and am \n     now teaching full time at Baruch College as an assistant \n     professor.\n       The point of my story is that the government's student aid \n     programs provided me with the opportunity to change from a \n     marginal member of society to a very productive one. I now \n     can pay my own way in society, and contribute quite a \n     sizeable portion of my income to society paying taxes and \n     making charitable donations. Reliable and realistic student \n     aid programs made this possible for me and millions like me. \n     And in case anyone asks, I am a second-generation Irish \n     Catholic whose father was a blue-collar worker in warehouses \n     all his life. I do not fit the stereotype that people use to \n     demonize recipients of student aid.\n       Please continue to remind your Senate colleagues, \n     especially those from New York, that it would be extremely \n     short sighted for the federal government to eviscerate the \n     student aid programs. In the long run, the lost tax revenues, \n     greater burdens on social supports, and the less trained and \n     less competitive work force will cost the country much more \n     than the cost of the programs. And in my case, the proposed \n     capital gains tax cuts (which will be funded at the expense \n     of realistic student aid programs) will not foster my \n     investment in the economy nearly as much as did the student \n     aid programs available to me. Those programs enabled me to \n     earn enough money to be able to invest in the economy in the \n     first place.\n       Please remind your colleagues that education is an \n     investment, NOT a welfare program! Thanks for sticking up for \n     the students.\n       3) I am a first year student at New York University. It is \n     one of the largest and also one of the most expensive private \n     schools in America. But, unlike the Ivy League schools with \n     comparable tuitions, there is not an enormous endowment for \n     scholarships. I knew that money would be a problem because my \n     parents are divorced and my mother owns a small business \n     which does not make much money.\n       I am a straight A student with an SAT score of 1490, so I \n     felt sure that I would qualify for all of the extra money \n     that is supposedly out there somewhere. So, I started \n     applying for outside scholarships from private corporations \n     and philanthropists. I applied for well over five hundred \n     scholarships, and I was not rejected for any of them. But, I \n     also did not get money for any of them. What I got instead \n     was five hundred post \n\n[[Page S 11443]]\n     cards informing me that none of the corporations or other private \n     sources give scholarships any longer. It seems that because \n     of the tough economy, private companies do not have any money \n     to spare anymore, or perhaps education is just not considered \n     to be a priority in this country anymore.\n       There is such a large difference between my family's income \n     and the cost of attending college that I knew that I would \n     not be able to go to NYU without some sort of financial aid. \n     Luckily, I qualified for a federal Stafford loan. Without \n     this loan, I honestly would not have been able to go to \n     college. I think that it is absolutely ludicrous that our \n     government would even consider cutting financial aid. \n     Education is so important, and I think that something is \n     seriously wrong with a government that does not use its \n     resources to help people who cannot afford to go to school. \n     There are so many people my age who have the drive, the \n     intelligence, and the determination to make wonderful \n     students, and it is not fair that those of us who come from \n     poor or middle income families are not allowed access to the \n     same education as the wealthy.\n       Today, you hear so much about equal opportunity, but at the \n     same time, there is such enormous injustice in the \n     educational system of this country. I cannot believe that \n     anyone would ever consider cutting student aid programs. I \n     know that the government has a very tough job in balancing \n     the budget now that we are so far in debt, but sacrificing \n     the future of this country is not the answer. Because we \n     really are the future of this country, I hate to think what \n     will happen if we all come of age without an education.\n       There is a great misconception that there are lots of \n     private scholarships out there to be claimed. And we are not \n     willing to ``find a cheaper school'' as I was told on many \n     occasions. I refuse to settle for a mediocre education while \n     students with the same or even lower grades and definitely a \n     lower level of determination get the best education in the \n     country simply because they come from a family that has more \n     money. We, as the future of this country, demand equal \n     opportunities. We demand an end to the tyranny of the rich. \n     We demand an education. Once upon a time the government did \n     not think that that request was such a frivolous one. It \n     would be tragic to think that they have changed their minds. \n     Please tell the government that this investment is the most \n     important one that it could possibly make.\n\n\n                             NORTH CAROLINA\n\n       I thought that Congress would be interested in stories \n     about how student aid has changed lives. I have a story for \n     you, and I'll try to keep it brief. I need to go to bed, \n     because I have to work in the morning.\n       I used to be a welfare mom. My ex-husband used to slap the \n     kids around, drunk or sober, and I decided that my kids and I \n     couldn't afford to live that way any more. My two sons were \n     becoming violent, and I didn't want my two daughters growing \n     up as victims, so I left him.\n       It made him pretty angry when we walked out, so he refused \n     to pay child support. It's obvious that four children cannot \n     be supported on minimum wage, so I decided to use welfare and \n     student aid and go to college.\n       I went to a community college for two years, and then was \n     accepted at the University of North Carolina School of \n     Journalism and Mass Communications. I have one class left to \n     take before graduating in August.\n       What a difference education has made for me! There is no \n     way I could have gone to Carolina without every penny of \n     scholarship money, loans, and Pell grants I could muster. It \n     would have been out of the question. I'd be stuck on welfare, \n     or poorer working without it. My college career has meant \n     more to me than I can possibly relate in a letter, and I've \n     had some of the best professors our educational system has to \n     offer, and learned much more than the skills I can use every \n     day on my job. I'm not on welfare any more, but write for a \n     weekly newspaper. It's a start, and I believe that one day \n     I'll move on to something that pays more, and will enable me \n     to pay more taxes!\n       My college education has changed my life, and the lives of \n     my children. I think they understand the value of education \n     now, and will be proud when their mama actually graduates. I \n     know they're glad we're not on welfare anymore.\n       If I had more time, money, and childcare, I'd come and \n     speak on the Senate floor.\n       2) The idea of reducing the amount of federal monies for \n     students scares the hell out of me. You see I am a first-\n     generation college student. I'm getting ready to start my \n     senior year of college, and plan to go on to graduate school. \n     My family only supports me in that they fall into one of the \n     brackets which qualify for federal aid. My mom only went to \n     high school and my dad didn't even finish junior high.\n       My Mom, who was a single parent with two kids for a long \n     time, imbued me with a sense of personal responsibility. I \n     have worked since I was 13 and am paying all my own bills in \n     school. Because of federal aid I was able to attend a small \n     liberal arts school where I have flourished and become, in my \n     humble opinion, an educated and socially conscious member of \n     society.\n       I'm involved in community service activities through a \n     scholarship I receive that allows me to spend approximately \n     ten hours per week during the academic year doing service. I \n     have worked with underprivileged kids and built homes in \n     inner-city Pittsburgh. I've coordinated the first-ever \n     student-initiated service learning conference for college \n     folks on HIV/AIDS issues.\n       Mr. Kennedy, you and your colleagues in the Senate give me \n     hope that this country can cure its social ills. I want to \n     help you do that, but I can't unless I receive a quality \n     education that prepares me for the rough future ahead. I plan \n     on getting a master's degree in either social work or \n     community planning.\n       Thank you very much for listening to me, and godspeed.\n                                OKLAHOMA\n\n       I'm writing to plead that Congress pass no legislation that \n     would reduce or eliminate student financial aid. Although I'm \n     no longer a student, I would never have made it past my first \n     year of college without financial aid.\n       I returned to school after serving six years on active duty \n     in the Army. Now, you may think that the Army provides \n     substantial financial assistance for school but that's not \n     truly the case. The only assistance the Veteran's Educational \n     Assistance Program, which provided a mere $180 per month. \n     This is not enough to pay rent, let alone buy food, pay bills \n     and pay tuition and textbooks for college. I left the \n     military because I wanted an education but was suffering \n     because of this desire to improve myself.\n       To try to make ends meet, I entered the Army Reserves and \n     worked part time. This still didn't meet my expenses. During \n     my first year in college my car was repossessed, my phone, \n     gas, water, and electricity disconnected (I was studying by \n     the light of a little oil lamp) and I was sued as a result of \n     my inability to pay my bills. I had resorted to selling my \n     blood plasma twice a week in order to gain the money to keep \n     myself fed. I tried to obtain assistance through welfare \n     programs, such as the Low Income Energy Assistance Program, \n     but was informed that, in spite of being poor enough to \n     qualify, I was ineligible because I was a student.\n       Finally, Financial Aid realized that I wasn't making \n     sufficient money to be able to go to school and survive at \n     the same time. I was awarded loans, federal grants and \n     student work-study. Using this financial assistance, I was \n     able to complete my BS degree and continued on to obtain my \n     Ph.D. Without this assistance, I would never have been able \n     to make it past the first semester of college.\n       Please do whatever it takes to discourage the Congress from \n     limiting financial aid to students. A good education is not \n     something that should be restricted to the economic elite.\n\n\n                              PENNSYLVANIA\n\n       1) All of us in academia are shocked at the intended \n     proposals to cut money for higher education and the arts. A \n     skeptic might consider this the natural reaction of just \n     another special interest group out for its own gain. I assure \n     you this is not the case. There are very few true academics \n     left in this country today. Already the funding is scarce, \n     and many qualified applicants never get to pursue the \n     education they desire--the education they are willing to \n     sacrifice to acquire. No one enters academia or arts for the \n     money. We do it because we feel driven to it, because we see \n     something valuable in it that is worth pursuing and \n     preserving. The sacrifices far outweigh even the social \n     prestige that a lucky few acquire. Therefore, we are not \n     asking a lot. We do not require the billions that go toward \n     building high-tech airplanes and such, just a little money so \n     that the dedicated few can preserve what are our most \n     treasured possessions: our knowledge, our wisdom, and our \n     culture.\n       When I think about how much money is spent on the average \n     garbage TV show or movie in comparison to the ballet, the \n     symphony, or the study of advanced subjects, I feel like \n     crying, but all I can do is laugh because it is so \n     ridiculous. As a result, our children's heads are filled with \n     garbage an violence. They have no idea of even their own \n     cultural and intellectual treasures, let alone those of their \n     ancestors. Without a few generations, we stand to lose so \n     much just for the sake of a few dollars. But I cannot think \n     of any money better spent. We here at the University of \n     Pennsylvania work six or seven days a week year round, often \n     way into the night. Do you know how much I earn on my present \n     Foreign Language Area Studies scholarship? $800 per month. \n     People on welfare make more than I do. Even people working at \n     fast food chains make more than that, and they get nights and \n     weekends off. But you know what? I do not regret it at all. I \n     feel so privileged to be part of such a great institution. I \n     love my work and I love my life. I do not mind being poor \n     because my knowledge makes me rich.\n       Moreover, when I graduate with my Ph.D. in Indian \n     languages, I will have the joy of sharing that knowledge with \n     countless students over the years. This is my life's goal, my \n     life's work. All I want is that people like me be allowed to \n     make those sacrifices which will enrich us all as Americans, \n     and contribute to a better society.\n       2) I am a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania here \n     in Philadelphia. I know that I could write forever about the \n     merits of student aid on a national scale, but I feel that I \n     should get right to the point by showing what cuts in student \n     aid would do to my family, my education, and my future.\n       I was born in a poor section of Cleveland, Ohio, where I \n     still reside. I am the second person and the first man from \n     either side of my family to have the opportunity to go to \n\n[[Page S 11444]]\n     college. I am here because of several reasons, not the least of which \n     is the generous financial assistance that I have received \n     from the University, student loans, federal assistance, and \n     private scholarships. If it were not for this type of \n     financial help, I could not think of attending any college, \n     much less one of the caliber of the University of \n     Pennsylvania. Also, my mother, a graduate of Case Western \n     Reserve University in Cleveland, has courageously decided to \n     return to college to pursue her doctorate in Anthropology. \n     She is currently in her first year of study at the University \n     of Florida where she has justifiably earned a full \n     scholarship with a small stipend. The catch in my mother's \n     situation: she is not allowed to hold a job as a condition of \n     her scholarship.\n       This means that she, with the stipend as her only source of \n     income, cannot contribute to my education in any way. My \n     father, who recently has found new employment, is left, along \n     with me, to pay a significant amount of money to the \n     University which we can barely afford now. We have trouble \n     paying the bills as it is; it would be even more difficult \n     (and perhaps impossible) to do it if student aid is cut.\n       I can barely afford school. As a young Black man growing up \n     in an urban environment, I have faced the dangers that the \n     streets present to us. I have seen a man die. I have buried \n     my murdered cousin. I have been harassed and nearly beaten by \n     police. However, when I see my young cousin who at 10 has \n     proven to be an excellent student and a budding young \n     botanist, I see the potential that is in so many young \n     children that are in the urban neighborhoods of these United \n     States.\n       If you truly care about the training of the future leaders \n     of this nation, then I would urge you to remember my words. \n     Remember them as the vote on this issue comes up. Think about \n     the children--your children--your constituents who elected \n     you--and what you are in Washington to do. Listen to your \n     conscience.\n       3) I'm not sure if I'm addressing you properly, but I \n     wanted to open a line of communication I was interested to \n     hear that there is a possibility that student aid program \n     funding may be cut. I'm a twenty-five year old ``non-\n     traditional'' student at Temple University in Philadelphia. \n     The federal and state aid make it possible for me to maintain \n     my status as a full-time student. I have a learning \n     disability that requires special arrangements for both \n     testing, and note taking. This unfortunately makes employment \n     concurrent to schoolwork next to impossible. I have managed \n     to volunteer a few hours of my time, when I'm able, to our \n     Disability Resources and Services center on our campus. In \n     addition, I've been hired by the University as a Residential \n     Assistant in our resident halls for next year. My total \n     income for next year, should provide me with only 33% of the \n     money needed to attend school full-time. Because my \n     disability was not recognized sooner than two years ago, a \n     ``traditional'' college education was not possible upon \n     graduation.\n       I appeal to you as a student who is trying to serve himself \n     and his fellow students, to please consider the impact and \n     burden that further limitations in student aid would cause to \n     those in my position. Please don't take away the future for \n     me.\n       Thank you for your time, and I trust that you will make a \n     decision that serves those of us that rely on aid to provide \n     a future.\n\n\n                               TENNESSEE\n\n       1) Though I am a Republican, this is one issue about which \n     the party and I disagree. I will be a sophomore at Boston \n     College next fall, and my attendance is contingent upon the \n     amount of financial aid my family receives. It has always \n     been my dream to go to school in Boston, and so far I have \n     been able to live out that dream; however, if I were to lose \n     any federal aid, I would be forced to drop out of BC. My \n     financial aid package includes everything from work study to \n     grants and scholarships, and Stafford and Perkins loans, each \n     at the maximum amount. I beg all of the members of the Senate \n     to make budget cuts elsewhere. Do not take away my dream.\n       Don't ruin our country's future by denying financially \n     challenged students the opportunity to learn the priceless \n     lessons that college and graduate school can teach us. \n     American society requires a college degree, if not a post-\n     graduate degree. How is my generation supposed to enter the \n     competitive job market without such degrees? If the Senate \n     cuts federal student aid, you might as well make increases in \n     unemployment and welfare benefits. There are too many \n     qualified students who would be forced into poverty if they \n     could not rely on federal student aid. Please do not do this \n     to me, my family, my friends, my generation, and our country.\n       2) Federal and private financial aid have paid for the \n     majority of my college education. I come from a very low-\n     income (less than $3,000 per year) family in upper eastern \n     Tennessee. We have a somewhat colloquial lifestyle--I spent \n     years without running water and electricity (and I'm only 22 \n     now!). We are basically a farming family. I am the first \n     person in my family to graduate college and I would not have \n     been able to accomplish this without aid. Contrary to popular \n     belief, poor people do not ``live off the dole'' constantly, \n     nor are we completely unable to ``make a contribution to \n     society.'' Yet, because the military is running out of places \n     from which to steal money, my government is threatening to \n     take these opportunities away from me.\n       Had these budget cuts been implemented during my first \n     years in college, I would not have been able to afford to \n     come here. My life would be very different. I would probably \n     have been forced to find work in a factory. I urge Congress \n     to think of the human aspect of student aid and to realize \n     what repercussions your decisions might have.\n                                 TEXAS\n\n       1) I am a first year student at Princeton University. I \n     attended high school in a small town just outside of Austin, \n     Texas. My high school was not known for sending students to \n     Ivy League schools. In fact, it struggles to send students to \n     college at all. The drop-out rate is about 60% and the school \n     district is one of the poorest in the state. My acceptance to \n     Princeton was a great shock to all of my peers. I overwhelmed \n     them that they could know someone who was attending Princeton \n     or at least about to. To my peers, Princeton was this rich, \n     white conservative school that only the Vanderbilts and the \n     Kennedys of our nation attend. Never in the minds of my peers \n     would such a school allow a poor Mexican girl from Del Valle \n     to attend it.\n       Of course, I could not have attended without the help of \n     financial aid. My father is in prison right now and my mother \n     is recovering from a heroin addiction. During my senior year \n     of high school (about a week after I found out about my \n     acceptance to Princeton), my mother abandoned my younger \n     sister and me for her drugs. My aunt gladly took us in, but \n     being on welfare she was hardly capable of feeding two extra \n     mouths. Money was tight while I was there but we always \n     managed. There was no way we could have managed to pay \n     $28,000 a year just to make my life dream possible.\n       If I do not continue to receive financial aid, my career \n     here at Princeton will be short-lived and my struggle and \n     those of other like myself will have been in vain.\n       2) I am a 41 year old Hispanic male, father of 4 and \n     preparing to take my comprehensive exams for my doctorate in \n     January, 1996. We were field workers in Michigan and I recall \n     asking my father why we had to work in the fields and he \n     would tell me it was because he did not have any education. I \n     was in the 7th grade when I told my father as we were picking \n     cherries that I was going to get a doctorate and thus I would \n     never have to pick in the fields. My dad encouraged me to do \n     it. At the time, I had no idea what a doctorate was but I had \n     looked it up in the dictionary and read that a doctorate was \n     the highest degree obtainable. I graduated high school and \n     went on to Central Michigan University but dropped out to \n     take care of my mother and eight brothers and sisters after \n     my father dies in a car accident.\n       After working hard and not making any economical gains, I \n     told my wife in the summer of 1987 that I was going to go \n     back to college to get a Ph.D. At the time, I had two \n     children, my wife worked at home due to the high cost of day \n     care. I could barely make ends meet with my three jobs \n     working as a pizza delivery driver, a bus driver, and a \n     custodian. I knew that I could not afford to go to school but \n     thank God for people like you that helped to provide \n     financial aid that my family needed in order for me to attend \n     school.\n       While attending school, I did not quit my three jobs \n     because I still could not afford to and I needed the health \n     insurance that the custodian position provided. I kept \n     telling my wife how great it was going to be when I finished \n     my education but inside I had doubts that I would be able to \n     complete my education due to financial reasons.\n       However, I had overlooked one thing. As I received more \n     education, I was able to take higher paying jobs. In 1989, I \n     took a position at the University of North Texas Financial \n     Aid Office. The position did not pay that much so I continued \n     delivering pizzas on the weekends. Often I would work 34 \n     hours from Friday to Sunday. In time, my position at the \n     Financial Aid Office was upgraded and I was able to quit the \n     pizza delivery job. I received my undergraduate degree in \n     1990 from the University of North Texas, my Master's degree \n     in 1991, and began my doctoral work. I was recruited for a \n     position from another department of the university. I left \n     the financial aid office, and took the position of Research \n     Scientist. Later, I was again recruited, this time for \n     Assistant Dean of Students. But, when I told my supervisors \n     of the position, they gave me another offer which is my \n     current position as Assistant to the Dean at the School of \n     Community Service at the University of North Texas. I am also \n     teaching two classes in Race and Ethnic Relations per \n     academic year at UNT. All of this has been made possible \n     because of financial aid.\n       3) I am a graduating medical students at Baylor College of \n     Medicine in Houston, Texas. Many people here are very nervous \n     now that we hear that loan subsidies may be cut. As a student \n     who received subsidized Stafford and Perkins loans while here \n     in medical school, I wanted to voice my opinion that these \n     subsidies are not only of great benefit, but an integral part \n     of allowing us to become the physicians this country needs.\n       Let me state that as an undergraduate, I did not receive \n     any federal aid because my parents had planned for my college \n     educational needs. They saved enough to pay for four years of \n     college which has helped me immensely. However, my parents, \n     who I consider to be of a middle class background, did not \n     have the finances to pay for medical school. Student loans \n     were my means to stay in school. \n\n[[Page S 11445]]\n\n       People have argued that students frivolously spend this \n     money, but I assure you that our financial aid department had \n     a yearly budget that helped us meet our needs and we could \n     not obtain loans beyond the monetary amount in their budget. \n     In fact, there were crucial times in our lives that were \n     never covered in the Baylor budget such as fees for taking \n     the medical licensure exams, parking fees for the medical \n     center, and residency application and interview costs.\n       I still had to borrow $70,000 over my four years to make \n     ends meet. If I did not have federal loans, my bill would \n     have increased by as much as 30%. I am astounded that \n     Congress would consider cutting student loans. I know our \n     country is looking for ways to increase the physician numbers \n     in underserved areas and increase the number of generalist \n     physicians. Yet, Congress would consider cutting college \n     loans that help us to contain our debt load and pursue \n     careers in areas that we love but do not pay as well. Please \n     understand that government loans have not only allowed me to \n     become a physician, they have allowed me to pursue my career \n     goals to be a primary care pediatrician serving a hometown \n     community that needs me. I hope that you are willing to allow \n     the students that follow behind me to have the same \n     opportunities to serve the medical community, their families, \n     and the patients that need them.\n       4) I am a single parent trying to get my Bachelor's Degree \n     at the University of Texas at Arlington. I have been in \n     school for 7 years working full-time and going to school \n     part-time. Each year I see tuition go up, fees go up, book \n     costs skyrocket, and less money to go to school on.\n       The reason I depend on federal financial aid is to get out \n     of poverty. At the present time, my salary is $1.00 higher \n     than the cutoff for food stamps and any public assistance. I \n     do not receive my child support because I cannot locate my \n     ex-husband. I want to make a better life for my daughter and \n     myself. My education is the answer to bettering my life. When \n     you cut funding, you guarantee that I will not get an \n     education.\n       Even though I am a Republican and have been for more than \n     20 years, I might just vote Democrat the next time around.\n\n\n                                VERMONT\n\n       I attend an elite liberal arts college in Vermont, a long \n     way from my home in Tennessee. I was raised by a single \n     mother, who is also attending college. My financial aid award \n     from Middlebury totaled more dollars than her salary. Still, \n     I am walking a thin line. Without the same level of financial \n     aid from Middlebury next year, I will not be able to return. \n     I am not the only person in this situation. The government \n     loan and grant programs are absolutely essential for me to \n     continue my education here. Government loans would also be \n     necessary for me to attend the state universities in \n     Tennessee, and the prospect of cuts in student aid concern me \n     very much. The GOP has become the party of greed. Please \n     don't allow these cuts to take place.\n\n\n                               WASHINGTON\n\n       1) Normally, I support the Republican viewpoint, but I must \n     oppose cuts to student aid. This country appears to be \n     sliding from the forefront of science and technology, and the \n     only way to keep our status as world leaders in the sciences \n     is to educate our citizens. The cost of higher education has \n     skyrocketed. At my alma mater, Central Washington University, \n     tuition has doubled over the past ten years. The cost of \n     textbooks and housing has similarly risen.\n       I would not have been able to attend college--I received my \n     B.S., M.S. and am now working on my Ph.D.--without financial \n     assistance. I do not view this as a handout--most of my aid \n     is in the form of loans that I am currently paying back. I \n     believe that making cuts in student aid will just hurt this \n     country in great ways.\n       2) I am a Junior at Western Washington University in \n     Washington State. My ultimate goal is to go into medicine, \n     something I have aspired to since my Freshman year of high \n     school. I went to a small high school and received little \n     help by the way of scholarships when I left, even though I \n     was Senior class president and ranked 4th in my class. The \n     money was just not there. I did not worry because I knew I \n     could still go to school with the help of financial aid.\n       If it had not been for work-study programs, loans, and \n     grants, I would not be pursuing this goal today. And now you \n     say that this aid may be cut. Do you intend to revert back to \n     the time when only an elite few got an education and the rest \n     of the country worked for peanuts? What are you thinking?\n       Why is education becoming such a challenge to receive? This \n     is scary to me, so scary because my life-line right now, my \n     reason for living, is the fact that I am going to school. I \n     am learning so much and growing so much, that I can hardly \n     believe how narrow-minded I used to be.\n       My parents' contribution to my education has been zero. We \n     are already in that bracket which states that we make too \n     much money to receive very much aid. Their paychecks will \n     never allow for a $10,000 which would be the effect on my \n     aid. How can I make you understand that this is completely \n     out of the question? You are taking from me my right to \n     pursue happiness, which I may need to remind you is a \n     Constitutional right. If I cannot go to school (and without \n     aid, I cannot go to school), I will have lost the one aspect \n     of my life that I value the most. And I know that I am not \n     alone. For my one story there are thousands more like it. The \n     livelihood of this country depends on its youth and that \n     youth's ability to get educated. If you take that away from \n     us, you will be responsible for the destruction, demise, and \n     collapse of this country.\n       3) When I approached my father about going to college about \n     ten years ago, he said, ``Sure, great idea, but don't expect \n     me to pay for it.'' Based on that statement, I knew I was on \n     my own; I decided to do my best in school and try to get into \n     West Point, or another service academy. I decided that I \n     wanted to go to college and that I was going to get there \n     somehow.\n       As a female, I knew that was a long shot. In the early \n     80's, when I was in high school, the first female cadets were \n     just graduating from West Point. I applied and over the \n     course of a year I finally got word from my Congressman that \n     he had nominated me to attend the U.S. Military Academy at \n     West Point, over almost 500 other candidates, a number of \n     whom were my classmates and friends. Due to a knee injury and \n     surgery, and the subsequent effect on my grades, West Point \n     did not accept me, though that nomination is still one of the \n     most important accomplishments of my life.\n       One of the routes to college had now closed and I had to \n     take another look at how badly I wanted to get a degree. I \n     worked for a few years and decided that if I really wanted to \n     go where I wanted and do what I wanted to do, I had to go \n     back to school. My mother (a college graduate with two \n     degrees who returned to school in her late thirties and \n     graduated thanks to government student loans), was, at that \n     time working at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks and \n     made me an offer I could not refuse. She said that I could \n     move up to Alaska with her and she would take care of the \n     roof over my head if I attended school full-time. The offer \n     was great, but once again I faced the dilemma of where to get \n     the money to pay for my tuition and book fees. I took my mom \n     up on her offer based solely on the reassuring words of the \n     financial aid counselor that government student loans were \n     available.\n       I did go to Alaska and in the four years I was there, \n     graduated with a degree in history and a minor in Japanese. I \n     was the first person on my father's side of the family ever \n     to graduate from college. I have been paying my loans back \n     for two years now and every payment has been on time. I owe a \n     great deal to the government's student loan program, and it \n     goes way beyond money.\n       How can one base such a program on dollars alone? My mom \n     was a welfare mom for awhile after my parents divorced in the \n     late 1970's. But, her desire to go further, get an education, \n     and the assistance of student loans got her off welfare and \n     helped her to earn her degrees and make a great living. She \n     set a great example for me in terms of how far an education \n     can take you, and I am proud to say this is one government-\n     supported program I am proud to be a second generation \n     recipient.\n\n\n                               WISCONSIN\n\n       1) Prior to enrolling in undergraduate school I was a high \n     school drop-out and lived on the Bad River Indian Reservation \n     in Odanah, Wisconsin. I lived off of the USDA food \n     distribution program and relief monies. In addition to being \n     just another impoverished Native-American Indian, I am deaf. \n     During my undergraduate studies I was fortunate enough to \n     have received grants from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a \n     Wisconsin Deaf grant, a vocational rehabilitation grant, and \n     a Pell grant for each year that I attended Northland College.\n       After receiving my BS I found that I was over $10,000 in \n     debt from student loans that I needed in spite of my many \n     grants. Most of my graduating class weren't so lucky. Many of \n     them had debts in excess of $50,000, making repayment a \n     doubtful proposition without first earning a more advanced \n     degree and further accumulation of debts. I can not over-\n     emphasize that without the Pell program and the student loan \n     program, I would not have been able to be where I am today. \n     Nor would I be going in the direction that I am.\n       Being Indian and deaf in Ashland County, Wisconsin, spells \n     long term poverty. Because I've gone to school and earned \n     fellowships, I have not had to seek relief monies or \n     participate in USDA commodity food distribution programs. I \n     feel that it is important to ask what is the rate of return \n     on education dollars. My own experience is one where no more \n     relief monies are required by me. When I consider the \n     situations of other students I know, I find the Republicans' \n     proposed cuts amazing.\n       2) I understand that we need to balance the budget, yet if \n     we don't educate the people how can we compete in the world \n     and pay off the debt when the next generation won't have good \n     paying jobs so we can put money back into the system. I'm \n     very proud of my parents, and my parents are very proud of \n     me. Everytime I go back to school my Mom says, ``I'm very \n     proud of you. You have chances I only dreamed of.'' To have \n     my mother say that makes me realize how far I could go. I \n     don't want the one dream I have, of going places my mother \n     only dreamed of going, be cut short because of money. That \n     hurts me deeply and I only hope that you see it my way. \n     During the summer I work at least 18 hours a day and my body \n     aches at night. I work every chance I get and still financial \n     aid is like a life preserver which keeps me afloat. If \n     financial aid is cut, my dreams may drown.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11438-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 11446]]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I rise today to remember and thank Lane \nKirkland, a South Carolina favorite son who fought for American workers \nand jobs as one of the Nation's key labor leaders.\n  After more than 50 years of union service, including the last 16 \nyears as president of the AFL-CIO, Lane Kirkland retired Tuesday.\n  Tomorrow's generation can learn much from Lane. Instead of today's \npop morality tuned to getting a soundbite on the nightly news, Lane has \nlived a life dedicated to the principle that working people should work \ntogether to improve their lot in life, to fight for justice, to strive \nfor dignity and to help all.\n  Lane Kirkland's accomplishments as head of the AFL-CIO should serve \nas a model for public service.\n  He was one of the Nation's first leaders to recognize the financial \ndevastation that Reaganomics would wreak on our economy when he \ndescribed Reagan's economic plans as a ``high-risk gamble with the \nlives of working people.''\n   And when the embattled Solidarity trade union faced an uphill battle \nin Poland, Lane Kirkland recognized what was at stake and provided a \nlifeline that kept Solidarity alive. In fact, Lane's lifelong fight to \npromote democracy led to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  No one could put it better than editorialists who wrote in \nWednesday's Detroit News:\n\n       When the trade union Solidarity bravely emerged in the \n     early 1980's to fight the Polish communist regime, Mr. \n     Kirkland and other labor officials smuggled money, printing \n     presses and even electronic equipment to keep the fledgling \n     anti-communist movement alive. . . . When it came to \n     confronting the greatest security threat this country has \n     ever faced, Mr. Kirkland did not flinch. He fought communism \n     and supported fledgling democratic movements that contributed \n     to the demise of many totalitarian regimes. For that effort, \n     he deserves everyone's appreciation.\n\n  Mr. President, Lane Kirkland was born and grew up in Camden, S.C. In \n1942--the same year I graduated from the Citadel--he graduated from the \nU.S. Merchant Marine Academy. In World War II, he served as a deck \nofficer on a merchant marine vessel that carried ammunition. After he \ngraduated from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in \n1948, he joined the AFL research staff. And in 1979, after moving up \nthe ranks, he became president of the AFL-CIO.\n  Mr. President, Lane Kirkland's career is a striking parallel to \nAmerica in this, the American century. He fought overseas to preserve \nour freedom. He won. He fought at home to make the American dream \navailable to all of us. And he won. Finally, he fought to end the cold \nwar and give others the access to the freedom that we cherish. Again, \nhe won.\n  All of us as Americans have reason to be proud that Lane Kirkland is \none of us. Those of us from South Carolina, however, have the privilege \nof claiming him as one of ours.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate Lane's friendship over the years and wish \nhim and Irena all the best.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11446-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11446-S11447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  IN COMMEMORATION OF COAST GUARD DAY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the U.S. Coast \nGuard on this, its 250th birthday. Since its formation on August 4, \n1790, Coast Guard men and women have served our Nation proudly, \nprofessionally, and with distinction. They have served in a complex \norganization that has grown and evolved along with our country. From a \nfleet of 10 small cutters built to stop smuggling, the Coast Guard has \ndeveloped into a multimissioned organization that is the world's \npremier maritime service.\n  The Active Duty, Civilian, Reserve, and Auxiliary personnel of the \nCoast Guard today perform many more missions than those who served in \n1790. On an average daily basis, the Coast Guard: conducts 191 search \nand rescue cases; saves 14 lives and assists 328 people; saves nearly \n$2.5 million in property; seizes 209 pounds of marijuana and 170 pounds \nof cocaine worth $9.2 million; boards 90 large vessels for port safety \nchecks; processes 120 seamen's documents; responds to 34 oil or \nhazardous chemical spills; conducts 120 law enforcement boardings, \nidentifying 65 violations; investigates 17 marine accidents; inspects \n64 commercial vessels; services 150 aids to navigation; and interdicts \n176 illegal migrants.\n  Everyone knows the valiant and often heroic efforts of Coast Guard \npersonnel as they perform search and rescue missions. During one such \nmission this past winter, a Coast Guard rescue swimmer displayed true \nbravery. Aviation Survivalman First Class Michael Odom jumped from a \nCoast Guard helicopter in the middle\n of the night and swam several hundred yards through turbulent seas to \nhelp rescue three men. After the third man was safely pulled aboard the \nhelicopter, the hoist cable broke, leaving Odom stranded in the ocean \nhundreds of miles from shore. Fatigued, the Coast Guardsman dragged \nhimself aboard a life raft, and a waited rescue. The 20 foot seas and \n40 knot winds repeatedly swept him from his raft, and he began to \nexperience severe seasickness. Unconscious, hypothermic, and near \ndeath, he as rescued 5 hours later by a second helicopter. This spring, \nAviation Survivalman First Class Michael Odom received the \nDistinguished Flying Cross for his heroic actions--actions that \ncharacterize the people of this great service.\n\n  The Coast Guard also continues to be the Nation's primary Federal \nmaritime agency. As a lead organization in the war on drugs, the Coast \nGuard regularly stops the flow of illegal substances bound for our \ncities and communities, as demonstrated by a recent interdiction in \nwhich a Coast Guard cutter stopped a vessel with over 5,000 pounds of \ncocaine on board.\n  Responding to safety problems posed by foreign vessels operating in \nU.S. waters, the Coast Guard implemented a Port State Control \nInitiative last year that has produced positive results. Coast Guard \nmarine inspector boardings of foreign ships in general have increased \n70 percent, while boardings of foreign freight ships--the vessel type \nmost often associated with substandard characteristics--have seen a 10-\nfold increase from previous levels. These efforts have led to the \nidentification of over 400 shipowners and operators and 18 flag states \nassociated with substandard ships. As a result of this targeting, the \nCoast Guard has enhanced its ability to focus boarding efforts on those \nships that pose the greatest risk to marine safety and environmental \nsecurity.\n  Coast Guard personnel are often at great risk in performing their \ndangerous missions. This past January, while conducting a law \nenforcement boarding, PO Jonathan D. Scotchmer made the ultimate \nsacrifice when the floor beneath him collapsed. His dedication to duty \nand willingness to serve his country are an inspiration to us all and \nwill not be forgotten. Petty Officer Scotchmer is a true hero.\n  Despite being the smallest of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Coast Guard \nin some manner positively affects the lives of virtually all Americans. \nThe service's efforts to enforce fisheries laws and regulations, to \nprevent, and when required, respond to oil spills in our Nation's \nwaters, and to rescue \n\n[[Page S 11447]]\nthose in distress in the maritime region are just one of the many \nexamples of the daily impact of the Coast Guard.\n  Mr. President, it is for these efforts and the exemplary service to \nour Nation that the Coast Guard was recently presented with the \nDepartment of Transportation's Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement. \nCoast Guard men and women are the ultimate lifesavers and guardians of \nthe sea. I am proud and honored to commemorate their birthday by \ncommending them for their dedicated service to a very grateful Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11446-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11447-S11448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       FEMA DISASTER RELIEF FUND\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am releasing a report prepared at my \nrequest by the inspector general of the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency regarding the integrity of the disaster relief fund which raises \nsome serious concerns about how disaster relief funds are being spent.\n  Last week, the President signed into law a supplemental appropriation \nof $6.55 billion for the FEMA disaster relief fund. These funds are \nneeded for expenses related to last year's Northridge earthquake as \nwell as other disasters in 40 States, including my own. I'm pleased \nthat the supplemental appropriation is now law, so that eligible \nexpenses related to these catastrophic occurrences can be reimbursed.\n  Ensuring that these funds are expended to meet the critical disaster-\nrelated needs of individuals and communities, so that they can rebuild \ntheir lives and neighborhoods, is vital. However, ensuring that these \nfunds don't serve as a slush fund for FEMA is absolutely essential, and \nthe inspector general has raised questions about whether the disaster \nrelief fund is indeed serving as a slush fund of sorts.\n  Specifically, the inspector general found that charges to the fund \ntotaling $87 million were for nonspecific disasters, some of which may \nbe inappropriate. There are no explicit guidelines to define those \nactivities that directly support disaster relief and are therefore \nlegitimate charges.\n  The FEMA Director must address this issue immediately to give us \nconfidence that the funds are being spent consistently with the intent \nof the law.\n  The inspector general also found that the disaster relief fund data \nare often unreliable, grants management is weak, disaster loan \nmanagement is inadequate, and certain FEMA policies do not appear to \nencourage the prudent use of disaster dollars.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear, I believe FEMA Director James Lee \nWitt has done a superb job of responding to each and every disaster he \nhas been responsible for--from the Northridge earthquake to the \nOklahoma City bombing. He and the Agency should be commended.\n  But we must ensure that FEMA disaster relief funds--which now total \nabout $7 billion FEMA's accounts--are spent carefully and judiciously. \nI intend to ask FEMA to come up with a plan for strengthening controls \non disaster relief funds and issue explicit guidelines and criteria.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief, 6 page executive \nsummary of the FEMA inspector general's audit of FEMA's disaster relief \nfund be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  AUDIT OF FEMA'S DISASTER RELIEF FUND\n\n\n                                preface\n\n       This report presents the results of our audit of FEMA's \n     Disaster Relief Fund. It was prepared in response to a \n     request from Senator Christopher Bond and as part of our \n     ongoing efforts to improve FEMA operations.\n       The report also addresses aspect of the Disaster Relief \n     Fund that Director Witt asked us to review. It contains \n     recommendations for corrective action. Accordingly, it is \n     being sent to the Director, Associate Directors, Regional \n     Directors, and the Chief Financial Officer. Copies of the \n     report are also being sent to Members of Congress.\n       The Audit Division, Officer of Inspector General, prepared \n     this report. Questions may be addressed to Richard L. \n     Skinner, Assistant Inspector General for Audit, at (202) 646-\n     3911.\n                                                  George J. Opfer,\n                                                Inspector General.\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       In response to a request by Senator Christopher Bond, the \n     Office of Inspector General undertook an audit of the \n     Disaster Relief Fund. We concentrated our efforts on the \n     financial management of the Fund and on issues that offered \n     an opportunity for improving operations and reducing costs. \n     Given the time available, we were not able to address every \n     issue that deserved attention. We plan to continue to devote \n     resources to the review of FEMA's use of the Fund.\n       It is important to consider the environment in which FEMA \n     operated since the 1988 enactment of the Stafford Act. The \n     number of disasters has steadily increased. There have been \n     more average or ``garden-type'' disasters. In addition, the \n     United States has been struck by two major hurricanes, Hugo \n     and Andrew, the massive months-long Midwest floods, and the \n     catastrophic Northridge, California earthquake. Responding to \n     these disasters put tremendous pressure on FEMA's financial \n     and personnel resources.\n       In this difficult environment, FEMA's performance in \n     assisting disaster victims has been criticized. In response \n     to this criticism FEMA has taken aggressive steps to improve \n     the delivery of services while trying to contain costs. To \n     illustrate, some of the more significant actions include:\n       Acquisition of a new financial management system.\n       Establishment of a Disaster Finance Center to process \n     payments.\n       Establishment of National Processing Services Centers.\n       Automation of Teleregistration and damage verification \n     inspections.\n       Establishment of a Disaster Resources Review Board.\n       Development of a new property management system.\n       These initiatives should go a long way in improving \n     disaster relief operations and reducing disaster costs. \n     However these actions are only the first steps. Much more \n     work needs to be done. Clearly through, FEMA is on the right \n     road and given enough time and resources the problems can be \n     solved.\n       We present numerous findings and recommendations that \n     should aid FEMA in its efforts to improve operations and \n     reduce costs. The following summarizes those findings.\n\n\n                     reliability of financial data\n\n       Disaster Relief Fund financial data are often unreliable. \n     The Fund balance does not accurately reflect either cash in \n     the Fund or amounts available to assist disaster victims. \n     FEMA's accounting system is inadequately controlled and \n     personnel lack the discipline necessary to ensure financial \n     data integrity. Budget requests are flawed because they are \n     based on unreliable financial data and projected disaster \n     costs that are not precise. (See Chapter 1, page 9.)\n\n\n                    appropriateness of expenditures\n\n       In fiscal year 1995, non-specific disaster charges are \n     expected to total $86.8 million, about four percent of total \n     fund expenditures. Many charges appear legitimate. Others, \n     however, fall into a ``gray'' area, i.e., depending on one's \n     interpretation of the Stafford Act and related FEMA \n     guidelines, they may or may not be appropriate charges to the \n     Fund. FEMA needs to develop explicit guidelines that define \n     those activities that directly support disaster relief \n     operations and, therefore, are legitimate charges to the \n     Disaster Relief Fund. (See Chapter 2, page 21.)\n\n\n                           grants management\n\n       FEMA has awarded Public Assistance grants totaling billions \n     of dollars to thousands of grantees without an adequate \n     grants management system to ensure funds are used properly. \n     Significant improvements are needed in pre-award and post-\n     award processes to ensure that grantees are accounting for \n     and using funds properly. Policies and procedures for all \n     aspects of grants management are needed. (See Chapter 3, page \n     31.)\n\n\n                  management of disaster loan programs\n\n       FEMA's Disaster Loan Program includes State Share Loans and \n     Community Disaster Loans totaling over $179 million. FEMA has \n     limited recourse in collecting loans if borrowers misuse \n     funds. Loan agreements, and other contractual agreements are \n     not regularly executed. FEMA's interest, therefore, is not \n     protected. Better loan monitoring and tighter restrictions on \n     borrowers' use of funds are needed. (See Chapter 4, page 47.)\n\n\n                  economy and efficiency of operations\n\n       We reviewed FEMA's management of human resources at the \n     disaster site, use of mission assignments to task other \n     Federal agencies for goods and services, and management of \n     property acquired with Disaster Relief Funds. We also \n     reviewed certain grant policies that did not appear to \n     encourage the prudent use of disaster dollars.\n       After the initial response to a major disaster, FEMA can do \n     a better job of managing resources to reduce travel related \n     costs. We estimate that $2 million dollars might have been \n     saved in Northridge by hiring locals in a more timely manner. \n     FEMA has recognized the need for improved staff management \n     and is taking steps to improve its management of human \n     resources at disaster sites.\n       FEMA does not have a system to ensure that the States' cost \n     sharing requirements are satisfied for work done through \n     mission assignments. Also, untimely billings from other \n     Federal agencies are tying up disaster dollars for excessive \n     periods.\n       Even though FEMA has taken several steps to improve \n     controls over property, more still needs to be done. \n     Additional training is needed to ensure the new property \n     management system will work effectively. Also, there is a \n     need to establish controls over property that is purchased by \n     other Federal agencies under mission assignments.\n\n[[Page S 11448]]\n\n       FEMA's policy on small public assistance projects is \n     resulting in unnecessary costs to disasters. Small projects \n     are those under $43,600 and are funded based on estimated \n     cost. Under FEMA's policy, grantees are only required to \n     certify that the project is completed; they are not required \n     to account for project costs. As a result, funds that have \n     not been used for disaster-related costs are not being \n     returned to FEMA.\n       Grantees are not required to account for and are not \n     spending all the funds provided for administrative costs \n     associated with public assistance grants. There are two ways \n     grantees can receive funds for administrative costs: (1) a \n     statutory fee calculated as a percentage of public assistance \n     awards; and (2) a management grant. The management grants are \n     fulfilling much of the grantees' administrative requirements \n     leaving much of the statutory fees unspent. FEMA needs to \n     reexamine its policy for providing administrative fees to \n     grantees to ensure that the funds are accounted for and \n     actually needed for the delivery of disaster related \n     services.\n       Considerable savings could be achieved by limiting the \n     Federal cost share for public assistance projects to 75 \n     percent of estimated project cost. Since 1989 the cost share \n     for 22 disasters was 90 or 100 percent. We estimate that over \n     $1.5 billion could have been saved if the cost share had been \n     held to 75 percent.\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       Since passage of the Stafford Act in 1988, FEMA has \n     obligated about $12 billion for disaster relief. FEMA \n     officials project that an additional $8 billion could be \n     obligated for disasters declared prior to July 1, 1995. The \n     Federal contribution for disaster assistance has increased \n     dramatically in the past 20 years, due in part to the greater \n     number and magnitude of disasters.\n       There is growing Congressional concern over the spiraling \n     Federal outlays associated with FEMA's disaster assistance \n     programs and a desire to control future disaster spending, \n     FEMA, also, has recognized the need to control disaster \n     costs. It has several initiatives underway or planned to get \n     a better grip on the escalating costs.\n       Among the major initiatives that FEMA is currently \n     developing or planning are: (1) a new financial system to \n     permit better identification and control of billions of \n     dollars of disaster related costs, (2) a property management \n     system that will allow for better accounting and control over \n     the millions of dollars of property purchased for disasters, \n     (3) improvements in staffing disasters to control personnel \n     and travel related costs, (4) centralization of support \n     services such as financial management and applicant \n     registration, (5) automation of labor intensive processes \n     such as damage inspections, and (6) Performance Partnership \n     Agreements with States that will limit the amount of disaster \n     assistance based on a per capita dollar amount. All of these \n     initiatives are underway, and if successful, should result in \n     better management and control over disaster dollars.\n       Congress, however, remains concerned with the escalating \n     costs of disasters. On April 27, 1995, the Office of \n     Inspector General received a request from Christopher S. \n     ``Kit'' Bond, Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee for \n     Veterans Administration, Housing and Urban Development, and \n     Independent Agencies, to undertake a review of FEMA's \n     Disaster Relief Fund to identify ways that costs can be \n     reduced.\n       This audit responds to the Senator's request by examining \n     the nature of costs charged to the Disaster Relief Fund, the \n     feasibility of converting loan programs to grants, the \n     economy and effectiveness of disaster operations, and \n     implications of increased cost sharing.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11447-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11448-S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                AMBASSADOR ALBRIGHT'S TESTIMONY ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs held two hearings \non Iraq. The hearings, chaired by the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Brown, focused on the importance of maintaining U.N. \nsanctions on Iraq and on the Iraqi atrocities against the Kurds.\n  I thought both hearings made a significant contribution to the \nSenate's understanding of a critical foreign policy issue, and I \ncommend Senator Brown for bringing the matter to the forefront of the \nsubcommittee's agenda.\n  At the start of the first hearing, U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations Madeleine Albright made a compelling, irrefutable case for \nkeeping U.N. sanctions in place against Iraq. Equally as important, her \ntestimony underscored the superb job the United Nations is doing to \ndismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, deter further \nIraqi aggression, and to protect Iraq's minorities.\n  At a time when the Congress is considering numerous proposals to \ncondition or reduce U.S. support of the United Nations, Ambassador \nAlbright's testimony serves to remind us of the tremendous \ncontributions the United Nations makes to advance vital U.S. foreign \npolicy interests. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nAmbassador Albright's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n             Statement by Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright\n\n       Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, and members of the \n     subcommittee.\n       I welcome this timely opportunity to discuss with you \n     United States policy towards Iraq, with particular attention \n     to the aspects of that policy that are carried out through \n     the United Nations.\n       As members of the subcommittee know, the United States has \n     been determined, in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, to \n     prevent Iraq from once again developing weapons of mass \n     destruction or threatening its neighbors with aggression. In \n     this effort, the tool of economic and weapons sanctions, \n     imposed by the U.N. Security Council, has been of singular \n     value.\n       Over the past year, we have worked hard to gain and \n     maintain support for our view that sanctions should remain in \n     place until Iraq is in overall compliance with all relevant \n     Council resolutions. This effort has been successful. In \n     March, May, and again in July the sanctions were extended \n     without controversy or change.\n       Iraqi officials have said publicly in recent days that, if \n     the sanctions are not lifted in September, when they next \n     come up for review, Iraq will cease to cooperate with the \n     United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM, which is the \n     body established to monitor Iraqi compliance. Such statements \n     are harmful both to the interests of the Iraqi people and to \n     the world at large.\n       The re-integration of Iraq into the world community is a \n     goal we all share, but there is only one path to that \n     objective--and that path requires full cooperation with \n     UNSCOM and full compliance with the requirements of the \n     Council. The regime in Baghdad must understand that it is not \n     involved in a negotiation; it is under an obligation brought \n     on by its own transgressions.\n       The United States is insisting, as is a majority of \n     Security Council members, that before there is serious \n     discussion of lifting sanctions, Iraq must comply not only \n     with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction, \n     but with other obligations established under council \n     resolutions. These include the return of stolen property, \n     accounting for those missing in action, and ending support \n     for terrorism and repression against the Iraqi people.\n       In his speech on July 17, Saddam Hussein characterized the \n     UN sanctions as ``cruel, harsh and repressive'' and said they \n     were causing ``great suffering'' among the Iraqi people. \n     Unfortunately, the sincerity of this statement of concern is \n     belied by Saddam's refusal to accept the terms of Security \n     Council Resolution 986, which would permit Iraq to sell up to \n     $1 billion of oil every three months in order to purchase \n     humanitarian supplies. It is belied, as well, by the \n     ``putting people last'' spending priorities of the Iraqi \n     government, by Saddam's campaign of terror against minorities \n     in the north and south, and by the barbaric treatment given \n     Iraqis suspected of disloyalty to the regime.\n       For four years, Iraqi officials have sought alternatives to \n     full compliance with Council resolutions. They have delayed \n     and obfuscated. They have demanded concessions in return for \n     small steps. They have threatened and bullied UNSCOM. They \n     have lied. Last fall, they even attempted to intimidate the \n     Council through threatening military maneuvers directed \n     towards Kuwait.\n       These tactics have not worked; and in the interests of \n     stability and justice, they must not be allowed to work.\n       Last month's decision by the Iraqi government to release \n     two American citizens who had been detained since March was \n     welcome, but irrelevant to the sanctions issue. The two \n     Americans should not have been jailed in the first place. We \n     congratulate Representative Bill Richardson for his \n     successful effort to gain their release, but his was strictly \n     a humanitarian endeavor. There was no message of any kind \n     from the Administration and no authorization to negotiate. \n     The Richardson trip did not represent the opening of a new \n     channel of communication between Iraq's government and our \n     own, and it has not and will not influence our policy with \n     respect to sanctions.\n       Let me describe now, more specifically, what that policy is \n     and why we feel so strongly about it.\n       We are insisting that Iraq meet fully all obligations \n     established by the Security Council because we remain highly \n     distrustful of the Iraqi regime, and because that regime \n     remains a potential threat to a region of great strategic \n     importance to us and to the world. It was five years ago this \n     week that Iraq invaded Kuwait. Hundreds of thousands of \n     American soldiers put their lives at risk to halt and reverse \n     that act of blatant aggression. We should not allow Saddam \n     Hussein to regain in the Security Council what he forfeited \n     through his own ambition and miscalculation on the \n     battlefield.\n       It should be obvious that a premature return to business as \n     usual with this regime would entail grave and unacceptable \n     risks. If past is prologue, we could expect the Iraqi \n     Government to resume the development and production of \n     weapons of mass destruction as rapidly as possible; we could \n     expect it to test repeatedly the limits of what could be \n     gained through the intimidation of its neighbors; we \n\n[[Page S 11449]]\n     could expect a halt to progress in resolving humanitarian and financial \n     issues arising out of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; and we could \n     expect continued brutal repression of the Iraqi people.\n       Accordingly, we are determined to maintain sanctions until \n     we are convinced by Iraq's behavior that it no longer \n     constitutes a threat to peace and stability in the Persian \n     Gulf. Iraq can demonstrate that by proving--through its \n     compliance with the Resolutions--that it is no longer an \n     outlaw state. Only when its peaceful intentions are proven \n     will there be grounds for modifying the sanctions regime.\n       Experience tells us that Saddam Hussein's Iraq will respond \n     constructively only to a policy of firmness and steady \n     resolve. Last fall, when Iraqi troops once again threatened \n     Kuwait, President Clinton responded immediately, forecefully \n     and effectively. As a result, Baghdad not only pulled back \n     its troops; but it agreed, at long last, to recognize \n     formally its legal border with Kuwait.\n       The central question, of course, is whether Iraq is, in \n     fact, complying with the terms of the relevant Security \n     Council resolutions. The answer, unfortunately, is that Iraqi \n     compliance has been grudging, slow, sporadic and \n     insufficient.\n       During the next few minutes, with the help of the National \n     Intelligence Council, I would like to review with you the \n     facts and the evidence that supports them. Mr. Andrew Liepman \n     of the CIA is here to assist in answering any questions you \n     may have.\n\n\n         weapons of mass destruction (wmd)--biological warfare\n\n       First, with respect to weapons of mass destruction.\n       On July 3, the Security Council was notified by UNSCOM \n     Chairman Ekeus that Iraq had finally admitted that it had, \n     indeed, possessed an offensive biological warfare program. \n     The Iraqis said that the program was conceived in 1985 and \n     that the production of biological warfare agents began at the \n     Al Hakam facility in 1989 and continued until 1990. They \n     claimed that the biological warfare agents produced were \n     destroyed in October 1990 in view of the imminence of \n     hostilities.\n       The Iraqis have now undertaken to draft a complete report \n     on their biological warfare program. We understand that an \n     initial draft has been prepared, and that it is--as we \n     speak--being reviewed in Baghdad by UNSCOM. If past efforts \n     by Iraq are any precedent, we can expect the process of \n     explanation and verification to consume a considerable amount \n     of time. In the area of chemical weapons, for example, Iraqi \n     obfuscation, deception and sloppiness caused a delay measured \n     not in days or months, but years. The sad fact is that no \n     initial Iraqi weapons declaration has been truthful.\n       There are, moreover, ample grounds for continued \n     skepticism.\n       Iraq claims--we believe falsely--that the biological \n     warfare agents produced were never weaponized. We believe \n     that the Iraqis began their biological warfare program much \n     earlier than they have admitted, and that more biological \n     agents were manufactured and many more facilities and people \n     involved than Iraq has revealed.\n       Iraq has not acknowledged to the UN anywhere near the \n     number of people normally associated with a research effort \n     of this size. Iraq will have to cooperate with UNSCOM in \n     showing the location of its biological warfare facilities and \n     the equipment used in production. UNSCOM will also need a \n     full explanation of the disposition of the more than 17 tons \n     of biological growth media that remain unaccounted for and of \n     the ways and means by which the produced biological agents \n     were allegedly destroyed.\n       We should not forget that, until five weeks ago, Iraq \n     denied outright the existence of an offensive biological \n     warfare program. The story changed only after irrefutable \n     evidence was made available to UNSCOM and members of the \n     Security Council that such a program had existed. In other \n     words, Iraq only admitted what we already knew. We cannot \n     count on Iraqi officials to volunteer accurate information \n     and, in this context, the importance of obtaining complete, \n     accurate and verifiable data is critical.\n       Consider that the Iraqis have admitted to producing more \n     than 500,000 liters of anthrax and botulinum toxin at the Al \n     Hakam facility. Anthrax, in doses of a millionth of a gram, \n     is fatal within five to seven days, nearly 100 percent of the \n     time. Botulinum is 100,000 times more toxic than the chemical \n     warfare agent sarin that was used by terrorists in the \n     Japanese subway tragedy earlier this year. Although weather \n     conditions and limitations on delivery capability would limit \n     potency, it is at least theoretically true that the amount of \n     biological warfare agents Iraq admitted producing is more \n     than enough to kill every man, woman and child on earth.\n                   other weapons of mass destruction\n\n       Discrepancies between the Intelligence Community's \n     assessments of the scale of Iraqi WMD efforts and Iraqi \n     declarations to the UN lead us to believe that Iraq is still \n     hiding equipment and materials belonging to its other WMD \n     programs. For example, the U.S. Intelligence Community \n     estimates that as many as several dozen Scud missiles remain \n     unaccounted for.\n       We are concerned, moreover, that if the oil embargo is \n     lifted unconditionally, Baghdad could well order the \n     departure of UN inspectors. Under those circumstances, Iraq \n     could then rebuild its weapons of mass destruction programs, \n     a process that would take: less than a year for Iraq's \n     biological weapons programs; two to three years for its \n     chemical warfare (CW) program; and five to seven years, with \n     foreign help, for a first nuclear device.\n       Lest there be doubt about its intentions, Iraq continues to \n     devote money and manpower to rebuilding its infrastructure \n     for its weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons \n     programs. The Al Kindi missile research and development \n     facility, for example, supported many Iraqi weapons programs \n     before the war. The facility was damaged heavily during \n     Operation Desert Storm but has been largely rebuilt and even \n     expanded since then. The facility has been under UN \n     supervision, but if UN inspectors were forced to leave, it \n     could easily be converted to support prohibited weapons \n     programs.\n       The Habbaniyah II facility produced CW agent precursor \n     chemicals before Desert Storm. The Iraqis have rebuilt the \n     main production building and the chlorine plant and have \n     added a phenol production line as well as a ferric chloride \n     line. These production lines contain dual-use equipment that, \n     in the absence of UNSCOM, could easily be converted to CW \n     agent or precursor chemical production.\n\n\n             return of captured kuwaiti military equipment\n\n       The Security Council has required that Iraq return to \n     Kuwait the military equipment it stole during the invasion. \n     Iraq's claim to have complied with this requirement is \n     laughable.\n       Baghdad says that it retains only a few pieces of damaged \n     Kuwaiti combat equipment; the truth is that Iraq has \n     integrated a variety of this equipment into its own military.\n       For example, Iraq claims that it has only four of the BMP-2 \n     infantry fighting vehicles that it stole from Kuwait; we \n     estimate it has more than 200.\n       Prior to the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq only had single-carry \n     heavy-lift transporters in its inventory. They stole about \n     100 Kuwaiti transporters capable of carrying two APCs each. \n     The Iraqis even used them to move pieces of equipment--\n     including the stolen Kuwaiti BMP-2's--that were used to \n     threaten the emirate last October.\n       Much of what Iraq actually has returned is not Kuwaiti at \n     all, but rather derelict Iranian equipment, captured during \n     the Iran-Iraq war, complete with documents written in Farsi \n     and painted-over pictures of the Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\n\n                               terrorism\n\n       Iraq has also continued to use terror as an instrument of \n     state policy.\n       We believe Iraqi security services were behind a highly \n     suspicious auto accident last summer that resulted in the \n     death of the son of the late spiritual leader of Iraqi Shia.\n       In April 1994, Iraqi intelligence officers murdered Talib \n     al-Suhayl, an Iraqi oppositionist in Beirut. The officers \n     were arrested and still being held by Lebanese authorities.\n       Iraq also remains in contact with terrorist groups such as \n     the Abu Nidal Organization and the Palestine Liberation \n     Front.\n\n\n                     repression of the iraqi people\n\n       Security Council Resolution 688 requires that the \n     Government of Iraq cease its brutal repression of the Iraqi \n     people. Here, as elsewhere, the record of Iraqi compliance is \n     dismal.\n       The Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human \n     Rights, Max van der Stoel, reports that repression continues, \n     including political killings, mass executions and state-\n     sponsored terrorism.\n       In the north, Saddam's economic blockade of the three \n     Kurdish provinces is now in its third year, and Baghdad's \n     shut-off of electrical power to Dahuk province is in its \n     second year.\n       In the south, at least 700 hamlets have been destroyed by \n     government forces since 1991. More have been destroyed this \n     year. Government attacks against Shia communities have been \n     accompanied over the past two years by the draining of the \n     southern marshes. This has produced catastrophic results for \n     local animal species and for the marsh Arabs whose unique and \n     ancient culture now verges on extinction.\n       The Special Rapporteur has asserted that the Government of \n     Iraq has engaged in war crimes and crimes against humanity, \n     and may have committed violations of the 1948 Genocide \n     Convention. The Special Rapporteur continues to \n     call on the Government of Iraq to permit the stationing of \n     monitors inside the country to improve the flow of \n     information and to provide independent reporting of alleged \n     human rights abuses. We continue to support Mr. van der \n     Stoel's work and his call for monitors.\n\n\n           coping with sanctions--palaces first; people last\n\n       In April, the Security Council approved Resolution 986, to \n     simplify procedures for Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil \n     to purchase humanitarian goods for its people. Iraq has \n     rejected this resolution, demonstrating again that Saddam \n     Hussein desires not to ease his people's suffering, but to \n     use that suffering to gain sympathy for getting sanctions \n     lifted.\n       Neither war nor sanctions nor diplomatic isolation have \n     altered Saddam's priorities; he continues to devote \n     considerable resources to rebuilding the Iraqi military and \n     his own palaces.\n       Iraq has built 50 new palaces or luxury residences since \n     the end of Desert Storm at \n\n[[Page S 11450]]\n     a cost of over $1.5 billion. There are now 78 such palaces or \n     residences in Iraq for use by Saddam, his family, or close \n     supporters.\n       For example, the Mosul palace complex includes two areas; \n     one with five palaces and two offices or apartment buildings; \n     the other with three completed palaces and a fourth under \n     construction on a newly excavated, man-made lake. The \n     estimated postwar cost of expanding this complex is between \n     $170-$230 million.\n       One of the largest and most elaborate palaces in Iraq is in \n     the Lake Tharthar complex; its estimated size of about \n     300,000 square feet is about five times the size of the White \n     House and one and one-half the size of Versailles. Other \n     buildings on the compound, including residence and service \n     and security facilities, add at least another 150,000 square \n     feet to the complex. The estimated cost of this complex is \n     $180-$240 million.\n       An additional $230-$310 million has been spent since the \n     end of the war adding new wings with elaborate archways to \n     the Baghdad Republican Palace, a building which serves as the \n     official palace and symbol of the regime.\n       In addition to diverting scarce resources away from needed \n     purchases of humanitarian goods, Saddam and his family \n     capitalize on their official positions in Iraq for personal \n     profit, often at the expense of their own citizens.\n       For example, members of Saddam's family, particularly his \n     son Uday, control extensive business interests in Iraq. Some \n     family members exploit the economic distortions caused by UN \n     sanctions by importing goods into Iraq for resale at \n     exorbitant prices. Saddam's relatives also are involved in \n     illicit oil exports from Iraq and use the proceeds, in part, \n     to line their own pockets. Finally, relief supplies donated \n     by the international community also have ended up for sale in \n     stores reserved for the elite friends of the regime.\n\n\n                              a look ahead\n\n       In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would like to stress several \n     points.\n       First, UN sanctions against Iraq have accomplished much. \n     Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction has \n     been dismantled; weapons have been destroyed; the border with \n     Kuwait has been recognized; there are clear constraints on \n     what Iraq can do to intimidate its neighbors. The \n     effectiveness of sanctions is directly attributable to their \n     multilateral nature. Here, the value of the United Nations, \n     and the importance of international cooperation in defense of \n     common interests, is clear.\n       Second, the continued effectiveness of sanctions cannot be \n     taken for granted. We have indicated that we would use the \n     veto, if necessary, to prevent sanctions from being lifted \n     prematurely. But to be most effective, sanctions must be \n     enforced, and that is much harder to do unilaterally. This is \n     a major reason we have argued so strongly, in the context of \n     Bosnia and elsewhere, that the integrity of UN sanctions must \n     be respected.\n       Third, the value to our interests of sharing appropriate, \n     but sensitive, information with United Nations bodies has \n     been demonstrated clearly in this case. And those who lapse \n     into derisive generalities about the quality and capabilities \n     of UN organizations should recognize that UNSCOM has \n     performed its complex tasks extremely well despite difficult \n     and at times dangerous conditions.\n       America's position on Iraq sanctions has been consistent, \n     principled and grounded in a realistic and hard-won \n     understanding of the nature of the Iraqi regime.\n       Our policy will not change until and unless Iraq does \n     everything the UN Security Council says it must. As President \n     Clinton stated in his most recent report to Congress on this \n     subject:\n       Iraq is still a threat to regional peace and security . . . \n     I continued to be determined to see Iraq comply fully with \n     all its obligations under the UNSC resolutions. I will oppose \n     any relaxation of sanctions until Iraq demonstrates its \n     overall compliance with the relevant resolutions. Iraq should \n     adopt democratic processes, respect human rights, treat its \n     people equitably and adhere to basic norms of international \n     behavior.\n       I should add that the Administration appreciates the strong \n     and bipartisan support it has had from Congress with respect \n     to our policy towards Iraq. this has been, and will remain an \n     essential ingredient to that policy's success.\n       Thank you once again for the opportunity to be here today. \n     I look forward to any questions you might have.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11448-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11450-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11450-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ENTITLED ``SUSTAINABLE ENERGY STRATEGY: CLEAN AND SECURE ENERGY \n     FOR A COMPETITIVE ECONOMY''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 73\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Throughout this century, energy has played a prominent role in \nAmerican progress. The rise of the great industrial enterprises, the \nascendence of the automobile, the emergence of environmental awareness, \nand the advent of the truly global economy all relate to the way that \nsociety produces and uses energy. As we face the opportunities and \nchallenges of the next century, energy will continue to exert a \npowerful influence on our Nation's prosperity, security, and \nenvironment.\n  Energy policies that promote efficiency, domestic energy production, \nscientific and technological advances, and American exports help \nsustain a strong domestic economy. The need to protect the environment \nmotivates our continual search for more innovative, economic, and clean \nways to produce and use energy. And although oil crises have receded \ninto memory, their potential for harming our economy and national \nsecurity remains.\n  Our Administration has actively pursued a national energy policy \nsince January 1993. We have engaged in an active dialog with thousands \nof individuals, companies, and organizations. Informed by the dialogue, \nwe have committed the resources of the Department of Energy and other \nagencies to ensure that our policy benefits energy consumers, \nproducers, the environment, and the average citizen.\n  This report to the Congress, required by section 801 of the \nDepartment of Energy Organization Act, highlights our Nation's energy \npolicy. The report underscores our commitment to implement a \nsustainable energy strategy--one that meets the needs of today while \nexpanding the opportunities for America's future. By implementing a \nsustainable strategy, our energy policy will provide clean and secure \nenergy for a competitive economy into the 21st century.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to improve the \ncontrol of outdoor advertising in areas adjacent to the Interstate \nSystem, the National Highway System, and certain other federally \nassisted highways, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     billboard control legislation\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nthat will strengthen the Federal law that regulates billboards on our \nNation's highways and scenic byways. My bill will close the loophole in \nthe 1965 Highway Beautification Act that permits billboards in unzoned \nareas, a fact that clearly violates the spirit of the 1965 act.\n  I have been a strong supporter of strict billboard controls even \nsince I represented Rutland County as a Vermont State senator. During \nmy tenure as a State senator, I served as vice chair of the special \ncommittee that wrote Vermont's law banning billboards from our Federal \nhighways and rural routes, and as state attorney general, I \nsuccessfully defended the law in the Federal courts.\n  New billboards are being constructed along the U.S. Federal aid \ninterstate and primary highways at record rates. In fact, based on \nestimates by the Congressional Research Service, one billboard is \nerected every 30 minutes all year long--a total of 15,000 to 16,000 \nannually--along Federal aid highways.\n  Currently, the Highway Beautification Act allows new billboards to be \nconstructed in zoned and unzoned commercial and industrial areas. In \ntheory, this limits billboards to areas with substantial bona fide \ncommercial or industrial activity. In practice, however, this means \nthat wherever there is any industrial or commercial use--for example, a \nsingle gas station--several bill billboards may be erected. Many of \nthese signs have messages that are not even related to the adjacent \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, by bill will close this legal loophole by only \nallowing billboards to be constructed in those areas that are zoned for \ncommercial or industrial use.\n  Mr. President, my bill will also require that the Federal Highway \nAdministration keep track of the number of billboards on our Nation's \nhighways. In 1991, the Congressional Research Service estimated that \nthere were between 425,000 and 450,000 billboards in existence on \nFederal aid roads, but admitted that no one really knew how many \nbillboards were along these roads.\n  Right now States are only required to report to the Federal \nGovernment the number of illegal and nonconforming billboards on their \nroads. Decent public policy cannot be made in the absence of \ninformation. My bill will require that States and the Federal Highway \nAdministration track the number of conforming billboards along Federal \naid highways and scenic byways.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill will prohibit the removal of trees \nand other types of vegetation for the sole purpose of improving \nbillboard visibility. The idea that publically owned trees, many \nplanted with public beautification funds, should be destroyed to enrich \nbillboard owners is ludicrous. What is worse is that many of these \nbillboards are nonconforming and are required by law to be removed \nanyway.\n  Mr. President, my bill will move the 1965 Highway Beautification Act \ncloser to its original intent of preserving the public's investment in \nour highways by protecting scenic areas and natural resources and \ngiving Congress the information it needs to make well-informed public \npolicy. I urge my colleagues to become cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1122. A bill to amend the provisions of titles 17 and 18, United \nStates Code, to provide greater copyright protection by amending \ncriminal copyright infringement provisions, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S 11452]]\n\n\n\n             the criminal copyright improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf \nof Senator Feingold and myself, the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act \nof 1995. This bill would close a significant loophole in our copyright \nlaw and encourage the continued growth of the National Information \nInfrastructure by insuring better protection of the creative works \navailable online.\n  This bill reflects recommendations and hard work of the Department of \nJustice. I want to commend the Department for recognizing the need for \nprompt action on this important problem.\n  Bruce Lehman, Commissioner of Patent and Trademark and chair of the \nWorking Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the President's \nInformation Infrastructure Task Force, recognizes the critical role of \ncopyright protection as we move forward with the NII. The preliminary \ndraft of the report of the working group, explained:\n\n       The potential of the NII will not be realized if the \n     information and entertainment products protectable by \n     intellectual property laws are not protected effectively when \n     disseminated via the NII. Owners of intellectual property \n     rights will not be willing to put their own interests at risk \n     if appropriate systems--both in the U.S. and \n     internationally--are not in place to permit them to set and \n     enforce the terms and conditions under which their works are \n     made available in the NII environment. Likewise, the public \n     will not use the services available on the NII and generate \n     the market necessary for its success unless access to a wise \n     variety of works is provided under equitable and reasonable \n     terms and conditions, and the integrity of those works is \n     assured. All the computers, telephones, fax machines, \n     scanners, cameras, keyboards, televisions, monitors, \n     printers, switches, routers, wires, cables, networks and \n     satellites in the world will not create a successful NII, if \n     there is not content. What will drive the NII is the current \n     moving through it.--Intellectual Property and the National \n     Information Infrastructure, July, 1994, p. 6.\n\n  The copyright Act, which is grounded in the copyright clause of the \nConstitution, assures that ``contributors to the store of knowledge \n[receive] a fair return for their labors.'' Harper & Row The Nation \nEnterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 546 (1985). I am mindful, however, that when \nwe exercise our power to make criminal certain forms of copyright \ninfringement, we should act with ``exceeding caution'' to protect the \npublic's First Amendment interest in the dissemination of ideas. \nDowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 221 (1985).\n  For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law a defendant's \nwillful copyright infringement must be for purposes of commercial \nadvantage or private financial gain. Not-for-profit or noncommercial \ncopyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no \nmatter how great the loss to the copyright holder. This presents an \nenormous loophole in criminal liability for willful infringers who can \nuse digital technology to make exact copies of copyrighted software and \nother digitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for \nquick, inexpensive and mass distribution of pirated, infringing works. \nThis bill would close this loophole.\n  United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an \nexample of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that \ncase, an MIT student set up computer bulletin board systems on the \nInternet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. \nThis resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over one \nmillion dollars over a 6-week period. Since the student apparently did \nnot profit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute \nhim under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire \nfraud. The district court described the student's conduct ``at best . . \n. as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and \nlacking in any fundamental sense of values.''\n  Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because \nit viewed copyright law as the exclusive remedy for protecting \nintellectual property rights. The Court expressly invited Congress to \nrevisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating:\n\n       Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach \n     to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software \n     even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer. \n     One can envision ways that the copyright law could be \n     modified to permit such prosecution. But, ``[i]t is the \n     legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and \n     ordain its punishment.''\n\n  This bill would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful \ncopyright infringements in the following ways: First, serious acts of \nwillful copyright infringement that cause significant loss to the \ncopyright holders would be subject to criminal prosecution.\n  The bill would add a new offense prohibiting willful copyright \ninfringement by reproduction or distributing copyrighted material with \na total retail value of $5,000 or more. Under the new offense, it would \nbe a misdemeanor to make even a single copy of a copyrighted work with \na total retail value of between $5,000 and $10,000, and a felony if the \ntotal retail value of the infringed upon item or items was over \n$10,000.\n  These monetary thresholds, combined with the scienter\n   requirement, would insure that criminal charges would only apply to \nwillful infringements, not merely casual or careless conduct, that \nresult in a significant level of harm to the copyright holder's rights. \nDe minimis, not-for-profit violations, including the distribution of \npirated copies of works worth less than $5,000, would not be subject to \ncriminal prosecution.\n\n  Second, the bill would increase the monetary threshold for the \nexisting criminal copyright offense, which makes it a misdemeanor to \ncommit any willful infringement for commercial advantage or private \nfinancial gain, and a felony if 10 or more copies of works with a \nretail value of over $2,500 are made during a 180-day period. The bill \nwould increase the monetary threshold in this offense from $2,500 to \n$5,000 for felony liability.\n  Third, the bill would expressly prohibit willfully infringing a \ncopyright by assisting others in the reproduction or distribution, \nincluding by transmission of an infringed work. This would further \nensure coverage of activities such as those of alleged in LaMacchia.\n  Fourth, the bill would add a provision to treat more harshly \nrecidivists who commit a second or subsequent felony criminal copyright \noffense. Specifically, repeat offenders would be punished by \nimprisonment for up to 10 years rather than 5 years for a first felony \noffense. Such a calibration of penalties takes an important step in \nensuring adequate deterrence of repeated willful copyright \ninfringements.\n  Fifth, the bill would extend the statute of limitations for criminal \ncopyright infringement actions from 3 to 5 years, which is the norm for \nviolations of criminal laws under Title 18, including those protecting \nintellectual property.\n  Finally, the bill would strengthen victims' rights by giving \nvictimized copyright holders the opportunity to provide a victim impact \nstatement to the sentencing court. In addition, the bill would direct \nthe Sentencing Commission to set sufficiently stringent sentencing \nguideline ranges for defendants convicted of intellectual property \noffenses to deter these crimes.\n  Technological developments and the emergence of the National \nInformation Infrastructure in this country and the Global Information \nInfrastructure worldwide hold enormous promise and present significant \nchallenges for protecting creative works. Increasing accessibility and \naffordability of information and entertainment services are important \ngoals that oftentimes require prudent balancing of public and private \ninterests. In the area of creative rights, that balance has rested on \nencouraging creativity by ensuring rights that reward it while \nencouraging its public availability.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice \nand other interested parties to make any necessary refinements to this \nbill to insure that we have struck the appropriate balance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n          Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995--Summary\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title.--The Act may be cited as the \n     ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995.''\n       Sec. 2. Criminal Infringement of Copyrights.--The bill adds \n     a new definition for ``financial gain'' to 17 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 101, and \n\n[[Page S 11453]]\n     amends the criminal copyright infringement provisions in titles 17 and \n     18. The bill also ensures that victims of criminal copyright \n     infringement have an opportunity to provide victim impact \n     statements to the court about the impact of the offense. \n     Finally, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to ensure \n     guideline ranges are sufficiently stringent to deter criminal \n     infringement of intellectual property rights, and provide for \n     consideration of the retail value and quantity of the \n     legitimate, infringed-upon items.\n       (a) Definition of Financial Gain. Current copyright law \n     provides criminal penalties when a copyright is willfully \n     infringed for purposes of ``commercial advantage or private \n     financial gain.'' The bill would add a definition of \n     ``financial gain.'' The bill would add a definition of \n     ``financial gain'' to the copyright law, 17 U.S.C. Sec. 101, \n     and clarify that this term means the ``receipt of anything of \n     value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.'' \n     This definition would make clear that ``financial gain'' \n     includes bartering for, and the trading of, pirated software.\n       (b) Criminal Offenses. The requirement in criminal \n     copyright infringement actions under 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a) \n     that the defendant's willful copyright infringement be ``for \n     purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain,'' \n     has allowed serious incidents of copyright infringement to \n     escape successful criminal prosecution.\n       For example, in United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. \n     535 (D. Mass. 1994), the defendant allegedly solicited users \n     of a computer bulletin board system on the Internet to submit \n     copies of copyrighted software programs for posting on the \n     system, and then encouraged users to download copies of the \n     illegally copied programs, resulting in an estimated loss of \n     revenue to the copyright holders of over one million dollars \n     over a six week period. Absent evidence of ``commercial \n     advantage or private financial gain,'' the defendant was \n     charged with conspiracy to violate the wire fraud statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1343. The district court described the \n     defendant's conduct as ``heedlessly irresponsible, and at \n     worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any \n     fundamental sense of values,'' but nevertheless dismissed the \n     indictment on the grounds that acts of copyright infringement \n     may not be prosecuted under the wire fraud statute.\n       The bill would add a new section 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(2) \n     to prohibit willfully infringing a copyright by reproducing \n     or distributing copyrighted material, which has a total \n     retail value of $5,000 or more. This monetary threshold, \n     combined with the scienter requirement, insures that merely \n     casual or careless conduct resulting in distribution of only \n     a few infringing copies would not be subject to criminal \n     prosecution. Criminal charges would only apply to willful \n     infringements resulting in a significant level of harm to the \n     copyright holder's rights. De minimis violations would not be \n     covered.\n       By contrast to the offense in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(1), \n     which requires that 10 or more copies be made during a 180-\n     day period for a felony penalty, the new proposed offense in \n     Sec. 506(a)(2), does not contain a numerical threshold or \n     requisite time period during which the infringement must \n     occur. Instead, criminal sanctions would attach under \n     Sec. 506(a)(2) if only a single copy were made of a \n     copyrighted work with a total retail value of over $5,000. \n     The criminal offense would be a misdemeanor if the total \n     retail value of the infringed-upon items was between $5,000 \n     and $10,000, and a felony if the total retail value was over \n     $10,000.\n       Court decisions have indicated that intangible property, \n     such as intellectual property rights, may not be protected \n     under traditional theft or fraud statutes. See Dowling v. \n     United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985) (``bootleg'' phonorecords \n     that infringed copyrights not subject to interstate \n     transportation of stolen property statute); United States v. \n     Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991) (intangible \n     property such as source code not protected by interstate \n     transportation of stolen property statute); United States v. \n     LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994) (violation of \n     copyright holder's rights cannot be prosecuted under wire \n     fraud theory). The copyright statute may be the only remedy \n     available to protect copyrighted works, such as computer \n     programs, from infringement by electronic copying. This is \n     exceptionally important because a copyright attaches, \n     automatically, when an original work is fixed in a tangible \n     medium. Thus, any work embodying source code or any other \n     literary work may be protected against unauthorized \n     reproduction by uploading or downloading, if at all, by the \n     copyright statute.\n       Under the bill, unauthorized reproduction or electronic \n     ``theft'' (which is, essentially, a reproduction and \n     distribution) of source code or other items worth $5,000 or \n     more are subject to criminal penalties, and the theft of more \n     valuable copyrighted material worth more than $10,000 is \n     punishable at felony level. In sum, since cases reflect that \n     intellectual property rights may not be protected by general \n     criminal statutes, the bill would amend the copyright law to \n     ensure such protection exists.\n       The offenses under Sec. 506(a)(1) and (a)(2) would overlap. \n     For example, someone selling 10 or more copies of a \n     copyrighted work may violate both provisions if the value of \n     those copyrighted works is $5,000 or more. The key, however, \n     is that the new provision in Sec. 506(a)(2) requires that the \n     infringement involve, at a minimum, $5,000, and felony \n     provisions do not attach until the value of the copyrighted \n     works reaches $10,000. By contrast, any offense, regardless \n     of value, involving private financial gain or commercial \n     advantage constitutes at least a misdemeanor, and the crime \n     reaches felony level under the bill once the retail value of \n     the copyrighted material exceeds $5,000.\n       The bill would also expressly prohibit willfully infringing \n     a copyright by ``assisting others'' in the reproduction or \n     distribution of an infringed work. This would make clear that \n     individuals who aid and abet a criminal copyright violation \n     could not escape criminal liability by claiming that they \n     were not responsible for the reproduction or distribution \n     because they merely enabled others to engage in such conduct.\n       (c) Limitation on Criminal Procedures. The bill would amend \n     17 U.S.C. Sec. 507(a) to extend the statute of limitations \n     for criminal copyright infringement actions from three to \n     five years. A five year statute of limitations is the norm \n     for violations of criminal laws under Title 18, including \n     those that relate to protecting intellectual property. See, \n     e.g., 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2319A (Unauthorized fixation of and \n     Trafficking in sound recordings) and Sec. 2320 (Trafficking \n     in counterfeiting goods or services).\n       (d) Criminal Infringement of a Copyright. The bill would \n     amend the penalty provisions in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2319 to \n     comport with the proposed amendments to 17 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 506(a), and would also add a new subsection providing \n     for a victim impact statement.\n       First, under current law, willful copyright infringement \n     for commercial advantage or private financial gain is a \n     felony punishable by up to five years' imprisonment only when \n     the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution \n     during a 180-day period of ten or more copies with a retail \n     value of over $2500. Willful infringements for commercial \n     advantage, which do not satisfy the monetary threshold or \n     quantity requirement during the statutory time period, are \n     misdemeanor offenses. The bill would modify the felony \n     penalty provision for willful copyright infringement for \n     commercial advantage or private financial gain to cover \n     reproductions or distributions ``by transmission'' and to \n     cover those individuals ``assisting others in such \n     reproduction or distribution.'' The bill would also change \n     the monetary threshold from $2,500 to $5,000.\n       Second, the bill would provide a new penalty in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2319(c) for the new offense in 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a)(2) \n     of willfully infringing a copyright by reproduction or \n     distribution of 1 or more copies of copyright works with a \n     total retail value of $5,000 or more. This new offense would \n     be punishable by a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment if \n     the total retail value of the legitimate, infringed work \n     exceeded $10,000.

A bill to limit access by minors to cigarettes through \nprohibiting the sale of tobacco products in vending machines and the \ndistribution of free samples of tobacco products in Federal buildings \nand property accessible by minors; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n    legislation banning tobacco vending machines on federal property\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 4 years ago, I introduced a bill to ban \ntobacco vending machines in Federal buildings and on Federal property \naccessible to children. Two years ago, I reintroduced the bill, and it \npassed the full Senate by voice vote as an amendment to the fiscal year \n1994 Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill. I rise today to \nreintroduce my bill for three simple reasons:\n  First, in 1993, after the Senate passed my amendment to ban tobacco \nvending machines on Federal property, the conferees failed to retain \nthe legislative language, opting instead for the following statement in \nthe fiscal year 1994 Treasury-Postal appropriations conference report:\n\n       . . . [elimination of the provision] does not signal a lack \n     of concern for the health and safety of minors. The conferees \n     agree that locating cigarette sales vending machines in areas \n     accessible to minors poses a serious problem as their \n     presence increases the availability of products which \n     otherwise may be prohibited from sale to minors. Therefore, \n     the conferees direct the Administrator to eliminate vending \n     machines in areas which are accessible to minors.\n\n  Despite this directive, tobacco vending machines remain on federal \nproperty and many are fully accessible to children.\n  Second, more substantively, vending machines are extremely difficult \nto monitor. Not surprisingly, they are one of the chief sources of \ncigarette purchases among children and teenagers.\n  Third, finally, every State in the country has enacted a law to \nprohibit the sale or distribution of cigarettes to minors.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to talk about each \nof the points I have listed.\n  As I mentioned, the congressional directive contained in the fiscal \nyear 1994 Treasury-Postal Service appropriations bill was issued almost \n2 years ago. In those 2 years, more than 2 million children and teens \nin this country took up smoking. One-third of them--more than 600,000 \nchildren--will later die of tobacco-related causes. Let me repeat that: \nmore than 600,000 children will die because sometime over the past 2 \nyears, they started to smoke. And we cannot even get a few cigarette \nvending machines out of some Federal buildings.\n  Mr. President, these statistics are not exaggerations. The facts are \nwell known and widely acknowledged:\n  First, more than 420,000 people died each year from tobacco-related \ncauses, making cigarette smoking the single most preventable cause of \ndeath and disability in the United States.\n  Second, every day, more than 3,000 children and teenagers start to \nsmoke. More than two-thirds of all adult smokers had their first \ncigarette before the age of 14, and 90 percent began smoking by age 18.\n  Third, every year, minors consume 516 million packs of cigarettes, at \nleast half of which are sold illegally to children and teens.\n  Five hundred sixteen million packs of cigarettes consumed by minors \nannually. Three thousand children starting to smoke every day. And \nevery State in this country has a law prohibiting the sale of tobacco \nproducts to minors.\n  Clearly, something is not working. It is time for a new course of \naction. Some experts argue that the wisest, most effective course of \naction would be to take the tobacco industry up on its voluntary plan \nfor reducing underage smoking and try to hold the industry to its \ncommitment. Others argue that we should use this opportunity to give \nthe Food and Drug Administration broader regulatory authority of \ntobacco products. The President is currently grappling with these tough \nissues, and we expect an announcement of his decision at any time.\n  For several years, I have sponsored legislation that would \nspecifically give the FDA the authority to regulate nicotine-containing \ntobacco products. For a number of years, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services has urged States and localities to take greater \nresponsibility by, among other things, banning cigarette vending \nmachines.\n  In recent years, other Federal officials, including President Clinton \nand former President Bush, have joined the Department's appeal to \nStates and localities. In its Healthy People 2000 Report, the Public \nHealth Service encourages Indian Tribal Councils to ``similarly enforce \nprohibitions of tobacco sales to Indian youth living on reservations'' \nbecause Indian nations are sovereign and exempted from State laws.\n  I agree with the Department's previous advice. I sincerely hope that \nover the next few days or weeks the President will take a tough stand \non the issue of Federal regulation of tobacco products. I hope he will \ngo much farther than this modest bill. At the same time, I would \ncaution the President and my colleagues in the Senate not to forget the \npowerful message that leading by example can convey.\n  Mr. President, over that past several years, while the Federal \nGovernment has been urging every other political body in the country to \nban cigarette vending machines, pack after pack are loaded into--and \npurchased out of--vending machines every day in Federal buildings. \nThose buildings include the Senate and House Office Buildings and the \nOld Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.\n  It is long past time for the vending machines to go. It is time for \nthe Federal Government to lead by example. I believe that if we expect \nStates, localities, Indian Tribal leaders, schools, parents, and even \nthe tobacco industry itself, to take steps to protect our children from \ntobacco, then we in the Federal Government should join the effort. We \nshould lead the effort. We can begin with passage of this legislation, \nwhich I ask to be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. Thank you.\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 304\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Gregg]

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Information Technology \n     Management Reform Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 4002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federal information systems are critical to the lives \n     of every American.\n       (2) The efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal \n     Government is dependent upon the effective use of \n     information.\n       (3) The Federal Government annually spends billions of \n     dollars operation obsolete information systems.\n       (4) The use of obsolete information systems severely limits \n     the quality of the services that the Federal Government \n     provides, the efficiency of Federal Government operations, \n     and the capabilities of the Federal Government to account for \n     how taxpayer dollars are spent.\n       (5) The failure to modernize Federal Government information \n     systems and the operations they support, despite efforts to \n     do so, has resulted in the waste of billions of dollars that \n     cannot be recovered.\n       (6) Despite improvements achieved through implementation of \n     the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, most Federal \n     agencies cannot track the expenditures of Federal dollars \n     and, thus, expose the taxpayers to billions of dollars in \n     waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n       (7) Poor planning and program management and an \n     overburdened acquisition process have resulted in the \n     American taxpayers not getting their money's worth from the \n     expenditure of $200,000,000,000 on information systems during \n     the decade preceding the enactment of this Act.\n       (8) The Federal Government's investment control processes \n     focus too late in the system lifecycle, lack sound capital \n     planning, and pay inadequate attention to business process \n     improvement, performance measurement, project milestones, or \n     benchmarks against comparable organizations.\n       (9) Many Federal agencies lack adequate personnel with the \n     basic skills necessary to effectively and efficiently use \n     information technology and other information resources in \n     support of agency programs and missions.\n       (10) Federal regulations governing information technology \n     acquisitions are outdated, focus on paperwork and process \n     rather than results, and prevent the Federal Government from \n     taking timely advantage of the rapid advances taking place in \n     the competitive and fast changing global information \n     technology industry.\n       (11) Buying, leasing, or developing information systems \n     should be a top priority for Federal agency management \n     because the high potential for the systems to substantially \n     improve Federal Government operations, including the delivery \n     of services to the public.\n       (12) Structural changes in the federal government, \n     including elimination of the Brooks Act (Section 111 of the \n     Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949), \n     are necessary in order to improve Federal information \n     management and to facilitate Federal Government acquisition \n     of the state-of-the-art information technology that is \n     critical for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     Federal Government operations.\n     SEC. 4003.

Mr. President, I submit an amendment to S. 852.\n  Mr. President, I submit this amendment to the Public Rangelands \nManagement Act of 1995 in an effort to assure multiple users of public \nlands, such as hunters and fisherman, that the bill does not change the \nfundamental requirement of multiple use.\n  As the principal sponsor of this legislation, I never intended that \nthe bill diminish in any way the rights and privileges currently \nenjoyed by hunters, fishermen, hikers, back-packers or any outdoor \nsportsmen and recreationalists.\n  When the original bill was criticized for limiting access for such \npurposes, and creating a so-called dominant use for grazing, it was \nchanged.\n  For example, section 106(a) states that livestock grazing on Federal \nlands shall be managed under the principle of multiple use and \nsustained yield.\n  To further emphasize this fundamental underpinning of the bill, a new \nfinding has been added to section 101(a) to state that: ``Multiple use, \nas set forth in current law, has been and continues to be a guiding \nprinciple in the management of public lands and national forests.''\n  The amendment I submit today would unequivocally state, at an \nappropriate place in the text of the legislation, that ``nothing in \nthis title shall limit or preclude the use of Federal land for hunting, \nfishing or appropriate recreational activities in accordance with \napplicable Federal and State laws and the principles of multiple use.''\n  I will urge my colleagues at the proper time to add this language to \nthe bill and I assure people across this country that their ability to \nuse public lands for their outdoor sporting and recreational activities \nwill be in no way diminished by this legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11469-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11470-S11471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 HARKIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2121\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Boxer) \nproposed an amendment to the bill S. 1026, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 371, after line 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1062 REDUCTION OF UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES IN \n                   EUROPE.\n\n       (a) End Strength Reductions for Military Personnel in \n     Europe.--Notwithstanding section 1002(c)(1) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act, 1985 (22 U.S.C. 1928 note), but \n     subject to subsection (d), for each of fiscal years 1997 and \n     1998, the Secretary of Defense shall reduce the end strength \n     level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in \n     accordance with subsection (b).\n       (b) Reduction Formula.--\n       (1) Application of formula.--For each percentage point by \n     which, as of the end of a fiscal year, the allied \n     contribution level determined under paragraph (2) is less \n     than the allied contribution goal specified in subsection \n     (c), the Secretary of Defense shall reduce the end strength \n     level of members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     assigned to permanent duty ashore in European member nations \n     of NATO by 1,000 for the next fiscal year.

Mr. President, many States have been directly \ninvolved in the explosive growth of gambling across the Nation in the \nlast two decades.\n  The staggering surge in State-sponsored and State-licensed gaming has \nlargely been the result of impulsive decisions by cash-strapped State \nand local governments whose leaders are looking for painless new \nsources of revenue.\n  There has been scant attention, at any level of government, to the \nlarger and often troubling public policy implications that accompany \nthe gambling boom. I have introduced S. 704, a bill that would charter \na Gambling Impact Study Commission which, after an 18-month inquiry, \nwould release its findings in a report that would provide some guidance \nto the President, to the Congress, to State and local governments and \nto the American people as these decisions are made in the future. \nSenator Lugar has joined in this effort as the chief Republican \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  In the current issue of the Washington Monthly, Joshua Wolf Shenk \noffers an illuminating analysis of the ways that State lotteries often \nentice individuals into gambling with sales pitches that, he notes, are \n``the only form of advertising unburdened by State and federal truth-\nin-advertising standards.'' I call his article, ``Everyone's A Loser,'' \nto the attention of my colleagues, and I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Monthly, July/Aug. 1995]\n\n Everyone's a Loser: How Lottery Ads Entice the Wrong People to Gamble\n\n                         (By Joshua Wolf Shenk)\n       Tom had been playing the lottery for two years when God \n     started whispering in his ear. At first, Tom (who asked that \n     his last name be withheld) would spend just a few dollars a \n     week. He had his regular numbers, and he'd play them when he \n     thought of it.\n       But then, he says, on the days that he hadn't planned on \n     playing, the word would come from Heaven: Your number is \n     coming tonight. Fear would strike him like ice water on the \n     neck: ``I'd think, `I'm not going to win it. I don't have the \n     [money] on that number.' '' So he'd rush out to play his \n     regular number, and many more. Before long, he was spending \n     $300 a week on tickets.\n       ``It was `A Dollar and a Dream'; `Hey, You Never Know,' '' \n     he says, repeating the advertising slogans of the New York \n     lottery. Tom pauses. ``Those were good come-ons.''\n       It's no accident that the voices inside Tom's head echoed \n     lottery ads. They're extremely effective. And they're \n     everywhere: on the radio and TV, in bus shelters and on \n     billboards, even in mailings sent straight to homes. The \n     message is simple: Play the lottery and get rich. Get rich, \n     and all your problems will be solved. The New York lottery \n     takes in more than $2 billion in sales each year, and it \n     spends $30 million each year on advertising to keep the cash \n     rolling in.\n       State lotteries target anyone who might cough up a dollar \n     (or $10 or $20) for the chance to strike it rich. \n     Conveniently silent on the odds, these ads send the message \n     that hard work and patience is for suckers. In the process, \n     the ads help wring billions of dollars from the most \n     vulnerable ``customers'' possible--the poor and the addicted.\n       Criticism of state lotteries runs a wide gamut. Some say \n     the state shouldn't even allow gambling, much less conduct \n     it. Others argue that gambling should be left in private \n     hands. Still others believe that the state should run \n     lotteries for roughly the same reason many states run liquor \n     stores: to keep the business controlled and clean, and to \n     make money for the state.\n       Regardless of where you stand on these important questions, \n     though, one thing should be clear: The advertising that \n     entices Americans to spend tens of billions of dollars on \n     lottery tickets each year is deceitful and corrosive. It is \n     the only form of advertising unburdened by state and federal \n     truth-in-advertising standards. The fact that it comes from \n     the state--which\n      ought to encourage people's strengths, not prey on their \n     weaknesses--makes it all the more foul.\n       Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia have \n     instituted lotteries, and that number is likely to \n     grow.``Quite simply, states need the revenue,'' explains \n     David Gale, executive director of the North American \n     Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. ``Every dollar \n     raised by the lottery is a dollar you don't need to get from \n     taxes.'' Across the country, $34 billion in lottery tickets \n     were sold in 1994. In Texas, the lottery contributed $935 \n     million to the state's budget. In New York, the figure was \n     $1.01 billion. As states have become dependent on lottery \n     revenue, the pressure to keep people playing has become \n     relentless. ``Marketing is absolutely essential,'' Gale says. \n     ``Lottery tickets are no different than any other product. \n     Your market will lose interest after a while. You have to \n     keep after them.''\n       Like any sophisticated business, lotteries target the \n     specific groups of people most susceptible to suggestion. The \n     Iowa lottery's media plan, for example, contains the \n     following statement of objective: ``To target our message \n     demographically against those that we know to be heavy \n     users.''\n       One such target is the poor. The charge that lotteries are \n     regressive--that is, hitting lower-income residents the \n     hardest--makes intuitive sense, since the pitch of wealthy \n     fantasies clearly resonates most strongly among those who are \n     least affluent. ``There's absolutely no question about it,'' \n     says Charles Clotfelter, a Duke University economist and a \n     leading authority on lotteries. According to a study by the \n     Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank, the poor \n     spend more money than the non-poor on lotteries--not only as \n     a percentage of their income, but also in absolute terms. \n     Blacks and Hispanics also tend to play more often than \n     whites.\n       I worked two summers at an Ohio convenience store that sold \n     lottery tickets, and my experience there confirms these \n     findings. The store drew customers from all socioeconomic \n     backgrounds, but lottery players \n\n[[Page S 11473]]\n     fell into distinct categories. On a normal day, the lottery patrons \n     were mostly working-class blacks. When the jackpot for Super \n     Lotto got sky-high, some wealthier folks joined the lines. \n     But the staple customers--those who spent five, 20, or 40 \n     dollars a day on daily numbers and\n      scratch-off games--were the same people every day; not \n     executives or store managers playing for kicks, but postal \n     workers and retirees on Social Security. You'll see the \n     same trend at almost any lottery outlet. You'll also \n     notice that the same stores almost invariably sell liquor \n     and cigarettes. Choose your poison.\n       The image of miserable working people magically transported \n     to lives to wealth and ease is a staple of lottery ads. A \n     billboard once placed in a slum of Chicago read simply: \n     ``Your Ticket Out of Here.'' An ad for the D.C. lottery shows \n     a man ``before'' the lottery--with matted hair, stubble on \n     his face, and glasses--and ``after''--freshly washed and \n     clean-shaven, wearing a tuxedo, and holding the program for a \n     theater performance. The copy reads: Just One Ticket . . . \n     And it Could Happen to You.'' And ad for the Michigan lottery \n     shows a college kid piloting a Lear jet. Then it cuts to him \n     day-dreaming on the job at a fast food restaurant. ``Thirty \n     new Lotto millionaires were created last year,'' the \n     announcer states. ``Play the Lotto, and you could win the \n     stuff dreams are made of.''\n       Lottery ads also go after gambling addicts, using a message \n     tuned to their weaknesses. About 5 percent of the population \n     is susceptible to compulsive gambling, according to Dr. \n     Valerie Lorenz, executive director of the Compulsive Gambling \n     Center in Baltimore. In many cases, she says, lottery ads \n     help tip these people over the edge.\n       Remember Tom's greatest fear, that his number would fall on \n     a day he hadn't bet? This is one of the defining \n     characteristic of compulsive gamblers, and it's a button that \n     lotteries push incessantly. ``Don't forget to play every \n     day,'' the Pennsylvania lottery ad says. Many ads picture \n     disheartened would-be winners whose numbers came up on a day \n     they declined or forgot to play. One ad for Tri-State \n     Megabucks (in New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont), for \n     example, shows a pathetic man grilling hamburgers on a fire \n     escape, while scenes of wealth and granduer flash by. The \n     theme is set to the tune of ``It Had to Be You,''\n\n     It could have been you.\n     It could have been you.\n     Countin' the dough.\n     Ready to go, on that three-month cruise.\n     Walkin' in style, down easy street,\n     Wearin' a smile, it could have been sweet.\n     But what can I say?\n     You just didn't play.\n     It could have been you!\n\n       The theme of magical, instant transformation also lures \n     problem gamblers. ``They live in a very painful world,'' says \n     Dr. Lorenz. ``They want to escape into fantasy, and they want \n     it instantly.'' And, of course, the sheer regularity of the \n     ads is a curse to addicts trying to stay on the straight-and-\n     narrow. ``I hear this all the time from lottery addicts who \n     are in recovery,'' Lorenz says. ``They'll cover their ears or \n     their heads. They'll say, `I wish I could leave the state.' \n     But that wouldn't help. It's all over the country.''\n       The ads never mention the losers. Tom Cummings, executive \n     director of the Massachusetts Council on Compulsive Gambling, \n     told me about two women he has been counseling. ``One lost \n     her house after going $40,000 in debt playing the lottery,'' \n     he said. ``The other gambled away money that was supposed to \n     pay for her daughter's education. All on the lottery.''\n       Lotteries aren't alone in suggesting that their product has \n     magical qualities--that's the art of advertising. But lottery \n     ads take a prize when it comes to their systematic \n     distortion. Because the lotteries are chartered by state \n     legislatures, they're untouchable by federal regulators and \n     they consider state regulators their colleagues in public \n     service. This allows lotteries to conceal the astronomical \n     odds against winning and inflate the size of jackpots.\n       Consider a 1993 California radio spot profiling a lottery \n     winner: ``John Padgett went to bed on Saturday night a \n     regular guy,'' the announcer says. ``When he woke up, he was \n     worth $11 million. That's because he's Super Lotto winner \n     number 610.''\n       Well, not quite. Padgett did win an $11.5 million jackpot. \n     But that's not worth $11.5 million. Any prize over a million \n     dollars is paid out over 20 years. Padgett's annual payment \n     came to $575,000. After taxes, the actual yearly award is \n     worth around $400,000. And the lost value--due to both \n     inflation ($400,000 will be worth far less in 2013 than it is \n     today) and lost interest--is significant.\n       It may be hard to sympathize with someone receiving a \n     $400,000 check every year. But this ad--and nearly every \n     state uses a similar pitch--is\n      clearly misleading. The government would never allow similar \n     distortions from private sector advertisers.\n       Finance companies, for example, are explicitly forbidden to \n     air commercials that feature investors who have earned vast \n     sums of money with the message, ``It could be you.'' But \n     lotteries do just that. ``I was probably going to have to go \n     back to work to make ends meet,'' Kentucky lottery winner \n     Denise Golden says in one ad. ``And now I won't have to. . . \n     . It's a dream come true.''\n       Lotteries are also exempt from Federal Trade Commission \n     truth-in-advertising standards and rules that, to give just \n     one example, require contests and sweepstakes to clearly \n     state the odds against winning in every advertisement. \n     Omitting the odds is a crucial element of lotteries' media \n     strategy, since they're trying to convince people that if \n     they play long enough, they are certain to hit the jackpot. \n     ``Sooner than later,'' says an ad for the West Virginia \n     lottery, ``you're gonna win!'' ``We won't stop until \n     everyone's a millionaire,'' the New York lottery promises.\n       A clue as to how far lotteries exceed the bounds that \n     constrain other advertisers is indicated by a report from the \n     National Association of Broadcasters issued in 1975. Three \n     tactics seemed clearly out of bounds, the NAB concluded:\n       1. [Indicating] what fictitious winners may do, hope to do \n     or have done with their winnings.\n       2. [Using] unqualified or inaccurate language regarding \n     potential winners' winnings. (e.g. ``There's a pot of gold \n     for those who buy lottery tickets''; ``Buy a ticket and be a \n     winner.'')\n       3. [Utilizing] approaches which praise people who buy \n     lottery tickets or denigrate people who do not buy tickets.\n       Today's lotteries hold themselves to no such standards. The \n     only rule is to produce maximum profit. Even in Virginia and \n     Texas, two states that forbid their lotteries to ``induce'' \n     people to play, ads make gambling seem fun and glamorous. \n     Missouri originally required all its lottery ads to include a \n     disclaimer: ``This message . . . is not intended to induce \n     any person to participate in the lottery or purchase a \n     lottery ticket.'' The disclaimer was dropped in 1988. It was \n     thought to be hurting sales.\n       Lotteries defend themselves against criticism by citing the \n     revenue they raise. They also advertise to publicize their \n     role in funding state projects. (Not\n      only does this approach bolster political support, it's also \n     a shrewd ploy to hook more players. Gambling is fun--and \n     it's also a public service!)\n       Each state has its own slogan: ``When Colorado plays, \n     everybody wins.'' ``The Missouri lottery: It makes life a \n     little richer for all of us.'' The premise of these ads--and \n     a crucial element of lotteries' popularity--is that money \n     goes to improving favorite areas of state spending, like \n     schools or parks. But this is a mere accounting trick. Ohio \n     claims that its lottery revenue goes toward education, for \n     example. ``But that doesn't mean that the budget for \n     education grows by that much,'' David Gale explains. ``What \n     happens is, the legislature budgets this much for education. \n     They see the lottery will contribute this much. So they take \n     the money they would have spent on education and put it to \n     other uses.''\n       Most states avoid the fiction altogether and say outright \n     that the money goes to the general fund. But that doesn't \n     stop lotteries from claiming credit for the very best of \n     state government. On its 20th anniversary, the Maryland \n     lottery ran a series of ``public service'' ads. One pictured \n     a nurse holding an infant, saying the baby would get better \n     care because of the Maryland lottery. Another ad in the \n     series gave credit to the lottery for the high school \n     graduation of an inner-city black teenager.\n       It is true that lottery profits go to state treasuries. But \n     so do taxes. Taxes are also honestly raised and reflect \n     community decisions about how to fairly distribute burdens \n     and responsibilities. In the current political climate, \n     raising lottery revenue is a political virtue; raising taxes \n     is political death. Naturally, politicians choose the easy \n     route. New York Governor George Pataki recently announced \n     plans for an enormous tax cut. He intends to make up the loss \n     in revenue through the introduction of ``five minute keno'' \n     in liquor stores and bars, which is expected to net the state \n     $115 million per year.\n       Lotteries defend themselves by pointing out the obvious: No \n     one is forced to buy a lottery ticket. ``I get so angry when \n     people say they should decide how [others] should spend their \n     money,'' says Teresa La Fleur, who publishes books and a \n     magazine for the lottery industry. ``Unless we decide it's \n     wrong to gamble, it's just a fact of life that people are \n     going to make choices with their money.''\n       But states don't merely allow, or provide, gambling. They \n     stimulate it. In addition to running ads, some states even \n     conduct direct-mail campaigns, sending coupons for free \n     tickets via mail. In a typical\n      campaign, cited in ``Selling Hope: State Lotteries in \n     America,'' by Clotfelter and co-author Phillip Cook, 35 to \n     40 percent of the coupons were redeemed for lottery \n     tickets. One-third of those who redeemed the coupons were \n     new players; one-third of these new players began to play \n     regularly.\n       Considering the addictiveness of lotteries, these types of \n     promotions are inexcusable. Of the nearly 40,000 calls to the \n     Council on Compulsive Gambling in New Jersey last year, for \n     example, 52 percent complained of addiction to lottery games. \n     Imagine the outcry if Phillip Morris sent free packs of \n     cigarettes through the mail.\n       In fact, the parallel between cigarettes and lottery \n     tickets is uncanny. That's why both have been the subject of \n     strict limits on advertising. Until 1974, when Congress \n     repealed a ban on the promotion of gambling in the mass \n     media, TV stations couldn't so much as mention winning \n     numbers. Now, of course, TV is the most popular medium of \n     advertising. Besides the many commercials, lottery drawings \n     are televised and a number of states have half-hour game \n     shows centered around the lottery.\n\n[[Page S 11474]]\n\n       Congressman Jim McCrery, a Republican from Louisiana, has \n     introduced legislation requiring the Federal Trade Commission \n     to impose truth-in-advertising standards on lotteries. That \n     would be a start. But a more dramatic step--banning ads \n     altogether--is in order.\n       Lottery ads don't just sell a product. They sell a way of \n     life. One ad for the Washington state lottery shows a line of \n     workers punching their time clock. ``The true joys in life,'' \n     the announcer says, ``are not found in the empty pursuit of \n     pleasure, but in the accomplishments realized through one's \n     own hard labor. For nothing satisfies the soul so much as \n     honest toil, and seeing through a job well done.''

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize one of my State's finest and most generous citizens. Maine \nhas a long tradition of philanthropic largesse, but Elizabeth Bottomley \nNoyce must now rank among the most kind-hearted, generous and \nsupportive Mainers in the State's history.\n  Earlier this summer, Mrs. Noyce purchased $19 million worth of \nproperty in downtown Portland. The property includes 6 acres of land, 3 \noffice towers and some other buildings along Congress Street, in the \nheart of Maine's largest city. But she did not buy the property in \nhopes of doubling her investment and moving on. Instead, she did so in \nhopes of luring businesses, retailers, and shoppers back to downtown \nPortland.\n  Like so many downtowns across America, Portland's is showing some \nwear and tear. The trend of the last decade or two has been toward \nsprawling suburban malls with enormous parking lots and varied stores \nin one convenient, air-conditioned setting. And while malls have been, \nin many ways, a blessing in terms of convenience for the customer and \nbusiness for the retailer, they have left a void in downtowns across \nthe country.\n  The company that will manage the properties Mrs. Noyce purchased has \nindicated that it plans to refurbish some of the buildings and add more \nparking in the area in order to lure some of the cultural and economic \nvibrancy of southern Maine back to downtown Portland. That was Mrs. \nNoyce's goal in making the purchase--to make Portland's downtown as \nthriving and vital as possible.\n  Such a purchase would be a noteworthy event on its own. But what \nmakes Elizabeth Noyce special is that the recent investment in downtown \nPortland is merely the latest in a long series of gifts to the people \nof Maine. Over the last decade, according to press reports, Mrs. Noyce \nhad donated more than $50 million to a variety of Maine institutions \nand communities. Her $3.5 million donation, for instance, allowed for \nthe construction of the Maine Maritime Museum, which attracts thousands \nof visitors every year to explore Maine's rich seafaring history. She \nhas also given $5 million to the University of Maine, $1 million each \nto the Maine Medical Center and the Portland Museum of Art, and another \n$250,000 to the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor--just to name a \nfew recent gifts. And she spent $7 million in 1991 to start Maine Bank \n& Trust and help Maine businesses at a time when there was a full-\nfledged banking crisis in Maine. She helped restore financial \nconfidence in the Maine banking industry and her bank has flourished as \na result--today it has 100 employees and is approaching 10 branches.\n  Last year, she gave $1 million to Maine Public Broadcasting. But \ninstead of just writing a check, she had five houses built on the Maine \ncoast. The project generated more than just revenue--it generated jobs \nfor Maine construction workers, builders, and designers. The money from \nthe sale of the five homes went to Maine Public Broadcasting, but the \ninvestment was much larger than that simple donation. It is the same \nprinciple she intends to apply in downtown Portland.\n  None of these gifts were to garner newspaper headlines or capture \nstatewide notoriety. Instead, they were simply gifts of a wonderful and \ngenerous spirit who believes very strongly in both the present and the \nfuture of Maine.\n  Elizabeth Noyce has become Maine's guardian angel--and our State is a \nmuch better place because of her.\n                H_______________________________________\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n  \n\n\n ADDENDUM.--CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-\n                                                   384--22 U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1994                                                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n                     Name and country                             Name of currency          Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScot B.

Mr. President, more than 30 years ago, President \nJohn F. Kennedy challenged us all to ``Ask not what your country can do \nfor you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' Plenty of statesmen \nhave come and gone since, and few have approached such eloquence. But I \nread a column recently in which the writer, former North Dakota Lt. \nGov. Lloyd Omdahl, comes pretty close, if not in style, certainly in \nhis message. He echoes President Kennedy's challenge at a point in our \nhistory when I think we need to get reacquainted with that challenge. \nHis words remind each and every one of us about the depth of our \nresponsibility to preserve and nurture our birthright--our Republic. \nMr. President, I think Mr. Omdahl's remarks deserve the attention of \nthe Senate, and I ask that his column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                     A Republic--If You Can Keep it\n\n                           (By Lloyd Omdahl)\n\n       The Fourth of July represents the most patriotic time of \n     the year when we celebrate the treasonous act of declaring \n     revolutionary intentions against the government. It was okay \n     because we won.\n       Just as important in United States history was the \n     ratification of the U.S. Constitution and the creation of a \n     democratic republic.\n       Shortly after the Constitutional Convention, Delegate Ben \n     Franklin was asked: ``And what kind of government did you \n     give us?'' To this he replied: ``A republic--if you can keep \n     it!''\n       For over 200 years, we have kept the republic through a \n     second war for independence, a traumatic civil war, a \n     devastating depression and a variety of complex international \n     conflicts. But just because the Republic has survived to this \n     point does not give it automatic life eternal. Each \n     generation must cope with the forces that would erode or \n     destroy the system.\n       It is my thesis that the present populace is less prepared \n     to preserve the Republic than prior generations.\n       Republics are citizen governments, which probably caused \n     Franklin to express dubiousness about its future. No one \n     really knew whether citizens could really successfully govern \n     a large geographic republic.\n\n[[Page S 11479]]\n\n       As former U.S. Senator Mark Andrews once commented: ``A \n     republic is a do-it yourself kit.'' The effectiveness with \n     which it operates is dependent on whether or not citizens are \n     willing to accept responsibility to ``do it'' themselves.\n       It seems that a number of basic prerequisites must be met \n     to preserve a republic.\n       And we're losing them.\n       First, citizens must be well-informed. They are not. We now \n     have an entire generation of citizens whose primary source of \n     news has come from television--an entertainment medium \n     designed to feed viewers entertainment and not news. This \n     medium requires that news must be entertaining to attract and \n     keep an audience thirsty for fun. Every TV personality \n     claiming to offer news--from Sam Donaldson to Rush Limbaugh--\n     is really offering entertainment disguised as news.\n       Second, citizens must be future-oriented. They are not. \n     Citizens oppose fiscal responsibility and other policies that \n     require short-term sacrifices for long-term benefits. They \n     want present gratification. (The latest example is popular \n     support for a 75-mile speed limit that would burn up the \n     world's limited oil supply faster.)\n       Third, citizens must function primarily from a rational \n     perspective. They do not. Reason has given way to paranoia, \n     anger, hate and a cornucopia of psychologically-based \n     responses. It is no longer possible to deal with serious \n     issues on a cognitive level.\n       Fourth, citizens must be public-regarding, i.e. place some \n     value on sacrifice for community and support for the \n     organized society. They are not. Organizations and \n     institutions are literally collapsing as people are \n     withdrawing into their shells. In reality, we have been \n     disassociating ourselves more and more from family, religious \n     and community organizations. Community and civic life is \n     dying.\n       The degree to which citizens are informed, future-oriented, \n     rational and public-regarding is the degree to which the \n     republic will function effectively. As we lose these \n     qualities, the republic's effectiveness will decline.\n       Because of the growing shallowness of citizen concern with \n     affairs of the republic, the republic becomes more vulnerable \n     to demagoguery, deception and disorganization. Politicians \n     with the simple, easy answers will be preferred to those \n     insisting on difficult decisions and sacrifice.\n       Even though it is over 200 years old, the future of the \n     Republic is still conditional. Ben Franklin's big ``if'' \n     should hang over us as a warning that republics have fallen \n     in the past and this one will also go if citizens aren't \n     willing to assume the perspective and commitment it takes to \n     make the system work.\n       It's our republic--if we can keep it.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11478-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11479-S11480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING TED BONDA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, over a period of years, one comes to \nknow a great many people, some of whom make an impression, some of whom \nfade from memory.\n  It was some years ago that I met Ted Bonda. He made an impression. \nAnd over a period of years, we have remained in touch. Ted has had an \nunusual career. World War II interrupted his education and he never \ngraduated from college, until recently when Cleveland State University \nawarded him an honorary degree. My hat's off to them.\n  Although Ted was not a college graduate, he was a member of the \nCleveland Board of Education for 5 years and president for 3 of those \n5, an extremely challenging position. He also served as a member of the \nOhio State Board of Regents for 9 years, 4 of which he served as its \nchairman, as well as 4 years as chairman of the Board of Fellows at \nBrandeis University, and a member of its board for more than 20 years.\n  But his community involvement was far greater than his educational \ninvolvement. Ted was a great lover of baseball who saved the Cleveland \nIndians from leaving the Cleveland community. He personally took over \nthe leadership and the financial commitment to save the Indians who, as \nof today, are leading the American League Central Division by 18\\1/2\\ \ngames.\n  His baseball exploits were recently described in the Cleveland Plain \nDealer in an article by Russell Schneider called, ``The Man Who Saved \nthe Tribe.'' His generosity, compassion and old-fashioned goodness have \nbeen beautifully described in the same paper by Herb Kamm, former \neditor of the Cleveland Press. And the warm feeling of the Ohio Board \nof Regents for him is aptly described in a Plain Dealer article by Lou \nMio in which the Board of Regents ``called upon its accomplished and \nlearned former chairman to deliver on his longstanding promise'' to \nprovide tickets the next time the Cleveland Indians play in the World \nSeries. Bonda told them that at a time when a World Series for the \nIndians looked possible.\n  Ted Bonda has indeed made an impact. He is the kind of human being \nthat every city in this country would be proud to have as a part of its \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, I ask that each of the articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The articles follow:\n  Time to Collect--Regents Tell Ted Bonda To Cough Up Promised Tribe \n                          World Series Tickets\n\n                              (By Lou Mio)\n\n       Alva ``Ted'' Bonda had a running joke during his nine years \n     on the Ohio Board of Regents.\n       It went like this: ``The next time the Cleveland Indians \n     play in the World Series, you are all invited.''\n       Ha, ha. Fat chance.\n       ``He probably invited several thousand people during his \n     nine years here,'' said William Napier, the board's vice \n     chancellor. ``Some people thought he was serious. Some did \n     not.''\n       Bonda, a former president of the Cleveland school board, \n     had more than a hometown fan's interest in the Tribe. He \n     owned the club in 1977 and 1978. But no matter. The Indians \n     hadn't been close to the World Series since 1954.\n       Seen the American League standings lately? The regents \n     have. That's why they unanimously adopted a resolution \n     Thursday concerning Bonda. He had served four years as \n     regents chairman, leaving the board in 1993.\n       First, they congratulated Bonda for his honorary degree \n     from Cleveland State University and for his ``irrepressible \n     faith in his beloved city, its people and its baseball \n     team.'' Then they got to the serious stuff.\n       ``The Ohio Board of Regents hereby calls upon its \n     accomplished and learned former chairman to deliver on his \n     longstanding promise; and . . . expresses its deep \n     appreciation to Professor Bonda for the tickets--and for the \n     instructive lesson . . . that good things do indeed come to \n     those who wait.''\n       Napier said he has Indians home and away baseball caps. \n     ``I'm ready as soon as I hear from him.''\n       Bonda enjoyed a hearty laugh when he learned of the \n     resolution.\n       ``I told them every year for nine years because it was \n     safe,'' Bonda said. ``But this year I told them I can't do \n     it. This year they really are going to win.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 12, 1995]\n\n                         The Quality of the Man\n\n                             (By Herb Kamm)\n\n       Cleveland State University has measured Ted Bonda for an \n     academic cap and gown, but it will take more than a piece of \n     tape to measure the man.\n       CSU recognized a lifetime of good deeds by awarding Bonda \n     an honorary doctorate of humane letters at its graduation \n     ceremonies Sunday afternoon.\n       Humane? Bonda has ennobled the word. He is a towering \n     figure of generosity, compassion and old fashioned goodness. \n     He is truly a favorite son.\n       It may be trite to say so, but in honoring Ted Bonda, CSU \n     honors itself. The recognition is long overdue, and it is to \n     CSU's credit that it has taken upon itself to correct this \n     omission.\n       Ted--they named him Alva Theodore at birth 78 years ago in \n     the Cleveland he has loved and nutured--has had a thing about \n     education, possibly because his own formal schooling ended \n     with his graduation from Glenville High School.\n       But it goes beyond that. Bonda sees learning almost as \n     important to life as bread. It explains why, at a time when \n     he could well have luxuriated in retirement, he took on the \n     onerous duties of president of the Cleveland Board of \n     Education; why he served on Ohio's Education 2000 Commission \n     and the Ohio Board of Regents; why he has given so much of \n     himself to Brandeis University as president of its National \n     Fellows and a member of its board of trustees.\n       The great Depression saw to it that Bonda never went to \n     college. But there are those who are endowed by Providence \n     with compensating virtues: good sense, good judgment, good \n     instincts. Ted is among them.\n       He of course has his critics. He brought so much passion to\n        his role as president of the Cleveland Board of Education \n     in the early '80s that he offended almost all his \n     colleagues at one time or another.\n       Surely he has irritated others in pleading and fighting for \n     his causes. Bonda tends to be impatient with those who are \n     slow to see things as he sees them or to join his crusades.\n       And it stands to reason that he had his critics and rivals \n     in business. A man doesn't lift himself up by his bootstraps, \n     or make the journey from poverty to wealth, without courting \n     controversy. But such foibles should matter little against \n     Bonda's record of caring and doing, of his countless \n     contributions to the civic and charitable missions of this \n     community and some beyond it.\n       He has been known to step in where angels fear to tread, as \n     when he was inspired, during his tenure as president of the \n     Indians, to name Frank Robinson as the first black manager in \n     major league baseball; as when he broke down another barrier \n     and brought Fred Holliday to Cleveland as superintendent of \n     schools.\n       Both deeds typified a commitment Bonda must have made early \n     in life, because those \n\n[[Page S 11480]]\n     who know him have never known him to flinch in the face of prejudice.\n       The citation Bonda received, as the title of doctor is \n     conferred on him, speaks of his ``outstanding accomplishments \n     in commerce,'' his ``unwavering support of education'' and \n     his ``tireless efforts to make Cleveland a better place.''\n       Dr. Bonda has done it all, and then some.\n                                                                    ____\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 8, 1995]\n\n                      The Man Who Saved the Tribe\n\n                         (By Russell Schneider)\n\n       If you're old enough to have been a fan of the Indians in \n     the 1970s--make that the dreadful 1970s--surely the name Alva \n     T. ``Ted'' Bonda will ring a bell.\n       And if you're not of that vintage, you are hereby notified \n     that had it not been for Bonda's efforts and perseverance \n     during those frustrating seasons from 1972-77, not only would \n     the current Indians not be doing as well as they are, they \n     also would not be the Cleveland Indians.\n       By the same token, neither would we have that downtown \n     jewel called ``Jacobs Field,'' or even Gateway's neighboring \n     Gund Arena.\n       It was Bonda who pledged his personal finances and agreed \n     to take command of the faltering franchise as its chief \n     operating officer in 1973 when the club was not only \n     insolvent, but also teetering near bankruptcy under the inept \n     Nick Mileti.\n       As it was reported to the 50-plus investors/partners in the \n     ownership of the Indians at the time, the club's losses were \n     $500,000 in 1972, $1.4 million in 1973, $500,000 in 1974, \n     $1.1 million in 1975, $680,000 in 1976 and $1 million in 1977 \n     for a not-so-grand total of nearly $5.2 million.\n       Despite the red ink that threatened to drown the franchise, \n     it was Bonda who steadfastly refused to consider selling the \n     club to Donald Trump, the wealthy New York developer.\n       Bonda insisted that Trump and other vultures offering to \n     buy the sick franchise sign an agreement that they would keep \n     the Indians in Cleveland. They all declined.\n       Thus, Bonda was stuck with the franchise, so to speak, and \n     made the best of it, as Art Modell, then the Indians' \n     landlord, acknowledged in a 1978 speech:\n       ``The man (Bonda) is a miracle worker. He was able to \n     successfully employ his talents to keep the banks and other \n     creditors from closing in. He was able to sell small pieces \n     of the partnership interests to new people to keep pumping \n     the club with an infusion of capital.\n       ``When a franchise--any kind of a sports franchise, be it \n     baseball, football, basketball, hockey or what have you--is \n     in trouble as the Indians were for so long, the quickest way \n     to cure the trouble is to move it, or sell it and allow it to \n     be moved.\n       ``History is full of franchises moving to greener pastures, \n     and as long as there is a New Orleans or a Washington--any \n     major city with an empty stadium--there's always the prospect \n     that somebody will come along and lift your franchise, move \n     it away.\n       ``But Ted Bonda never let that happen. No matter how dire \n     the straits were, and they were very dire, he was able to \n     keep the sheriff from the door, to keep juggling all the \n     balls until something could be done.\n       ``Above all, Bonda did an outstanding job of keeping the \n     Indians franchise in a condition that would allow a new group \n     to come in and take over,'' and keep the team in Cleveland.\n       Which is what happened on Feb. 3, 1978, when native \n     Clevelander F.J. ``Steve'' O'Neill purchased control of the \n     franchise, ensuring it would remain in Cleveland.\n       When O'Neill died in 1983, his estate sold the club in 1986 \n     to Richard Jacobs, under whose ownership the franchise has \n     flourished, financially and artistically.\n       All of which is relevant now because, on Sunday, Cleveland \n     State University will bestow the honorary degree of doctor of \n     humane letters upon Alva T. ``Ted'' Bonda.\n       It is an honor well-deserved by a 78-year-old guy who was \n     too poor to go to college, whose business career began as a \n     clerk in a shoe store and as a parking lot attendant, and who \n     became one of the most influential civic and political \n     leaders in Ohio--as well as having saved the Indians for \n     Cleveland in the '70s.\n       And if--when?--the Indians win the American League pennant, \n     or even the A.L. Central Division championship, I can't think \n     of anyone who'd be more deserving of the honor of throwing \n     out the ceremonial first pitch than Ted Bonda.\n       Without his involvement 20 years ago, there probably \n     wouldn't be major league baseball here.\n       P.S. In view of his recent and ongoing ``no-threat'' threat \n     to sell the Browns and allow them to be moved to another city \n     if taxpayers don't renovate the Stadium for his team, it \n     would be prudent for Art Modell to re-read the comments he \n     made in 1978 praising Bonda.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11479-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR SATURDAY, AUGUST 5, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, with all due respect to the majority \nleader, last year I remember standing on this floor about this time \nwhen we had one of the most important measures ever to confront the \nAmerican people before the Senate on whether or not we would have a \nhealth care bill to address the real needs of people in this country. \nAnd my colleagues on the other side would not permit us to vote on it. \nLast year we were here trying to pass a health care bill of extreme \nimportance to the American people, trying to hammer it out, trying to \nwork out our differences. A lot of people here had travel plans to take \ntheir families on vacation.\n It got canceled.\n\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would not permit us to \nreach a conclusion of that health care bill. Amendment after amendment \nafter amendment after amendment--they would not let us reach a final \nconclusion on the health care bill.\n  Oh, but now, now when the Pentagon bill is before us, when we want to \nabrogate the ABM Treaty, when we want to throw more lard, as my \ncolleague from North Dakota said the other day--he said he cannot call \nit pork, that does a pig a disservice--putting in $7 billion more than \nwhat the Pentagon wanted.\n  Oh, no, now we have to reach a conclusion on this. We cannot have the \ntime to debate our amendments in full and open debate. Rush to \njudgment. Close it off. And threats that somehow we are going to be \nhere until the 19th, 20th, or whatever.\n  I say to the distinguished majority leader, we heard that last year \nwhen the shoe was on the other the foot.\n  Mr. DOLE. We were here, too.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And the other side would not let us vote on the health \ncare bill. They kept rolling out those amendments one after the other. \nOh, but now there is something wrong with our side if we want to \nlegitimately debate and amend this pork barrel bill, this bill that \nputs up walls that says you cannot take any money out of the Pentagon \nto help educate our kids, to help care for the elderly, to help put a \nlittle heat in the homes of our elderly people. No, we cannot do that, \nwe put a wall around it.\n  Now they tell us we cannot debate it fully and fairly? I have \namendments on this bill that I want to debate, having to do with space-\nbased lasers and Star \n\n[[Page S 11481]]\nWars and, yes, I want to debate the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Colorado with whom I happen to agree. But, no, we are told we have \nto close it down or we are going to be held here all during August.\n  Well, Mr. President, this Senator canceled his vacation with his \nchildren last year because the other side kept us here and would not \nlet us pass the health care bill. If this Senator has to cancel this \nAugust because we need to make a better bill for the defense of this \ncountry, to save our taxpayers some billions of dollars, to make sure \nwe do not go off on some insane path of abrogating the ABM Treaty, of \nbuilding more missiles, if that is the price we have to pay, then let \nus stay here and let us debate this bill and let us amend it and let us \nhave a better defense bill for this country than this pile of lard that \nwe have before us.\n  I yield back my time if I have any left.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/04/senate-section/article/S11480-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "04", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 8:30 A.M.
