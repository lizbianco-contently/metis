The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1357) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 105 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1996.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Rockefeller motion to commit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance with instructions.\n       Brown modified amendment No. 2949 (to instructions of \n     motion to commit), instructions that the committee should \n     consider the findings of the trustees of the Federal \n     Insurance Trust Fund.\n       Abraham amendment No. 2950, to establish beneficiary \n     incentive programs to collect information on fraud and abuse \n     against the Medicare Program and to collect information on \n     program efficiency.\n       Harkin amendment No. 2957 (to amendment No. 2950), to \n     strengthen efforts to combat Medicare waste, fraud, and \n     abuse.\n       Bradley motion to commit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance with instructions.\n       Nickles/Brown amendment No. 2958 (to Bradley motion to \n     commit the bill), to increase the earned income tax credit \n     for families.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the motion by Senator Bradley. Let me start out by saying, last \nnight I think we had a good technical discussion and an important \npolicy discussion. I must say, I think all of my colleagues are \nenormously impressed with Senator Bradley's mastery of the material.\n  Mr. President, what I would like to do today in the 5 minutes that I \nhave, is to talk about this vote before us in a slightly different \ncontext. I say to my colleague from Wisconsin, my good friend, I have \nbeen thinking about the first class I will teach again at the college \nor university, community college, or University of Minnesota. In this \nclass, which I hope to teach in 7 years from now, the first lecture is \ngoing to be about this week. It is going to start out with a definition \nof politics, and I am going to say politics is, in part, about values \nand what we all care about, and we can have honest disagreements.\n  The second part of the lecture I am going to give when I go back to \nteaching is going to be titled: Who decides? Who is asked to sacrifice? \nAnd how do these decisions take place? That really summarizes this \nmotion that the Senator from New Jersey has offered, which I am so \nproud to be a cosponsor of.\n  A question: Who decides that we are going to have $245 billion of tax \ngiveaways to people already high-income and wealthy, least in need of \nthose breaks? And whose parents, or whose children, go without adequate \nhealth care? It is that simple. Or, Mr. President--and this refers to \nsome amendments that I will later on make sure that colleagues vote \non--who decides that we are going to, essentially, leave untouched this \narea of corporate welfare, that if you have a $5 million estate, you \nare going to get a tax cut, as my colleague from New Jersey pointed out \nlast night, to the tune of $1.7 million?\n  But at the same time that you have that kind of tax giveaway, at the \nsame time you have special tax loopholes and breaks for oil companies, \nor insurance companies, or you have citizens who work abroad in other \ncountries that do not have to pay any taxes on the first $70,000 they \nmake, or special breaks for pharmaceutical companies and, at the same \ntime, Mr. President--and there is no better example--a $5 million \nestate. How many people ever have that, and you get a $1.7 million tax \nbreak.\n  Who decides that we are going to have that kind of tax giveaway to \nthe wealthiest of the wealthiest citizens in this country, and not \nthose whose children go hungry and whose children are not able to \nafford a higher education?\n  In the lecture that I give, when I teach again, I am going to \ncontinue to raise these questions. I will ask the question: Who decides \nthat we are going to raise taxes for more than 200,000 people in \nMinnesota, families in Minnesota, with incomes under $30,000 a year, \nhard-pressed people and, at the same time, we are going to let the one \nperson in my State--or maybe two--with a $5 million estate get $1.7 \nmillion in a tax giveaway?\n\n[[Page S15708]]\n\n  We make choices here, and these are the questions: Who decides? Who \nbenefits? Who is asked to sacrifice?\n  In my State of Minnesota, I say to my colleague from New Jersey, we \nhave an interesting situation where back in 1991 we decided that we \nwould have a 15-percent EITC at the State level, tied to the Federal \nEITC. So working families in Minnesota get an added benefit.\n  The final point in my lecture: How did this decision get made? I \nwould tell you that what we have going on here in the U.S. Senate is \ndeficit reduction based on the path of least political resistance, \ndeficit reduction in inverse relationship to economic justice. If you \nhave the big bucks, if you have a $5 million estate, you get the tax \nbreaks. If you are low or moderate income, your taxes are raised, or \nyou cannot afford health care, or you cannot afford to send your kid to \ncollege.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the big givers are getting their way. \nThe heavy hitters are getting their way. All these large financial \ninstitutions and corporations are not asked to tighten their belts at \nall. Mr. President, what we have here is decisionmaking, democracy for \nthe few, not democracy for the many.\n  This motion brings back some fairness and justice to this process.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I rise today as a \nstrong supporter and original cosponsor of Senator Bradley's motion. It \npresents a straightforward tradeoff to the Senate. It says restore the \ntax credit for lower income working families in exchange for cutting \nsome of the tax breaks available to healthy corporations.\n  Before I get into the arguments for this motion, I want to say a \nbrief word on this budget, in general.\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I cannot agree with the \npriorities established in the budget bill before us today. But what I \nfind more disturbing than the bill itself is the partisan and \ndestructive direction the debate over this budget has taken.\n  We have polarized in extreme political positions firing slogans and \nhalf-truths at each other. The two parties agree on many basic \nprinciples that could underpin a balanced budget plan. There are \nbillions of dollars and miles of middle ground between the Democratic \nand Republican budget battle stations. Yet we have chosen to stay \nlocked in our traditional partisan positions.\n  I want to use the few minutes I have today to talk about the ample \nroom for compromise in the current budget debate. I want to remind my \ncolleagues about the principles that bring us together as public \nservants--rather than those that drive us apart into our partisan \npolitical camps.\n  First, we believe in balancing the budget. This is a year in which a \nmajority of the Senators voted for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution and a vast majority voted for a 7-year balanced budget \nplan. Whether we talk about 7 or 10 years, most of us agree it is time \nto stop adding to our national debt. Whether we cut defense or domestic \nprograms, most of us agree that Government should spend less.\n  Second, we believe that the growth of spending on Medicare and \nMedicaid must be restrained and doing so will involve difficult cuts. I \nhave heard no one deny that the aging of our population and out-of-\ncontrol health care costs have put into jeopardy these two basic health \ncare programs. I do not think anyone is seriously suggesting that we \ncan continue to let them grow at their current rates.\n  How much we cut this year, how much we put back into Medicare and \nMedicaid, how we make those cuts are all legitimate items for debate. \nWhether cuts need to occur at all is not debatable.\n\n  Third, we believe that our economy needs to grow and grow in a manner \nthat rewards families who choose work over welfare. A huge majority of \nthis Senate just voted for a welfare bill--a bill included in the \nbudget before us--that radically changes welfare into a flexible \nprogram that moves people into jobs. A majority of those who have \nserved in this and past Congresses have support the earned income tax \ncredit, a tax incentive for families that work. Encouraging work--\nrewarding work--supporting working families. These ideas are not \nDemocratic or Republican. They are American.\n  On these three points of agreement alone, we could build a credible \nbalanced budget plan. And if we did that, this Congress would be \npraised for its responsibility, its leadership, and its service.\n  Furthermore, producing a bipartisan budget plan--without partisan \nbickering, without vetoes, without shutting the government, without \npress conference--would respond to what people outside the beltway are \ndemanding I strongly believe that Americans want to see us debate the \nbudget, not use it to divide our country.\n  Americans are sickened by the hostile rhetoric, the blind \npartisanship, the misleading use of figures and facts. They are \ndemanding some honesty, some comity, and some real attempts to craft a \nbalanced budget that a huge majority of them and us can support.\n  That said, Mr. President, the budget before us is not the place to \nstart a fruitful debate on balancing the budget. It has been written \nwithout the input of our party, the President, or any outside witnesses \nbrought in for public hearings. It contains too many tradeoffs that I \nbelieve are unfair and unbalanced--and that I believe most Americans \nwould believe are unfair and unbalanced.\n  Mr. President a report recently released by the Census Bureau showed \nthe gap between our wealthiest families and low-income families growing \nto the widest point recorded since the Bureau began taking such \nmeasurements in 1967. That income disparity is a cancer that is eating \naway at economic productivity and the standard of living in this \ncountry. Any responsible balanced budget plan would take it into \naccount and would certainly not make it worse.\n\n  The budget before us makes it worse. The bottom 51 percent of tax \nfilers--those with incomes of less than $30,000--would be worse off \nunder the Senate package than under current law, according to Joint Tax \nCommittee data. Further, wealthy taxpayers--those with incomes above \n$200,000--would gain an average of $5,088 per taxpayer in the year \n2000. How can I justify asking a sacrifice from so many while I myself \nwould get a big tax break under this bill?\n  Mr. President, this basic unfairness--this basic unbalance--is the \nprimary reason I will vote against this budget, and why I do not \nbelieve it can form the basis for the compromise we so sorely need. I \ncan and will ask and stand for sacrifices for the common good as long \nas they are shared sacrifices. But I will not support a bill that \nimposes real pain on many to provide gain for a few.\n  Mr. President, I am afraid that we are missing an historic \nopportunity because of our focus on short-term political benefit. If we \ngave up our infatuation with sound bites and brinkmanship, we have the \nchance to pass a balanced budget, to undo the economic damage of the \nlast decade. As this debate proceeds, I urge my colleagues on both \nsides to move toward the position most Americans have already taken: \nStop tearing each other down and start building a future for this \ncountry with a bipartisan and fair balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I cannot agree with the \npriorities established in the budget bill before us today. But what I \nfind more disturbing than the bill itself is the partisan and \ndestructive direction the debate over this budget has taken. We have \npolarized in extreme political positions, firing slogans, and half-\ntruths at each other. Americans are sick of the blind partisanship and \nmisleading use of figures and facts. They are demanding some honesty, \nsome cooperation, and some real attempts to craft a balanced budget \nthat a huge majority of them and us can support.\n\n  That said, Mr. President, the budget before us is not the place to \nstart a fruitful debate on balancing the budget. It has been written \nwithout the input of both parties, the President, or any outside \nwitnesses brought in for public hearings. It contains too many \ntradeoffs that I believe are unfair and unabalanced--and that I believe \nmost Americans would believe are unfair and unbalanced.\n  Mr. President, this basic unfairness--this basic unabalance--is the \nprimary \n\n[[Page S15709]]\n\nreason I will vote against this budget, and why I do not believe it can \nform the basis for the compromise we so sorely need. I can and will ask \nfor sacrifices for the common good as long as they are shared \nsacrifices. But I will not support a bill that imposes real pain on \nmany to provide gain for a few. I cannot justify asking for a sacrifice \nfrom so many when I, myself, would get a big tax break under this bill.\n  Our time is limited, so let me offer three brief arguments for the \namendment on the earned income credit before us.\n  First, the amendment would make the balanced budget plan more fair. \nAccording to Joint Tax Committee data, the budget before us makes most \ntaxpayers with incomes of $30,000 or less worse off than they are under \ncurrent law. Compare that with the top 1 percent of taxpayers--those \nwith incomes above $200,000--who would receive a tax break of an \naverage of $5,088 under this budget plan.\n  The primary reason for this imbalance is the cut in the earned income \ntax credit [EIC]--the only tax break targeted to low-income working \nfamilies.\n  No one here would claim that balancing the budget is easy or can be \ndone without sacrifices by many people. However, how can we ask a \nmajority of the taxpayers to accept a balanced budget plan in which \nthey lose and a small, wealthy minority wins? That is not balanced, \nand, once it is fully understood, I do not believe it will be supported \nby most Americans.\n  Second, the amendment before us keeps a bipartisan promise we made to \nworking families. The EIC was enacted during the Ford administration \nand supported by every President since then. The EIC represents a \nbipartisan commitment to keeping low-income working families with \nchildren above the poverty line. In short, the EIC makes work pays \nbetter than welfare.\n  I have heard almost every Member of this body talk about the \nimportance of moving people from welfare to work. And we need to do \nthat in a manner that is not bureaucratic and not burdensome to \nbusiness. The EIC does this. If we cannot agree in this body to keep \nour promise to working families by preserving the EIC, I am afraid \nthere is going to be very little we can agree on.\n  Finally, the amendment before us cuts fat without cutting muscle. \nSome have characterized the EIC as a program plagued by uncontrolled \ngrowth and fraud. If that were the case, we should certainly cut it \nback dramatically. But that is not the case.\n  Only 5 percent of the cuts in the EIC proposed by the budget are \nrelated to fraud--and our amendment keeps those cuts intact. The rest \nof the cuts re reductions in taxes that go directly to working \nfamilies.\n  The average annual Federal tax hike proposed in this budget for the \n262,000 Wisconsin families who get the EIC would be $457. No one, I \nhope, is claiming those families--many of whom make around $12,000 a \nyear--are defrauding the Government. No one, I hope, is suggesting that \ntheir one tax credit ought to be first on the budget chopping block.\n  Mr. President, we are all agreed that we have to balance the budget, \nand to do that, we have to reduce entitlement spending. But we have to \ndo so in a way that makes sense and is fair. Cutting an established \nbipartisan tax credit that encourages work over welfare does not make \nsense. Cutting it while increasing tax breaks for corporations and the \nwealthy is not fair. I urge my colleagues to support the Bradley \nmotion.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out against the \nRepublican proposal to raise taxes on working families and in support \nof the Democratic amendment. The Republican tax plan raises taxes on \nfamilies making $30,000 while give a big fat tax cut to people with $5 \nmillion estates.\n  We talk a lot about getting people off welfare. But I believe if we \nare serious about moving people from welfare to work, then work must \npay them enough to pay the bills. When mom or dad works 40 hours a week \nthey should be able to pay the bills. They should be rewarded for \nworking hard. The earned income tax credit does that, it rewards hard \nwork by families. It allows these struggling families to have hope for \na better future.\n  Yes, we talk a lot about welfare reform. We talk a lot about family \nvalues. But look what we do. I believe what we explicitly state as our \nvalues we should implicitly reflect in our public policy. What is our \npublic policy? This Senate is already on record against even debating \nan increase in the minimum wage. And now this Senate is about to \napprove cutting a tax credit that helps these very same working men and \nwomen who depend on the minimum wage.\n  What are we saying to these families? We are saying even as you \nstruggle and work hard, we are going to raise your taxes. And why? Is \nit because we want to balance the budget? That is what the Republicans \nsay, but that is not the truth. The only reason we are raising taxes on \nworking families and slashing Medicare is so that the Republicans can \npass a big tax cut for people making $100,000 or $200,000 a year.\n  Mr. President. In order to fund a capital gains tax cut for the \nwealthy, the plan before us would cut the earned income tax credit by \n$42 billion and call it reform. It would increase the tax deductions \nfor capital gains by $33 billion and call it fair.\n  The earned income tax credit is designed to reward work. For every \ndollar a low income worker earns at a job, he or she receives a tax \ncredit. The size of the credit ranges from 7 cents to 36 cents per \ndollar, based on your family size. This credit is gradually phased-out \nas income rises so that there is always an incentive to earn more and \nwork more. In short, the EITC helps to offset the heavy burden that \ntaxes can place on a family that counts every single penny. It is tied \nonly to income that is earned on a job. It provides a tax break to \nthose who need it most, low-wage earners.\n  But all of this is being changed by this reconciliation bill. Single \nworkers will be cut off. Families with one or two kids will have their \ncredit reduced and their taxes increased.\n  And what does this mean? To the people of my State of Maryland it \nmeans tougher times. These cuts in the EITC mean that over 270,000 \nMaryland taxpayers will pay more while those at the top pay less. These \ncuts in the EITC mean that by 2002, people of my State will pay an \naverage of $345 more in taxes. It means that 120,000 Maryland families \nwith two kids will have their tax bill go up by $474 a year.\n  Lets talk about what this tax increase means to real people. For \nRhonda Clark, a 26-year-old mother from Baltimore, it means that even \nthough she has worked hard to get off welfare and to raise her two \nyoung kids, even though she has played by the rules, life is about to \nget harder. For Rhonda, this tax increase means she will have less \nmoney to pay for child care for her two young kids. Inflation will go \nup, but Rhonda's tax credit will be reduced in 1996 by $367.\n  The EITC has a long history of bi-partisan support. But that is about \nto change too. This tax credit has been endorsed and expanded by \nPresidents and Congresses of both parties. President Ronald Reagan \ncalled it, ``The best antipoverty, the best profamily, the best job \ncreation measure to come out of Congress.'' This credit rewards work. \nIt is a bonus for the good guys because it is based on hard work. We \nshould be praising it today. Not attacking it. Not cutting off workers, \ncutting off families, and cutting off hope.\n  Let us reflect in our public policy what we have stated as our \nvalues. Let us keep faith with working families by supporting the \nearned income tax credit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the earned income tax credit is a \nvaluable tax credit for our working families. As enacted by the \nCongress in 1993, the EITC would provide a tax credit for over 21 \nmillion workers and their families this coming year. Working families \nwith earnings of up to $28,500 per year would be eligible. These are \nfamilies who play by the rules and work hard each day to get by. These \nare the same families who are disproportionately affected by the \nRepublican cuts in domestic spending.\n  The earned income tax credit is the result of a bipartisan effort to \ncreate a disincentive to people from remaining on public assistance \nrather than working at lower wage jobs, and was hopefully a major \naspect of welfare reform. President Reagan called it the ``best \n\n[[Page S15710]]\n\nantipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come \nout of Congress.'' Reagan proposed a significant expansion of the \ncredit in the 1986 tax reform bill.\n  The House of Representatives has proposed a $23 billion tax increase \non these same families by repealing the 1993 earned income tax credit \nexpansion for families with two or more children, and by denying the \nEITC to families without children. Fourteen million EITC recipients--\nnearly half of the EITC recipients with children--would be adversely \naffected. Families with two or more children would be hardest hit.\n  The proposal before the Senate makes even more severe cuts. The \nproposal would increase taxes on 17 million households to raise $42 \nbillion. A report by the Treasury Department shows that under the \nSenate proposal, 21 percent of families currently eligible for the EITC \nwould lose their eligibility by the year 2005.\n  On a national level, the proposal will mean an immediate $300 average \ntax increase. For the 7.4 million families with two or more children, a \n$410 tax increase will occur. And the average tax increase will \ncontinue to go up over time, reaching $644 by the year 2005. These \nfamilies include 18.5 million children.\n  In Massachusetts, 194,000 working families would face an average tax \nincrease of $321 in the year 2002. For families with two or more \nchildren, the increase would reach $440.\n  Two-thirds of the proposed tax increase in the EITC would be achieved \nby repealing the final phase of the 1993 expansion for families with \ntwo or more children--an expansion promoted by President Reagan in 1986 \nand President Bush in 1990.\n  Also included in the Republican bill is a proposal to tax social \nsecurity payments received by approximately one million widowed, \nretired, and disabled taxpayers who care for about 2 million of their \nown children, grandchildren, or other children. These social security \nrecipients would face an average increase of $850.\n  The 1993 expansion was designed to keep a family of four with a \nparent working at the minimum wage above the poverty level, assuming \nthe family also received food stamps. And we still haven't been able to \nachieve that.\n  The standard of living of working families has continued to \ndeteriorate since 1979. In 1996, the real value of the minimum wage \nwill decline to its lowest level in 40 years. Without an increase in \nthe minimum wage, the EITC must do the job of raising the after tax \nincomes of working families.\n  We have heard too much rhetoric about the level of fraud and abuse. \nThe facts do not bear out these accusations. Any fraud and abuse that \nhad taken place has been largely eliminated through steps taken by the \nIRS to reduce erroneous claims. There is no more fraud and abuse with \nthis credit than there is in capital gains claims of the rich.\n  Other improvements to the credit have been made consistently over the \npast several years. Most recently, it was altered to deny eligibility \nto those with $2,500 or more of taxable interest and dividends.\n  There has also been too much rhetoric about the fact that the rate of \ngrowth of the EITC is out of control. That is not the case. With the \n1996 expansion, the CBO projects that the EITC will grow at less than \n4.5 percent per year. This growth is due largely to inflation. As a \npercentage of gross domestic product, the cost of the EITC will decline \nafter 1997.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  It restores $43 billion in cuts over the next 7 years in the earned \nincome tax credit in the Senate Republican reconciliation bill.\n  At a time when many working Americans are struggling to make ends \nmeet, the Senate Republican budget would hike Federal taxes on low- and \nmoderate-income working families. It would also raise some State taxes \non these same working families.\n  This is a double whammy on working families.\n  This Federal tax increase will also raise taxes in seven States that \nhave a State earned income tax credit tied to the Federal credit, \nincluding my home State of Vermont.\n  This bill will raise both State and Federal taxes on 27,000 Vermont \nworking families earning less than $28,500 a year.\n  As a result of this double tax jeopardy, working Vermonters will lose \n$64 million in Federal earned income tax credit benefits and an \nadditional $16 million in State earned income tax credit benefits over \nthe next 7 years.\n  On average, about 63 percent of Vermont taxpayers would see their \ntaxes rise under this bill because of these earned income tax credit \ncuts.\n  Under the Senate bill, a Vermont family of four earning $15,610 a \nyear, the 1995 poverty line, would lose $4,500 of earned income tax \ncredit benefits over the next 7 years--$3,600 cut in the Federal earned \nincome tax credit and $900 cut in the State earned income tax credit.\n  A Vermont family of four making $22,000 a year would fare even \nworse--suffering a loss of $1,208 in State earned income tax credit and \na loss of $4,831 in Federal earned income tax credit over the next 7 \nyears.\n  It is very doubtful that the Vermont General Assembly can afford to \nincrease the State earned income tax credit to make up this loss, with \neven more Federal cuts on the way.\n  Workers are treading water or worse against the rising tide of \ninflation and low wages. Now is not the time to cut a tax credit that \nwill raise Federal and State taxes on low- and moderate-income \nfamilies.\n  Instead, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to restore \nthe earned income tax credit.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the Senate debates S. 1357, the fiscal \nyear 1996 budget reconciliation bill, I am concerned that the tax \nchanges and spending priorities put forward seek to balance the budget \non the backs of senior citizens, working families, the working poor, \nand our Nation's children. The Republican proposal for a $270 billion \ncut in Medicare, a $182 billion reduction in Medicaid, and a $43 \nmillion tax hike for families earning under $30,000 a year to finance \n$245 billion in tax giveaways--over half to individuals earning over \n$100,000 annually--clearly outlines the number one priority of the \nRepublican plan: tax relief for a privileged few.\n  The details of the legislation stand in stark contrast to the \nintended goal of reducing the Federal budget deficit. The fears I \nexpressed during debate on the budget resolution have been confirmed; \nthe brunt of deficit reduction in this bill comes at the expense of our \nresponsibility to make work pay, the education and well-being of our \nyouth, the retirement security of our parents, and our commitment to \nlong-term investments in productivity, education, and job training. \nThis approach is shortsighted and threatens to reverse progress made in \ngenuine deficit reduction and tax fairness over the past years.\n  The tax increases contained in the reconciliation bill hit hardest on \nworking American families. In particular, the $43 billion reduction in \nthe earned income tax credit [EITC] will raise taxes for 17 million \nworking Americans and their families. The most effective way to improve \nthe economic well-being of the middle class and working poor is to \npromote policies that reward work and lessen dependency. Resources \nshould be focused on economic policies and public investments that \nenhance productivity, create well-paying, skilled private sector jobs, \nand restore economic mobility and prosperity to working Americans.\n  Yet the Republican plan cuts the earned income tax credit by $43 \nbillion over 7 years; reversing longstanding bipartisan support for \npolicies that make work pay. The earned income tax credit helps low-\nand-middle-income working families who have seen their wages decline \nsince the 1980s and serves as a safety net for middle-class families \nconfronted with a sudden loss of income. The EITC helps these families \nthrough economic difficulties and encourages policies that make work \npay.\n  Mr. President, despite the tremendous number of new jobs created last \nyear and the 2-year decline in the national unemployment rate, the \nearnings of many Americans have remained stagnant. In fact, over the \nlast decade most working families have seen their standard of living \nerode. People are working harder and longer to make ends meet. The \nnumber of working \n\n[[Page S15711]]\n\npoor families and individuals living at or below the poverty line \ncontinues to grow.\n  The 1993 expansion of the EITC was designed to lift a family of four, \nin which a parent works full-time, year-round at the minimum wage, to \nthe poverty line. This $43 billion tax increase on millions of working \nfamilies--many just above the poverty line who are struggling to work, \nraise their families, and avoid welfare, will destroy an important \nincentive that encourages work and self-sufficiency. The proposed cut \nin the EITC would increase Federal income taxes on millions of low-\nincome working families with children. The Treasury Department \nestimates that 17 million low-income American taxpayers will see an \nimmediate tax increase averaging $281 per year under the Republican \nproposal. When fully implemented, the Republican proposal would boost \nthe average tax bill for working taxpayers by $457 per year.\n  In 1996, working families with more than one child will see their \nEITC reduced by $270. A working family with two children earning \n$20,000 or less would see a $372 tax hike. Working poor families with \none child and taxpayers without children also will see a tax increase \nunder the GOP plan. The elderly, disabled, and retired who receive \nSocial Security and have an average income under $10,000 will see their \ntaxes climb by an average of $859 under the Republican plan. Over 1 \nmillion low-income working families--and over 2 million children--would \nsuffer as a direct result of this proposal.\n  Working families with children that have low and moderate incomes \nface three strikes under this bill. The reduction in the earned income \ntax credit, cuts in Medicaid, and ineligibility for the $500 per child \ntax credit will hit millions of working families and millions of \nchildren hard. Over 30 million children, 44 percent of our Nation's \nyoung people, would receive no benefit or only partial credit and not \nthe full $500 proposed.\n  Mr. President, what message are we sending to working men and women? \nBy raising income taxes on millions of Americans struggling to make \nends meet and committed to work over welfare and making tax breaks \nparamount, the Republican reconciliation plan establishes disincentives \nto hard work and threatens the economic security of millions of \nAmerican families.\n  I urge the defeat of S. 1357.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. It is always a pleasure to be \nworking with my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bradley. It is \nunfortunate, though, today, that what we are trying to do is to fix the \nRepublican budget and attempt to restore the earned income tax credit.\n  Mr. President, this Republican budget will cut $43 billion from the \nearned income tax credit, and in so doing, this budget will be raising \ntaxes on those earning less than $30,000 a year.\n  I have to tell you, this is totally incomprehensible to me that while \nthe Republicans are touting this budget and all the glory of its tax \ncuts, they are raising taxes on hard-working American families.\n  Where is the logic in this? As one of my colleagues recently stated, \nthis is nothing more than reverse Robin Hood--taking from the poor in \norder to pay for tax breaks for the most wealthy in America.\n  The impact of this proposal is astounding. The numbers are \nstaggering. This budget will raise taxes on 17 million families across \nAmerica. In my home State, low-income working families with two \nchildren will see a $452 tax increase in 2002 and a $522 tax increase \nin 2005.\n  What kind of message does this proposal send to our hard-working \nfamilies? Does it provide security and hope? Or does it tell them they \nare on their own? Does it tell these families that are working to stay \nabove the poverty line that we no longer reward hard work and support \ntheir efforts?\n  Mr. President, the EITC has always received bipartisan support \nbecause it is a commonsense tax credit. It rewards work. It provides a \nreal incentive. It gives people the means to move from the welfare \nrolls to the work force.\n  As we all know, in 1986, Ronald Reagan praised the EITC. I remember \nhim saying, ``It is the best antipoverty, best profamily, best job \ncreation measure to come out of Congress.''\n  As in President Reagan's day, many of today's hard-working American \nfamilies are trying to make end's meet, send their kids to school and \nprovide some hope for the future. Average Americans are worried today \nabout their jobs. They are anxious about their cost of education. And \nthere is genuine concern out there about the costs of health care. It \nis astounding that the other side has chosen this time to reduce the \nEITC.\n  Mr. President, this tax increase is not a big deal to some of our \ncolleagues here in the Senate, but, believe me, these are real \nincreases to average Americans.\n  As I have said many times throughout this budget process--I will say \nit again now--this budget has no conscience nor provides any hope. It \nhurts the little guy, those who need help, those who are struggling to \nmake a living and provide for their children, and it rewards the rich.\n  Taking away this tax credit adds insult to injury. The EITC keeps \npeople off welfare. It offsets other forms of formal assistance. It \ngives American parents the security they need to enter the work force.\n  We cannot balance the budget on our working poor, our elderly and our \nchildren, and we cannot justify cutting taxes for the wealthy while \nincreasing taxes on the poor. We should put things back in perspective \nand help those who really need our help.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It \ntells working families we are in their corner. It says we are against \nincreasing their taxes and we are for insuring their financial \nsecurity.\n  I commend my colleague from New Jersey and urge all of our colleagues \nto support this sound, commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, in 1993, Congress decided to give a 3-\nyear tax cut to families earning under $30,000 a year. That is the \nearned income tax credit.\n  What the other side attempted to do is to say, ``Do not give these \nworking families earning under $30,000 a year the third year of their \ntax cut.'' That is essentially what this debate is about.\n  As I said last night, I would oppose their effort to raise taxes on \nfamilies earning under $30,000 a year if it was a free-standing \namendment; but in the context of this debate it is virtually \nunconscionable because of the estate tax provision in this bill. I have \nnot heard anyone on the other side defend this provision. If you have a \n$5 million estate you pay $1.7 million less in estate tax because of \nthe changes in this bill. I have not heard one person on the other side \nof the aisle stand up and credibly defend why we should give less than \none-tenth of 1 percent of the estates in this country a $1.7 million \ntax cut while we are raising taxes on families earning under $30,000 a \nyear. I have not heard that defense. Maybe it exists. I have not heard \nit.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico read a letter from the \nJoint Tax Committee, as if the letter clinched the case. And the letter \nof course says that 72 percent of the tax benefits in this bill go to \nfamilies earning under $75,000 a year. That is true. One does not \ndispute that. But that is not a refutation of the fact that taxes are \nincreased on families earning under $30,000 a year. It means that the \ntax cut for those with incomes between $30,000 and $75,000 is large \nenough to offset the tax increase for those earning under $30,000.\n  Then, finally, there was this nice phrase here in the letter from the \nJoint Tax Committee, ``Only 1.5 percent of all households will have an \nincome tax increase;'' an income tax increase.\n  Mr. President, people who earned under $30,000 a year last year paid \n$114 billion in Federal taxes. Guess how much of the $114 billion was \nincome tax? It was $12 billion. Mr. President $12 billion out of the \n$114 billion was income tax.\n  What other taxes do they pay? They are working people. They pay \nSocial Security taxes. For years we heard from the other side that the \ncruelest tax of all is the tax on working Americans, the Social \nSecurity tax. What they are doing is essentially raising the effect of \nthe Social Security tax on \n\n[[Page S15712]]\n\nthose working people, because the earned income tax credit offsets \nSocial Security taxes and income taxes and excise taxes paid by \nfamilies earning under $30,000 a year. And the Joint Tax Committee did \nnot refute that. The letter refers only to income taxes, not Social \nSecurity taxes.\n  So let us be clear here. Let us be clear. There has not been one \nrefutation of the fact that the earned income tax credit offsets Social \nSecurity taxes. And when you repeal it, you are essentially raising \nSocial Security taxes on families earning under $30,000 a year. Why do \nthis in the context of a bill where estates of $5 million get a $1.7 \nmillion tax cut? Tell me how is that good policy.\n  Then, of course, we are going to see a chart later, the famous growth \nchart, that will show that the earned income tax credit has increased \ndramatically in the last 3 years, how it is exploding since 1986. Every \ntime, Mr. President, every time we hear that argument about the earned \nincome tax credit exploding, remember, Mr. and Mrs. America, what they \nare saying is that working families are getting a bigger and bigger tax \ncut and they do not like it. Republicans want to reduce their tax cut. \nThey want to raise taxes on working families.\n  So when you see that chart going up, that is not a chart of the \ngrowth of the earned income tax credit. That is a chart of taxes going \ndown for working families in this country.\n  So when the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma puts that chart up--\nand I hope he puts that chart up at some point today--remember those \nbars that go higher and higher: Lower taxes on working families in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those moments that is so clearly \ndefining that it really is even reachable by my own rhetorical skills. \nYou do not have to be a great speaker when you have all the facts on \nyour side, when you have no refutation on the other side, and when the \nchoice is so clear--a $1.7 million tax cut for estates of $5 million? \nThat is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the estates in this country \nin any given year. So the contrast is clear: a tax cut of $1.7 million \nfor estates versus a tax increase on working families.\n  The other side says, ``We did not increase it on families. We only \nincreased it on single people earning under $30,000.'' Well it is true \nthat single people are clearly getting a tax increase. That is true. \nBut I can also give you plenty of examples of where you increased taxes \non working families. Anybody who is single under 30, yes, you get a big \ntax increase--a big tax increase. Not a small one, a big one. And for \nmany families, it is also true.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that I think bears a very a strong \nvote in support of our effort to protect this tax cut for working \nfamilies. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, who is on the floor now in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey is kind as \nalways.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am going to be on the floor again \ntoday because the Republican rhetoric is not matching the reality \nand the Republican rhetoric is that the children's tax credit will help \nfamilies.\n\n  In reality, too many families will be excluded from this credit \nbecause it is not refundable.\n  In fact, over 20 million children will not receive the full benefit. \nAnd these children are in families earning less than $30,000, families \nthat need tax relief the most to make ends meet on a tight family \nbudget.\n  To add insult to injury, not only do Republicans deny the credit to \nsuch hard working, low-wage families, Republicans are paying for it by \nimposing a tax increase on them with a $43 billion cut from the earned \nincome tax credit [EITC].\n  The Republican leadership continues to claim that their tax package \nhelps middle-class American families. And this sounds good, but I want \nto know how they define the middle class?\n  In my State of West Virginia, we believe that parents who go to work \nevery day, and struggle to raise their children are middle class, \nadmirable, and deserving of support and encouragement. Over 65 percent \nof our taxpayers are working hard but earn less-less than--$30,000. For \nsuch families they will lose, not gain under this bill.\n  West Virginians have a basic sense of fairness and common sense. They \nwill know that this package and its claim of middle class tax relief \nare false when they fill out their tax forms in April 1997.\n  Just 2 years ago, these working families were promised tax relief. \nNow Republicans are reneging on that deal and raising taxes on families \nearning less than $30,000. For families with two or more children, \ntheir taxes will go up an average $483. For families with one child, \ntaxes will go up an average of $410. This will hit over 77,000 families \nwith children in my State of West Virginia alone.\n  But such numbers can be numbing. Let us get beyond the rhetoric, and \nlook at real families.\n  A real family, like the Helmick family of New Milton, West Virginia, \nwill be worse off, not better. The Helmick family has 6 children, \nranging in age from 15 to 4. Mr. Helmick works full-time as a truck \ndriver for a local construction company, and Mrs. Helmick is a full-\ntime homemaker. In the past, they have used their EITC to buy baby \nfurniture and to buy a used truck so Mr. Helmick has reliable \ntransportation to get to work. Mr. Helmick will not get to claim the \nfull tax credit for his children, and he will lose EITC benefits under \nthe Republican plan.\n  This is a real working family that will be hurt, not helped.\n  And families like the Helmicks who can not claim the child credit and \nare hurt by the cuts in EITC, probably will not be claiming capital \ngains tax breaks either. For them, this package does little more than \nrenew their cynicism since it reneges on promises made just 2 years ago \nwhen we told families to play by rules, go to work instead of welfare \nand we will offset your payroll taxes so that you do not have to raise \nyour children in poverty.\n  I feel badly for 65 percent of families in West Virginia who will be \nhurt rather than helped by the Republican tax proposal.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 3 minutes and \n18 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I have one final point.\n  The purpose of the earned income credit was to offset income taxes \nthat working families pay--working people--and Social Security taxes \nthat working families pay, and excise taxes that working families pay. \nThat is the purpose of it.\n  The other side has said this proposal that they have offered does not \nincrease income taxes on 98 percent of the people.\n  What about Social Security taxes? What about excise taxes? Are they \nsaying those are not taxes? Are they not saying that a working family \nat the end of the month has less money in their pockets because they \npaid those taxes? A working family has less in their pockets after this \nproposal passes because of the Social Security taxes that they do not \nhave offset, and the excise taxes that they do not have offset. And if \nyou are a working single person, forget it. You are going to have a \nserious increase in taxes. Those are the facts. Those are the facts.\n  One repeat of a statistic: Of the $114 billion in Federal taxes paid \nby families and individuals earning under $30,000 a year, only $12 \nbillion of the $114 billion are income taxes. We offset all the others. \nThey offset only the $12 billion.\n  In the context of a tax bill, where an estate of $5 million gets a \ntax cut of $1.7 million, I really want to hear the other side defend \nthat estate tax provision.\n  I want to hear them make the argument about the family farm because I \nwill have an amendment later that will protect the family farm, and it \nwill cost $700 million as opposed to $3 billion over 5 years. Then we \nwill be able to see the difference between the two parties. Even on \nthat issue, one wants to protect the family farm, and the other, of \ncourse, wants to give a little bit more benefit to business \ncorporations, and not only the family farm. I can understand why that \nis good politics for some. It certainly is not good \n\n[[Page S15713]]\n\npolitics. And it is certainly not good policy in the context of a bill \nthat raises taxes on working families that deserve a tax cut, not a tax \nincrease.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 27 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could amplify a point made by the Senator from \nNew Jersey, it is not good politics either because people in the \ncountry--in case anybody has not noticed--yearn for a political process \nthat they can believe in, a political process where they think they are \nrepresented. This does not look like such a process. This looks like \nsomething good for big players, heavy hitters, those who have all of \nthe influence, with the vast majority of the people shut out. This is \nnot a regular person's standard with this kind of break.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, for the record, I would like to have the \nChair advise the Senate of the time remaining on both sides overall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours left for the Senator from \nNew Mexico, and there are 4 hours and 45 minutes remaining for the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. As I understand it, we have now used up \nall time and completed debate on the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. As I understand it, we are about then, per the \nprevious agreement, ready to take up an amendment that I understand is \nto be offered by the Senator from Florida who I believe is in or near \nthe Chamber with regard to Medicaid funding.\n  Is that the understanding that has been tentatively agreed to as far \nas the other side is concerned?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding that Senator Nickles reserved 10 \nminutes of time to speak on this topic. I am trying to ascertain \nwhether he intends to use it.\n  Mr. EXON. On the EITC issue.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Then we would go to the Medicaid amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We are trying to determine if that reserved 10 minutes \nwill be used or not.\n  Mr. EXON. Since Senator Nickles is not here, in order to conserve \ntime, could we temporarily set that aside and allow the Senator from \nFlorida to proceed with his presentation?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We would be happy to enter into a unanimous-consent \nagreement, and we wish to reserve the 10 minutes of time for Senator \nNickles for whatever time later that he might be available.\n  I move that we temporarily lay aside the EITC motion so that we might \nproceed to the next motion, I believe it is, while reserving 10 minutes \nof debate on our side for the EITC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what was \nthe request on the EITC?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I do not think it is a request, simply a confirmation of \nan agreement reached last night for 10 minutes reserved for Senator \nNickles to comment further on the motion that the Senator from New \nJersey has offered.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. There was a motion made last night? I do not think there \nwas a motion last night relating to any time allotted to the other \nside.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The motion I believe is the motion of the Senator from \nNew Jersey. I believe the agreement with regard to time on that motion \nis 10 minutes had been reserved.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Reserving my right to object, my understanding is \nSenator Nickles' amendment was on a second-degree amendment, and \nSenator Nickles chose to withdraw his second-degree amendment. I do not \nthink there was ever an agreement on time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I propose to have Senator Graham proceed. \nIf he chooses to take time off the bill, we will for Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I have no objection to time off the bill.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we can then proceed at this time in the \nusual fashion. I am pleased to yield 1 hour off the bill of time to be \ncontrolled by the Senator from Florida who wishes to address the \nmatter, and I hope the Chair will recognize the Senator from Florida at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, could I ask the ranking member a question? \nIs the 1 hour under the control of the Senator from Florida, or is it 1 \nhour equally divided?\n  Mr. EXON. Under the usual procedures, there is 1 hour under the \ncontrol of the minority. I have just yielded that 1 hour to the Senator \nfrom Florida, and, of course, there is also 1 hour for the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inform the Members of the \nSenate that, since this is a motion, it is 1 hour equally divided \nbetween the sides. That would be 1 hour equally divided between the \nproponents of the motion, Senator Graham, and 1 hour for the opponents \nunder the control of the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in light of the limitations under which we will debate \nthis matter, I will make a few opening comments, and then yield 5 \nminutes to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, one of the most significant but not adequately focused \nupon aspects of this debate is the impact which this reconciliation \nwill have on the most important Federal-State partnership in existence, \nwhich is the Medicaid program. This program represents for most \nStates----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inquire: Has the Senator sent \nthe motion to the desk?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have not but I shall in a moment.\n  This represents for most States 40 percent, or more, of all of their \nFederal grant in aid programs for highways, education, and law \nenforcement. Forty percent of all of the funds which come from the \nFederal Government to assist States in providing services to their \npeople come through this one program of Medicaid.\n  It is the safety net under our entire health care system. While it \nrepresents well under 10 percent of health care spending in terms of \nthe Federal commitment to Medicaid, it represents the safety net for \nvirtually 100 percent of our health care system.\n  Yesterday, I heard some speakers talk about the fact that we are \ninvolved in this reform not just because we need to balance the Federal \nbudget, which many of us, including this Senator, strongly support and \nhave voted consistently for measures that will move toward the balanced \nbudget and are very pleased at the report yesterday that for the third \nconsecutive year we have reduced the degree of the Federal deficit, but \nbeyond that goal of balancing the Federal budget, we need to rid \nourselves of failures, of programs that were not functioning, that in \nsome cases were even counterproductive.\n  Mr. President, while I will suggest some areas in which I believe the \nMedicaid Program can be improved, I will state emphatically this \nprogram is by no definition a failure. In one very dramatic area, \ninfant mortality, this program has contributed substantially to a \ndramatic reduction in infant mortality in virtually every State. It has \nresulted in more babies being born at term, at full birthweight, fully \nable to begin the developmental process, and then it has helped poor \nmothers to be able to continue the health care for those babies after \nthey were birthed.\n  This program is a program which has had flexibility to respond to \nchanging circumstances which range in every degree from changes in \npopulation to changes in economic circumstances to natural disasters \nthat impose unanticipated burdens upon a particular State.\n  I will talk later about my concern of the proposals in this \nreconciliation bill for the severe cuts in the Medicaid program, cuts \nwhich will reduce the annual average increase to 1.4 percent in \ncomparison to the private sector's estimate that over this 7 years, \nprivate sector health care will increase at 7.1 percent per American \ncitizen over each of the next 7 years; that that kind of disparity \nrepresents not a fine tuning of the Medicaid Program but, frankly, a \ncollapse of the Medicaid Program and its ability to serve as the safety \nnet. And finally, that the allocation of funds among the 50 States in \nthe rigid block grant formula is inequitable, perpetuating inequities \nin distribution \n\n[[Page S15714]]\n\nwhich exist in the current law as well as rendering the program unable \nto respond to changes in circumstances among our 50 States.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, with those introductory comments, I send \nto the desk a motion to commit with instructions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] moves to commit the \n     bill S. 1357 to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions: to report the bill back to the Senate within \n     3 days (not to include any day the Senate is not in \n     session) making changes in legislation within that \n     Committee's jurisdiction to eliminate reductions in the \n     Medicaid program over the seven year period beyond \n     $62,000,000,000 and reduce revenue reductions for upper-\n     income taxpayers by the amount necessary to ensure deficit \n     neutrality. In addition, the Committee is instructed to \n     achieve the Medicaid savings through implementation of a \n     Medicaid per capita cap with continued coverage \n     protections and quality assurance provisions for low-\n     income children, pregnant women, disabled, and elderly \n     Americans instead of through implementation of a Medicaid \n     block grant.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Florida. \nI rise to support this motion and ask unanimous consent to be included \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Florida, I \ndo not have much confidence about this 2,000 pages plus and what it is \ngoing to mean for people in my State of Minnesota that I represent.\n  The other day in the Chamber of the Senate I had an amendment. I did \nnot mean for it to be symbolic. I thought there would be 100 votes for \nit. My amendment said that if by virtue of action we take in this \nreconciliation bill there are fewer children with medical coverage, \nalso more children that are hungry, then we will revisit what we have \ndone over the next year and we will take action to correct this damage. \nI could not get votes for that. I received 45 votes.\n  I come from a State with 425,000 Medicaid--we say medical \nassistance--beneficiaries, projected to be, I say to my colleague from \nFlorida, 535,000 by the year 2002. My State of Minnesota does not have \nthe slightest idea what in the world we are going to do in response to \nanywhere from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion--we do not even know yet--of \ncuts in medical assistance. And I can tell you right now, in all due \nrespect to my wonderful colleagues, in my not so humble opinion, I come \nfrom the greatest State in the United States of America. We have done \nsome wonderful things. We are a compassionate State, and we will not \nwalk away from the most vulnerable citizens.\n  So this a shell game for Minnesota, and for all too many of our \nStates it is a shell game.\n  Mr. President, 300,000 children are medical assistance beneficiaries \nin my State of Minnesota, many of them in working families. We will not \nwalk away from those children. So the counties are going to have to \npick up the cost. It will be the property tax, Minnesotans.\n  In my State of Minnesota, we have done some wonderful things to make \nsure that people in the developmental disabilities community can keep \ntheir children at home, do not have to become indigent and poor to get \nassistance; that people with developmental disabilities may live lives \nwith dignity. But I will tell you what is going to happen. With \ndraconian cuts in medical assistance, my State will not walk away from \nthis community. It all gets put back on the State, all gets put back on \nthe counties. This is nothing but a shell game.\n  In my State of Minnesota, 60 percent--60 percent--of our medical \nassistance payments go to our nursing homes. I have been to a lot of \nthose nursing homes, and a lot of the people who are the care givers \nask the following question: Senator, what are we going to do with these \nreductions? We cannot live with these reductions and live up to \nstandards. Are we going to let staff go? Are we going to redefine \neligibility? Are there going to be fewer benefits?\n  This is not just the elderly. These are the children and the \ngrandchildren as well.\n  This amendment really cuts right to the heart and soul of what we are \nabout here. I was in a debate earlier. We have an estate relief tax \nbreak. For those Minnesotans who have $5 million in an estate, they are \ngoing get a tax break, I say to my colleague from North Dakota, of $1.7 \nmillion. Those are the kinds of giveaways we have. But at the same time \nwe have draconian cuts in medical assistance for people with \ndisabilities, for children and for elderly citizens. And in many ways, \nI say to my colleague from Florida, I think these reductions are \nperhaps the most problematical for the States we represent, the most \nproblematical, the most awful, the most god-awful for the counties and \nlocal communities that we represent, because in my State of Minnesota \nwe are not going to walk away from the citizens. Somebody is going to \nhave to pay the bill. We are going to have to do it out of the local \nproperty tax, and that is going to be the most difficult way of all.\n  This makes no sense at all. This is, as I have said 1,000 times in \nthe Chamber of the Senate, a rush to recklessness. This is a fast track \nto foolishness, and I wish my colleagues would look at their language \nand look at their statistics and look at their charts and read their \nsentences and understand what the consequences are going to be for the \nlives of the people we represent.\n  Let us have deficit reduction, but let us go after some other folks \nthat can tighten their belts. Let us look at the subsidies to the oil \ncompanies, coal companies, pharmaceutical companies, insurance \ncompanies, estate breaks, and all the rest.\n  Let us not cut medical assistance to the point where we are denying \nquality health care for the people we represent. This is an extremely \nimportant motion. It is about fairness. It is about economic justice. \nAnd I say to my colleagues, it is also about good health care policy. \nThe numbers should drive the policy. We need to have deficit reduction, \nbut we cannot be reckless with the lives of the people we are here to \nrepresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of the Democratic leadership amendment, the \nGraham motion. My Republican colleagues constantly remind us of how \nimportant family values are. And I think family values are fantastic, \nespecially the one that says, ``Honor thy father and thy mother.'' I \nthink it is not only a good commandment to live by, I think it is a \ngood public policy to implement.\n  I believe when we say, ``Honor thy father and thy mother,'' we should \nhave this in our Medicare Program and in our Medicaid Program. A \nsubstantial part of the Medicaid Program goes to services to the \nelderly who are in nursing homes. We have watched this program grow. \nAnd it is an important safety net to the American middle-class \nfamilies. We must preserve Medicaid to be a safety net for the people \nwho have no other resources for long-term care and also for those who \nare disabled, disabled Americans who rely on Medicaid because they \ncannot get private health insurance.\n  My dear father died of Alzheimer's. I could not reverse the tide of \nhim dying one brain cell at a time, but I vowed I would devote my life \nto fighting for a long-term care policy. That is what the Spousal \nImpoverishment Act was, a protection, and what we passed in 1988. I am \nglad that we do not repeal spousal impoverishment. And I hope it does \nnot erode.\n  I regret that we are now going to cancel out the protections of \nnursing home grants that looked out for people who were in nursing \nhomes, who were too sick to be able to protect themselves, the laws \nthat prevent restraints and the laws that prevent abuse, that mandates \nstandards, so that when people who have Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or \nother dementia diseases where we need long-term care, even though we \ncannot change the course of the disease, we can ensure that they are in \na \n\n[[Page S15715]]\n\nsafe, secure environment. We can be sure of a lot of things if we pass \nthe Graham motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is entirely appropriate that today we \nfocus on the other real aspect of the Medicare debate, and that is \nMedicaid. Medicare reduces the support for our seniors by 22 percent. \nThe Medicaid legislation reduces it by some 30 percent. Today I want to \ntalk for just a few moments about the children who are going to be \nadversely impacted by the current legislation that is before the \nSenate, unless the Graham amendment is passed.\n  Among the children--in 1993--9.5 million were uninsured. The best \nestimate is that, under current law, the number of uninsured children \nwill increase to 12.6 million in the year 2002. Under the Republican \nproposal, 4.4 million additional children will be uninsured in 2002 for \na total of 17 million. Even under current law, there will be an upward \nflow in the number of children who lack health insurance coverage, but \nthe Republican plan makes it even worse.\n  Just 2 years ago, on a bipartisan basis, under the leadership of \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Riegle, and others, the Finance Committee \npassed a program to provide comprehensive health services for children \nup to the age of 18 who were at or below 185 percent of poverty. We \nhave one intervening election and look what happens? We basically pull \nthe rug out from underneath the children of this country. Eighteen \nmillion of them now have coverage under Medicaid. Ninety percent of \nthose children are in families that are in the work force, either full \ntime or part time. These are hard-working men and women at the lower \nlevel of the economic ladder that absolutely depend on this program for \nthe range of health services that are provided under the Medicaid \nProgram. And effectively, under the Republican proposal that is before \nus today, we are saying, ``No longer will there be the guarantees of \nthe prescreening services, no longer will there be the range of \ndifferent health services for the children in this country.'' And why \nare we doing it? To provide tax breaks for the wealthiest companies and \ncorporations in this country and the wealthiest individuals in this \ncountry.\n  Not only are we pulling out the rug from underneath the children in \nthis country, but, again, we are pulling out the rug from underneath \nthe seniors by eliminating Federal standards in nursing homes. I was \nhere in 1987 during the time that Congress held some of the most \nshocking hearings that we have ever had in the U.S. Senate, when we \nfound out what was happening to our parents in nursing homes across \nthis country. We found that there were shocking conditions. And \nRepublicans and Democrats got together and passed minimal standards in \norder to make sure that our seniors were going to be able to live in \nnursing homes with some peace and dignity and quality care.\n  Under this Republican proposal, effectively, we are taking out those \nguarantees and taking out those standards and at the same time failing \nto provide the assurance for those seniors and those parents that there \nwill be decent, quality care in the nursing homes of this country.\n  Mr. President, this makes no sense for the same reasons that the cuts \nin Medicare make no sense. The Republicans are taking the funds out of \nthe protections for children and out of the protections for the seniors \nof this country, and using it for tax breaks for the wealthy \nindividuals and corporations of this country. And, Mr. President, in \norder to remedy that, we should embrace the Graham motion. That \namendment offers us the best opportunity to do so.\n  Medicaid is the companion program to Medicare, and the Republican \nassault on Medicaid is even more cruel and unfair than their assault on \nMedicare. The Republican plan would cut Medicaid by $187 billion over \nthe next 7 years.\n  The country is up in arms over Medicare cuts that would mean a 22-\npercent reduction a year by the end of the budget period. By the end of \nthat same period, Medicaid will be cut by a staggering 30 percent a \nyear.\n  In large measure, the Republican cuts in Medicaid will strike another \nblow at the same groups hurt by the Republican cuts in Medicare--senior \ncitizens and the disabled. Ten million elderly and disabled Americans \nare enrolled in Medicaid. Twenty-three percent of them--nearly one in \nevery four--will lose their coverage. Seventy percent of all Medicaid \nspending under the program is for these two groups--the elderly and \ndisabled--and much of it is for long-term nursing home care.\n  But there is also another group who will be especially injured by the \nRepublican cuts--America's children. Seventy percent of Medicare \nspending is on the aged and disabled--but 70 percent of the people rely \non Medicaid are children and their parents--a total of 18 million \nchildren and 8.1 million parents.\n  Every child deserves a healthy start in life. But under the \nRepublican program, millions of families who have adequate medical care \ntoday will be forced to go without such care tomorrow. One in every \nfive children in America depends on Medicaid. One in every three \nchildren born in this country depends on Medicaid to cover their \nprenatal care and the cost of delivery. These children are also \nguaranteed prenatal care, immunizations, regular check-ups, and \ndevelopmental screenings. And, they are guaranteed the physician care \nand hospital care they need.\n  The vast majority of Medicaid-covered children--90 percent--are in \nfamilies with working parents. Most of these parents work full time--40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks a year. But all their hard work does not buy \nthem health care for their children, because their employers don't \nprovide it and they can't afford it on their own. Even Medicaid fills \nonly part of the gaps. Over 9 million other children are uninsured, and \neach day the number rises. Soon, less than half of all children will be \ncovered by employer-based health insurance.\n  We tried to address this problem last year, but Republicans said no. \nNow, they are trying to undermine the only place where families without \nemployer-provided coverage can turn for health care.\n  The Republican cuts in Medicaid will add 4 to 6 million more children \nto the ranks of the uninsured. When they are done--one in four American \nchildren will have no insurance at all.\n  These cuts will drastically increase the number of uninsured \nchildren. They will eliminate all the standards of quality that protect \nchildren today. The guarantee of prenatal care is gone. The guarantee \nof physician care is gone. The guarantee of hospital care is gone.\n  Under the Republican plan, senior citizens and the disabled are on \nthe receiving end of a deadly one-two punch. Deep Medicare cuts, and \neven deeper cuts in Medicaid. Not only will one in four lose their \nMedicaid coverage, but they will be victimized by one of the cruellest \naspects of the cuts--the elimination of any Federal quality standards \nfor nursing homes.\n  Strong Federal quality standards for nursing homes were enacted by \nCongress with solid bipartisan support in 1987, after a series of \ninvestigations revealed appalling conditions in nursing homes \nthroughout the Nation and shocking abuse of senior citizens and the \ndisabled.\n  Elderly patients were often allowed to go uncleaned for days, lying \nin their own excrement. They were tied to wheelchairs and beds under \nconditions that would not be tolerated in any prison in America. \nDeliberate abuse and violence were used against helpless senior \ncitizens by callous or sadistic attendants. Painful, untreated, and \ncompletely avoidable bedsores were found widespread. Patients had been \nscalded to death in hot baths and showers, or sedated to the point of \nunconsciousness, or isolated from all aspects of normal life by fly-by-\nnight nursing home operators bent on profiteering from the misery of \ntheir patients.\n  These conditions, once revealed, shocked the conscience of the \nNation. The Federal standards enacted by Congress ended much of this \nunconscionable abuse and achieved substantial improvements in the \nquality of care for nursing home residents.\n\n[[Page S15716]]\n\n  Yet the Republican Medicaid cuts eliminate these Federal standards. \nIt does not modify them. This bill does not reform them. It eliminates \nthem. The House bill even repeals the nursing home ombudsman program \nthat provides an independent check on conditions in nursing homes.\n  In addition, the cuts in Medicaid are so deep that even conscientious \nnursing home operators who want to maintain high quality care will be \nhard-pressed to afford the staff and equipment necessary to provide it.\n  It is difficult to believe that anyone, no matter how extreme their \nideology, would take us back to the harsh nursing home conditions \nbefore 1987. But that is exactly what the Republican plan will do.\n  The Republican plan for Medicaid is an outrage. It says that society \ndoes not care about the most vulnerable groups in our country--senior \ncitizens, children and people with disabilities.\n  In a very real way, Medicare and Medicaid is a lifeline for tens of \nmillions of Americans who have nowhere else to turn. Without access to \nMedicare and Medicaid, many healthy children and many senior citizens \nwill become sick and many will die. This bill can fairly be called The \nSick Child and Dead Senior Citizen Act of 1995.\n  It is wrong, deeply wrong, to put millions of our citizens at much \ngreater risk of illness and death in order to pay for tax breaks and \nspecial favors for the wealthy and powerful. Greed is not a family \nvalue. Republicans in Congress who intend to vote for these harsh and \nextreme cuts should think again before they wash their hands of their \nresponsibility for the consequences of their votes.\n  These Republican proposals are too harsh and too extreme. They are \nnot what the American people voted for last November. They should be \nrejected out of hand by Congress.\n  I withhold the balance of my time and yield it to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I would yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I think it is important to put the reforms that are proposed by the \nmajority into context here and to try and speak about those reforms in \nrational language, instead of the panic and paranoia that has been \nexpressed regarding those reforms.\n  It has been represented on the floor of the Senate today that the \nblock grant program for Medicaid as proposed would be a collapse of the \nMedicaid system. I think that is an overstatement by a substantial \namount.\n  Let me just address the issue of what kind of collapse could happen \nin the event we were to have the block grant program. We began in the \nState of Missouri, my home State, in which I had the privilege of \nserving as attorney general for 8 years and Governor for 8 years, a \ntotal of 16 years. During that timeframe we began to use managed care \nunder a special waiver from the Federal Government to deal with the \nneeds of those who needed assistance in regard to their medical needs.\n  And as a result of our experience with that, we have come up with \nsome idea of how much we could do if we were given a block grant \ncompared to what we were able to do under the Federal system of \nbureaucratic intermeddling and a one-size-fits-all Washingtonian \nMedicaid Program.\n  Now, it should be noted after I left the Governor's office almost 3 \nyears ago now, my successor, who is a Democrat, maintained largely the \nsame set of professionals to run the program, so that the individuals \nwho will talk about the program from that experience are not partisan \nindividuals. Earlier this year, the director of the program in the \nState of Missouri indicated if they had a block grant, they could \nincrease the number of individuals covered from 600,000 under the \nFederal plan, to 900,000 if they had the flexibility of doing with the \nfunds what a State could do under the flexibility of a block grant.\n  Now, I do not call the extension of medical services to an additional \n50 percent a collapse of the system. I call this an empowerment of \nState and local governments to be able to do something that they may or \nmay not deem necessary. It gives them the flexibility to meet the needs \nof the indigent rather than to define this in terms of a collapse.\n  I was interested with the statement, particularly because it was now \na statement from an individual in a Democratic administration of a \nMidwestern State. And after it appeared in the newspapers around my \nState last January, I inquired of the individual who came to my office \nto talk about these proposals in the summer. And I asked him point \nblank, ``Is this the fact that you could increase the coverage from \n600,000 people to 900,000 people if you were absent the redtape, if you \nhad the same amount of money on a block grant?'' His direct testimony \nwas ``yes.''\n  Now, that is not a collapse of the system. Now, it may be politically \nexpedient to talk about scare tactics and to talk about collapses, but \nthe truth of the matter is, we are not going to provide the basis for a \ncollapse. We are going to provide the basis for meeting needs, and \nmeeting them effectively. And just a few moments after we had the \ncollapse theory expressed on the floor here today, we had the we would \nnot have the slightest idea of what to do theory expressed on the floor \ntoday.\n  I cannot believe that a State as profoundly well disposed as \nMinnesota would not have the slightest idea in terms of how to meet the \nneeds of their citizens. It is stunning to me. As a matter of fact, \nthey could look to the State of Missouri, or a number of other States, \nto find out.\n  Let me just tell you some of the Missouri experience. As a matter of \nfact, even if we do not have this major reform, Missouri is going to \ntry and continue to expand its ability to serve through managed care. \nNext year, Missouri would have half of all of its recipients on managed \ncare.\n  What does the system look like? What does the system look like if \nStates have the right to design the system, because they have been \ngiven a partial right in my home State? Here is what it looks like in \nSt. Louis.\n  Last year, they decided to offer to Medicaid individuals the option \nfor managed care. They asked companies that can provide that managed \ncare to provide proposals. There were eight or nine companies that \ncompeted to provide proposals. Seven of them were authorized as a menu \nso that the people who have needs could get those needs met in a \nmanaged care system.\n  People choose the HMO. People choose the provider system that they \nwant. Nine out of every ten recipients of the program make a choice. \nThe other 10 percent have to be assigned by the State. They do not have \nenough interest in their medical care to even make their own choice, \nbut they are assigned.\n  What is interesting to me is this: That at the end of every year, \nincluding our pilot program in Kansas City and St. Louis, individuals \nhave a right to switch from one system to another.\n  If this were a draconian system, if this were an abusive system, if \nthis were a system where there was lots of dissatisfaction, you would \nexpect to see a lot of people switching at the end of every year. You \nwould expect to see people trying to find a better way, looking for a \ndifferent company, finding a different provider. You would expect to \nsee a tremendous outpouring of rejection of the system of managed care \nthat the block grant would really endow every State with the capacity \nto implement.\n  Do you know what? Do you know what the rate of changing providers is \nevery year at the end of the year in the State of Missouri? The rate is \n1 percent. There is a 1-percent dissatisfaction rate, individuals--\nwell, they may not be dissatisfied, they may just try something else or \nthey may move to a different part of the city so a different provider \nwould be more convenient for them.\n  A 1-percent--1 percent--change rate does not indicate a system which \nis in collapse. It does not indicate a system which is in chaos. You do \nnot have a 1-percent change rate if your system is one where they do \nnot have the slightest idea about how to meet the needs. When you have \na 1-percent change rate, you are really doing well.\n  I cannot imagine a federally operated system where 99 percent of the \npeople \n\n[[Page S15717]]\n\nwere lauding the system and endorsing it by their sticking with the \nprogram, in spite of the fact they had six or eight other options from \nwhich to choose.\n  It has been said this is a shell game. Well, Mr. President, I say to \nmy colleagues, it is a shell game all right to propose that this is \nchaos or this is collapse. We are not talking about reducing our \ncommitment to individuals who are medically needy. We are talking about \nour ability to provide for ways of meeting their needs more \nsubstantially. If in Missouri we could expand from 600,000 to 900,000, \njust with ripping out the red tape, it is a shell game to say that we \nwant to keep the old system.\n  Forty percent growth over the next 7 years in the resources--and if \nyou could have a 50-percent increase in the number of recipients with \nthe current amount of funds and you provide a 40-percent growth, this \nis empowerment, this is not shell, this is not collapse, this is not \nchaos, this is compassion, and I mean that seriously.\n  I just want to say that when we hear these arguments indicating that, \n``Oh, we're not going to be doing enough; there are children that are \ngoing to''--we have a system which is in collapse. We have a system \nwhich is in chaos. It says if to endow States with the capacity to \ncorrect the errors is going to promote collapse or chaos, we have \ncollapse and chaos. That is what has happened in the welfare system of \nthe United States. It not only collapsed financially, it has collapsed \nin terms of its humanity, and it is wasting resources. It is supporting \nin my State 600,000 people when the same resource could be supporting \n900,000 people for medical care.\n  I might add that in the State of Missouri, this is not a State where \nwe have to spend a whole lot of money to get the 99-percent \nsatisfaction rate. Missouri is far below the national average when it \ncomes to the kind of resources that are required to meet the needs of \nthe medically needy.\n  So let us just try to set the record straight for a moment. Giving \nStates the right and the opportunity to have cost reduction does not \nmean they are going to reduce the services. It may mean we are going to \nimprove. It has in the State of Missouri, and I think it can in every \nother State.\n  Asking States to exercise their ingenuity in their capacity to rescue \na failed system from the Federal Government does not mean we do not \nhave the slightest idea about how we can meet the needs of individuals. \nI think that is an overstatement, even for Minnesota. I believe they \nwill have a good idea, and I believe they can make it work.\n  This is an opportunity we have to change a failed system and to move \nfrom a failed system to a system that can succeed. It is not a \ntightfisted opportunity. It is not an opportunity that does not \nrecognize that there will be additional needs. It is a system which \nprovides for reasonable growth, but not unbridled expansion.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida, and I certainly support his motion to commit.\n  Mr. President, what happens to parents who are struggling to try to \nbalance the raising of children and, at the same time, caring for aging \nparents under the Republican proposal? If a working family gets a new \nchild tax credit but loses Medicaid nursing home coverage for an aging \nparent, what is the overall effect on that family? The child tax credit \nis $500 for some families. Not in West Virginia where two-thirds of our \nfamilies would not get it.\n  Let us say for some families it is $500 a year, but the loss of \nMedicaid nursing home coverage in West Virginia would cost from $25,000 \nto $35,000 per family, because that is what a nursing home costs if you \nhave to pay it yourself.\n  An example, Julie Sayers of Charleston, WV, cares for her mother who, \nas the Senator from Maryland was talking about, suffers from \nAlzheimer's disease, and she cared for her as long as she could at \nhome, as children want to do, but when it came to the point that she \ncould not care any longer, she had to take her mother to a nursing \nhome.\n  Julie in this case gets a partial child tax credit, much less than \n$500 under the Republican package, but she cannot get Medicaid coverage \nfor her mother in the nursing home. So what good is it, the child tax \ncredit? What damage does the Medicaid cut do--$182 billion, $187 \nbillion for a tax break for the wealthy.\n  Julie and her family are going to be a lot worse off under the \nRepublican proposal, not better off, but worse off, and this is a real \nperson caring for a real mother with Alzheimer's in West Virginia \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I understand Medicaid needs reform, and Senator Graham \nrecognizes that there are responsible ways to reduce the rate of growth \nin Medicaid spending, but we really should not get down to the business \nof throwing seniors out of nursing homes. We really should not do that. \nThat, in my judgment, is what the Republican amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 20 minutes. The \nSenator from Florida has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  At this time, I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Frist.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment and \nin support of the underlying bill before us. I wish to take a few \nminutes to outline where we are going with Medicaid today. I have had \nthe opportunity to spend some time in the private sector on Medicaid, \nand we have huge challenges there--challenges before me as a physician, \nbefore hospitals, before the beneficiaries and groups of people that, \nall too often, could fall through a safety net, and, in fact, today are \nfalling through safety nets. Why? Because of excessive and burdensome \nregulations we put on the States that prevent the States from carrying \nout their mandate to provide that safety net through this joint Federal \nand State program called Medicaid.\n  The program is not working today. In fact, as most people know, only \nabout half of the people under the poverty level are served by Medicaid \ntoday. It was Gov. Bill Clinton speaking before the House Operations \nCommittee, in December of 1990, who said it, laid it out, clearly--as \nclearly as any of us could today. He said, ``Medicaid used to be a \nprogram with a lot of options and few mandates. Now it is just the \nopposite.''\n  The problem is that a well-intentioned program--once again, now 30 \nyears old--has layered mandate upon mandate, regulation upon \nregulation, where we have tied the hands of our regulators, State \ngovernments, where they cannot carry out this important goal of serving \npeople who are in need, or who cannot provide for themselves otherwise. \nThe problem is crystal clear.\n  Again, it is one of these problems which has been laid out before us, \nwhich our Governors have told us about, which anybody who has \nparticipated in the system at a doctor-patient level, or at a level \nthis Congress could recognize or should recognize. This underlying \nRepublican plan will go a long way toward resolving that problem. The \nproblem is that Federal spending has doubled over the last 5 years. It \nhas doubled the amount of money that is put in from the Federal \nGovernment, without any observable improvement in services delivered.\n  The problem at the State level is that 20 percent, on average, of a \nState budget now goes to a Medicaid program, and that 20 percent is \ngrowing faster and faster and crowding out other State \nresponsibilities.\n  Third, and probably most important, is the excessive regulation we \nimpose by running this program and micromanaging this program out of \nWashington, DC, which results in waste, which some resources could be \ntranslated into very effective care for populations in need.\n\n[[Page S15718]]\n\n  Now, the Republican Medicaid plan basically does one thing. It says \nwe cannot micromanage the health care for the populations that have \nbeen defined out of Washington, DC. We have failed. We have not been \nable to control costs, and are only serving about 50 percent of the \npeople under the poverty level.\n  What we have said overall in this bill is that we are going to give \nthat responsibility to the States, to the people who are closer to \nhome, who can identify the individual needs, strip away the thousands \nand thousands of regulations which tie the State's hands, and say you \naddress the problem in the way that you see fit. But there are certain \nramifications and certain general, broad areas that we say it is \nimportant to target.\n  In this bill we have said that 85 percent of current spending levels \nfor mandatory services are for three distinct populations: One, \nfamilies with pregnant women or children; two, individuals with \ndisabilities; and, three, the indigent seniors.\n  The transformation of Medicaid will be, again, very simple. If we \ncompare the old Medicaid to the new Medicaid program, in the past \nMedicaid has had an open-ended entitlement. Under the new Medicaid, we \nwill move toward this concept of block grants, allowing States to \ncontrol their dollars. Under the old Medicaid, we had Federal mandates \nwith micromanagement, coming out of the beltway, out of the bureaucracy \nhere in Washington. And under new Medicaid, we give States the \nflexibility to design the types of plans they think best identify the \nneeds and meet the needs of their citizens.\n  Under the old Medicaid, it is expenditure-driven, increasing at a \nrate of about 17 percent a year, again and again. Under the new \nMedicaid, it will be needs-driven. Under the old Medicaid, there have \nbeen unlimited growth rates.\n  In my State of Tennessee, Medicaid grew by 40 percent just 3 years \nago. There is no tax base that can keep up with 40-percent growth. \nUnder the new Medicaid, Medicaid will continue to grow--continue to \ngrow on a base year of 1995, in our particular plan, and grow at a rate \nof 7 percent next year, and then it will vary thereafter, according to \nformulas developed by the States.\n  Again, looking to my own State of Tennessee, what is one of the \nfundamental problems? On this chart is the Medicaid expenditure growth \nfrom 1986 out to 1993. You can see that, on average, as illustrated by \nthe red going across, the growth in Tennessee has been about 22 \npercent. And remember, this growth of 20 percent is competing in a \nState budget for other issues, whether it is infrastructure or \neducation; it is crowding out other State expenditures. In 1992, you \ncan see, in one State we had growth rates in Medicaid of 44 percent. It \nwas about 14 percent in fiscal year 1993.\n  Well, in Tennessee, we looked at three solutions: No. 1, raise taxes \nagain and again and again. That is what we have done a number of times \nover the last decade. The American people have said, ``We do not want \nto have our taxes raised again and again.''\n  Second, we can go through massive health care reductions. In \nTennessee, we said ``no.'' Or we can undergo fundamental change. \nTennessee is one of six States who got a waiver from HCFA in order to \ncarry out a plan. The plan has had mixed results. Let me show you what \nthe results have been overall. It was a program called TennCare.\n  Given the flexibility we want to give all 50 States--and only 6 have \nit today--there were 12 competing managed care organizations who, \nthrough a total demonstration project, assumed the care for about 1 \nmillion people in Tennessee. Primary care access has been improving \nover time under the program compared to the old Medicaid system. \nNonemergency use of emergency rooms has gone down over time. The number \nof in-patient hospital days has gone down over time. And the overall \nbudgetary expenditures have been met. In fact, growth there has been \nflat. But the exciting thing is that the quality of care has increased \nby overall objective standards and, not only that, the number of people \ncovered has been markedly increased.\n  In 1993, before this reform plan, if you took the overall population \nof Tennessee, coverage was 89 percent. By using those Federal dollars \nsent to the State more wisely, more effectively, with all of the \nGovernment regulations stripped away, we were able to improve our \noverall coverage for all people across Tennessee from 89 percent to 94 \npercent.\n  So when you hear that by giving States more flexibility we are, in \nsome way, decreasing access, you can look to Tennessee and say that we \nare one State that had regulations stripped away and were given that \nfreedom to carry out a program that they thought best identified and \ncovered the needs, and we were able to improve access across the State \nfrom 89 percent to 94 percent.\n  If we look at overall expenditures by allowing one State the \nflexibility to carry out their program, stripped away of the Federal \nregulations, we can see, when you compare Medicaid versus the new \nprogram called TennCare, which is in yellow here, the overall Medicaid \nprojections growing at 20 percent a year, which are in the color red. \nThe year is along the axis here. Starting from 1987, 1995 to 1998, we \ncan see we have had this progressive growth up to 1995. If we had done \nnothing in Tennessee, the growth would have continued at 20 percent a \nyear. But having an element of coordinated care, growth has been \nrestrained over time. This is translated into savings for the American \npeople, again, with good quality of care, and expanded coverage, in \nterms of the number of people covered.\n  So the final question is: Why can everybody not do what Tennessee \ndid? Well, Oregon might want a different type of system; Hawaii might \nwant another type of system; Missouri might want another system. Let us \nlet people closer to home decide that, but we have to strip away the \nregulations.\n  In addition, the other comment might be, well, why cannot people get \nwaivers like Tennessee did--and I participated in that process so I can \ntell you it is a huge burden to get the waiver.\n  In fact, on September 22, in a letter sent to the commissioner of the \ndepartment of finance and administration in Nashville, TN, there are \nanother 9 pages of terms and conditions for Tennessee to try to adhere \nunder. We would do away with those regulations under the Medicaid \nproposal.\n  For all these reasons, I support the underlying bill and speak \nagainst the proposed amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cleared it with the managers that I can \nhave 2 minutes off bill debate time and I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will speak to this issue for \n4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, today we learned on the news that America is finally \ngetting it. Mr. President, 57 percent of the people in the latest \nnational poll say that the Republicans are gutting Medicare to pay for \na tax cut for the rich.\n  It has taken awhile for the message to come through but people are \nwaking up to the truth. The Republicans are gutting Medicare. They are \ngutting Medicaid. They are raising taxes on those who earn less than \n$30,000 a year to help fund a tax break for the wealthiest Americans. \nThose who earn over $350,000 a year do just great.\n  By the way, if you are one of those lucky people to have a $5 million \nestate, pop open that champagne because unless we Democrats prevail you \nare going to get millions of dollars back.\n  Today, the Senator from Florida is giving all Members a chance to \nmodify this radical and extreme budget as it relates to Medicaid.\n  I have listened very carefully to Senator Frist, to Senator Ashcroft, \nand neither of them address the main issue addressed in this amendment, \nwhich is the devastating nature of these cuts, the very size of these \ncuts.\n  Let me put it into perspective. In America today, the Medicaid \nProgram costs $90 billion a year. The Republicans want to cut $187 \nbillion out of that. That is 2 years--more than 2 years of expenditures \nof the Medicaid program over a 7-year period. They are cutting 2 years \nof Medicaid out of 7 years.\n  I ask, as a person who works for a living, over a 7-year period, \ncould you afford to be unemployed for 2 years? \n\n[[Page S15719]]\n\n Could you afford to lose that much income and pull your family \ntogether? I think it is clear that the answer is no.\n  Do you know what the cuts mean to California? Mr. President, $18 \nbillion. Millions of children will not be served. Millions of working \npoor will not be served. Emergency rooms will close. Trauma centers \nwill close.\n  My friends say, oh, there is so much room to be more efficient. \nCalifornia is the most efficient in the Nation. How do we get more \nefficiency out of a system that is already the most efficient?\n  The answer is that people will be kicked off the program. Who are \nthese people who are on Medicaid? We should look at them. Who are these \npeople on Medicaid? They are the most disabled people among us, the \nmost disabled children among us--children with spina bifida, children \nwith cystic fibrosis. They are the working poor who cannot get \ninsurance. They are the down and out who maybe lost their job and need \nhelp.\n  By the way, they are the seniors. Two-thirds of the seniors in \nnursing homes are on Medicaid. I do not know if you have been to a \nnursing home lately, but buried in this bill is a provision to repeal \nnational standards for nursing homes.\n  We are not only cutting all of this, we are gutting the standards.\n  Now, I heard Senator Roth, the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, on the radio this morning saying, ``These Democrats, they do \nnot want change. They want the same old thing.''\n  I want to respond to that. We Democrats want change, but there is a \ndifference. We want good change. We want change that is good for \nAmerica.\n  President Clinton has a record of change--more jobs, less \nunemployment, AmeriCorps, lower deficit for the first time 3 years in a \nrow since Harry Truman. That is good change.\n  This is evil change. This is bad change. This is greedy change. \nSupport our friend from Florida.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Senator from California spoke as if \nthere were going to be decreases in the amount of funding.\n  I think it is important to just call to the attention of the American \npeople that when we refer to cuts here in Washington we are referring \nto cuts in the amount of increase. We are not going to take 2 years out \nof the funding of the next 7 years. We are going to reduce the level of \nincrease. We will still have a 40-percent increase in the amount of \nresource available.\n  It is important that we define the situation in terms that the \nAmerican people would normally use. In that respect, we have a 40-\npercent increase in funding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Your comment referred to my argument and I choose not \nto yield.\n  The second thing that the Senator from California said, how can you \nget a system more efficient? I think it is clear, we allow States to \ndevelop the efficiencies that provide for as much as a 50 percent \nincrease in the delivery of services.\n  The fact of the matter is, that is what has been shown in the pilot \nprojects in Missouri. Our director of Medicaid says that if he could \njust get rid of the Federal regs he could move from 600,000 people to \n900,000 people with the same amount of money. That is how you get more \nefficient--take the onerous one-size-fits-all Federal Government out of \nthe picture.\n  I yield 6 minutes of our remaining time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, would it not be interesting to be some \nkind of out-of-touch observer and walk out and listen to the last day \nor so, the conversation. It is not a debate. It is posturing \nconversation.\n  I just walked in and listened. It would be pretty hard to follow. It \nwould be pretty hard to try and establish from listening here what the \ngoals were and what the purpose was, particularly from our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  I think you have to conclude certainly we are not all coming from the \nsame base of facts. I think you have to conclude that in some cases \nthere is not even any clearly defined goals that are being pursued on \nthat side of the aisle.\n  I think you would have to conclude there is quite a different \nphilosophy--a philosophy of maintaining the status quo, of attacking \nthe proposals without any particular plan, to continue the growth of \nGovernment and the size of spending. That would have to be the goal \nthat you would assume from the conversation.\n  You would be confused when you hear constantly time after time this \nidea that you are reducing Medicare so that we can increase tax cuts.\n  The fact of the matter is that part A of Medicare is financed by \nwithholding from wages. It goes into a trust fund. You have two choices \nwhen it is growing at 10.5 percent. You can either do something about \nthe cost and reduce that rate of growth or you can add more to the \nwithholding.\n  I do not hear that proposition being done. Those are the choices. It \nhas nothing to do with taxes. It has nothing to do with balancing the \nbudget. If the balanced budget was not in the picture, you would be \ntalking about how do you take care of part A in Medicare. You do not \nhear that. That is a fact. That is a fact.\n  You can probably balance the budget it we stop using all the charts \nthat we have out here, for one thing.\n  We do have a plan. The Republicans do have a plan. The plan is to \nbalance the budget instead of more debt. A responsible thing we need to \ndo for our kids as we go into another century, we have a plan to have \nsome middle-class tax cuts instead of increasing--the largest increase \nwe ever had--like last year.\n  I hope we get on into this earned-income tax credit, this 50 percent \nof people's taxes going up. That is just not the case. You might be \nreducing some of the payments that have been going under earned-income \ntaxes--it is not increasing taxes. We know that.\n\n  We ought to be talking about Medicare solvency. That is what our \npurpose is. We ought to be talking about jobs and opportunity, instead \nof welfare dependency. That is what we are talking about here, making \nsome changes that have not been made for years. My friends start by \nsaying yes, we need changes, and then resist them. That has become the \npattern here.\n  Let me tell you just a little bit about Medicaid in Wyoming. \nRepublicans surely have taken a historic approach to it. In Wyoming, \nspending will rise on Medicaid from $110 million in 1996 to $168 \nmillion in the year 2002. That is not really a cut, is it? On an \nindividual basis, the average Federal grant for each person in poverty \nwill grow from $2,188 to $3,263, hardly a cut.\n  Certainly we need more flexibility. We have heard from some of the \nformer Governors. We heard, of course, from the Governors in the States \nwho say give us more flexibility and we can take these dollars and more \neffectively run the program. The Governors have asked for more \nflexibility. The Republican bill mandates benefits for low-income \npregnant women, children up to 12, elderly and disabled as defined by \nthe State--those are mandates that are there that, indeed, some of the \nGovernors are objecting to.\n  Medicaid, as the Senator from Tennessee indicated, has exploded in \nterms of its growth rate; an annual rate of 19.1 percent between 1989 \nand 1994. You cannot sustain that kind of growth. So you need to look \nfor ways to deliver the system, to deal with the core problems and that \nis helping to reduce the costs by giving more flexibility to States to \nshape their programs. The program in Wyoming for the delivery of \nMedicaid needs to be quite different than the program in West Virginia \nor Massachusetts, and we need the flexibility to do that.\n  So, Mr. President, we have talked about the benefits. States will \nmeet a minimum spending level of Medicaid. For low-income pregnant \nwomen, children up to 12, elderly and disabled as defined by the State, \nStates will be required to spend at least 85 percent of the amount they \nspend in 1995. They will be allowed to put together programs like AFDC \nand Food Stamps if they choose, to put together a package of benefits.\n  Regarding nursing home standards, the committee responded to the \nGovernors' requests by granting them authority to write standards under \nFederal guidelines. States must establish and maintain standards for \nquality care, which must be promulgated \n\n[[Page S15720]]\n\nthrough their State legislatures--people, I suppose, who have no caring \nfor the elderly. I do not believe that. Most of you have served in \nState legislatures. Do not tell me the States do not care. I cannot \nbelieve what I hear from time to time about that.\n  So, we do need to make changes if we want to continue to have a \nprogram that delivers services. That is what it is all about. I think \nwe ought to take a little look at the long-term goals and the breadth \nof the goals that are in this bill. They have to do with balancing the \nbudget. They have to do with job opportunities. They have to do with \ndealing with some of the problems which have brought us to where we \nare.\n  I really wish we could talk just a little bit more about the facts. \nFor instance, this tax business that we hear every time someone stands \nup. Tell me a little bit about part A of Medicare and how that gives a \ntax offset. I would like to know more about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 90 seconds to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks about the \neffects of the proposal to reduce projected Medicaid expenditures by \nover $186 billion over 7 years on those in Alabama--poor mothers and \nchildren, the disabled, and the elderly--who count on Medicaid for \ntheir medical and long-term care.\n  First, and most importantly, the Republicans proposal, if adopted, \nwould immediately place the Alabama Medicaid Program in a state of \nutter chaos. It would place a gun to the head of the Governor and State \nlegislature. They would be forced to make immediate, savage cuts--about \n21 percent--in the program. These cuts, over $386 million, would have \nto be imposed the current fiscal year, starting in the second quarter \nof the year.\n  Let me be very clear about this. These cuts would be imposed on the \nMedicaid budget that has been in effect since October 1, 1995. The only \nalternative available to these cuts would be an immediate major \nincrease in taxes on the people of Alabama. This would not happen given \nthe ``no new taxes'' pledge of our Republican Governor.\n  My second observation is that this sudden cut is only part of the \nalmost $3 billion hit the Republican bill would impose on Alabama. I \nknow the other side claims that Alabama and other States can easily \nhandle these cuts by achieving greater efficiencies in the program. \nWell, sure they can, and I can tell you how. They can cut poor people \noff the program by restricting eligibility. For those who remain, \naccess to care can be cut by simply reducing payments to providers, \ndoctors, hospitals, and nursing homes, below the costs of their \nservices. At that point, these services will no longer be available.\n  Finally, Mr. President, our Republican colleagues repeatedly assert \nthat all of these cuts are not real, they are simply reductions in the \nrate of increase. However, as we have finally had an opportunity to \nexamine the details of the bill, we find that in some important \ninstances this is simply not the case. For example, the Medicaid \nproposal cuts funds going to hospitals that care for a disproportionate \nshare of patients that do not have insurance or other means to pay for \ntheir care as reduced immediately by 56 percent. I repeat, this is a \nreal cut of $185 million. According to Dr. Claude Bennett, President of \nUAB, almost 30 percent of Alabamians are medically indigent and \nresponsibility for providing care to them falls largely upon their \nUniversity Hospital. Dr. Bennett is correctly concerned that it can \ncontinue to shoulder this burden which will surely increase in the face \nof these cuts.\n  Now, I know, Mr. President, that in the backrooms the majority is \ncontinuing to cut deals in an effort to fix up this disaster. States \nare pitted against States. If Alabama gets its situation improved, \nwhich it must, the poor in some other States will suffer. The bottom \nline is this--these Medicaid cuts are simply too much, too soon. Our \nState will not be able to cope without hurting people. We must rethink \nwhat we are doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15707-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15720-S15747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REAL FAMILIES VERSUS REPUBLICAN RHETORIC\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Republican rhetoric is that working \nfamilies will be helped, but I question if this will be true for real \nfamilies in West Virginia.\n  This Republican package seeks to cut Medicaid funding by a whopping \n$187 billion over 7 years. But people deserve to understand what such \nharsh cuts mean. Medicaid covers poor children, pregnant women, the \ndisabled, and low-income seniors who need nursing home care. What \nhappens to these people and their families when we slash Medicaid \nfunding?\n  Coming from West Virginia, when I think of a family, I think about \nthe children, parents, and grandparents. What happens to parents \nstruggling to balance raising children and caring for aging parents?\n  If a working family gets a new child tax credit but loses Medicaid \nnursing home coverage for an aging parent, what is the overall effect \non that family? The child tax credit is $500 a year for some families \nlucky enough to qualify, but the loss of Medicaid nursing home coverage \nwill cost those same families $16,000 to $30,000 a year.\n  For example, Julie Sayres of Charleston, WV cared for her mother who \nsuffers with Alzheimer's disease as long as she could at home. But as \nher mother's illness got worse, she had to move to a local nursing home \nwhere Julie can visit her daily. Julie may get a partial child tax \ncredit of $500 under this package, but if she cannot get Medicaid \ncoverage for her mother in the nursing home when her mother's meager \nsavings are exhausted, Julie and her family will be much, much worse \noff. That child tax credit will not cover even a month of nursing home \ncare for her mother.\n  This is real story about a family hurt, not helped by this package.\n  In my State of West Virginia, over 21 percent of our residents rely \non Medicaid, and I worry about what will happen to them and the health \ncare system in my State as it tries to absorb more than $4 billion in \ncuts--West Virginia simply cannot afford this.\n  A headline from the Charleston Daily Mail last week reads: \n``[Medicaid] Cuts May Affect Infant Mortality.''\n  This catches one's attention. It demands closer scrutiny and careful \nthought. The article reports:\n\n       With the help of Medicaid-funded programs, West Virginia's \n     infant mortality death rate decreased from 18.4 deaths per \n     1,000 in 1975 to 6.2 deaths per 1,000 in 1994, better than \n     the national rate of 8.0 deaths per 1,000 births.\n       Medicaid has greatly increased poor women's opportunities \n     to get medical care, said Phil Edwards, the administrative \n     assistant for the Bureau of Public Health's Division of \n     Women's Services. ``By making them eligible, they go in for \n     prenatal care earlier than they would otherwise,'' he said. \n     ``Every dollar you spend on this side in prevention, you save \n     four on the other side where you don't have to treat an at-\n     risk patient,'' Diane Kopcial of the state maternal and child \n     health office said.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe this article should make us all stop and \nthink before we impose such cuts in Medicaid. Do we really want to \njeopardize nursing home care for seniors? Do we really want to slide \nbackward on infant mortality?\n  I do not want to go backward. I understand that Medicaid needs reform \nand our amendment recognizes that there are responsible ways to reduce \nthe rate of growth in Medicaid spending. But we should not throw \nseniors out of nursing homes, deny poor mothers access to prenatal care \nand possibly return to times when our infant mortality rate rivals some \nThird World countries, or turn our backs on the disabled.\n  We should think about the real families in West Virginia and cross \nthis country who depend on Medicaid for basic, vital health care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full article from the \nCharleston Daily Mail, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Charleston Daily Mail, Oct. 20, 1995]\n\n                    Cuts May Affect Infant Mortality\n\n       The state Medicaid Crisis Panel began wrapping up its work \n     as health officials expressed concern that federal cuts in \n     the program could reverse progress the state has made \n     reducing infant deaths.\n     \n[[Page S15721]]\n\n       The panel appointed by Gov. Gaston Caperton will recommend \n     ways to cut $200 million out of the Medicaid program this \n     year to balance the budget. It recommend long-term changes \n     that should prepare the program to handle likely federal \n     cuts.\n       Medicaid is a health care program for the poor and \n     disabled. The federal government pays 75 percent of the cost \n     and the state pays the rent.\n       At the insistence of Administration Secretary Chuck Polan, \n     the Department of Health and Human Resources will prepare a \n     priority list of money-saving measures it already is taking \n     and those it thinks the state should take.\n       The list, with the amount each change would save, will be \n     presented at the panel's meeting next Thursday.\n       The group will begin discussing its recommendations then, \n     but will meet final time on Oct. 29 to reach an agreement, \n     said Chairman from Haywood.\n       Meanwhile, state health officials and worried that proposed \n     federal Medicaid cuts could increase infant mortality.\n       With the help of Medicaid-funded programs, West Virginia's \n     infant death rate decreased from 18.4 deaths per 1,000 births \n     in 1975 to 6.2 deaths per 1,000 births in 1994, officials \n     said. The national rate is 8.0 deaths per 1,000 births.\n       Diane Kopcial of the state maternal and child health office \n     said that when Medicaid expanded in the 1980s the state:\n       Recruited physicians to care for Medicaid patients.\n       Built a referral system with hospitals in Charleston, \n     Morgantown and Huntington.\n       Began the Right from the Start program to serve Medicaid-\n     eligible woman during their pregnancies and 60 days after \n     they give birth. It also serves infants up to age 1. The \n     program provides nutritional counseling, parenting education, \n     and transportation to medical appointments.\n       The Women, Infants and Children program also provides \n     nutrition and health education, free food and breastfeeding \n     information for women and children under 5.\n       Medicaid has greatly increased poor women's opportunities \n     to get medical care, and Phil Edwards, the administrative \n     assistant for the Bureau of Public Health's Division of \n     Women's Services.\n       ``By making them eligible, they'll go in for prenatal care \n     earlier than they would otherwise,'' he said.\n       ``Every dollar you spend on this side in prevention, you \n     save four on the other side where you don't have to treat an \n     at-risk patient,'' Kopical said.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my Democratic \ncolleagues in opposition to the Republican proposal to replace the \njoint Federal-State Medicaid Program with a block grant to the States.\n  Medicaid currently guarantees that 36 million low-income pregnant \nwomen, children, disabled, and elderly Americans have access to \nhospitals, physicians, nursing homes, and other basic health care. The \nRepublican plan would eliminate this guarantee and cut Medicaid by $182 \nbillion by the year 2002.\n  What the Republicans are proposing is to cut Medicaid and then lower \nthe standards States must meet because they know that the standards \ncannot be met with the lower level of funding. In a recent letter to \nMembers of the Senate, the National Association of Counties expressed \nquite correctly the natural consequence of this proposal. I quote from \nthat letter:\n\n       We do not believe that States will find enough budgetary \n     efficiencies without reducing eligibility. The flexibility \n     given to States in the operation of the proposed \n     restructuring will trickle down to counties in the form of \n     flexibility to raise property taxes, cut other necessary \n     services or further reduce staff.\n\n  The Republican plan endangers the future health, well being, and \nproductivity of millions of low-income pregnant women, poor children, \nand disabled Americans. It jeopardizes the long-term care of millions \nof our elderly. And these sweeping policy changes have been proposed, \npassed out of committee--and may well be passed by the Senate--without \none official public committee hearing.\n  Because of this, I joined with a number of my Democratic colleagues \nearlier this month in convening several hearings on the Medicaid and \nMedicare programs. We wanted to hear from the people who will be \naffected by the proposed changes. During those hearings, we heard some \nvery moving testimony regarding the impact the Republican plan to cut \nMedicaid will have on the lives of average, hard working middle-class \nAmericans. Since many Members were unable to hear this very moving \ntestimony, I would like to insert in the Record one of the more \ncompelling statements presented at these hearings by Ms. Mary \nFitzpatrick from Dickson, Tennessee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, so follows:\n\n                     Testimony of Mary Fitzpatrick\n\n       My name is Mary Fitzpatrick. I live in Dickson, Tennessee, \n     about 50 miles outside of Nashville. Once again, I am in \n     Washington to speak on behalf of the rights and needs of \n     citizens in nursing homes. I use the word ``again'' because \n     it was eight years ago that I sat before members of Congress \n     and described a pattern of neglect and poor care that led to \n     my mother's death in a nursing home in 1984. I spoke then \n     because I wanted to do whatever I could to prevent another \n     human being from the pain and denial of dignity that my \n     mother, Maggie Connolly, endured. I did not want any other \n     family to have to bear the agony of watching a loved one \n     suffer because of lack of basic services and a system that \n     fails to protect frail, vulnerable people. And I want to \n     spare others the despair my family felt trying to persuade \n     the state of Tennessee to enforce nursing home standards.\n       The account I gave eight years ago helped achieve \n     bipartisan support for the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Act. \n     Imagine my shock in learning of the current proposal to \n     undermine this law.\n       I cannot believe Congress would consider returning to a \n     system that renders quality nursing home care an option for \n     states, especially when I know what the state did for my \n     mother--absolutely nothing.\n       Obviously, lawmakers in Washington are out of touch with \n     ordinary people. And that's who people in nursing homes and \n     their families are--ordinary individuals seeking a safe \n     setting and adequate services during en emotionally, \n     physically trying time.\n       Ordinary people understand the need to control the federal \n     deficit. Ordinary people realize the importance of ensuring \n     accountability for public dollars paid to the nursing home \n     industry each year.\n       What is beyond our comprehension is how elected officials \n     can support a proposal that will hurt people who can not \n     speak out for themselves.\n       As I explained in 1987, after my mother's admission to the \n     nursing home, my daily routine soon became one of cleaning up \n     my mother's waste, bathing her and changing her linen as soon \n     as I arrived each afternoon. The facility denied my mother \n     this basic care. I even had to fight for the supplies to \n     provide that care myself.\n       My mother raised three children, and until a stroke at age \n     47 had worked in a bag manufacturing plant. Prior to her \n     admission to the nursing home, she suffered from Parkinsons \n     disease and congestive heart failure and lost her ability to \n     speak. In 1983, her condition quickly deteriorated. After a \n     two week hospital stay, she became incontinent and her \n     doctors advised us she would need to go to a nursing home. I \n     favored a nursing facility near my home. Unfortunately, my \n     mother's source of payment, Medicaid, was not preferred by \n     that facility which refused her admittance.\n       Upon recommendation and a tour of the chapel, lunchroom and \n     some of the residence floors, we chose a facility then called \n     the Belmont Health Care Center. From day one, my brother, \n     sister and I visited mother regularly. My brother even \n     changed shifts so that he could see her each afternoon,. I \n     would come by directly from work, missing dinner to stay \n     until 8:30 or 9:00 p.m. Weekends also involved regular visits \n     from family and friends. There was never a day during my \n     mother's nursing home stay that she did not receive care and \n     attention for several hours from family members or friends. \n     Still, the problems began almost immediately.\n       On the third day of my mother's nursing home stay, I found \n     her seated in her own waste in a wheelchair. Giving up on \n     finding any staff to assist me, I changed mother's clothing \n     and cleaned her up myself. Soon after I was unable to find \n     any clean linens and was informed of a new policy allowing \n     each residents just two sets of linens. I was persistent and \n     was able to obtain some fresh linens. But there was always a \n     shortage of supplies and on many days, I had to search the \n     linen closets on several floors to find a single set of clean \n     bed linens.\n       Within six weeks my mother developed her bed sore. \n     Eventually the sores covered her body, making it impossible \n     for her to lie without pressing on the painful skin ulcers. \n     By the time she died eight months later at the age of 75, one \n     of the original sores measured about three inches across and \n     nearly two inches deep. The staff never carried out the \n     instructions on regularly repositioning her. My brother, \n     sister and I would turn her while we were there, but she was \n     supposed to be turned every two hours around the clock. Nor \n     was there sufficient staff to properly care for my mother's \n     bed sores. Two nurses showed me how to clean the bed sores \n     and told me where to purchase special medical dressing. I \n     bought and used them regularly, but the nursing home \n     administration continued telling me that they couldn't find \n     out whether the pharmacy carried these dressings.\n       There were other problems. Residents like my mother who \n     were unable to reach out for water could go for many hours \n     without anything to drink. My mother's roommate told us how \n     my mother once had dabbed a Kleenex and spilled water on a \n     tray and held it in her mouth to relieve her thirst. \n     Throughout this ordeal none of the family or friends caring \n     for my mother knew where to go for help. Finally a friend \n     located someone on the \n     \n[[Page S15722]]\n\n     Tennessee Department of Health and Environment Nursing Home \n     Inspections staff. I called him and explained our concerns \n     about retaliation. He promised confidentiality and said \n     someone would be out within the next few days. But it wasn't \n     until a few weeks that a state inspector came. One of my \n     complaints involved getting proper care for my mother's bed \n     sores.\n       Then two days after the state inspector's visit I came to \n     the facility and found my mother's sheets soaked in blood. \n     She was lying on her side crying. I pulled back the covers \n     and saw her bed sores had been debrided, which means \n     surgically cut to remove the dead tissue. I was shocked to \n     find that the procedure had been performed at the nursing \n     home instead of the hospital. Given the seriousness of the \n     bed sores, she must have been in agony. But when I asked what \n     they could do for the pain, I was told, ``Tylenol is all we \n     can give.''\n       I think mother probably went into shock. But, in any event, \n     she died two days later on July the 7th, 1984. When I was \n     getting ready to go to the funeral home the state inspector \n     called me to say that they had been out a few days before to \n     investigate my allegations of three weeks ago. He said I \n     would be pleased to know that most of my complaints had been \n     substantiated. I told him it was too late. My mother was \n     dead.\n       The undertaker told me he had never seen a body is such bad \n     condition, and that he had to enclose the lower half of \n     mother's body in a plastic bag. One of the most disturbing \n     things about this whole ordeal is that my mother was aware of \n     what was going on, even though she could not express herself, \n     other than through gestures and facial expressions. And, all \n     the while, I was haunted by the fact that other people in \n     nursing homes, both young and older, were going through the \n     same hell that my mother went through.\n       It has been very difficult to have to relive this \n     experience the second time around. But, it is even harder to \n     accept the fact, Congress is preparing to destroy a law that \n     would have saved my mother and so many others, so much pain \n     and suffering. Thank you for the chance to speak. I would be \n     glad to try and answer any questions.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, Ms. Fitzpatrick laid out before us in \ndetail commonly found nursing home conditions before passage of Federal \nnursing home minimum quality standards. The Republican plan we are \nconsidering would repeal the minimum quality standards for nursing \nhomes. In my view, such a proposal is mean spirited and illogical.\n  Morton Kondracke in a recent column described the consequences of \nthis proposal:\n\n       The Republicans need to face up to the fact that, if they \n     go through with their planned reforms in poor people's \n     healthcare, instances of abuse, neglect, broken bones, urine-\n     soaked beds and filthy surroundings will multiply in the \n     years to come.\n\n  Mr. President, those were the very conditions that led to the \nenactment of the 1987 legislation. And now they want to repeal these \nstandards. They want to repeal them because they know that without them \nsome nursing home--some, not all--but some nursing homes will be able \nto absorb the reduced funding by lowering their standards of care. They \nwill return to the old days of mistreatment and nontreatment which Mary \nFitzpatrick and Morton Kondracke described as a means of cutting costs \nto respond to the slashed funding. Other nursing homes--the ones that \ndo not lower their standards--may simply stop serving those families \nwhich cannot afford to pay $50,000-$60,000 a year for nursing home \ncare. And who will this affect? The 4 million elderly who depend on \nMedicaid for their nursing home care and their families.\n  Mr. President, our Government should not renege on its commitment to \nensuring that millions of needy, disabled, and elderly Americans \nreceive essential basic health care. The Republican proposal, which \nwould eliminate such guarantees, could have disastrous consequences for \nmany citizens, and I would strongly urge my colleagues not to go down \nthis path.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nDemocratic leadership amendment to restore over $125 billion to the \nMedicaid Program.\n  Our Republican colleagues constantly remind us how important family \nvalues are to them. I think that's great. Families are the backbone of \nour society. They provide nurturing and loving environments for our \nchildren. They provide stability and safety, and foster values we need \nto become better people and a better society.\n  What are family values? I'll tell you what I think they are. I think \nfamily values are honoring your mother and father. I think family \nvalues are honesty--keeping promises. Family values are care and \ndedication to the well-being of those you love.\n  Family values are not breaking promises, they are not telling your \nmother and father that they'll have to do without medical care, and \nthey're absolutely not about risking the safety of your parents when \nyou can no longer provide the care they need and have to put them in a \nnursing home.\n  Mr. President, there are 18 million children in the United States who \ndepend on Medicaid. There are more than 900,000 elderly people who \ndepend on Medicaid for their nursing home care. There are 6 million \ndisabled Americans who depend on Medicaid.\n  The wealthy won't be affected by these draconian cuts. It's likely \nthat the vast majority of the 100 Senators in this room won't be \naffected, nor will most of the 435 Members of the House.\n  The people who are affected are normal, regular, everyday Americans. \nNot big-time lobbyists; not big-money campaign contributors. The people \nwho are affected are people like my neighbors, my mom, and the kids who \ngo to St. Stanislaw's Catholic School right down the street from me.\n  Mr. President, there are 6 million disabled Americans who rely on \nMedicaid because they cannot get private health insurance. It's not \nbecause they don't want it. It's not because they can't afford it. It's \nbecause no private insurance company will cover them. Without Medicaid, \nwhere will they go? I believe that I am my brother's keeper. We have a \nresponsibility to our fellow women and men. Make no mistake about it.\n  Mr. President, Medicaid is a program that benefits a broad spectrum \nof Americans. One in five children in America--18 million kids--receive \ntheir health coverage through Medicaid. One in five. Healthy children \nare the first step to a strong America. The next generation must be \nhealthy in body and mind in order to make the large contribution to our \nsociety that we're all trying to prepare them for.\n  These kids don't understand Medicaid. They don't understand the \nprocess, and, quite frankly, they probably don't care. But their \nparents do. Their parents worry themselves sick about whether or not \nwe're going to take away their ability to get medical care for their \nkids.\n  I worry myself sick about that too. But there's a difference. I have \na vote on this floor, and I have the bully pulpit. And I want them to \nknow that I'm on their side. I'm fighting for them. I want the parents \nof the 18 million children on Medicaid to know that I stand ready to \nhelp them help themselves.\n  I'm glad this legislation does not repeal the Spousal Impoverishment \nAct. I authored this act in 1988. And I'm here to tell you I'm standing \nsentry to make sure this critical protection is maintained.\n  My dad died of Alzheimer's disease. My mom, my sisters and I made use \nof a long-term care continuum in Maryland. We took Dad to a geriatric \nevaluation center at Johns Hopkins to be sure we knew what was wrong \nwith him and how to keep him at home with us longer. We used adult day \ncare to stretch out his ability to stay with us and to help with \nrespite care for my mother--a heart bypass survivor. But we reached a \npoint when we knew we couldn't give him the level of care that he \nneeded. And we had to bring him to a nursing home.\n  I visited my dad all the time at his home. It wasn't a Cadillac, \nGucci-style nursing home. Dad would have hated that. It was a real \nnursing home with real patients who had real families.\n  Over time I got to know those families. I listened to their stories--\nto their trials and their tribulations. I heard stories about how you \nhad to spend down your life savings to $3,000 before you could qualify \nfor help. Families had to go into bankruptcy while they were trying to \npractice family responsibility.\n  My dad wasn't the kind of guy who wanted a fancy tombstone. He wanted \nto make sure that what he left behind would help others. I made a \npromise that I'd try to change the cruel rules of Government that \npenalize families who have saved all their lives.\n  I'm so proud that with the help of great men like Lloyd Bentsen, \nGeorge Mitchell, Ted Kennedy, and the members of the Finance Committee, \nwe changed that law so that now you can \n\n[[Page S15723]]\n\nkeep your home, you can keep assets up to $15,000, and the spouse at \nhome can have an income of up to $1,000 a month. So, I'm glad that this \nwon't be repealed, and I want to make sure it never, ever is. I want \nall Senators to know that in this regard, we've done well by the \nAmerican people.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the rest of the bill. In \nthis legislation we are repealing nursing home safety standards! That \nis horrific.\n  As I just said, my father was in a Chevy Cavalier nursing home--not a \nCadillac nursing home. But we all knew that he would be fed, he would \nbe taken care of, he would receive his medication, we wouldn't have to \nworry about restraints, we wouldn't have to worry about abuse. We knew \nthat because of the standards, dad would be safe.\n  In 1983 Congress commissioned a study by the Institute of Medicine at \nthe National Academy of Sciences. This study revealed shocking \ndeficiencies in nursing home care. In 27 States, at least one-third of \nfacilities had care so poor that it jeopardized health and safety.\n  Some nursing home residents have been treated in conditions which are \nworse than prisons. Worse than prisons!\n  In 1987 Senator Pryor led the charge to enact the standards which now \nprotect nursing home residents. He's still leading that charge, and I \nthank him for that.\n  Now we want to repeal those standards? Not this Senator. I will not, \nunder any circumstance, allow anyone in this body to put the lives of \nmen like my father at risk.\n  Saying ``yes'' to this amendment says yes to keeping promises, it \ntells our seniors, our children and the disabled that we care about \ntheir well-being. That we will help them if they've played by the rules \nand if they're making the effort to help themselves. And that we will \nnot let those few nursing home profiteers put them at risk in the name \nof turning a buck.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by Senator Graham.\n  The bill before us creates a Medicaid block grant, a blank check, to \nStates with virtually no rules, no specified benefits, no rules of \neligibility.\n  The amendment would retain the current Medicaid Program, but impose a \nspending limit per individual recipient, an individual cap. This \napproach would hold down cost increases without undermining Medicaid as \na health insurance program.\n\n\n                         Medicaid in California\n\n  Medicaid, called Medi-Cal in my State, pays for health care for 6 \nmillion Californians. Out of these 6 million, 38 percent are children. \nMedicaid pays the bills of over 60 percent of children in California's \nchildren's hospitals. At Oakland Children's Hospital, it pays for 70 \npercent.\n  Medicaid provides 70 percent of hospital care to the poor in my \nState. Of total Medicaid dollars, over 59 percent is spent on the \nelderly and disabled and 41 percent to families.\n  One million Americans are infected with HIV/AIDS. In California, \nthere are over 150,000. Medicaid provides health insurance for 40 \npercent of all people with HIV/AIDS, including 90 percent of all HIV-\ninfected children. In California, Medicaid pays for 50 percent of all \nHIV/AIDS care. Medicaid pays for 55 percent of HIV-related public \nhospital care and 41 percent of private hospital care.\n  In my State, Medicaid paid $719 million for emergency services for \nillegal immigrants, last year, according to the California Department \nof Health Services.\n  Medicaid is a fundamental health safety net in California, insuring \neverything from basic inoculations for poor children to sophisticated \nadvanced treatment for AIDS.\n\n\n                        Medicaid Cost Increases\n\n  As a former mayor, I know the difficulty of balancing budgets and \nkeeping costs under control. And there is no doubt that Medicaid costs, \nalong with general health care inflation, have grown at double digits, \ncreating tremendous pressure on government budgets at all levels.\n  The amendment before us reins in Medicaid's growth, but instead of \ncutting $187 billion, it cuts $62 billion, one-third of the cut in the \nRepublican bill.\n\n\n         Why the Graham Amendment is Better than the Roth Bill\n\n  Why is this approach preferable to the committee bill?\n  First, it does put restraints on spiraling costs.\n  Second, it preserves coverage for those who cannot get health \ninsurance on the private market because of costs or the individual's \nhealth condition.\n  Third, a per capita cap can respond to changing conditions--\npopulation growth, recessions, base closings, natural disasters, \nimmigration.\n\n\n                      California and Fluctuations\n\n  The per capita cap approach in this amendment would enable my State \nto respond to all the economic fluctuations that we live with daily.\n  Unemployment in California has not dropped below 7 percent since \n1990. While the country added 3 million jobs between 1991 and 1993, \nCalifornia lost nearly 450,000.\n  Base closures and realignments have erased more than 200,000 jobs, \nsucking $7 billion out of the State's economy. Defense and aerospace \nindustries are downsizing.\n  Some 6.5 million or 23 percent of our nonelderly population are \nwithout health insurance. In some urban areas, the uninsured rate is as \nhigh as 33 percent. Over half, 58 percent of the uninsured, are \nchildren and young adults.\n  Employer-provided health insurance is declining. Two-thirds of \nCalifornians employed by firms with fewer than 25 employees do not \nreceive health insurance.\n  California is home to 38 percent of all legal immigrants in the U.S.\n  A flat block grant with a fixed pool of money cannot respond to \nchanging needs like this. A formula that is responsive to numbers of \nbeneficiaries, like this amendment, can.\n\n\n                           Nursing Home care\n\n  The amendment before us would preserve nursing home standards, \nstandards that S. 1357 eliminates.\n  Responding to a National Academy of Sciences report, Congress in 1987 \nenacted nursing home standards to promote quality of life of nursing \nhome residents and to prevent abuse and neglect. This bill repeals \nthose standards, rules designed to prevent bedsores, dehydration, \nmalnutrition, infection; rules designed to protect privacy and human \nintegrity. These standards have reduced injury and cut the use of \nchemical restraints, which in turn has reduced costs.\n  In California, 65 percent of our 113,000 nursing home residents rely \non Medicaid. This is 113,000 elderly and disabled people, patients \nwith, for example, Alzheimer's, AIDS, and ventilator needs.\n  Twenty-one percent of nonelderly nursing home residents are disabled. \nSeventy-five percent of nursing home residents are women. The typical \nnursing home resident is an 83-year-old widow with multiple chronic \nconditions, such as crippling arthritis or osteoporosis.\n  We should not take away these minimal protections for the most frail \nand make them victims again.\n\n\n                    Medicaid--a Middle-Class Program\n\n  Medicaid is health insurance for low-income Americans and the \ndisabled. But it is important to understand the implications Medicaid \nhas for the middle-class. Nursing home standards, which are required as \na condition of receiving Medicaid payments, benefit every nursing home \nresident of whatever income.\n  By cutting Medicaid, we add to the rolls of the uninsured which means \nthat more people show up in emergency rooms with exacerbated illnesses. \nWe all pay for that.\n  Medicaid reimbursement to our public hospitals enables these \nhospitals to have up-to-date trauma centers and emergency rooms which \nserve Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients. These are critical \ninstitutions in many communities on which we all depend. Indeed, these \ninstitutions are at the economic core of thousands of communities and \nthey provide jobs.\n\n\n                           A Basic Protection\n\n  The committee bill makes drastic cuts in Medicaid and it revamps the \nprogram in a way that cannot respond to the growing needs of California \nand changes a steadfast program of health insurance to an arbitrary, \nill-defined block of Federal funds.\n  The bill purports to transform Medicaid. I'm afraid that it destroys \nMedicaid.\n\n[[Page S15724]]\n\n  I oppose the committee bill. I commend my colleague from Florida for \nhis amendment and I support him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Washington 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nthis very important amendment he has brought before us today. It seems, \nso often when we come out on the Senate floor, we get caught up in the \ncharts and graphs and ``Senatese\" terms that we hear so often and we \nforget what we are doing affects very real people and very real \nfamilies across this country. I want to talk about one of those very \nreal people. He is a young child. He is 21 months old. He lives in my \nState. His mother wrote me a desperate letter saying, ``Please do not \ntake away Medicaid.''\n  Her son, Abe, was born with a severe medical disorder. He needs a \nmodified ventilator to breathe 22 out of every 24 hours. In his short \n21 months, he has had many surgeries to help put fingers on his hands, \nto help him breathe, to help him live. His mother said, without \nMedicaid, Abe would not be here.\n  This mother is desperate because she knows, as all of us do, that if \nwe change this bill in the way that is being proposed by the \nRepublicans, she will have to fight for Medicaid coverage with everyone \nelse in my State who is desperately going to be looking for help, and \nit is very likely that Abe will not have his ventilator once this goes \nto our States.\n  I went out and I talked to hundreds of parents in my State who have \nchildren at Children's Orthopedic Hospital in my home State. These are \nparents who did not expect to have a child with a severe medical \ndisorder. They did not expect to have a child with asthma, who was in \nthe hospital every other week. They did not expect to have a child who \nhad leukemia. And they did not expect that they would have to quit \ntheir job to stay home and take care of that child. They did not expect \nthat their own medical insurance would run out within a very short time \nbecause of the limits on insurance. And they never expected to have to \nturn to the Federal Government to ask for help.\n  But I can tell you everyone of those parents needs our help and this \namendment will send that assurance back to them. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, how much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes for the Senator from Michigan and \n7 minutes and 30 seconds the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I would prefer not to use our 2 minutes at this point.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that off of the \ngeneral debate on the bill there be 3 minutes yielded, one of which \nwill be yielded to the Senator from Wisconsin as well as 1 minute for \ndebate of this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Florida and I thank the Chair. \nIf we do not make changes very quickly, I am very concerned that older \npeople in our society are going to get the message from this budget \nthat we have changed our attitude toward their contributions in \nbuilding this society. What other impression are senior citizens \nsupposed to get, when a huge percentage of balancing the budget is \nbased on enormous, and I think in many cases unjustified, changes in \nMedicare, changes that will increase the premiums of seniors in this \ncountry well beyond what they would have been.\n  Equally bad is something that is being discussed, as we sit here \ntoday, over in the Senate Aging Committee, namely the completely \nunjustified elimination of the Federal nursing home regulations from \nOBRA 1987. What fiscal or other justification is there for saying to \nolder people who now must be in a nursing home after a hard life, a \nlife of work and contribution to country and family, that we are not \ngoing to be sure on a national level that people are protected from \nunhealthy and unsafe conditions?\n  Those of my colleagues who served in State legislatures, or served as \nGovernors of their State, will certainly confirm that Medicaid makes up \na huge portion of the State budget.\n  And, Mr. President, if they have any passing knowledge of their \nState's Medicaid program, they will also confirm that the bulk of the \nMedicaid budget, and the source of the greatest growth in that budget, \nis probably the growing demand for long-term care services, typically \nnursing home care.\n  This is certainly true for Wisconsin.\n  But, Mr. President, in Wisconsin, back in the late 1970's, we came to \nthe realization that unless significant reforms were enacted, the \nrapidly increasing nursing home use would be too heavy a load for the \nStates' budget to sustain prudently.\n  Through a bipartisan effort--and Mr. President, I stress bipartisan \nbecause Governors and legislators from both parties supported the \neffort--we made some significant reforms to our long-term care system.\n  The centerpiece of that reform was the creation of a home and \ncommunity-based program, called the Community Options Program, or COP.\n  COP provides flexible, consumer-oriented and consumer-directed \nservices that help keep the disabled of all ages in their own homes and \ncommunities.\n  It builds upon the existing set of so-called informal supports--the \ncaregiving done by family members and friends.\n  Mr. President, the results have been dramatic.\n  Between 1980 and 1993, while Medicaid nursing home use increased by \n47 percent nationally, in Wisconsin Medicaid nursing home use actually \ndropped 15 percent.\n  Mr. President, long-term care reform is the key to taming our \nMedicaid budget.\n  But that is not the route pursued in this bill.\n  Instead of a comprehensive reform that would help States cope with \nthe growing population of those needing long-term care services, this \nbill cuts and runs.\n  It cuts the Federal Government's share of this growing burden by $182 \nbillion over the next 7 years.\n  It runs away from the problem of a mushrooming population needing \nlong-term care by block granting the program and dumping responsibility \nin the laps of State policymakers.\n  Mr. President, this is a prescription for disaster.\n  For 30 years, States have made policy decisions based on one set of \nrules.\n  Based on those rules, over those 30 years an infrastructure of long-\nterm care has evolved that is heavily skewed toward expensive, \ninstitutional care.\n  That was not by accident.\n  The system that developed in that time produced the incentives that \nresulted in this institutional bias.\n  But, Mr. President, that infrastructure cannot change overnight.\n  And it certainly will not change simply because the Federal \nGovernment slashes funding and runs away from the problem.\n  Just the opposite is likely to happen.\n  Today, Medicaid is essentially a provider entitlement.\n  Providers of specific services are funded, and that infrastructure, \nwhich has been so influential at both the State and Federal level in \nwriting the rules which produced the system we have today, is not going \nto disappear.\n  That skewed infrastructure is well situated at the State level to win \nthe fight for the pool of resources this bill greatly reduces.\n  This bill is not reform; it merely makes a flawed situation even \nworse.\n  The same problems that exist in Medicaid today will exist under this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to commit, \nand let the Finance Committee craft a product that will let States wean \nthemselves off of their addiction to expensive institutional services \nand instead move toward helping families keep their disabled loved ones \nat home, utilizing consumer-oriented and consumer-directed home and \ncommunity based care. So I hope we support the Graham amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to reserve the balance of our time \nincluding the additional 2 minutes which were yielded for my close.\n\n[[Page S15725]]\n\n  I yield to the Senator from Michigan for any final debate in \nopposition to the motion.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute to just \nrecapitulate the point that has been made on our side in the last hour \nof debate.\n  Our position is quite simple--that if States are given the kind of \nflexibility that has in part been given for waivers to run Medicaid \nPrograms, they can bring down the rate of growth of these programs far \nmore effectively than a Federal bureaucracy in Washington; that, \nindeed, the growth rates are growth rates that decrease but growth in \nspending that has been outlined in the reconciliation bill can still \nprovide the sorts of benefits that all of us want to see for our \ncitizens, if we let the States, the people closest to those in need, \nrun these systems.\n  In my State of Michigan, our Governor, our legislature, and our \ndepartment of social services insist that they can make our program \neven more efficient at the rate of growth that is proposed in this \nlegislation if they are simply given the opportunity to do so. We have \ncome to a point when health care costs are skyrocketing in the public \nsector but are being brought under control in the private sector \nthrough such things as competition and other market factors.\n  Let us give the States the chance to do some of the same things this \nlegislation does. That is the reason we have included this approach and \nState flexibility in the reconciliation package.\n  At this point, I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch from January \n31, 1995, which bears testimony to the fact that:\n\n       Missouri also wants to start a managed care system for its \n     600,000 Medicaid recipients. It would use the money saved to \n     provide medical coverage to another 300,000 Missourians who \n     do not qualify for Medicaid coverage now and who also cannot \n     afford insurance.\n\n  So it would really provide insurance for about half of the \nindividuals who currently are uninsured in the State. That is what the \npromise of this potential is.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 31, 1995]\n\nGOP Gears Up To Grapple With Medicaid: States Could Design Own Programs\n\n                           (By Kathleen Best)\n\n       Republican Congressional leaders said they would take up \n     legislation in the next few weeks that could dramatically \n     change the way states provided medical services to the poor.\n       Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar said after a meeting with GOP \n     Congressional leaders that they were willing to consider \n     giving states lump-sum payments and letting them design their \n     own health-care programs for the poor.\n       ``Let us determine who's going to be in the program,'' \n     Edgar said. ``If the money's not there, then we'll have to \n     make some tough decisions.''\n       In return for greater state flexibility, the states would \n     have to agree to hold down future costs, which they split \n     with the federal government.\n       ``They seemed very sympathetic and agreeable to giving us \n     flexibility,'' Edgar said. ``And they said they would like to \n     try to get this thing going within the next few weeks.''\n       Edgar, a Republican, is the lead negotiator of Medicaid for \n     the Republican Governors Association. He met Monday with Sen. \n     Robert Packwood of Oregon, head of the Senate Finance \n     Committee, and with Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the House GOP's \n     point man on the federal budget.\n       Edgar said no firm agreements came out of the meeting. But \n     he said both House and Senate GOP leaders ``are willing to \n     move much quicker than we had hoped for,'' in part to try to \n     hold down increasing costs for the program.\n       Medicaid is now the third largest entitlement program in \n     the nation after Social Security and Medicare. The health \n     benefits to the poor cost states five to eight times more \n     each year than providing cash, food and other benefits to \n     poor mothers with children.\n       For the last few years, Medicaid also has been one of the \n     fastest-growing programs. Illinois, for example, now spends \n     more on Medicaid than it does on education. And Missouri \n     spends more on Medicaid than on any other program.\n       Both states are seeking permission from the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, to change their Medicaid programs. \n     But those requests--both pending for months--remain \n     unanswered.\n       Illinois wants to move to a managed care system that would \n     encourage the poor to get medical treatment from health \n     maintenance organizations or a designated family physician \n     rather than seeking more expensive care in emergency rooms.\n       Missouri also wants to start a managed care system for its \n     600,000 Medicaid recipients. It would use money save to \n     provide medical coverage to another 300,000 Missourians who \n     do not qualify for Medicaid coverage now and who also cannot \n     afford insurance.\n       Edgar said the reforms that he would push for would do away \n     with the need for states to seek federal permission to make \n     such changes. Such permission is now required because the \n     federal government pays for 50 percent of Medicaid costs in \n     Illinois and 60 percent of the costs in Missouri.\n       Federal reimbursement rates are based on the per capita \n     income of a state, which means poorer states get more federal \n     money.\n       ``One of the major things driving the Congress right now is \n     the bottom line--how do you balance the budget,'' Edgar said. \n     ``You can't balance the budget unless you attack the Medicaid \n     problem.\n       ``We're not talking about just throwing people off the \n     rolls, but creating a more efficient program,'' he said.\n       Although Medicaid affects millions of poor Americans and \n     accounts for billions of dollars in annual spending, the \n     issue had remained on the sidelines of the welfare reform \n     debate while Congress focused on changing the programs that \n     provided cash, food and housing to mothers with children.\n       ``The discussion of welfare reform has been far too \n     narrow,'' Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan said. ``It really comes \n     from some of the anecdotal talk about the welfare queen and \n     all this sort of thing as opposed to really thinking through \n     what you want to do--lifting people up to self-sufficiency \n     and work.''\n       President Bill Clinton, in a meeting Monday morning with \n     the National Governors' Association, said he would be willing \n     to consider some changes in Medicaid, but he provided no \n     specifics, participants said.\n       Clinton promised the governors more flexibility in their \n     welfare programs but insisted on safeguards for children.\n       Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, said \n     later that if the federal government did not give states \n     permission to experiment with Medicaid, ``then we will have \n     failed with welfare reform.''\n       Edgar said he planned to meet again next week with GOP \n     congressional leaders to work out a consensus on what needed \n     to be changed. In the meantime, he said, he would talk to \n     both Democratic and Republican governors.\n       He predicted that changes in Medicaid would not set off the \n     same kinds of partisan wrangling that have kept the nation's \n     governors from reaching an agreement on food, housing and \n     cash assistance to the poor.\n       ``Welfare is important, but if you really want to get to \n     what drives most governors up the wall, it's Medicaid,'' he \n     said.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record, another St. Louis Post Dispatch article, \npublished on the 24th of November of last year, which is similar:\n\n       State officials estimate that that provision would result \n     in health insurance coverage for 300,000 people who cannot \n     afford it today--about half the State's uninsured.\n\n  That provision referred to is one which would waive Federal \nregulations and allow the State to design its own program.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch]\n\n GOP Plan May Let Missouri Alter Medicaid--Waiver Would Allow Coverage \n                      of Half of State's Uninsured\n\n                           (By Kathleen Best)\n\n       A promise by congressional Republicans to give the states \n     more flexibility could help Missouri win federal approval of \n     a dramatic shift in the way it provides medical services to \n     its poor.\n       ``Since this is a request for state flexibility, it is in \n     line with the Republican agenda,'' said Donna Checkett, \n     director of the Missouri Division of Medical Services.\n       Missouri wants a waiver of federal regulations that would \n     allow it to rein in the cost of providing medical services to \n     the poor at the same time it expands the program to include \n     about half of the state's uninsured.\n       Health care for the poor would be provided through a new, \n     managed-care system designed to hold down costs by, for \n     example, encouraging people to seek treatment from family \n     doctors, rather than going to emergency rooms, which are more \n     expensive.\n       The state would contract with doctors, hospitals and health \n     maintenance organizations to care for the state's 600,000 \n     Medicaid participants.\n       In addition, Missourians who now earn too much to qualify \n     for Medicaid but too little to buy private health insurance \n     would be allowed to buy into the state-run program at reduced \n     rates.\n       State officials estimate that that provision would result \n     in health insurance coverage for \n     \n[[Page S15726]]\n\n     300,000 people who cannot afford it today--about half the \n     state's uninsured.\n       Before Missouri can put the new system in place, it needs \n     approval from the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services. With Republicans poised to take control of federal \n     purse strings, department officials are likely to be \n     encouraged to look favorably on such waiver requests.\n       Missouri made its formal application for a waiver last \n     summer and is now answering questions about its proposal.\n       Checkett said the most nettlesome problems resolve around \n     how to provide care for poor people with chronic mental \n     illness.\n       ``There have been a lot of questions--both from Washington \n     and in the state--about whether individuals who are \n     chronically mentally ill should go into managed care,'' she \n     said.\n       ``We're concerned about how to balance the protections we \n     need to provide (for the mentally ill) with cost control.''\n       The mentally ill tend to need lots of expensive medical \n     care. But the nature of their illness often makes managing \n     that care nearly impossible as some move in and out of \n     institutions, sometimes living on the streets and \n     occasionally disappearing from the system.\n       ``Managed care is tricky with basically health people,'' \n     Checkett said. ``It's more challenging when you are dealing \n     with the Medicaid population. When you are dealing with the \n     mentally ill, you need to strike a balance very carefully and \n     be very certain how appropriately you have balanced the cost \n     interest with protecting a vulnerable population.''\n       The state originally proposed setting up a pilot project \n     that would carve out a package of behavioral health services \n     for everyone on Medicaid that would be managed by a \n     behavioral health organization.\n       But that approach resulted in howls of protest from mental \n     health advocates and others, and has been, in effect, \n     scrapped.\n       Chekett said no alternative plan had been decided, although \n     negotiations were under way.\n       ``Missouri is not alone in wrestling with this, I can \n     guarantee you,'' said Checkett, who is chairman of the \n     association representing state Medicaid directors.\n       ``If you were to poll other states, you would find this \n     issue of how to treat individuals with chronic mental illness \n     has been a big one. It's been the hardest project I've ever \n     worked on.''\n       A final decision on the mental illness question will be \n     made by Gov. Mel Carnahan and is expected by Jan. 15, when \n     the state plans to present its answers to 259 questions posed \n     by federal regulators.\n       Checkett said the other difficult questions on the list \n     centered on how the state would provide managed care in rural \n     areas of Missouri, where there are few doctors and fewer \n     opportunities to impose cost controls.\n       ``Those are questions we have ourselves and are working \n     on,'' she said. ``We hope we will be able to pay better rates \n     for primary care under a managed care system, which would \n     encourage more doctors to take on more Medicaid recipients.''\n       Some doctors in rural areas now limit the number of poor \n     patients they will see because the state pays proportionately \n     higher rates for treating the poor at hospitals and in \n     emergency rooms.\n       ``Now, we spend $2.5 billion a year with a heavy bias \n     toward institutional settings,'' she said. ``We want to \n     change that.''\n       Checkett said she hoped that if all the answers are \n     submitted by mid-January, the state can begin negotiating \n     details of final approval in the spring. That schedule would \n     coincide with a review by the Missouri Legislature. \n     Legislators must appropriate the funds to pay for the \n     revamped program.\n       But the same Republican majority in Washington that may \n     make it easier for the states to experiment with new \n     approaches may also throw a wrench into carrying out such \n     plans.\n       GOP legislators already have begun talking about major \n     changes in Medicaid and welfare funding, which could force \n     Missouri back to the drawing board.\n       ``I am concerned, just looking at Medicaid, that there will \n     be serious discussion about entitlement caps,'' Checkett \n     said. ``I don't know what it means.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \neditorial which appeared in the St. Louis Post Dispatch entitled \n``Missouri's Wise Shift to HMOs,'' be printed in the Record.\n  It states, in part:\n\n       The Carnahan administration made the right move in deciding \n     to use HMOs to provide medical care for the 154,000 St. Louis \n     area residents eligible for Medicaid.\n\n  The potential of a waiver is similar to what we would have in a block \ngrant.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post Dispatch, Oct. 14, 1995]\n\n                     Missouri's Wise Shift To HMO's\n\n       Regional Medical Center appears to have won big in \n     Missouri's decision to shift all Medicaid recipients in the \n     St. Louis area into health maintenance organizations. The \n     state itself is a winner, too.\n       The Carnahan administration made the right move in deciding \n     to use HMOs to provide medical care for the 154,000 St. Louis \n     area residents eligible for Medicaid. Otherwise, these \n     patients would be cared for under fee-for-service programs \n     with few ways to control costs. HMOs, by contrast, agree to \n     treat patients for a fixed monthly fee, regardless of the \n     services the patients require.\n       HMOs do this profitably by stressing prevention and managed \n     care that denies patients access to unneeded and costly \n     medical specialists, procedures and tests. The Carnahan \n     administration estimates that the shift to HMOs could save \n     the state as much as $11.6 million in the first 12 months. \n     That may seem like a mere ripple in a Missouri Medicaid \n     budget of about $2 billion, about half of which comes from \n     state funds, but these savings mark an important step toward \n     improved cost control.\n       Seven HMOs have contracts with Missouri to treat the \n     state's Medicaid patients. Their monthly per-patient fees \n     vary. The fee for Medicaid-eligible women between the ages of \n     21 and 44, for example, ranges from $120.30 to $127.35. The \n     monthly per-patient fee for children between the ages of 7 \n     and 13 ranges from $42.95 to $46.39.\n       Regional is a big winner because at least 33 percent of the \n     121,890 Medicaid patients have enrolled in HealthCare USA, \n     the HMO co-owned by Regional. Two other HMOs also are using \n     Regional as the preferred provider of services under their \n     plans. Some officials estimate that Regional could end up \n     providing care for nearly half the Medicaid-eligible patients \n     in the St. Louis area.\n       Whether these numbers will be sufficient to help Regional \n     balance its budget and provide care for the uninsured is \n     uncertain. In the last fiscal year, the hospital provided $40 \n     million in care to indigent patients. This year, the hospital \n     is facing a shortfall of at least $11 million because of \n     reductions in federal funds for indigent care. In all \n     probability, the city and county, which set up Regional, will \n     have to cover this deficit.\n       Ideally, Regional's entry into the HMO business will help \n     it pay more of its bills without having to rely on local \n     subsidies. But the city and county must keep in mind that \n     lots of the community's indigent patients don't have access \n     to Medicaid. In other words, St. Louis and St. Louis County \n     will continue to have an obligation to assist Regional in \n     providing care for these patients.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an article from the Tennessean, published on \nOctober 24, 1995, which praises the success of Missouri's use of \nmanaged care for its Medicaid population.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, Oct. 24, 1995]\n\n                     TennCare Could Take Some Notes\n\n\n                      Coventry exec compares plans\n\n                           (By David A. Fox)\n\n       Tennessee may be in the vanguard of Medicaid reform with \n     its TennCare program, but Missouri is the state that is \n     pulling off Medicaid privatization most successfully, a local \n     managed care executive said yesterday.\n       With a more incremental approach, Missouri has managed so \n     far to avoid some of the problems that have plagued Medicaid \n     reform here and in Florida, said Philip Hertik, chairman of \n     Conventy Corp. Nashville-based Coventry, which does not \n     participate in TennCare, is one of seven organizations that \n     last month began enrolling St. Louis Medicaid members in \n     private managed care plans.\n       In a speech to a national conference of the Health Industry \n     Manufacturers Association at Loews Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel. \n     Hertik cited several strengths of the Missouri plan to \n     provide health care to the poor at a contained cost. Among \n     them:\n       Missouri initiated its plan in just one area, rather than \n     throughout the entire state.\n       It put the managed care contracts out for bid.\n       It prohibited marketing of the private plans directly to \n     Medicaid beneficiaries.\n       A neutral company was chosen to gather data from each plan \n     and distribute the information to Medicaid members for use in \n     making their selection.\n       Missouri geared its plan only to the poor, beginning with \n     people in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     program.\n       By contrast, TennCare began in January 1994 covering both \n     the poor and uninsured statewide, at predetermined rates with \n     aggressive marketing to Medicaid members. As a consequence, \n     the $3.1 billion program serving 1.1 million residents \n     started with great confusion among its members, with griping \n     by providers whose reimbursements were slashed and with some \n     apparently improper member-recruitment practices by at least \n     one private health plan.\n       Hertik called the privatization of Medicaid ``the biggest \n     thing in managed care in the past 15 years'' and one of \n     several trends revamping the industry. With the companion \n     trend toward privatizing Medicare, he forecast that market \n     leverage increasingly will shift to managed care \n     organizations and away from hospitals and other providers, \n     such as home health, which traditionally have received a \n     majority of their payments directly from government programs.\n       Probably the most obvious trend facing managed care \n     organizations is the wave of \n     \n[[Page S15727]]\n\n     mergers and acquisitions. But Hertik said this trend differs \n     from consolidation waves in other industries that frequently \n     are sparked by efforts to achieve operating efficiencies from \n     such things as volume buying and the elimination of redundant \n     services.\n       ``All of this is aimed at market leverage, rather than just \n     economies,'' he said.\n       The deals, including health maintenance organizations \n     buying traditional indemnity insurors, are intended to \n     increase the membership in local managed care plans.\n       ``But having sheer size on a national scale and strong \n     balance sheets don't necessarily make you the high-quality, \n     low-cost provider in local markets where the purchasing \n     decisions are made,'' he said. ``It's just a little troubling \n     knowing that its market leverage at the base of this \n     consolidation.''\n       Hertik also identified two other trends:\n       The reaching of ``an inflection point'' heralding ``price \n     competition as more the rule of the day'' instead of boom-\n     and-bust cycles in health insurance underwriting.\n       An emphasis by managed care companies in managing care, \n     rather than just costs, by establishing clinical guidelines, \n     practicing disease management and measuring outcomes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 14 seconds remaining for the Senator \nfrom Michigan, and 7 minutes and 30 seconds remaining for the Senator \nfrom Florida.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my 14 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there is time we received, 3 minutes of \ngeneral debate and 1 minute which was used by the Senator from \nWisconsin. And I ask for the other 2 minutes, as well as the balance of \nour time on this amendment for my closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it has been an illuminating debate but almost as \nilluminating by what has not been said as what has been said.\n  What are some of the things that have been omitted? One of the major \nomissions is, how did the majority party arrive at the figure of $187 \nbillion as the basis of its reduction in Medicaid expenditures by the \nFederal Government over the next 7 years? What was the source of that \nnumber? How was the calculation of the efficiencies and flexibilities \nthat were going to be incorporated in this program used to derive the \nultimate number of $187 billion?\n  The reason that there has not been an answer to that question is \nbecause there is not an answer to that question. The $187 billion was \nderived, not by a rational assessment of what would be the needs of the \nprogram or what will be the per capita increase in costs in delivering \nhealth care, but rather as a means of deriving a set of dollars to fund \na tax cut for the wealthiest of Americans.\n  The fact is that the Medicaid Program has been operating at a per \ncapita level of expenditure less than the national average in terms of \nall private sector health care spending, 7.1 percent in the private \nsector, 7 percent in Medicaid. This is what has been the level of \nMedicaid expenditure per capita. Under this bill, the proposal is to \nslash Medicaid from a 7 percent growth to a 1.4 percent growth.\n  Mr. President, I would defy anyone to say that is not going to result \nin a significant collapse of the Medicaid system's ability to serve the \nmost vulnerable population in our country.\n  The second question that has not been discussed is, why has the \nMedicaid Program been growing at the rate that it has been growing?\n  Let me suggest three reasons, one that we ought to be very proud of, \nand that is that we are doing as a Nation a much better job of helping \nthe poorest and most at risk of our children. Infant mortality in the \nUnited States has dropped by over 21 percent in the last decade. Infant \nmortality in America has dropped by over 21 percent in the last decade. \nWe ought to be proud about that, and it has occurred because in large \npart we have extended Medicaid coverage to more and more at-risk \nmothers, and we have provided the kind of appropriate health care \nimmediately after birth. We should not be ashamed of that.\n  Second, Medicaid has increased because of the aging of Americans. \nWhat has not been pointed out is that 60 percent of the Medicaid \nexpenditures do not go to poor children and their mothers. Sixty \npercent of the expenditures go to the disabled and particularly to the \nfrail elderly. In my State, 70 percent of Medicaid expenditures go to \nthe disabled and the frail elderly.\n  That happens to be the segment of our population which is growing at \nthe fastest rate. In most States the fastest growing generational \ncomponent of the population is people who are over the age of 80--the \nvery population that is most likely to need Medicaid assistance for \nlong-term care.\n  The third reason for the increase in the number of persons on \nMedicaid has been the decline in private insurance coverage \nparticularly for children. In 1977, 71 percent of the children of \nworking Americans had their health care covered through their working \nparents. Today, in 1993, that number is down to 57 percent and \nprojected in the year 2002 to be 47 percent. There has been almost a 1-\nto-1 increase in the poor children on Medicaid as there has been a \ndecline in poor children covered through a parent's health care policy.\n  Those are three basic reasons why Medicaid has been increasing over \nthe last few years, not because of oppressive Federal regulations.\n  Another thing that has not been discussed is the allocation formula. \nWould you like to see the allocation formula among the States? There it \nis. That is the arithmetic allocation formula contained in the \nRepublicans' Medicaid proposal.\n  This formula, when you get through all the algebra, says that those \nStates which today are receiving 4 and 5 times as much per capita as \nother States will continue to receive 4 to 5 times as much. We are \nseeing a pattern. We saw it in welfare reform and now we are seeing it \nin Medicaid, and that is identify the problem, decry the status quo, \nand then retain the funding formula of the current program. We did it \nin welfare reform, and we are about to do it again in Medicaid.\n  It would be like George Washington, after having won the American \nRevolution, saying, ``but we are going to continue to pay tribute to \nGeorge III.'' The very reason that we fought the war would have been \nforgotten.\n  Mr. President, we need to have a funding formula that treats all \nAmericans fairly wherever they live. This bill of the Republicans \ncontinues basically the current funding formula into the indefinite \nfuture.\n  What is going to be lost under the Republican proposal? We are going \nto lose the flexibility of an effective State-Federal partnership--\nthose States that experience growth, those States that experience \neconomic decline, those States that experience a natural disaster. We \nhad 12,000 people added to the Medicaid role in Florida within days \nafter Hurricane Andrew because not only were their homes blown away, \ntheir jobs were blown away and they became eligible for Medicaid. And \nthey needed it because of the disaster through which they just lived. \nThat flexibility is going to be lost in this program. We are also going \nto lose the adequate funding of a Federal partner, and we are going to \nlose national standards particularly in the area of nursing homes.\n  It is not surprising that President Reagan said that the Medicaid \nProgram should not be turned over to the States but that the Medicaid \nProgram should be federalized in order to have a national standard of \nhealth care. Where are the voices for President Reagan today? This \ngreat advocate of a strong national program to protect the health of \nour children needs to be heard today.\n  I close by saying there is a better way. We are proposing in this \nmotion, first, that we have a rational reduction in Medicaid. What we \nessentially are saying is that we will propose to restrain Medicaid to \n1 percentage point less than the private sector rate of growth in \nhealth care spending. And with that 1 percent restraint, that is, that \nthe per capita for Medicaid will be 6.1 percent per year over the next \n7 years, we will save $62 billion. We think that we can make that kind \nof a change without ravaging the system, and we would distribute the \nmoney through a per capita cap.\n  This maintains the individual entitlement to Medicaid coverage and \ncreates incentives to maintain health care coverage. It provides for \nfunding into each of the four categories of principal \n\n[[Page S15728]]\n\nMedicaid populations, that is, poor children, their mothers, the \ndisabled, and the frail elderly, so that we will not create what is, I \nbelieve, an inevitable result of the block grant approach which is \ngoing to be a war at the State level among those four groups of \nbeneficiaries.\n  We would also allow for a continuation of innovative programs such as \nthe program in the State of Tennessee. We believe that the kinds of \nflexibility that we would provide, which would make it easier for \nStates to move into managed care and easier for States to use \ncommunity-based services to meet the needs of the elderly, will produce \nsome real economies and therefore reduce the rates of expenditure over \nthe next 7 years, an attainable goal without collapsing the system.\n  It is interesting, Mr. President, that the proposal that I make \ntoday, the per capita cap alternative to block grants, is the proposal \nwhich was introduced in the Senate on June 29, 1994, by our \ndistinguished majority leader, cosponsored by 39 Republican Members. A \nsimilar program was introduced by our colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, and the junior Senator from Rhode Island, also promoting a \nper capita cap on Medicaid as a means of reforming the system.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we have a program that will achieve \nsignificant savings without sacrificing the safety net that Medicaid \nhas represented. We can have these reforms while retaining a program \nthat is vital to 37 million of our most vulnerable Americans. What we \nwill sacrifice is a little piece of the tax break that we are about to \ngive to the wealthiest of Americans in order to assure minimal health \ncare standards for the poorest and most vulnerable of Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements \nfrom scores of organizations in opposition to the Republican plan and \nin support of the proposal that is before us be printed in the Record \nand that an analysis of the mandates which are contained in the \nRepublican proposal also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 3, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations are opposed to \n     eliminating the entitlement status of individuals under the \n     Medicaid program. The Medicaid program provides basic health \n     and long term-care services to over 33 million American men, \n     women, and children. Eliminating the entitlement status would \n     jeopardize coverage for these seniors, families, children, \n     and persons with disabilities, at a time when employers are \n     dropping coverage and the number of uninsured persons \n     continues to rise.\n       We understand that, in the interest of deficit reduction, \n     savings must be achieved in the Medicaid program. However, \n     extreme and disproportionate cuts in the Medicaid program \n     will result in more Americans uninsured and in poor health, \n     disincentives for providers to serve this population, and \n     untenable cost shifting to state and local governments, \n     providers and private payers. We stand ready to work with you \n     on ways to achieve reasonable levels of savings without \n     endangering the access of millions of beneficiaries to \n     essential health care. We do not believe that ending the \n     entitlement nature of the Medicaid program would achieve \n     these objectives.\n           Sincerely yours,\n       AIDS Action Council.\n       Alzheimer's Association.\n       American Academy of Family Physicians.\n       American Association of University Women.\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       American College of Physicians.\n       American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees.\n       American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.\n       American Geriatrics Society.\n       American Network of Community Options and Resources.\n       American Nurses Association.\n       American Public Health Association.\n       American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.\n       Americans for Democratic Action.\n       Association for the Care of Children's Health.\n       Automated Health Systems, Inc.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition.\n       Catholic Charities USA.\n       Catholic Health Association.\n       Center for Community Change.\n       Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n       Center for Women Policy Studies.\n       Center on Disability and Health.\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       Coalition on Human Needs.\n       Connecticut Association for Human Services.\n       Consumers' Union.\n       Council of Women's and Infants' Specialty Hospitals.\n       County Welfare Directors Association of California.\n       Families USA.\n       Family Service America.\n       Human Rights Campaign Fund.\n       International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.\n       International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, \n     Machine and Furniture Workers.\n       International Union of United Auto Workers.\n       Legal Action Center.\n       Legal Assistance Resource Center of Connecticut.\n       Mennonite Central Committee, Washington Office.\n       National Association of Child Advocates.\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related \n     Institutions.\n       National Association of Counties.\n       National Association of Developmental Disabilities \n     Councils.\n       National Association of Homes and Services for Children.\n       National Association of People with AIDS.\n       National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems.\n       National Association of Public Hospitals.\n       National Association of School Psychologists.\n       National Association of Social Workers.\n       National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform.\n       National Coalition for the Homeless.\n       National Community Mental Health Care Council.\n       National Council of Senior Citizens.\n       National Easter Seals Society.\n       National Education Association.\n       National Family Planning and Reproductive Health \n     Association.\n       National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council.\n       National Mental Health Association.\n       National Treatment Consortium.\n       National Women's Law Center.\n       Neighbor to Neighbor.\n       NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby.\n       OMB Watch.\n       Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n       Protestant Health Alliance.\n       Service Employees International Union.\n       Spina Bifida Association of America.\n       The Alan Gutmacher Institute.\n       The American Geriatrics Society.\n       The Arc.\n       United Cerebral Palsy Associations.\n       West Virginia Developmental Disabilities Planning Council.\n       Women's Legal Defense Fund.\n       World Hunger Year.\n       YWCA of the U.S.A.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 October 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: As groups deeply concerned with the health \n     and well-being of America's children and families, we are \n     writing to express our fundamental opposition to the proposed \n     House and Senate reconciliation bills' Medicaid provisions.\n       The physical and mental health of America's children today \n     determines the social and economic health of the whole nation \n     in the future. Unfortunately, our children's health is \n     already at risk: we lag behind many other industrialized and \n     some developing nations on key indicators like infant \n     mortality, low birthweight, prenatal care, and immunizations. \n     The Medicaid proposals in the reconciliation bills will make \n     this situation far worse.\n       Already, nine and a half million U.S. children lack any \n     health insurance. Even though just as many parents as ever \n     are employed, children have been losing private, employer-\n     based insurance at a rate of 1 percent a year for more than a \n     decade. Medicaid has been making the difference, as its \n     increased coverage of children from working poor and near \n     poor families has kept the number of uninsured children from \n     skyrocketing.\n       But as the drop in private insurance continues, if Medicaid \n     shrinks instead of picking up some of the slack, children \n     will lead in paying the price. With a $182 billion Medicaid \n     cut, in the seventh year of the cut 6\\1/2\\ million children \n     would lose eligibility if the cut is translated into \n     eligibility reductions applied proportionately to all groups \n     (e.g., children, people with disabilities, the elderly, and \n     other adults). Then 19 million children would be uninsured in \n     2002. In fact, we fear that political conditions in state \n     capitals will lead children to bear a disproportionately \n     large share of any Medicaid cuts, so the number of uninsured \n     children would be even larger.\n       The United States can invest now--in immunizations, \n     preventive care and early treatment--or it can pay later in \n     more expensive remedial care and the high social and \n     productivity cost of children growing up unhealthy. We all \n     support fiscal responsibility in the federal budget, but to \n     balance the budget on the backs of children and destroy a \n     system of assured health care that is fundamental to the \n     health of millions of America's children and pregnant women \n     is unacceptable.\n           Sincerely,\n       Action for Families and Children (DE),\n       Adolescent Pregnancy ChildWatch, Los Angeles County (CA).\n       Advocates for Children and Youth, Inc.

We are enclosing a \n     copy for you. It outlines the protections children and \n     adolescents need in coverage, medically necessary and \n     preventive care, access to pediatric care, and immunizations \n     under a restructured Medicaid program.\n       These kinds of protections make good sense, because \n     children and adolescents represent over half of all \n     recipients of Medicaid. In fact, Medicaid pays for the health \n     care of one fourth of the nation's children and adolescents \n     as well as one third of the country's infants. Protecting \n     their health coverage, regardless of the state in which they \n     live, is a low cost but high return investment not only in \n     children's well-being today but also in the health and \n     productivity of at least one third of the nation's future \n     work force. Medicaid coverage for a child averages only one-\n     eighth the cost of coverage for a senior citizen.\n       We were heartened by the bipartisanship of the Senate \n     Finance Committee in addressing the need for children's \n     coverage. It would require all states under a restructured \n     Medicaid program to cover poor children and pregnant women. \n     We believe most members of Congress share in this conviction.\n       Your vote on Medicaid legislation this year may be the \n     single most important vote you will cast for the health of \n     our nation's children in this decade. Please vote to protect \n     America's most important resources: our children\n           Sincerely,\n     Joe M. Sanders, Jr., M.D.,\n       Executive Director, American Academy of Pediatrics.\n     Lawrence A. McAndrews,\n       President and CEO, National Association of Children's \n     Hospitals.\n\n       Enclosure.\n\nHow To Make Sure They're Still Smiling After Congress Gets Through With \n                               Medicaid.\n\n       It should go without saying that the key to having a \n     healthy America in the future is keeping children healthy \n     today.\n       Those of us who spend every moment of our working lives \n     keeping children healthy want to say it anyway.\n       Because at this moment, Congress is making drastic changes \n     to the Medicaid program, the most serious side effect of \n     which is that the health care needs of millions of children \n     will not be sufficiently guaranteed.\n\n\n             congress is taking the ``aid'' out of medicaid\n\n       The Congressional block grant proposals could leave it to \n     the States to determine who is eligible to receive benefits \n     and what kind of benefits will be offered.\n       Today's system at least guarantees specific preventive \n     health care benefits vital to the health and well-being of \n     many children from poor and working families.\n\n\n            congress must build in certain basic guarantees\n\n       Regardless of how Congress changes Medicaid overall, the \n     following protections should be included:\n       1. Children and adolescents from low-income families must \n     maintain guaranteed Medicaid coverage.\n       2.

It has been access to \n     critically needed health and related services and to \n     essential community-based long term services and supports--\n     provided through the Medicaid program--that have enabled \n     families to stay together and children and adults with \n     disabilities to live fuller and more productive lives in \n     their communities.\n       Specific CCD concerns relate to the following issues:\n       While the Senate proposal maintains a guarantee of health \n     care coverage for low income individuals with disabilities, \n     the House proposal completely eliminates the current \n     individual entitlement status of Medicaid for people with \n     disabilities.\n       Neither the Senate or House proposals would require states \n     to provide any specific services, except for childhood \n     immunizations.\n       Medicaid is no longer an entitlement and if there is no \n     requirement for the provision of a full range of services, \n     people with disabilities will lose access to critical health \n     and long term services, and supports. For people with \n     disabilities and serious health conditions, the lack of \n     access to health and health-related services and supports \n     will lead to an exacerbation of existing health problems and/\n     or disabilities, as well as the emergence of additional \n     health problems and secondary disabilities. For people with \n     long term care needs, the lack of Medicaid coverage will lead \n     to the loss of services and supports that help them to live \n     more independent lives in the community--in some cases \n     leading to homelessness and inappropriate \n     institutionalization. In addition, families of children with \n     disabilities will have their economic security undermined as \n     they try to pay for essential health and long term services. \n     It is important to remember--especially in a nation where the \n     number of individuals insured through their employer \n     continues to decrease--that for many people with \n     disabilities, Medicaid has been the only health care \n     coverage available.\n       While both proposals include state level ``set-asides'' for \n     certain vulnerable populations, i.e. families with pregnant \n     women and children, elderly individuals, and low income \n     people with disabilities under age 65, the proposed funding \n     formula for these set-asides would mean that states could not \n     continue to provide the full range of services and supports \n     that they now provide for children and adults with \n     disabilities.\n       States would be permitted--within these broad categories--\n     to determine what services to provide. According to the House \n     proposal, for each set-aside category, states \n     \n[[Page S15731]]\n\n     would have to spend 85 percent of the average percentage of \n     the state's Medicaid spending from FY 1992 through FY 1994 \n     devoted to mandatory services (what the state now must cover) \n     for people in that category. According to the Senate \n     proposal, for each set-aside category, states would have to \n     spend 85 percent of the state's Medicaid spending in FY 1995 \n     on mandatory services for people in that category.\n       This formula does not take into consideration spending on \n     optional services (what the state now chooses to cover). For \n     people with disabilities, this is a major blow. Current \n     optional services are the ones most likely to be of critical \n     importance to children and adults with disabilities and \n     dollars currently spent towards them would not be counted \n     towards the disability set-aside. Optional services include \n     the following: speech, physical, and occupational therapy, \n     psychological services, clinic services, prescription drugs, \n     dental services, eyeglasses, prosthetic devices, \n     rehabilitative services, home and community based services, \n     ICF-MR services, personal care services, respiratory care \n     services, and case management.\n       In addition to the loss of the personal entitlement to \n     specific required services and the weak funding formula, both \n     the House and Senate proposals eliminate consumer and quality \n     assurance protections and federal oversight in Medicaid \n     services or Medicaid funded facilities.\n       This includes elimination of federal nursing home and ICF/\n     MR regulations and even the minimum requirement that funds be \n     spent on active treatment for individuals in institutional \n     settings rather than merely custodial care. While Congress \n     continues to speak of the value of devolution and state's \n     rights, the CCD remembers when states could not or would not \n     provide needed services and supports for children and adults \n     with disabilities and their families. There are well \n     warranted and deep-seated fears in the disability community \n     that the loss of minimum federal standards coupled with \n     intensifying fiscal pressures will mean that some states \n     return to institution-based custodial care with the \n     consequent loss of individual freedom, rights, and quality of \n     life. The public policy and the original intent behind \n     federal oversight requirements currently attached to funding \n     for certain Medicaid long-term services must be remembered \n     and respected. The proposals also permit the states to move \n     more people into managed care plans while at the same time \n     removing current consumer protections related to managed \n     care.\n       The CCD strongly urges you to carefully reconsider how to \n     ``reform'' the Medicaid program and not to support the \n     passage of the provisions in the Medicaid Transformation Act \n     of 1995 as part of the budget reconciliation bill. We ask you \n     not to eviscerate a program that has allowed millions of \n     children and adults with disabilities to live fuller and more \n     productive lives in the community because they now have \n     access to both acute health care and needed long term \n     services and supports. The CCD does not support the status \n     quo on Medicaid. We do believe, however, that there are \n     changes to the program that can be made that will not \n     penalize those who now benefit from the program. These \n     include the elimination of the current incentives for \n     institutional care and the provision instead of incentives \n     for home and community-based long term services and \n     supports.\n       Finally, the CCD supports efforts to reduce the federal \n     deficit. However, the CCD strongly believes that it is \n     unfortunate that most of the programs on the table for \n     deficit reduction are those of importance to children and \n     adults with disabilities--such as Medicaid, children's \n     Supplemental Security Income, housing, social services, jobs, \n     and education. It is also unfortunate that Congress is \n     endeavoring to balance the budget using only 48% of the \n     federal budget and that 48% comes at the expense of programs \n     of critical importance to the lives of people with \n     disabilities.\n       The CCD asserts that the individual entitlement status of \n     Medicaid to a mandated set of benefits for children and \n     adults with disabilities must be maintained.\n       The CCD asserts that federal reimbursement should be \n     maintained for the full range of acute and long term services \n     and supports that are presently available, including optional \n     services which states now choose to provide through their \n     Medicaid programs. In addition, the states should be required \n     to continue to contribute at least their current share of \n     funds to finance Medicaid services and supports.\n       The CCD asserts that the federal requirements that states \n     meet certain standards of care and continue appropriate \n     quality assurance measures, as well as due process and other \n     consumer protections must be maintained.\n       The CCD asserts that managed care should be an ``option'' \n     and not the only avenue of services for people with \n     disabilities and that strong consumer protections, including \n     timely and appropriate access to all necessary services, \n     supports, and providers must be ensured.\n       The CCD asserts that current incentives for institutional \n     care built into the Medicaid program must be eliminated and \n     replaced with incentives for the provision of home and \n     community-based long term services and supports.\n\n\n       1995 ccd health and long-term services task force members\n\n       Adapted Physical Activity Council.\n       Alliance of Genetic Support Groups.\n       American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Academy of Neurology.\n       American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\n       American Association for Respiratory Care.\n       American Association of Children's Residential Center.\n       American Association of Spinal Cord Injury Psychologists & \n     Social Workers.\n       American Association of University Affiliated Programs.\n       American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.\n       American Foundation of the Blind.\n       American Horticultural Therapy Association.\n       American Network of Community Options & Resources.\n       American Occupational Therapy Association.\n       American Orthotic and Prosthetic Association.\n       American Physical Therapy Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       American Rehabilitation Association.\n       American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.\n       American Therapeutic Recreation Association.\n       Amputee Coalition of America.\n       Association of Academic Physiatrists.\n       Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs.\n       Autism National Committee.\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       Brain Injury Association.\n       Center on Disability and Health.\n       Children's Defense Fund.\n       Children & Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders.\n       Epilepsy Foundation of America.\n       International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation \n     Services.\n       Joseph P.

We fear that the proposed annual \n     increases in federal Medicaid funding for state programs will \n     be insufficient to meet the quality of care needed by \n     residents of long-term care facilities and subsequently \n     reduce access to services. Furthermore, the failure to meet \n     the resource needs anticipated in future years for these \n     services will negate the many advances made in this area as a \n     result of the enactment of the nursing home reform provisions \n     of OBRA '87.\n       We urge you to support the retention of federal oversight \n     of nursing home quality linked to a statutory provision \n     ensuring that adequate financial resources are made available \n     to meet prescribed levels of service. Although this linkage \n     can take several forms, the current formulation which backs \n     the nursing home reforms of OBRA '87 to a statutory direction \n     that payors of services (both federal and state) must ensure \n     the payment of adequate rates has proven a workable mechanism \n     and should not be repealed.\n       Federal nursing home reform standards, joined with existing \n     reimbursement standards have resulted in a steady improvement \n     in the quality of long-term care services. Without such a \n     linkage, this quality of care cannot be sustained. It is our \n     sincere desire to move forward with the quality of care \n     provided in nursing homes, and recognize that \n     \n[[Page S15732]]\n\n     the ability to do so is dependent upon the provision of \n     adequate financial resources.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Health Care Association (AHCA); American \n           Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHA); \n           Catholic Health Association; InterHealth; Horizon CMS; \n           Clinton Village Nursing Home, Oakland, California; \n           Qualicare Nursing Home, Detroit, MI; Westmoreland \n           Manor, Greensburg, PA; Services Employees International \n           Union (SEIU); American Federation of State, County, and \n           Municipal Employees (AFSCME); United Auto Workers \n           (UAW).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Counties (NACo) \n     strongly opposes the block granting of Medicaid and the loss \n     of a federal guarantee to benefits. Counties will be saddled \n     with significant cost shifts as a result of capping the \n     federal contribution to Medicaid.\n       We do not believe that states will find enough budgetary \n     efficiencies without reducing eligibility. The flexibility \n     given to states in the operation of the proposed \n     restructuring will trickle down to counties in the form of \n     flexibility to raise property taxes, cut other necessary \n     services or further reduce staff. In many states, counties \n     are required to serve individuals with no private or public \n     health insurance. The cuts to the program will have the \n     effect of increasing the costs of that state mandate.\n       Individuals will continue to have health needs, regardless \n     of the payor source. That is why we have always supported the \n     intergovernmental nature of the Medicaid program and the \n     assurance that there is some minimum level of coverage \n     guaranteed to eligible individuals, regardless of the state \n     in which they reside. While we support the increased use of \n     managed care and the further targeting of the \n     disproportionate share program, we believe that provisions in \n     the bill overall will harm many current recipients and the \n     counties which serve them.\n       If you have any questions about our position, please call \n     Tom Joseph, Associate Legislative Director, at 202/942-4230.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E.

However, a review of the GOP Medicaid Plan \n     indicates that it creates as much bureaucracy as it purports \n     to reduce. Some of the bureaucratic initiatives included in \n     the plan are important and necessary; however, the argument \n     that the GOP plan reduces bureaucracy just doesn't add up. \n     The following is a very conservative estimate of the total \n     number of new bureaucratic requirements created by the GOP \n     Medicaid plan:\n\nNumber of new requirements for each submitted Medicaid plan..........32\nNumber of States and District of Columbia (times)....................51\n                                                               ________\n\n    Total number of new requirements for all plans (=)............1,632\nAdditional committees, advisory panels, demonstration projects, etc. \n  (+)................................................................15\n                                                               ________\n\n    Total number of new bureaucratic requirements (=).............1,647\n\nNote: The total does not include drug provider pricing reports or other \nfederal and state drug-related reports.\n\n       Specifically, the proposal requires:\n\n\n                              Section 2100\n\n       Page 2--A state plan is required for reimbursement under \n     this bill.\n       The state plan must be approved by Secretary.\n\n\n                              Section 2101\n\n       Page 4--State must establish performance measures to \n     evaluate Medicaid plan.\n       Independent review required of state performance.\n       Page 5--Strategic objectives and performance goals in state \n     plan must be updated not later than every 3 years.\n\n\n                              Section 2102\n\n       Page 5--Extensive annual reports must be prepared by states \n     and submitted to Congress.\n\n\n                              Section 2103\n\n       Page 6--Every third year, each state must provide for an \n     independent review of the state Medicaid plan.\n\n\n                              Section 2104\n\n       Page 12--Each state Medicaid plan must provide a \n     description of the process under which the plan shall be \n     developed.\n\n\n                              Section 2105\n\n       Page 13--States required to provide public notice and \n     comment on their Medicaid plan.\n       Page 14--States are required to established advisory \n     committees for the establishment and the monitoring of the \n     Medicaid plan.\n\n\n                              Section 2106\n\n       Page 16--The Secretary shall provide for the establishment \n     of a Medicaid Task Force.\n       Page 16--An advisory group to the Medicaid Task Force shall \n     be created comprised of representatives from seventeen \n     national health care organizations.\n       Page 18--The task force shall report to Congress by April \n     1, 1997, with recommendations regarding objectives and goals \n     for states in the implementation of a Medicaid plan.\n       Page 19--Creation of an Agency for Health Care Policy and \n     Research.\n\n\n                              Section 2111\n\n       Page 19--Each state Medicaid plan must meet certain Federal \n     eligibility and benefit requirements.\n\n\n                              Section 2113\n\n       Page 31--States may set up premium and cost sharing \n     mechanism including co-payments and deductibles.\n\n\n                              Section 2114\n\n       Page 35--If a state contracts with a capitated health care \n     organization, the state must annually provide before the \n     beginning of the contract year--public notice and an \n     opportunity for public comment on amounts spent.\n\n\n                              section 2115\n\n       Page 37--Each state will develop its own criteria for \n     providing benefits and geographic coverage.\n\n\n                              section 2117\n\n       Page 40--Establishment of new income rules for \n     institutionalized spouse in determining eligibility for \n     Medicaid.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I congratulate the excellent statement and \narguments that have been made by my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida on the matter at hand. I believe we are about ready to come \ndown to the end of this and go on to the education amendment. But \nbefore we proceed, I wish to yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I apologize for being tied up in the Committee on \nBanking and Housing. I think as we look at this legislation people have \nto ask the fundamental question of who is being hurt by this proposal. \nNo one is suggesting we ought not to make reforms in these programs to \nmake them more efficient. But when 4.4 million children over the next 7 \nyears, as the estimates say, will lose the kind of protection that \nMedicaid has provided, that in my view goes too far. I think the \nAmerican people are responding to that. It is extreme. Clearly, \ncorrections need to be made, but this goes way beyond what most \nAmericans think is right and fair.\n  If we are going to invest in the future and promote growth, then \nthese young children who have no other safety net to protect them are \ngoing to be lost in that process. It is bad enough to place at risk 12 \nmillion Americans, 8 of whom are in effect adults with long-term care \nneeds. But for almost 5 million children who may lose Medicaid in this \ncountry who are born into these circumstances and will start their \nlives in this way, I think is wrong headed; I think it is extreme; I \nthink it is unfair; and I think it is dangerous for this country's \nfuture.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, after conversation with several Senators, \nincluding my distinguished colleague from Michigan, I think we have \ngeneral agreement now that we will, under the previous order, move to \nthe next order of business, which is the so-called education amendment.\n  The time under that amendment will be controlled by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who I think is ready to offer the \namendment. In the interest of conserving time--we have had a general \nagreement--and I ask unanimous consent at this time that instead of the \n2 hours, 1 hour each side, on the education amendment, that the time be \nreduced to 90 minutes or 45 minutes per side. I propose that as a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the majority does not object. We support \nthe 90-minute time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I hope at this time the Chair could \nrecognize the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2959\n\n(Purpose: To strike those portions of the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources reconciliation title that impose higher student loan costs on \n   students and families, by striking the 85 percent fee imposed on \ncolleges and universities based on their student loan volume, restoring \n  Federal interest payments on subsidized student loans during the 6-\n   month grace period in which graduates look for jobs, eliminating \ninterest rate increases on parent (PLUS) loans, and eliminating the 20 \npercent cap on direct lending, and to provide an offset by striking the \n          provisions that dilute the alternative minimum tax)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk shall report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] for himself, \n     Mr. Simon, Mr. Pell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mrs. Feinstein and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2959.\n       On page 1409, beginning with line 8, strike all through \n     page 1410, line 25.\n       On page 1421, beginning with line 15, strike all through \n     page 1423, line 13.\n       On page 1424, beginning with line 2, strike all through \n     page 1425, line 16.\n       Strike chapter 3 of subtitle B of title XII.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we are 2 days into this debate on the budget \nrecommendations of our Republican friends in the U.S. Senate. We had an \nopportunity yesterday to debate the issue of whether we are going to \ncut $270 billion out of the Medicare program in order to give tax \nbreaks for the wealthy individuals and corporations.\n  Today we had the debate about whether we are going to take $180 \nbillion away from the neediest children in our society and from the \nseniors of our country who have made such a difference to our Nation \nand put them at greater risk.\n  The third element in this whole Republican proposal is to deny, or \nmove towards denying, the sons and daughters of working families the \nopportunity to achieve the American dream, that is, in the area of \nhigher education.\n  The whole debate on higher education was a key debate in the 1960's \nbetween President Kennedy and President Nixon. During that time, this \ncountry went on record to provide help and assistance to the young \npeople of \n\n[[Page S15734]]\n\nthis country. We reserved three-quarters of a Federal assistance \nprogram for grant money and one-quarter for loans. The programs built \non the enormous success that this country saw at the end of World War \nII. We expended, in today's dollars, $9 billion on education assistance \nto those who came back and fought in World War II.\n  It is an interesting fact, Mr. President, that the analysis of this \nprogram proved it was a remarkable success. In fact, every dollar was \nactually given in grants--not loans--and returned some $8 to the \nFederal Treasury.\n  This Nation was committed to higher education. This Nation was \ncommitted to the young people of this country, to their hopes and \ndreams for a future America. But under the Republican proposal, \neffectively what they are saying is, ``We're going to take some $10 \nbillion away, away from the students of this country, and make it more \ncomplex, more difficult, and in many instances deny the dreams of those \nyoung people.'' For what reason? For the reason of providing the tax \nbreaks for wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals.\n  That is what this is about, Mr. President. That is what this is \nabout. The amendment that we have offered today responds to that \nprovision of the Republican bill.\n  First of all, the provision that institutes a new student loan tax \nthat requires colleges and universities to pay the Federal Government \nan annual fee of .85 percent of their student loan volume is struck. In \naddition, the amendment strikes provisions that eliminate the interest-\nfree grace period, a concept that has been supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats since the student loan program began.\n  We also strike the increased interest rates on parents in the PLUS \nloans, which are necessary loans for parents that do not have great \nassets. Striking the increased interest rates will help those parents \ncontinue to take advantage of the PLUS loans. Finally, the amendment \nstrikes provisions capping the direct loan program at 20 percent of \nloan volume. The program is now at almost 40 percent participation.\n  The amendment takes us back to the existing law which will permit any \ncollege in this country, in any State, to choose to participate in the \ndirect loan program. Not under the Republican program.\n  What we are saying is: If colleges, their boards of trustees, \nparents, faculty, teachers, young people want to move toward a direct \nloan program, that choice ought to be available at the local level. The \nRepublican proposal denies colleges and universities and their \ncommunities the right to choose a loan program that works for them. \nThat right to choose was a bipartisan agreement that was made in 1993. \nI believe that denying colleges and universities the right to choose is \nunwise and unfair.\n  And, Mr. President, we offer a full offset for this change to the \nRepublican proposal, so that our amendment is budget neutral. We will \nreturn help and assistance to the students of our country by striking \nthe provisions of the Finance Committee's reconciliation bill that \ndilute the alternative minimum tax on corporations.\n  The alternative minimum tax on corporations sets a minimum corporate \ntax liability. It was passed in 1986 because many corporations were \nescaping any kind of tax payment. And you know what the Republicans \ndid? They relaxed it to benefit corporations by $9.2 billion. And so \nthe Senate of the United States will have a chance today to say, ``Do \nwe want to relax the alternative minimum tax for corporations by $9.2 \nbillion or do we want to provide the help and the assistance for the \nsons and daughters of working families?\"\n  We have effectively voted on this amendment before, and we are going \nto see if the whiplash of the Republican leadership is going to march--\nforce the Republicans to march in lock step to reject what they have \nsupported in May: a reduction in the cuts to students.\n  We are taking the changes in the alternative minimum tax that \nprovided easier payments for the largest corporations of this country \nand using them for the deficit reduction requirements for education and \nleaving these programs alone. That is what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we have to make the case, or should \nhave to make the case, that education is central to the American dream. \nBut under the Republican proposal, they change that dream into a \nnightmare. The idea that the Republican proposal is a shared sacrifice \nis malarkey.\n  They say, ``There's a shared sacrifice in our Human Resources \nCommittee's proposal.'' The shared sacrifice is two-thirds--two-thirds \nof the burden is going to be on the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies. Half of them earn below $20,000 a year; two-thirds of them \nbelow $40,000. It is interesting to note that these are the same people \nwhose taxes are going to be increased under the EITC. These are the \nsame people that are going to have to provide additional help and \nassistance to their parents to increase the copayments and the \ndeductibles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Again, these are the same people whose taxes will be increased under \nEITC, as Senator Moynihan clearly pointed out when he put the chart \nbefore the U.S. Senate and the American people. We are already going to \nhave to pay increased payments under this bill.\n  What do our Republican friends have against working families? They \nraised the EITC that goes to the low-income, working families. And now \nthey are denying the opportunity for education for many of the sons and \ndaughters.\n  Mr. President, I want to just point out that a $250 increase in the \ncost of college will cause roughly 20,000 fewer students from working \nfamilies to enroll. Because there are almost $1,000 in additional costs \nto working families just in the grace-period provisions of the \nRepublican proposal, 80,000 young people in this country will not go to \ncollege because of the increased burden that their families will not be \nable to pay.\n  Now, there will be a time when someone says, ``This is really a very \nminor slap on the wrist for these families.'' They will point out, \n``Look, you are only talking about $900 for the grace period, only $500 \nmore under the PLUS loans, and only $25 under the institutional \nloans.''\n  Mr. President, that all adds up. In my State of Massachusetts, \nworking families will have to pay more than $200 million in additional \ncosts. That is wrong. It is a transfer of wealth from working families \nto the already wealthy individuals in our country. Therefore, I hope \nthat this amendment is agreed to. It is a responsible amendment. We \nhave debated this issue many times and we have said that we believe \nthat education is fundamental to the future of America and young \nAmericans. Why should we dampen, and in many instances extinguish, the \nhopes and dreams of the sons and daughters of working families?\n  That is the choice here. We can strike the alternative minimum tax or \nwe can dock the sons and daughters of working families.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island who has been a \nformer chairman of the Education Committee and who has made such a mark \nin education policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I am very, very \npleased to be an original cosponsor of this critically important \namendment. What we are talking about here is a capital investment in \nthe future of our Nation. Passage of this amendment would accomplish \nthe objective of taking students and their families, not completely, \nbut partially out of harm's way.\n  First, it would strike the first-time-ever fee on institutions of \nhigher education. This fee of .85 percent, based on the total amount of \nmoney borrowed by students and parents at every institution of \nlearning, is an unprecedented move and a cost that would undoubtedly be \npassed along to students in higher fees. Once established, I am afraid \nthat it will increase over time.\n  Second, this amendment would strike the increase on the interest rate \nin the Parent Loan Program. Some argue that the increase would be so \nsmall as to be insignificant. I disagree.\n  A parent who borrows for 4 years of college at a typical 4-year \npublic university will borrow a total of $27,000. If those loans are \nrepaid over 10 years, the increase in the interest rate will mean those \nparents will have to pay an \n\n[[Page S15735]]\n\nadditional $1,400. If they take advantage of extended repayment, the \ncost could well increase to $2,800. Neither of these figures is \ninsignificant.\n  A parent who borrows at a private university will borrow more than \n$66,000. Repayment over a 10-year period will mean an additional $3,400 \nthat parents will have to pay because of the increase in the interest \nrate. If repayment is extended over 20 years, the additional cost to \nthe parent will be nearly $6,900, or $7,000.\n  Third, the amendment would strike the 20-percent cap on the Direct \nLoan Program. This would leave alone the direct loan conference \nagreement of 2 years ago. It would mean that we would continue to have \na spirited competition between direct and regular loans, a competition \nthat has brought students improved services, better rates and more \nbenefits.\n  And fourth, the amendment would strike the elimination of the \ninterest subsidy during the grace period. This is of vital interest to \nstudents who have just completed their education and are out looking \nfor a job. Proponents argue that the cost of eliminating the grace \nperiod will be small, but to a student who is just beginning a job, \nevery dollar counts.\n  In terms of the package, I point out that while one change might \nappear small, the combined impact of the four changes addressed in this \namendment is considerable. Students and their families will feel the \nimpact of these changes. Instead of taking them out of harm's way, it \nwill place them directly in the line of fire. We can avoid that outcome \nif we adopt this amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting \nfor it. If ever there was a capital investment amendment to improve the \ncompetitive ability of our Nation, this is it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to our friend and colleague and former \nmember of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Jeff Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, I am in strong support of the Kennedy-Simon student \nloan amendment. It does deal with a very serious problem that I see in \nthis budget reconciliation bill.\n  Very simply, what we are talking about here is $10.8 billion that is \nto be reduced or eliminated out of the funds that will otherwise be \nmade available to students over the next 7 years, students who want to \ngo to college and who do not have the financial means with which to go \nto college.\n  That $10.8 billion is presented by the Republican majority as being \nfairly shared. We are going to try to charge some of that to the loan \nindustry and some of that to the students and families themselves.\n  I have a chart here, Mr. President, which I think makes the point \npretty clearly that the cost, that $10.8 billion, is not fairly shared. \nWhat this chart shows is that something like 30 percent of this entire \n$10.8 billion, $3.1 billion specifically, will be additional costs to \nthe loan industry; 70 percent of the entire cut in education is costs \nto students and their families. That is $7.6 billion over 7 years.\n  Let me talk about some of the specific things that we are doing to \nincrease the costs to students and families during that time, because \nsome of it is precedent setting and, in my view, it is a very bad \nprecedent and reflects very badly on our country.\n  One which has been referred to by both the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Rhode Island is that we are starting, for the \nfirst time, to charge interest on the loan from the day of graduation. \nThat may seem like a small item and, in some larger global sense, it \nmay be, but it signifies something about what the Congress is about in \nthis reconciliation bill.\n  Always before, the idea was when students graduated from college, we \nwould give them a 6-month grace period in which to get a job, in which \nto begin to receive regular monthly paychecks, before they were charged \nthe interest on that loan.\n  But we are eliminating that in this legislation. Here the idea is \nthat we can pick up $2.7 billion over the next 7 years by eliminating \nthat grace period and starting to charge that interest from the day \nthey graduate. I think that is a shortsighted, mistaken and wrong \npolicy decision.\n  A second item that I particularly want to focus on that I think is \nperhaps even a worse precedent is this whole idea of charging a tax to \nschools that want to make a student loan. In my State, the schools that \nare making Federal student loans are generally schools that are trying \nto provide education to moderate-income families and students. They \nwould be charged, under this bill, .85 percent, nearly 1 percent of the \nvalue of the loan, at the time the loan is originated.\n  When I bought a house, I remember that they charged me a loan \norigination fee. You always shop around to see where can you get the \nfewest points, where will they charge you the fewest points for your \nhouse loan. The Government has never charged points for student loans \nbefore. We have never charged origination fees when we made a loan to a \nstudent to go to school.\n  This year, for the first time, we will begin to charge an origination \nfee. Now we charge it to the institution. The school itself has to pay \nthe student loan and, of course, that builds in an incentive for the \nschool perhaps to look for more financially capable students. They do \nnot have that cost. They do not need to worry about origination fees if \nthey get students that, in fact, do not need student loans. I think it \nis a very bad precedent. I think when you start charging an origination \nfee for a student loan, it is a sad day in our Nation's history. That \nis exactly what we see proposed in this bill. That would, supposedly, \nresult in the Federal Government picking up $2 billion over the next 7 \nyears.\n\n  We are increasing the interest rates on family interest. That is \nanother $1.5 billion. And then by capping the amount of direct student \nloans that can be made, presumably we are going to pick up $1.4 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would strike the most onerous \nprovisions of the reconciliation bill by striking the provisions that \nincrease the costs of loans for students and their families.\n  The Republicans propose that almost 70 percent of the $10.8 billion \ncuts in the current student loan system be shouldered by students and \ntheir families. Only $3.1 billion is borne by the loan industry and \n$100 million by cost sharing with States. The overwhelming majority of \nthese cuts, shown in red on this chart, would be shouldered by the very \nstudents the program is intended to help. Only 30 percent of the cuts, \nshown in yellow on this chart, are imposed on banks, guaranty agencies, \nand secondary markets in the student loan industry. That means that \ndirectly or indirectly the wrong people suffer. It will cost needy \nstudents more to borrow.\n  The Kennedy-Simon amendment fixes that. It strikes all portions of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee reconciliation title that \nimpose higher student loan costs on students and their families. Let me \nshow you how.\n  First, the amendment would restore a 6-month interest-free grace \nperiod following graduation. That means that interest would not accrue \non student loans for 6 months after graduation giving students time to \nlook for a job. This amendment strikes the Republican cut of $2.7 \nbillion for the interest-free grace period. The amendment would thereby \nsave an individual student between $700 and $2,500, depending on the \nlength of study and amount borrowed.\n  Next, the amendment eliminates a new .85-percent fee on new student \nloans. It strikes the $2 billion Republicans would save by introducing \nthis new loan fee. The Republican plan would force colleges either to \nabsorb this new tax on student loans or pass it on as increased \nstudents fees. This would have meant about $25 every year for about 14 \nmillion students with new loans. It would have effectively penalized \nschools for accepting needy students.\n  Next, the amendment eliminates the rise in interest rates families \npay for student loans. Without this amendment, the increase in PLUS \nloan interest rates could amount to up to $5,000 a family. This \nincrease would be paid by the very families who lack other assets \n\n[[Page S15736]]\n\nagainst which to borrow, and must therefore borrow most heavily from \nthis program to afford 4 years of college.\n  Finally, the amendment eliminates the 20 percent cap on the direct \nloan program. The program is now at 30 to 40 percent and has made the \nstudent loan process much quicker and more efficient for participating \nstudents.\n  This amendment is good policy for the Nation. In New Mexico, it will \nbe absolutely essential. It will enable a better education for some \nstudents who otherwise would not go to college. Colleges in New Mexico \nhave volunteered my office the numbers of their students on Federal \nfinancial aid because, they tell me, they know is vital for the \nstudents they serve. They say three New Mexico colleges alone have well \nover 20,000 students receiving some form of Federal financial aid. At \nthe University of New Mexico, there are about 10,000; at New Mexico \nState University, about 9,000; at Western New Mexico University, about \n1,400. Other colleges have more.\n  More important, over 70 percent of all financial aid in most New \nMexico colleges is Federal. In some it is almost the only source \navailable. In New Mexico Highlands University and New Mexico Junior \nCollege in Hobbs there is very little financial assistance that is not \nFederal. These schools serve students to whom financial assistance is \nabsolutely essential, whose families cannot sustain higher levels of \npersonal debt. Other States may be richer than New Mexico. But in my \nhome State, this amendment would make the difference in reducing the \nlevel of student and family debt to a point that working families feel \nit is within their reach. This would enable some students to go to \ncollege who otherwise might not go. Graduating from college is no \nlonger a ticket to the good life; it has become a mandatory \nqualification for most entry-level professional jobs.\n  This bill strikes at the heart of the Federal Government's commitment \nto education; the Kennedy-Simon amendment renews that commitment to \nmaking college accessible to qualified students regardless of \nprivilege. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy-Simon \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself such time as I may need to make a brief \nstatement or two regarding this amendment. And then I will yield time \nto another Member on our side.\n  The chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and I \nwere chatting here on the floor, and the Senator from Kansas indicated \nto me a couple of things. Members on both sides are probably aware that \nthere are discussions going on now that may directly address much of \nthe content of this amendment in a way that would be very similar to \nwhat is being proposed here. Those discussions are going on as we \ndebate this issue.\n  There is likely to be, from our side, an amendment which would be \nresponsive to some of these concerns, many of which were raised in the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee--Members on both sides of the \naisle--during the debate.\n  For the students who are watching today and listening to our \nproceedings, or their families, I want to point out a couple of factors \nwhich, once again, the chairman of the committee reminded me of, which \nwe discussed during our deliberations on this.\n  First of all, nothing in the reconciliation package will, in any way, \naffect the volume of loans available to students. In other words, the \ngrowth rate of student loan volume will continue unabated under the \nRepublican package. Students who are hoping to get loans will have \nthose loans available. We are not contracting the size of the loan \nvolume. I believe it will be in the vicinity of $26 billion annually \nunder this package.\n  In addition, I point out concerns that have been raised hear about \nthe origination fee that is part of this package. There was an \namendment, as the President will remember, brought before the committee \nthat would have eliminated the origination fee. It was opposed and \nvoted down. I believe every Member of the minority party voted against \nan amendment that would have eliminated those origination fees.\n  I want to, once again, point out just for clarification, insofar as \nthe grace period issue is concerned, we are not asking students to \nbegin paying back their loans upon completion of school. Our changes \nonly go to the issues of when interest begins to accrue. Students will \nstill have 6 months after they graduate before they are required to \nbegin paying their student loans. Indeed, as I think everybody is \naware, the overriding goal we have here in this reconciliation package, \nand more broadly in our budget, is to bring the budget into balance.\n  Mr. President, when we do that, we not only will bring down interest \nrates for the Federal Government, we also will bring down interest \nrates across America for everybody. When those interest rates come \ndown, they will not just come down insofar as what we pay on the bills, \nit will be for what people pay on home mortgages and with respect to \nstudent loans. As those student loan interest rates come down, they \nwill, I believe far more effectively, help students to finance their \ncollege education than anything we are doing here today, because a much \nlower student loan rate is going to mean far less total dollars spent \nby students than anything else we could do here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I also note that in our finance package here in the reconciliation \nbill, there also is a student loan deduction available to people who \nare paying student loans, for middle-income families. That, too, will \nhelp to offset the burdens of college education that middle-class \nfamilies in this country pay.\n  So we are trying to be responsive. We are not reducing the volume \nrate. We are not requiring students to begin paying their loans \nearlier; and, most important, we are trying to balance the budget so \nthat interest rates on student loans will be so low that they will help \nstudents in the kind of ways students want most, which is a total \namount of money being paid back, lower than what they have to pay back \ntoday.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is the first time I have come to the \nfloor to comment on this reconciliation package. I guess the first \nthing we tried to look at with regard to this is the tax cuts and also \nthe cuts in spending. One has to look at it from the standpoint of how \nit affects home. What does it do for my home State of Montana? There \nare some things not in this package that I think, if you want to do \nsomething about a farm bill, give farmers accelerated depreciation and \nincome averaging, we would not need a farm bill, if you want to be fair \nwith agriculture because of the conditions under which they work.\n  But in this package, I congratulate Senator Domenici, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and, of course, the Finance Committee, for their \nexceptionally hard work to try to balance and make it fair. Tax relief \nfor families is the biggest part of this tax relief provision. It goes \nto families. Now, we hear talk on the other side of the aisle this \nmorning about a cutback in programs. Why do you think there are tax \ncuts in here? Because it allows families to make the decision on how \nthey want to spend their money, not how it is spent here in Washington, \nDC; it is for them who live in the hinterlands. There is tax relief for \nsenior citizens and small businesses.\n  When you look at my State of Montana, that is going right down the \nline where we need a little relief. And we close some loopholes for \ncorporations. So they did exceptional work on this. We have heard about \nthe tax break for the rich, corporate welfare, and all of this, those \nloopholes for the corporations. They have been closed. Frankly, I have \nnot seen a lot of that. This tax package, as a total revenue cost over \na 7-year budget, is around $245 billion. However the cost is reduced by \nelimination of those corporate loopholes, which saves the Government a \nlittle over $21 billion over 7 years. That net cost makes us back to \n$224 billion. We can get bogged down in figures. I know how easy that \nis.\n\n[[Page S15737]]\n\n  We have to keep reminding America through this whole debate that the \nsingle largest revenue item in this tax package is a $500 per child tax \ncredit, which has a cost of about $142 billion. What is wrong with \nletting families hang on to their money? They earned it. Sure, there \nare some Government services they want to pay for and it takes some \namount of dollars to provide services that only Government can offer. \nWe know that. But when they start making the decisions for all parts of \nyour life, then that is where the real debate starts. Nobody is \ndebating public safety here or doing some of the things for the society \nthat has to be done.\n  This package provides for an adoption credit; a marriage penalty \ncredit; deductions for student loan interest, for the first time; \ndeductions for contributions to individual retirement accounts. These \ntax breaks--about $28 billion, or so--are 13 percent of the total cost \nof the package, and are targeted for folks who are middle-income folks. \nThere is $40 billion in capital gains tax reform. There, again, we hear \n``cut taxes for the rich.'' Capital gains tax is a voluntary tax.\n  You do not have to pay capital gains tax. You do not have to pay it \nbecause you do not have to sell.\n  The real wealthy folks can get around it because they know how to \nmove those things around with tax laws and different laws.\n  On capital gains, this helps even the homeowner whenever he sells his \nhome and wants to retire. Everybody whose assets appreciate, pays \ncapital gains taxes--that is, if they sell.\n  So it is not for the rich. It is for all Americans that are smart \nenough to get a hold of some assets that appreciate, and they pay taxes \non them.\n  We visited with a very knowledgeable man from Kansas and he said over \n$7 trillion of assets would flow onto the market if the capital gains \nwas cut in half. Imagine what that would do to the American economy. \nImagine what that would do to the tax coffers of the Treasury of the \nU.S. Government, so that maybe we can do some things that we want to \ndo.\n  We have to think a little bit--just think a little bit. Capital gains \nis basically a voluntary tax. Just a voluntary tax.\n  Another provision in this package, the estate and inheritance tax \nprovision on that reform. Folks who leave estates--those estates have \nbeen taxed and taxed and taxed and the interest they make on that has \nbeen taxed and taxed and taxed and then when they die they are taxed \nagain.\n  I think of all of the ranches and farms in the State of Montana where \nmoney had to be spent for insurance policies to protect themselves so \nthey could pay the inheritance taxes so the farm or the ranch can stay \nin the family.\n  Needless, needless expense. They paid taxes on that land, and \nproperty tax, income taxes, investment taxes, and then when the key \nfamily member passes on there is another estate tax that has to be paid \nagain.\n  Hard-working families--the only thing they have on these farms and \nranches is just the land. They have not made a lot of money. They do \nnot have a lot of cash. They just do not have a lot of cash.\n  In effect, these death taxes are robbing American communities of a \ntradition of values that local family-run businesses provide. I \nwholeheartedly support that provision. If you feel for a young man that \nis trying to start off in the agriculture business, my goodness, do not \nstrap him with a debt that he cannot work his way out of.\n  If you think there is not some disparity there, I will give you just \na little idea on what it is like to farm. I was walking down the \ngrocery store aisle the other day and found out that Wheaties cost \n$3.46 a pound. Do you realize that we are only getting $2.50 a bushel \nfor a bushel of wheat that has 60 pounds of wheat in it?\n  They wonder--it is a little bit of disparity here. You want that man \nto keep on producing food and fiber so the American people can eat \ncheaper than any other society on the face of this Earth.\n  A while ago I listened to my distinguished colleague from the other \nside of the aisle challenge the estate tax credit. Their argument is \nfocused on the unfairness of giving a tax break to any estate that \nexceeds $5 million.\n  I have asserted the top one half of the top 1 percent of the American \npeople fall into that category. They should not be getting a tax break \nin the first place. I agree.\n  I must depart from my distinguished colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle for two reasons. I believe any death tax is on its face \nunfair. If we are going to keep these small businesses, these farms and \nranches in the families of traditional values, we have to take a look \nat what we do in the taxing situation.\n  Taxes that cost jobs--the alternative minimum tax, we did not get all \nthat we needed in this, but if there is one place that creates jobs and \nopportunities, it is here. When you tax small corporations, small \nfamily businesses, make sure that they keep two sets of books to see \nwhich one is a higher set of taxes than the others, that takes away \nfrom this business of the ability to expand, to expand their business.\n  Under the committee's package, the method of depreciation is \nconformed but the useful life is not.\n  One major problem with this is that business will start to have to \nsuffer the unnecessary costs of maintaining two sets of books on each \ndepreciable assets of the performing two tax computations to determine \nthat they do not fall into the alternative minimum tax bucket.\n  Two sets of books--needless, costly. We could be investing that in a \nbigger payroll. That is what creates jobs.\n  In conclusion, we should talk about some good things that are in this \npackage. Talk about the good things that people are going to say we \nwill keep more money in your neighborhood, for your quality of life, \nthat you can make the decisions on how you want to spend the money and \nnot be looking toward this 13 square miles of logic-free environment or \nanswers that sometimes just do not work in our local communities.\n  That is what this debate is all about--where the power is, the power \nof the purse string. With the tax credits and some reform we will do \nthe responsible thing and not the irresponsible thing of saying, \n``Let's wait until next year,'' or ``Let's accept the status quo,'' and \nwe know what the results of that are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the education \namendment offered by my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  I glanced through this two-volume reconciliation thing this morning \nand I found all kinds of things. Here is a provision for the Hetch \nHetchy Dam. I have no idea where the Hetch Hetchy Dam is or what it \nmeans.\n  It has very little significance for the future of our country, but \nwhat does have significance for the future of our country is what we \nare doing in the field of education.\n  The Presiding Officer may be too young to remember the GI bill after \nWorld War II. There was a fight on the GI bill. The American Legion, to \ntheir credit, said ``Let's have educational benefits as part of the GI \nbill.'' The other veterans organizations said, ``Let's have a cash \nbonus for veterans.''\n  Fortunately, the American Legion prevailed and we put the money into \neducation. We lifted this Nation.\n  Now we face the same choice. Do we have a tax loophole here that is \nbeing put in, which the Kennedy amendment says, ``Let's not put that \ntax loophole in,'' or do we put the money in education? The Kennedy \namendment says put the money in education.\n  I want to address specifically the question of direct lending. Let me \nsay to my colleagues on the Republican side, this is not a Democratic \nidea. The first person that suggested it is Congressman Tom Petri, a \nRepublican from Wisconsin.\n  My cosponsor of this legislation in the U.S. Senate was Senator David \nDurenberger, a Republican from Minnesota. When he was approached and \nsaid we ought to have the free enterprise system work and have the \nbanks and the guaranty agencies profit from it, Dave Durenberger said, \n``This is not free enterprise; it is a free lunch.'' That is the \nreality.\n  There is not a school in the country, not a college or university, \nthat is on direct lending, that wants to go back to the old system.\n\n[[Page S15738]]\n\n  Colleges and universities like it, the students like it, taxpayers \nlike it for reasons I will get into in a minute, and for my colleagues \non the Republican side who say we like to do away with paperwork, I \nhave heard speeches on both sides on that, every college and university \nsays this does away with all kinds of paperwork. This is a change not \njust for a speech but for a vote. If the colleges and universities like \nit, if the students like it, if it is good for the taxpayers, why are \nwe limiting direct lending? My friends, the only beneficiaries are the \nbanks and the guaranty agencies and their lobbyists. And we have just \nseen in the newspapers that the banks have record-breaking profits. If \nwe want to have a bank subsidy bill, let us call it that, but do not \nput the name of ``student assistance'' on it. Let us not play games.\n\n  Who are these people who are fighting direct lending? The Student \nLoan Marketing Association, Sallie Mae, created by the U.S. Congress. \nThe salary of the chief executive officer of Sallie Mae, 3 years ago \nwas $2.1 million. All they do is student aid, guaranteed by the U.S. \nGovernment. The guaranty agency, one in Indiana, USA--the chief \nexecutive officer earns $627,000. We pay the President of the United \nStates $200,000. And that one guaranty agency is spending $750,000 on \nlobbying on this.\n  We face a choice. Are we going to help students and parents and \ntaxpayers or the banks and the guaranty agencies? It is very, very \nclear. This is brazen, Mr. President, brazen. We have to help people.\n  Indiana University says there is 90 percent less paperwork with \ndirect lending, 25 percent fewer errors, easier adjustments, faster \ndisbursement. I have heard a lot of talk about unfunded mandates around \nhere. This is an unfunded mandate you are imposing on colleges and \nuniversities. Iowa State University, for example, testified they have \nbeen able to take four people who used to work in student loans because \nof the all the paperwork and everything, and have them do other things. \nAnd they have been able to cancel some of their computers that they \nhave, for $400 a month.\n  If I may have 1 more minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. It is very, very clear what the public interest is. \n``Banks Cash In, Taxpayers Lose on Loan Programs,'' USA Today says.\n  Government employees--we hear a lot, let us simplify. This is what we \nare told: 500 employees direct lending; 2,500 Government employees. \nThat does count the guaranty agencies.\n  Then here is what CBO says about the 20 percent cap that is in here \nright now: Under current law, direct lending will save us, over 7 \nyears, $4.6 billion.\n  What we did on the budget resolution, we said count administrative \ncosts for direct lending but not for the old program. So, because of \nthe phoniness--and even the Chicago Tribune says they are cooking the \nbooks here--you theoretically save $600 million. The real saving is a \nsaving of $4.6 billion.\n  If we are interested in helping students, colleges and taxpayers, we \nought to be voting for the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe that it is important constantly, \nduring the course of this debate, to return to fundamental principles, \nto the broad policy goals which we as a nation ought to seek for the \nbetterment of our society and for a brighter future for those who \nfollow us. In returning to those fundamental principles, there is no \nbetter place to start than with this fundamental principle enunciated \nby Thomas Jefferson almost two centuries ago. And I quote our third \nPresident:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of Government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  The staff notes I have here with me this morning have, at one place, \nthe notation ``they,'' that is to say the opponents to this resolution, \n``do not wish to balance the budget.'' But I do not believe that to be \ntrue. I have not heard any argument at any time this year from a Member \nof this body that has not included in it at least lip service to the \nconcept of a balanced budget. But, of course, there are three ways to \nthat goal, or at least three kinds of oratory which give lip service to \nThomas Jefferson's principle.\n  The first is to state the principle but always to have an objection \nto any course of action which will make that principle a reality. And \nthat is the common approach of those who oppose the resolution we have \nbefore us today.\n  The second way, a way that seems to have very little support on the \nother side of the aisle but clearly actuates the President of the \nUnited States, is to define the problem out of existence. I will come \nback to that in just a moment.\n  The third way, the hard way, the difficult way, is actually to make \nbasic changes in our laws and in our spending policies, that will in \nfact lead us to a balanced budget.\n  To return for a moment to the President's approach of defining it out \nof existence, I would also like to quote him. Just a little more than 2 \nshort years ago, the President of the United States said:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office was normally more \n     conservative about what was going to happen and closer to \n     right than previous Presidents have been. I did this so we \n     could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers. I \n     did this so that no one could say I was estimating my way out \n     of this difficulty. I did this because, if we can agree \n     together on the most prudent revenues we are likely to get if \n     the recovery stays and we do the right things economically, \n     then it will turn out better for the American people than we \n     said. In the last 12 years, because there were differences \n     over the revenue estimates, you and I know that both parties \n     were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. This is \n     tightening the reins on Democrats as well as Republicans. Let \n     us at least argue about the same set of numbers so the \n     American people will think we are shooting straight with \n     them.\n\n  In those eloquent words the President said let us all agree that we \nwill use the projections of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  That was then. This is now. Earlier this year the President presented \na budget to us which never, in his own terms, included a deficit of \nless than $200 billion. Later, when it turned out that Republicans were \nserious about balancing the budget, the President said, ``Me, too. I \ncan do it. And I can do it without pain. I can do it without changing \nany major policies in the United States. I can do it by defining it out \nof existence. I will abandon my allegiance to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I will simply estimate that interest rates and inflation will \nbe lower and revenues will be higher, and without any major changes at \nall we can balance the budget.'' So he defined the problem out of \nexistence.\n  The day before yesterday in this body we had a straw poll, as it \nwere, on whether or not the President's approach was acceptable. And it \nlost by a vote of 96 to nothing. The other side of this aisle, quite \nproperly, rejects that approach. But it also rejects the approach of \nany significant changes. So, at this moment, nominally we are debating \neducation. They do not want any changes. Previously we were debating \nMedicaid. They do not want any changes. Before that we debated \nMedicare. They do not want any changes. In fact, you can go down a \nlitany of spending programs, and they do not want any changes. But they \nwould like to have a balanced budget. It just is not a high enough \npriority.\n\n  Mr. President, to return to the Congressional Budget Office, we now \nknow that we are not simply engaging in a game of whether or not it is \nappropriate to balance the budget. We know what the positive results of \nbalancing that budget will be. The Congressional Budget Office says \nthat if we actually change the laws appropriately interest rates will \nbe sufficiently lower and economic growth will be sufficiently higher \nso that the Federal Treasury will be $170 billion better off by the \ntime the budget comes into balance in the year 2002. That is only the \nFederal Treasury. That is not the other hundreds of billions of dollars \nwhich will be in the \n\n[[Page S15739]]\n\npockets of the American people because they have better jobs and higher \nwages.\n  That is what this exercise is all about, a better break for America.\n  So what are we proposing to do? We are proposing to say to the \nAmericans, if we go through this process, if we make these changes, we \nare going to give that $170 billion back to you in lower taxes on \nworking Americans, and a little more besides because we have been \nresponsible enough to balance the budget.\n  So when we get right down to it, Mr. President, that is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  First principles--the moral duty not to load our spending on the \nbacks of our children and grandchildren; and the economic benefit--an \neconomic benefit I suspect Thomas Jefferson did not suspect--of acting \nin a responsible fashion, both because we will create more opportunity \nfor our people and because we can appropriately lower our taxes.\n  That is the difference between the two parties. That is the \ndifference between a yes and a no vote on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 20 minutes \nand 54 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I just could not help but hearing my friend from Washington saying we \nhave a moral obligation. Yes. We do. We have a lot of moral obligations \nto our children and to the future. One of the most important \nobligations is to ensure that future generations have the ability to \nget a decent, sound education so that they can raise their families and \nso that they can compete in the world marketplace. That also is a moral \nobligation.\n  What this reconciliation bill does is pull the rug out from under \nthat obligation that we have for future generations.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot of talk about the tax breaks that are in \nthis bill. Those of us on this side have been talking about the $245 \nbillion tax breaks for the wealthy that will come at the expense of the \nelderly and Medicare cuts. There is an $11 billion cut in student aid \nin this bill, the largest cut in student aid in our history. But what \nwe are not hearing about are the hidden taxes that the Republicans have \nin this bill, the ``stealth taxes.'' This is what they are hitting \nstudents with to pay for those tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  This chart illustrates this right here. This budget adds about $700 \nto $2,500 of debt per student by eliminating the interest subsidy \nduring the grace period. That is a hidden tax on our students. It also \nincludes up to $5,000 in additional expense for families who use the \nPLUS program by raising their interest rates. It is another tax on \nstudents and their families. It imposes a direct Federal tax of .85 \npercent on colleges and universities participating in the student loan \nprograms; a direct tax on colleges. Of course, they are going to have \nto pass that on to their students.\n  Last, of course, it forces schools out of the direct loan program \nthat has been so successful.\n  So we hear about the tax breaks to the wealthy. We do not hear about \nthe stealth taxes that are in the Republican bill, and mainly it falls \non students.\n  Mr. President, there was an article recently in the Des Moines \nRegister which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Des Moines Register]\n\n                   The Reality of Cutting Student Aid\n\n                            (By Rekha Basu)\n\n       If you want to talk to Robin Kniech, you'd best catch the \n     Drake University junior early, before she heads for class or \n     checks in at one of her five jobs, which add nearly 40 hours \n     to her already full load.\n       Between the baby sitting, secretarial and other work, \n     Kniech just manages to eke out her $1,200 tuition \n     contribution. The rest of the $14,100 is made up from merit-\n     based scholarships and college loans.\n       Last week, which was Save Student Financial Aid Week, \n     sponsored by Drake Democrats, Kniech was also out rallying \n     students against proposed cuts to federal student aid. For \n     her, it's a subject of more than political interest. Any \n     cuts, however small, could tip the delicate balance she has \n     crafted to get a college education.\n       ``I don't have any financial support from my parents,'' \n     says Kniech. ``I don't have any more hours to squeeze, and if \n     I were to lose $300 in aid, I probably wouldn't be in \n     school.''\n       Just when you start thinking there's no other sacred zone \n     left for congressional Republicans to tamper with, along \n     comes another. If it isn't school lunches or aid to families \n     with minor children, or programs that give disadvantaged \n     preschoolers a fighting start, if it isn't rolling back \n     federal standards governing the care of elderly in nursing \n     homes or the health care of low-income people, then it's \n     gashes into the very programs that enable people to go to \n     college so they can hope to get decent jobs. At Drake, \n     several hundred thousands dollars could be lost, according to \n     John Parker, director of financial planning. Some 60 percent \n     of Drake students get need-based assistance.\n       This is a tough issue to get your arms around, given the \n     rather confusing tangle of college-aid programs and formulas. \n     But the bottom line is the GOP plans to take $10.4 billion \n     out of student-loan entitlement programs and apply it to \n     deficit reduction. The legislation targets Stafford loans--\n     private loans secured by the federal government, which you \n     might remember as Guaranteed Student Loans. That's what they \n     were called when I got one for graduate school. A whopping 90 \n     percent of Drake law students and 40 percent of \n     undergraduates now get them.\n       It also hits loans to parents to help finance their kids' \n     educations, and several loan programs originating with the \n     federal government but administered by the university, such \n     as the Perkins loan. That cut alone would knock off aid to 90 \n     Drake students.\n       Some proposals that might seem benign can cut quite deep. \n     One would force student recipients of subsidized Stafford \n     loans (those given to the highest-needs students) to start \n     accruing interest charges immediately on graduation, instead \n     of after the six-month grace period they now have. The added \n     debt could be just enough to derail Kniech's plans to join \n     the Peace Corps. ``This hits at high-needs students harder \n     than anybody else,'' says Parker.\n       There's also a proposal to raise both the ceiling and floor \n     on the major federal grant program, Pell grants, \n     disqualifying some 250,000 students nationwide, costing 75 \n     Drake students about $40,000, and affecting students' \n     eligibility for other grants. And more.\n       If you're tempted to argue that a student like Kniech \n     should set her sights on a less costly education, forget it. \n     She couldn't afford community college. She'd have to pay more \n     than twice what she's paying out of pocket.\n       Viewed piece by piece, the cuts may not look like much. And \n     Drake Republicans have countered with flyers pointing to the \n     programs which aren't slated for actual cuts (but contain no \n     increases for inflation), or the growth in funding of the \n     Pell grant program. But every cut matters to students \n     struggling to stay afloat. ``There are students at Drake who, \n     if they had to come up with another $50 they just flat out \n     couldn't do it,'' Parker says. And there's the precedent. As \n     senior Tanya Beer put it, ``I think we're moving more toward \n     education for the privileged rather than education as a \n     right.''\n       The financial-aid story offers an interesting juxtaposition \n     of GOP fact and rhetoric. While the cheerleaders of \n     congressional Republicans like to rail about elitist \n     liberals, the scheme unfolding in Congress is built around an \n     unparalleled elitism, deliberately cutting off avenues for \n     advancement for those starting out at a disadvantage, even as \n     they are admonished to stay in school and work harder.\n       So excuse Robin Kniech if the politicians' lectures about \n     working her way up ring a little hollow. She's keeping her \n     end of the bargain, and a 3.8 grade-point average. She just \n     doesn't have anything left to give up.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is entitled ``The Reality of Cutting Student Aid.''\n  I will read a couple of items from it:\n\n       If you want to talk to Robin Kniech, you'd best catch the \n     Drake University junior early, before she heads for class or \n     checks in at one of her five jobs, which add nearly 40 hours \n     to her already full load.\n       Between the baby sitting, secretarial and other work, \n     Kniech just manages to eke out her $1,200 tuition \n     contribution. The rest of the $14,100 is made up from merit-\n     based scholarships and college loans.\n       ``I don't have any financial support from my parents,'' \n     says Kniech. ``I don't have any more hours to squeeze, and if \n     I were to lose $300 in aid, I probably wouldn't be in \n     school.''\n\n  John Parker, director of financial planning, said that 60 percent of \nDrake students get need-based assistance.\n  ``There are students at Drake who, if they had to come up with \nanother $50, just could not, flatout could not, do it,'' Parker said.\n  I think I will end on this note, a good note. The writer of the \narticle said:\n\n       So excuse Robin Kniech if the politicians' lectures about \n     working her way up ring a little hollow. She's keeping her \n     end of the bargain, and a 3.8 grade-point average. She just \n     doesn't have anything left to give.\n\n\n[[Page S15740]]\n\n  Mr. President, here is what is happening at one of our regent \nuniversities, the University of Northern Iowa, the smallest of our \nthree state universities. For the 1990-91 school year the average loan \nof a student per year was $2,589. That was in 1991. Today that is up to \n$4,395, and, if this reconciliation bill passes, that is going to climb \neven higher. This bill just piles more debt on students. That is going \nto discourage students from going to school and seeking a higher \neducation.\n  Who does it hit? It hits moderate- and low-income families the \nhardest. That is why we have to defeat this reconciliation bill and \nmake sure that these students can get a decent education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my colleague \nyielding me this time.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment and strongly \nsupport this amendment. Many good arguments have already been made here \nthis morning. In fact, the chart used earlier by my colleague from New \nMexico I think makes the case. Seventy percent of the cuts proposed in \nthe bill before us will fall on students and their families; 30 percent \nare industry losses.\n  I suppose in the context of a huge budget, some may say what is $7.6 \nbillion in all of this? I suppose there are not many people here in \nthis body who would understand what this will mean to millions of \nAmericans. The impact seems relatively minor when you start talking \nabout $100, $300, or $500 a year. But they are not minor costs for most \nAmericans.\n  There is a failure to appreciate, whether it is Medicaid, Medicare, \nhigher education, that while these numbers of $90, $100, $200, $2,000, \nor $2,700 do not seem like anything large in the context of people of \nthe upper-income levels, to working families in this country, these \namounts make the difference between getting an education, getting \nhealth care, losing the job, or falling back into poverty. And for many \nof these families, they will be hit time and time again by the \nprovisions of this bill--they will pay more for health care, receive \nless earned income tax credit and pay more for college.\n  Our colleague from North Dakota the other day offered an amendment on \nthe cuts in Medicare. He said cannot we forgo the tax breaks for people \nmaking in excess of $250,000 a year? The savings to us would be $50 \nbillion over 7 years, if we just said nobody over $250,000 gets a tax \nbreak. We could have saved $50 billion, if we had followed that \namendment. But this Senate said no. We are even going to provide the \ntax breaks for people making in excess of a quarter of a million \ndollars.\n  Just think what that $50 billion would do. We would not have to be \ndebating this amendment. Mr. President, $7 billion of that $50 billion \ncould go to these middle-income families out there that are going to \nfeel the pinch in higher education.\n  Mr. President, we all appreciate and know that in a global economy in \nthe 21st century we are going to have to produce the best-educated, and \nthe best-prepared generation that this country has ever produced if we \nare going to be effective. That is common sense. Everyone ought to \nunderstand that.\n\n  Yet as you increase these costs on these families, we are going to \nwatch students fall through the cracks. We are going to lose that \ntalent and ability merely because we want to provide a tax break for \npeople making in excess of a quarter of a million dollars. I do not \nknow anyone who believes, if you have to make a choice as to which of \nthose two groups you benefit when there are scarce resources, it ought \nnot go to people earning a quarter of a million dollars rather than to \nthose of modest means pursuing higher education.\n  I think it is regretful; I think it is sad, indeed, that this \ninstitution could not make the simple decision of saying to those at \nthe highest incomes: Wait a while. Maybe next year or the year after we \ncan provide a tax break for you. But right now we need to assist \nfamilies struggling to meet the costs of higher education.\n  This $7.6 billion is going to fall heavily on those families out \nthere trying to make ends meet, trying to send their kids to college \nand trying to make difficult choices that make this possible.\n  Let me just quote one recent survey. It shows that business that made \nan investment in the educational attainment of their work force--as \nreported by corporate managers--resulted in twice a return in increased \nproductivity of a comparable increase in work hours and nearly three \ntimes the return of an investment in capital stock. That is corporate \nmanagers talking about the importance of investments in education. I \nhope this amendment is adopted.\n  There are 11 million young Americans who are in our public higher \neducation institutions. Cannot we today offer some relief, some hope \nfor them even if it means saying to those making more than a quarter of \na million a year, you are going to have to wait a while to get your \nbreak, to see to it that those 11 million families, those 11 million \nchildren get the opportunity for a decent education? That choice ought \nto be clear.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nMichigan. I compliment him on his leadership. I just mention that many \nof the allegations and statements that are made are certainly not \ntaking a look at the overall big picture.\n  I wish to help students, too. I understand that there may be a \nleadership amendment that is going to make some modifications in the \nproposals that are being discussed. I think I will wait for the \ndiscussions on the specifics until that amendment is offered. It will \nbe accommodating some of the concerns that have been raised because I \nthink all of us--I happen to have four kids, two of whom are in higher \neducation right now. That costs a little money. But I will tell you the \nbest news we could give my kids that are going to college is to balance \nthe budget.\n  We only have one proposal before us to balance the budget. That is \nthe proposal that the Republicans have put forth that will give us a \nbalanced budget. I remember going to a town meeting not too long ago \nand somebody who was about 23 years old raised their hand and said: \nSenator, will I ever see a balanced budget in my lifetime?\n  They were just as serious as they could possibly be. Later today, or \nmaybe tomorrow, we are going to be voting on a balanced budget. But \nthere is only one. President Clinton does not have a balanced budget. \nWe do. When you think of somebody going to college and talking about \ncollege loans, what a heck of a deal it is right now that they inherit \nsuch enormous national debt. Let us at least stop it.\n  The only proposal that we have before us to stop it is our proposal \nto balance the budget. Now, we may make some modifications in the \nproposal to alleviate some of the concerns that have been raised \nspecifically dealing with student loans. So again I will leave that \nalone for the time being.\n  Let us talk about what we are doing for all American families. I \nheard my colleague say, well, this is $10 billion. We are giving \nAmerican families $140 billion of tax cuts. If they have children, they \nget a tax cut under our proposal, $500 per child. If you have four \nchildren, that is $2,000. That is pretty significant. And families get \nto decide if they want to use that money for education, for \ntransportation, or for other things. Families make that decision. I \nthink that is important.\n  I also want to talk about the benefit of a balanced budget for the \naverage American family. If you have a $100,000 mortgage--it seems like \nthat is a large amount but that is not that unheard of today--you will \nhave savings--it is estimated by independent sources that by having a \nbalanced budget you will \n\n[[Page S15741]]\n\nhave a 2-percent interest rate reduction, maybe as high as a 2.7-\npercent reduction on a $100,000 mortgage. That boils down to savings of \nover $2,000 per year, actually $2,162 per year.\n  Also, if you have a student loan, let us say an $11,000 student loan, \nthat is $216 in savings just in the fact that interest rates have come \ndown. If you have a car loan of, say, $15,000, you have savings of \n$180. Those total savings of $2,500 per year if we are able to bring \ninterest rates down by balancing the budget. So I think students have a \nreal interest in seeing us balance the budget.\n  I also want to talk about some of the misstatements that have been \nmade. Are families better off at different income levels? Because I \nheard some people say some lower-income families are getting a tax \nincrease. That is totally false, totally, completely false. And so \nagain I wish to look at what happens to families under this proposal. \nFamilies that make, say, $5,000, they do not pay any income tax. They \npay zero income tax. Right now they get an earned income credit of \n$1,800. They get it under present law. That is what they are going to \nget under our proposal.\n  What about families making $10,000? They still do not pay any income \ntax. They get a $3,110 EIC. Next year they are going to get an increase \nthat goes to $3,200.\n  What about families that make $15,000? Right now, they get a check \nfrom Uncle Sam of $2,300. They do not write Uncle Sam a check. They \nstill pay zero income tax and next year they are going to get a bigger \ncheck, $2,488. So that is an increase. That is an improvement.\n  What about families that make $20,000? Well, they get an EIC of $832. \nWith two children, they are presently paying zero tax. Next year, they \nare going to get from us, EIC goes up to $1,429.\n  You might say, why? Well, the tax credit reduces their tax deduction \nso they get a higher EIC.\n  What about a family that, say, makes $30,000. You have a lot of \nfamilies making $30,000 that are sending kids to school. Right now, \nthey are writing Uncle Sam a check for $929. Under our proposal, they \nwill receive an EIC of $171 and pay no income tax. That is over a \n$1,000 improvement for that family. And actually every family beyond \nhere will receive over a $1,000 improvement. Right now, if they are \nwriting checks for $2,000, they will write a check for $900. That is \nover a $1,000 improvement.\n  A $40,000 family would write a check to Uncle Sam right now with two \nchildren, $3,500. Under our proposal, they will write a check for \n$2,400. Again, they save $1,100. They save in the child credit. They \nalso save from the reduction in the marriage penalty.\n  A family making $50,000 would write a check for $5,000. Under our \nproposal, they will write a check for $3,900. They will get a $1,100 \nsavings. They can use that money for education. Our whole propose is \ntargeted at families, and families can decide how to spend that money. \nAnd people with children are concerned about education. We are going to \nlet them keep their money so they can decide how it should be spent. I \nthink that is awfully important.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric that bothers me because it is not \nfactual. Lower-income groups are going to have their taxes raised. Not \ntrue. In many cases they are alluding to earned income credits, and so \non. Those grow. I happen to be pretty familiar with them. I am going to \nput them in the Record. Maybe everybody can be familiar with them. \nThese credits are growing every year. We give taxpayers a tax cut if \nthey have children and they want their children to go to school.\n  It is interesting; after the debate we had last night, somebody \ncalled my office about 11 o'clock and said: I am kind of embarrassed \nbecause my daughter, who is going to school, going to college received \nan earned income credit of $300. He said the reason why I am \nembarrassed is because I am a millionaire. But in present law they \nqualify. Does that make sense? I said, well, why would your daughter \nqualify? Well, she forgot to tell them that I gave her $18,000 to \nsupport her college education. But under present law she can qualify if \nshe does not report that income. Now, we try to tighten down on EIC, so \nwe report other income and say that income should be counted.\n\n  Right now with EIC, you qualify under the program if you make less \nthan $26,000. Under our proposal we allow that to grow to $29,000. Some \npeople say that is a Draconian change because the administration wants \nyou to qualify for EIC if you make $34,600. That may be the majority of \npeople in Alabama; that may be the majority of people in Michigan, \nmaybe in Oklahoma. There are a lot of people in our State that make \nless than $34,000.\n  So we curb the growth. Right now you can qualify if you have income \nless than $26,000. We allow that to grow under our proposal to $29,000. \nBut the administration wants it to grow to $34,000.\n  I had a millionaire call me last night and say, ``My daughter \nreceived a benefit that I don't think she should have. I think you're \nright. I think a lot of people are receiving this benefit that \nshouldn't. Let's try to target our assistance to those people who \nreally need the help.''\n  That is what we are trying to do, target our assistance. Some 70 \npercent of this package is directed at American families that make less \nthan $75,000 per year. Those are the families that are sending their \nkids to school. So let us be responsive. Let us be helpful. And let us \nmake some of the changes that are necessary to make our economy grow.\n  At the same time, let us balance the budget. I am really excited \nabout the opportunity to balance the budget. I am bothered by the fact \nthat the President of the United States had a press conference \nyesterday and he said, ``Look how great we are doing. The deficit has \ncome down 3 years in a row. We are making real progress.''\n  What he forgot to show is what happens in the future. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, his deficit grows. He talks about $164 \nbillion in 1995, and it is less than it was the year before. I think \nthat is great. I do not think he is entirely responsible for that. But \nwhat happens in the outyears? Well, the Congressional Budget Office \nsays that it will be $210 billion in the year 2002. He forgot to tell \neverybody the deficit is going to go from $164 billion to $210 billion \nand over $200 billion almost every year, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  That is not acceptable. There is a change. Some of us are very, very \nsincere. We mean it. We want to balance the budget. Some of us voted \nfor a constitutional amendment to make us balance the budget, and we \nfailed. We lacked one vote in the Senate. But we also said we should do \nit whether this amendment passes or not.\n  Many people on the other side of the aisle said, ``We should pass a \nbalanced budget. We don't need a constitutional amendment to make us do \nit.'' And if we had the right composition in this body, they would be \ncorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Oklahoma has \nspoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It would be correct if we had the composition in the \nbody that would vote for a balanced budget. But I will tell my \ncolleagues, we cannot balance the budget unless or until we are willing \nto contain the growth of the entire budget. And we have already had \nvotes to say, ``Oh, let's don't reduce the rate of growth in Medicare. \nOh, we're cutting $270 billion in Medicare.''\n  The facts are, in Medicare, this year we are spending $178 billion in \nMedicare, and in the year 2002 we are going to spend $286 billion in \nMedicare. That is a significant increase. It is a 7 percent increase \nover that entire period of time, 7 percent per year.\n  ``Don't cut Medicaid, for crying out loud. No. Medicaid is too \nsensitive.'' They forget to tell people Medicaid in the last 4 years \nhas grown as much as 28, 29, 13, and 8 percent. Make that in 5 years \nthen 9 percent. Medicaid has exploded in costs. Many States have \nfigured out ways to dump their liability on the Federal Government. It \nused to be a 50-50 share for most States. Now they are figuring out \nways to make it 70 percent Federal Government, 30 percent State. We are \ntrying to reform that and curtail that growth.\n  Mr. President, I think it is awfully important we balance the budget, \nand I \n\n[[Page S15742]]\n\ncompliment my colleagues for the proposal we have before us today. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time is \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 8 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield me----\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \nseveral charts and other material.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n AMERICAN FAMILIES BETTER OFF TOMORROW THAN TODAY UNDER SENATE GOP BILL \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

Taxation: Provided by Senator Don Nickles, 10/20/95.                                 \n\n\n\n          [From the U.S. Senate--Republican Policy Committee]\n\n     To: Budget and Tax L.A.'s.\n     From: J.T. Young.\n     Re: Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\n       Once again we bring to your attention a piece run by \n     today's Washington Post that refutes the shrill political \n     posturing of the White House.\n\n                         (By James K. Glassman)\n\n                         A Program Gone Bonkers\n\n       The road to a $5 trillion national debt is paved with good \n     intentions.\n       Look at the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Launched by \n     Gerald Ford, lauded by Ronald Reagan, expanded by George Bush \n     and Bill Clinton, it's based on welfare principles that even \n     a Republican (or a professed New Democrat) can love. The only \n     problem is that, like many other good ideas in Washington, \n     it's gotten completely out of hand.\n       Currently, the EITC is the fastest-growing program in the \n     federal budget. It will cost the Treasury $24 billion this \n     year, up from less than $2 billion 10 years ago.\n       In their giant reconciliation bill--the final budget \n     measure of the year--Republicans are trying to restrain this \n     growth. Under the Senate version, EITC costs will rise to $32 \n     billion in 2002. In the budget language of Washington, that's \n     a cut. In any other language it's an increase--although not \n     so large as projected under the current law, which has costs \n     rising to $36 billion by 2002.\n       The EITC is a sort of negative income tax. If you fall into \n     a certain earnings bracket, you don't pay the government; the \n     government pays you.\n       The idea of the EITC is to put more money in the pockets of \n     low-income working families. If you don't work, you don't \n     qualify. Since the benefits are paid in cash and the rules \n     are simple, the Internal Revenue Service can administer the \n     EITC easily and cheaply.\n       Believers in the free market like the notion that the EITC \n     doesn't force recipients to use funds for a particular \n     purpose like other federal programs (housing, food stamps). \n     Instead, it gives them money and lets them make their own \n     choices.\n       The EITC is not only the fastest-growing entitlement \n     program, it's the broadest. In 1986 some 7 million families \n     were covered by the EITC, and the average-outlay by the \n     government was $281. This year 18 million families are \n     covered at an average of $1,265. In 1986 the maximum credit \n     taxpayer could receive was $550; today, it's $3,111.\n       In Mississippi, a whopping 39 percent of families receive \n     the EITC; in Texas, 26 percent; California, 22 percent. With \n     this kind of penetration, the EITC follows a welfare \n     tradition invented by Franklin Roosevelt: To keep a program \n     alive, make sure money flows not just to the poor but to the \n     middle class. That's been the key to success for Social \n     Security, Medicare, student loans and farm subsidies.\n       The EITC was begun as a modest program to help offset the \n     burden of payroll taxes on the poor and, through its unique \n     structure, to encourage them to work more. But the philosophy \n     soon became: ``Hey, if a little bit is good, then more is \n     better,'' says Bruce Bartlett, an economist who served in the \n     Bush Treasury Department.\n       Today, the EITC is enjoyed by families making as much as \n     $26,672 a year, and that doesn't include outside income. \n     Under the tax law that President Clinton promoted and signed \n     two years ago, by 2002 families making $34,612 will qualify \n     for EITC benefits. The Senate wants to scale that figure back \n     to $30,200--which seems pretty sensible for a government that \n     already owes its creditors $4.9 trillion.\n       At its core, the EITC is a massive income transfer scheme. \n     New IRS figures show that in 1993 the top 5 percent of \n     American earners paid 47 percent of the federal income taxes, \n     up from 37 percent in 1981. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent \n     of earners--thanks in large measure to the EITC--paid 5 \n     percent of the taxes.\n       The EITC, in other words, has created a veritable tax \n     holiday for about half the families in America.\n       Many would say that's fair. But there's another question \n     raised by the EITC: Does it really encourage work? There's \n     doubt.\n       For 1996, families with two or more children will earn \n     credits of 40 percent of their income until they reach \n     earnings of $8,910 annually. Then, they max out at a credit \n     (in nearly all cases, a cash payment) of $3,564. So far, so \n     good. Clearly, there's a big incentive to work, since a \n     dollar paid on the job becomes $1.40 in the pocket (minus \n     modest payroll taxes).\n       If you earn between $8,910 and $11,630, you still receive \n     the maximum credit. Then the disincentive begins--you start \n     losing 21 cents of credits for every additional dollar you \n     earn. When your income reaches $28,533, your credits hit \n     zero.\n       Again, this sounds fair. But the problem is that the EITC \n     forces lower-income Americans to face marginal tax rates that \n     are higher than those faced by the richest Americans.\n       As Bartlett wrote recently in a brief for the National \n     Center for Policy Analysis: ``Families with incomes between \n     $11,000 and $26,000 are being taxed at the rate of 60 percent \n     on each additional dollar earned. . . . This total tax rate \n     includes federal, state and local taxes plus the reduction in \n     the EITC.''\n       And these high marginal taxes definitely discourage work. \n     Economist Edgar Browning of Texas A reported in the \n     National Tax journal that nearly half of all families \n     receiving the EITC has less income than they would have had \n     without the tax credit--because the credit enticed them to \n     work less. And a University of Wisconsin study found that \n     ``on balance the EITC reduces the total hours worked.''\n       Is there a solution to the EITC conundrum? One answer is to \n     remove the phase-out of benefits: Simply give all taxpayers \n     an extra 40 percent credit for the first $10,000 or so of \n     income. But that would be hugely expensive. Another answer is \n     to kill the EITC entirely. But that would be politically \n     impossible.\n       The third course is to try to restrain a program gone \n     bonkers. That's what the Republicans are doing. At the same \n     time, however, they should admit that the EITC isn't quite so \n     glorious as they once thought. Maybe luring people out of \n     poverty is something that government just can't do.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I must oppose the reconciliation bill we \nconsider today because it impacts on parents, students, and families in \nways they cannot afford; that is why I support and cosponsor Senator \nKennedy's amendment to strike the student loan provisions in this bill \nthat impose higher college costs on students and working families.\n  Mr. President, the Labor Committee's proposal to save $10.85 billion \nthrough changes in the Federal Student Loan Program is simply \nunacceptable. It strikes a blow at the Federal Government's role in \nproviding an opportunity structure for our Nation's youth. It threatens \nthe future economic opportunity for young people who are today's \nstudents and tomorrow's work force, and it rejects help to those who \npractice self-help.\n  The Labor Committee's reconciliation proposal is another strike at \nthis Nation's opportunity structure. The Republicans want to levy on \nnew tax on colleges and universities. The Republicans want colleges to \npay a .85 percent tax on their total student loan volume. That is \noutrageous.\n  It does not make a difference whether that tax is .85 percent or 2 \npercent as originally proposed by committee Republicans. A tax is a \ntax. Colleges and universities will still have to pay a new tax to the \nFederal Government every year.\n  Mr. President, colleges and universities all across my State of \nMaryland are adamantly opposed to this new tax.\n  This new tax means that the University of Maryland in College Park \nwill have to pay approximately $255,000 in taxes on its student loan \nvolume each year. The University of Maryland in Baltimore will have to \npay approximately $180,000.\n  Private independent colleges will be especially hard hit. These \ncolleges do not get substantial State financial support. This results \nin higher student loan volume. So, Loyola College in Baltimore will \nhave to pay approximately $95,000 to the Federal Government.\n  It means that Johns Hopkins University will have to pay about \n$204,000 and Western Maryland College will pay about $25,000 in taxes \non student loans each year.\n  Where will colleges get this money? They may be forced to pass on \nthis new tax burden to students in the form of increased tuition, \nreduction in scholarships, or elimination of student services or \nprograms.\n  College tuition has already skyrocketed. Our undergraduate students \nborrow the maximum of $17,125 a year just to be able to afford a \ncollege education, to have access to increased opportunities and to \nachieve the American dream. But this reconciliation bill will leave \nsome students out in the cold.\n  This is unacceptable. It is not only a tax on colleges, but a tax on \nopportunity. Students in this country are \n\n[[Page S15744]]\n\ntold every day--do well, work hard, get a good education and you will \nbe rewarded. But this kind of tax sends the wrong message to students \ntrying to get ahead and trying to get ready for the future.\n  Mr. President, the Congress passed the Higher Education Act \namendments in 1992 to bring help to those who practice self help. It \nwas meant to be Federal help to middle class families who are drowning \nin debt and trying to send their children to college.\n  Yet, imposing a new tax is not only a hit on colleges and students, \nbut also a hit on parents trying to help pay for their child's college \neducation. This reconciliation bill increases the interest rate that \nparents will pay on loans and increases the overall cap on that \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, promises made must be promises kept. By cutting \nstudent loans, we are cutting the promises we made to students, to \nparents and to colleges.\n  I believe in rewarding the good guys in our society who work hard and \nplay by the rules. That means giving help to middle-class families \nwhere moms and dads struggle--maybe even working two jobs--to pay \ntuition to send their son or daughter to college.\n  Mr. President, these families are paying loans on top of loans. We \ncannot turn our backs on them now.\n  Our students need our support through Federal financial aid programs \nor through innovative initiatives like national service. But, we are \ndoing away with those opportunities too.\n  National service gives students an alternate way to afford college, \nand at the same time, national service helps meet some of our \ncommunity's most critical needs.\n  As an appropriator, I know firsthand how hard it is for the \nGovernment to come up with a balanced check book. But education must be \nour No. 1 priority. It is with me. It is for parents and students who \nbalance their own check book every day and every semester. It should be \na priority for this Congress.\n  Mr. President, college is no longer a luxury. It is a necessity just \nto stay competitive in the job market. It is a dream come true for \nparents of first generation college students to see their children walk \nacross the stage. I believe we should give people the chance to pursue \ntheir dream through earned opportunities. To rob them of this \nopportunity is robbing America of its future.\n  I hope every member of the Senate will support Senator Kennedy's \namendment to strike the student loan provisions from this bill. It is \nan important investment to this Nation's students and it is important \nto America's economic future.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, first I want to thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his great leadership on preserving student aid. He \nhas moved quickly at every opportunity to stick up for students and \nparents, and his amendment today is sorely needed.\n  Mr. President, student aid has a proud history in this country. Much \nof my generation went to college on the GI bill. Then we passed the \nHigher Education Act of 1965, helping boost college attendance to \ntoday's levels. Of the 13 million students in college today, half of \nthem receive Federal grants and loans under that Act.\n  Economically, budgetary, morally, this bipartisan policy of making \nstudent aid a priority has been right. Economic analysis shows that we \nhave benefited 8 for 1 on our GI bill investment. Recent analysis shows \nthat the investment in education is twice as productive as other \nworkplace investments. And the lower income people in our society \nshould not be shut out of an affordable college education. We need to \nmake every effort every year to make sure that our higher education \nassistance policy builds our country rather than dividing it.\n  But Republicans have come this year with the proposition to students \nthat everyone has to help balance the budget. Students should take some \ntime in the library and study this bill. Everyone does not pay. \nStudents--particularly low-income students--are asked to pay $10.8 \nbillion more. But others--particularly those who can pay for college \nout of their pockets--get new tax breaks. These tax breaks and \nincreased spending in other parts of the budget are much larger than \nthe student loan cuts. In other words, this Congress could easily \nchoose not to make students pay more, but the Republican leadership \nthinks it is more important to give more to certain constituencies \nbefore the next election, all the while crying balancing budget.\n  Let me be specific about how Congress could avoid cutting student aid \nin this bill:\n  First, we could lower the brand new tax break in this so-called \nbudget-balancing bill from $245 billion to $235 billion.\n  Second, we could trim back the proposed defense increase of over $50 \nbillion.\n  Third, we could refuse to provide a new tax break for corporations \ncurrently paying the minimum allowed, which is what is offered in this \namendment.\n  The fact is, all of these alternatives--and many others--are \nunacceptable to the Republicans that wrote this budget because student \naid was a much lower priority to them than new tax breaks.\n  Mr. President, these student aid provisions are shameful. If students \nand parents knew what was in this bill, they would think we had gone \noff the deep end. This is not the way we balance the budget, it is the \nway we pander for the next election and put the budget out of balance \nin the long run. I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment \nto maintain our investment in education.\n  Mr. AKAKA Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about cuts \nin education programs included in the reconciliation bill.\n  The bill before us cuts $10.8 billion from the student loan program. \nThese proposals include a 1 percent fee hike in PLUS loans, elimination \nof the grace period for recent graduates, the imposition of a 20 \npercent cap on direct student loan volume, and an .85 percent school \ntax based on the institution's student loan volume. If you wanted to \nundermine deliberately higher education, it would be difficult to come \nup with a more destructive list of proposals. Plain and simple, these \neducation cuts are irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, the 1 percent fee hike for PLUS loans is regressive \nand could add $5,000 to a family's indebtedness for a college \neducation. This may not mean much, but to a family struggling to make \nit on $25,000 a year, it could deprive a student of a college \neducation. Moreover, this measure discriminates against families who \nhaven't achieved the dream of home ownership, and who cannot take out \nhome equity loans to finance college.\n  Eliminating the grace period for recent graduates is similarly ill-\nconceived. This provision would saddle graduates with additional \nfinancial burden at the most critical time in their careers. It could \nforce graduates to settle for lower paying, less desirable jobs \nimmediately upon graduation rather than providing them a reasonable \nopportunity to secure higher paying employment that better matches \ntheir skills and desires.\n  The proposal to cap the direct loan program at 20 percent of the \ntotal student loan volume is misguided in three respects. First and \nforemost, it would discourage additional schools from participating in \nthe program and reduce the opportunities for thousands of economically \ndisadvantaged students who would not be able to qualify for guaranteed \nloans.\n  Second, the 20 percent cap will ultimately drain the Treasury of \nbillions of dollars because reinsurance fees and other subsidies will \nbe paid to banks, secondary markets, and guaranty agencies. Direct \nloans have been a money saver because they cut out the middleman, \nreduce administrative overhead, and increase accessibility. Only the \nbanks and other financial institutions stand to profit from the changes \nin this bill.\n  Third, capping direct loans will effectively limit one of the most \nimportant side benefits of the program--providing competition to the \nbanks. Without the direct loan program, the lending industry would be \nfree to raise interest rates on their own student loan instruments, \nincreasing borrowing costs to those who choose, or are forced to \nchoose, private lending sources. This in turn is likely to lead to \nadditional defaults, the costs of which will be borne by the taxpayer. \nI would be curious to learn how proponents of free enterprise explain \nthis clearly anticompetitive initiative.\n\n  Mr. President, the last major GOP education initiative is the \nproposed 0.85 \n\n[[Page S15745]]\n\npercent tax on schools. Like the other proposals, this is a regressive \ninititaive that will discourage schools from participating in the \ndirect loan program, force them to pass on the costs to students \nthrough increased tuition, and require them to tap into their already \ndwindling student financial aid budgets. Again, as with the other \ninitiatives, this provision will disproportionately impact students \nfrom low- and middle-income families. It is ironic that as Republicans \ntrumpet a $245 billion package of tax cuts that largely favor wealthier \nAmericans, they seek to impose an indirect tax on students and families \nwho can least afford it.\n  Mr. President, these are some of the reasons why I oppose the \neducation provisions contained in this measure. When added to the \nproposed wholesale reductions in discretionary education programs--from \nHead Start to Goals 2000, to campus-based aid--they constitute a plan \nto reduce access to quality education and harm our ability to compete \nin an increasingly sophisticated international marketplace.\n  Reducing investment in education, which is already inadequate, will \ninevitably limit economic growth and undermine the standard of living \nof middle-class Americans in the 21st century. And it will close the \nwindow of opportunity for the economically disadvantaged among us who \nare pursuing the American dream.\n  Mr. President, reducing our commitment to an educated, skilled work \nforce in the name of deficit reduction is shortsighted and terribly \nmisguided. As this country struggles to find its way in a global \nmarketplace dominated by cheap foreign labor and high technology, \nwithdrawing our investment in education amounts to economic suicide.\n  This budget proves that Republicans are more committed to protecting \nthe interests of the haves than in accommodating the aspirations of the \nvast majority of Americans who want only to improve the quality of \ntheir lives through hard work and education. Again, I believe this is a \npennywise, pound-foolish approach that is shortsighted, mean spirited, \nand will cost the taxpayer money in the long run.\n  If this budget is implemented, students of modest means may have to \nforgo a college education; others who are fortunate enough to achieve \ntheir baccalaureates may have to forgo their dreams of pursuing \ngraduate study. And those students who leave college in the future will \nbe saddled with huge debt burdens at a time when they are least likely \nto be able to afford payments.\n  The proposals contained in this measure, in concert with the proposed \nreductions in fiscal year 1996 education appropriations measure, will \nensure that our future work force is less educated, less productive, \nand less well off. This in turn will reduce the Nation's tax base, \nplacing further upward pressure on the deficit--exactly the opposite \neffect from the stated purpose of this budget plan.\n  This wholesale disinvestment in our most important resource, our \nyoung people, is not merely shortsighted, it is blind. Blind to the \nimperatives of the new global marketplace, blind to the effect that \ncuts in education will have on our ability to prosper in an \nincreasingly complex world, and blind to the effect it will have on our \ndeficit.\n  But competitiveness, economic viability, and individual opportunity \nwill not be the only victims of the proposed cutbacks in education. Our \nsense of civil community, of history, of tolerance, the ability to \nconduct informed, rational discourse--these are also the potential \nvictims of this harsh and ill-conceived budget plan.\n  For education is not just about making enough to feed the kids or to \nbuy a new car or to own a home--it is also about preparing ourselves to \ncarry out the responsibilities of citizenship in the world's oldest \nrepublic.\n  Mr. President, no sane nation embraces ignorance. Yet, this is what \nthe proposed resolution would have us do. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to reject this war on knowledge by opposing the education \nproposals contained in this measure that threaten our future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am prepared to yield our time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was just going to yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, and then we go with your side.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Fine.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Could I ask the Senator from Michigan how much time will be yielded \nto the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The remainder of our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. OK. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n4 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for this amendment.\n  As I sit here and listen to this debate today, I cannot help but \nwonder how many of our colleagues depended upon financial aid to \nadvance their education and build the foundation for their careers. \nThis is a highly educated body. And judging from the vast array of \ndegrees that are conferred upon my colleagues, I would have guessed \nthat many were dependent upon Federal assistance to finish their \nschooling.\n  However, the proposal to eliminate $10.8 billion in student loans \nforces me to question whether any of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle ever relied on financial aid to get an education. I can tell \nyou I would not be here today without Federal assistance that made my \ncollege education possible.\n  I will also tell you that working families will be the hardest hit by \nthis gutting of our student loan program. These middle-income families \noften do not qualify for full scholarships and cannot afford to pay \nfull tuition, particularly when $20,000 a year for tuition is today's \nnorm in higher education. Why sacrifice our Nation's future by limiting \neducational opportunities for young people?\n  This bill could have targeted the student loan industry, but instead \n63 percent of the bill's student loan cuts fall directly on students \nand their parents. Take for example the increased rates on PLUS loans \nthat are taken out by parents. I can tell you as a parent of two \nchildren entering the post-secondary world, I am concerned that \nfamilies across this land will find these new loans out of reach. This \naid is particularly important to those families without enough equity \nin their homes to take out a tax-deductible home equity loan.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely concerned with the proposal to \neliminate a small, but very important, element to those entering our \nwork force. All of us realize the difficult challenges facing today's \ncollege graduate. The limited prospects of employment, coupled with \nfinancial independence, on top of an already mounting educational debt \nput many of our graduates today in fiscal hardship before they are ever \nable to contribute back to our society.\n  To help these individuals during this difficult time, we have \nprovided a 6-month grace period on their loan once they finish school. \nThis is not loan forgiveness. It does not lead to increased deficits or \ndefaults. It simply provides a new college graduate a few months to \nfind a job and begin the process of becoming a contributing member of \nour society.\n  Some say this is a minor provision, appreciated by few students. I \nwill tell you, at the University of Washington, in Seattle alone, \n12,000 students will feel the impact of this grace period. It means \n$2.4 million to those students.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let us discuss a program that is working. The \ndirect loan program is producing enormous benefits for all. In a recent \nsurvey, 112 campuses using the direct lending program were polled, and \n90 percent reported satisfaction with the program.\n  During this academic year more than 1,350 schools are making \nborrowing easier for their students through the direct loan program. It \nis praised by students and college presidents alike for its speed, \nefficiency, and lack of bureaucracy. Why are we capping this success at \n20 percent of total loan volume when we know it works? Let us give \ndirect lending a chance to work for our schools and its students.\n  Mr. President, these cuts in our student loan programs are not \neconomic savings. They are only going to shortchange our country's \nfuture. When we \n\n[[Page S15746]]\n\nsacrifice our next work force for the sake of quick economic savings, \nwe all mortgage our economic prosperity. The cuts in student loans are \na direct impact to every single working family who wants to know that \ntheir child will be able to go on to college in this country that we \nare so proud of.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Michigan for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I find that the debate that is currently going on on \nthe floor interesting but not balanced. And I say that because, while \nwe talk about our children and the great compassion that I think this \nSenate and this Congress has always demonstrated toward young people in \nneed, there is another side to the story that must be told if we are to \nspeak of balance.\n  There is no question that we want as many of our young people as well \neducated as they can possibly become. We should encourage that kind of \nan environment. Clearly, the student loan program that is embodied \nwithin this package today will continue to educate as many as are \ncurrently being educated with the flexibility of growth to include \nmore. While it changes the parameters of the obligation, it would be \ngrossly unfair for anybody to portray that we are stepping away from or \nstepping back from our commitment to disadvantaged young people today \nseeking higher education.\n  What is glaringly absent from the debate on the other side is the \nrest of the story. I will tell you that having an education, having a \ndegree in an economy that does not create a job and hire you is the \ngreatest of tragedies.\n  The budget that we are seeking to bring about, in promises kept to \nthe American people, is a budget in balance, and there is not an \neconomist in this country today that will disagree that a budget \nimbalance causes the economy of this country to be more productive, \nmore job creating, having the ability to pay higher wages and to hire \nthe master's degrees and the doctorate degrees that oftentimes today go \nwanting and in their search for a job cannot find themselves able to \npay the student loan.\n  The future of our children, Mr. President, and our grandchildren does \nnot depend on a student loan. It depends on the economy of this country \nand the vitality of that economy that produces the student loans that \ncreates the jobs that offers the future and the opportunity.\n  Most economists agree today that our current debt structure creates a \n2-percent drag on our economy, and that 2-percent drag costs us \nhundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs annually as we work to \nincreasingly compete in a world marketplace.\n  I find it absolutely amazing that this President will argue a $200 \nbillion deficit and a debt that heads toward $5 trillion and says that \nthat is growth and that is opportunity and that is going to create a \nproductive economy.\n  Let me tell you what that kind of $200 billion deficit does to the \naverage child of today, the college student of tomorrow, the job seeker \nin the future.\n  The average child today will pay $5,000 additional taxes over their \nlifetime with that $200 billion deficit. The Clinton budget projects \ndeficits of that range out through the year 2000, and that alone adds \nup to an additional tax burden of $40,000 in the lifetime of that \nchild. Those are statistics from the National Taxpayers Union.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, that is the future. This Senator is \ngoing to vote for a dynamic program of student aid, but he is not going \nto deny that student the same opportunity that that student's parents \nhad in their lifetime: to seek a better life, to have a job, to be \nproductive, to be creative. That is our reality, and that is what we \npromise the American people.\n  So I suggest to all of us today that this really is a debate about \nthe child and the child's future and his or her opportunity to be \nproductive, to have a rewarding experience in their life, because just \nlike the security of Medicare and just like the security of Social \nSecurity, they are all bound inextricably to the productivity of an \neconomy. Not debt, not layoffs, not a sluggish economy that is not able \nto get up to speed and to be competitive in a world marketplace.\n  I am absolutely amazed that we cannot strike that balance or that we \nhave to struggle so hard to argue that a balanced budget makes sense. \nSomehow this deficit syndrome that the President has caught himself in \nand is unable to escape--while he argued yesterday, ``Look at the \nproductivity, look what I have done,'' what he failed to say, ``In the \noutyears, I am going to have to ask the American people for another \nlarge tax increase, because while my tax increase of a year ago has \nforced the deficit down, the Government has not changed its spending \nhabits. And every program that I offer in my budget,'' i.e., the \nPresident, ``I want more spending and more Government and more growth \nin the most nonproductive sector of our society.''\n  The American people last November said it very clearly. They said, \n``Sorry, Mr. President, you're wrong; you've got to change and our \nGovernment has to change and we have to make sense of something, \nbecause we sense our vitality is slipping away, our ability to make a \nliving is slipping away.''\n  I do not dispute what the other side is saying about the less ability \nof the American family to pay for their child's education, but have \nthey ever stopped to ask why there is less ability, why can the family \nof today not provide as much for the child as the family of 20 or 30 \nyears ago? There is an obvious reason. They cannot provide the \nlifestyle. The economy has been dragged down by a debt structure and a \nGovernment that consumes ever greater a proportion of the gross \nnational product of our country in the most nonproductive of ways.\n  I do not dispute the need for Government, but I do dispute its size, \nI do dispute the debt, I do dispute the deficit, because economic \ncommon sense says, and most economists agree, that if this Government \ncan live within its means, our economy will be a much more productive \nplace, I say to my fellow Senators, and we all know what that means. \nThat is opportunity, that is jobs, that is productivity, that is the \naverage family being able to care for their children and having the \npride to say to their children, ``You are going to have a better life; \nyou are going to have greater opportunity; we want you to have that \ncollege degree, and we can assist you in doing so because our lives are \nbetter lives.''\n  That is the issue at hand. It is the debt. It is the question of \ndeficit. It is the drag on the economy and the nonproductive way that \nwe have found ourselves increasingly caught up in, unable to provide \nthose kinds of opportunities.\n  I applaud what this side is attempting to do in response to the \nAmerican people and future generations to come.\n  You see, Mr. President, I have parents--like we all do--who grew up \nin the Depression days, and they tell me about the phenomenal \ndifficulties and the attitudes that for a generation that experience \nprovoked on the American scene; that somehow they thought less of \nthemselves and less of their ability to produce because of the \nphenomenal negative economic experience that that generation went \nthrough.\n  Can we assume that that could never occur again? Well, we should not, \nand that is what Republicans and Americans are doing today in their \neffort to produce a balanced budget to control the growth of Government \nand say to future generations, ``We heard you and we provided an \neconomy that will give you the opportunity you seek.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague from \nMassachusetts in supporting this amendment. As I listen to some of the \nrhetoric on the floor, I really feel like this is Alice in Wonderland \nout here. This is not a debate about whether we are going to reduce the \ndeficit or balance the budget. The Republicans keep coming back and \nsaying, ``By God, the only way we are going to deal with the deficit \nand the budget is to do these things.''\n  The choice here is how we are going to balance the budget. They want \nto spend more money on B-2 bombers. \n\n[[Page S15747]]\n\n They want to continue the Market Promotion Program. They want to take \na $5 million asset on a trust fund and give people a $1.7 million tax \nbreak. It is a question of how we are doing it.\n  What we all understand is, we should not be doing it at the expense \nof students and at the expense of the colleges and universities that \nhave entered into the Direct Loan Program so that you can put more \nmoney back into the pockets of the lending institutions. It just does \nnot make sense.\n  The Senator from Idaho stands up and says, ``We are going to take a \nlesser amount of money, but we are still going to be able to give you \nthe same amount of education.'' I wish he had been there yesterday when \nthe chancellor of the University of Massachusetts and the folks from \nLowell, MA, and New Bedford and Fall River, which have 15 percent \nunemployment, working class people came in and said to me, ``Senator, \nif these cuts go through, our kids are going to drop out of \nschool.'' And they are going to drop out of school because they are \ngoing to have $5,000 of additional costs in interest on the PLUS loan \nthat is going to be $700 to $2,500 of debt because they eliminate the \ninterest subsidy on the 6-month grace period. They are going to have a \ntransfer tax on colleges and universities participating in the student \nloan program, and they are going to end, for half the universities, \ndirect participation.\n\n  Mr. President, those kids cannot go to school paying that additional \nmoney. But they are giving the money to people earning more than \n$300,000, and to all of these other interests. They are continuing \nadditional defense spending. The question is how we will balance the \nbudget. It should not be done on the backs of the future generation in \neducation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, has leader time been reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that I may use a portion of that \nleader time without it being charged against either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15720-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF WAR CRIMES\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, today's Washington Post reveals shocking \nnews about what happened to the men of Srebrenica after this so-called \nsafe area fell to Bosnian Serb forces in July. Twelve thousand men from \nthis U.N.-designated safe area tired to flee to Bosnian Government-held \nterritory and more than half were brutally butchered by forces under \nthe command of Gen. Ratko Mladic.\n  Yesterday's Christian Science Monitor reported that Serb officers--\nfrom Serbia--actively participated in the massacre of Moslems from \nSrebrenica.\n  No doubt about it, General Mladic and his forces are directly \nresponsible for these war crimes. But, these reports beg the question: \nWhat was the role of the Yugoslav Army in this attack on Srebrenica and \nthe subsequent massacre of Moslems. And more importantly, what was \nSlobodan Milosevic's role in these savage war crimes?\n  Reportedly Mladic is often in Belgrade--where he coordinates with \nsenior Serb officers, including the Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav \nArmy. The Yugoslav Army has continued to actively assist Bosnian Serb \nforces. And Bosnian Serb and Serb air defenses are integrated.\n  The bottom line is that the Congress--and the American people--need \nto hear what the administration knows about the relationship between \nBosnian Serb forces and the Yugoslav Army, and the relationship between \nMladic and Milosevic. Have we been told everything the administration \nknows about Milosevic's possible culpability in this hideous war crime?\n  Frankly, I am highly skeptical that the buck stops at General Mladic. \nIn any event, these questions need to be answered by the administration \nnow.\n  Next week, the proximity talks will begin in Dayton and Serbian \nPresident Slobodan Milosevic will attend. We need to know whether we \nare rolling out the red carpet for a war criminal. We need to know who \nthe administration is dealing with--the butcher of the Balkans or the \npeacemaker of the Balkans?\n\n  Furthermore, the President should publicly commit his administration \nto ensuring that these war crimes will not be swept under the rug as \npart of the price of peace settlement. If Milosevic is responsible for \nwar crimes, he should be held accountable--even if this complicates the \npeace negotiations.\n  Mr. President, if the administration fails to effectively address the \nmatter of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, the Congress will. The \nfiscal year 1996 foreign operations bill includes an amendment I \noffered on the Senate floor which would prohibit bilateral assistance \nto any country that provides sanctuary to individuals indicted the U.N. \nWar Crimes Tribunal on Yugoslavia. It also instructs U.S. \nrepresentatives in multilateral institutions to vote against aid to any \ncountry that provides sanctuary to indicted war criminals.\n  The United States is the leader of the free world--this requires not \nonly political, but moral leadership. We cannot repeat the United \nNations's grievous error of looking the other way when confronted with \nenormous crimes against humanity.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my leader time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 30 \nseconds to thank the majority leader for his statement.\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader for his statement made on \nthese war crimes, these atrocities. I do not believe that those who \ncommitted these crimes should be able to get away with it. I think it \nwould be a terrible mistake for the world.\n  I appreciate the power of what the majority leader says. I very much \nappreciate his focus on the war crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15747-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15747-S15767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. When I heard what my colleague from Idaho said, I \ncould not be in more profound disagreement. The debate is not on a \nbalanced budget, deficit reduction; it is on a Minnesota standard of \nfairness. This agenda here is not connected to the reality of the lives \nof people that we represent back in our States: ``Senator, I am a \nstudent at Moorhead State, I work three minimum-wage jobs. The college \nyears are not the best years of my life.''\n  ``Senator, I am a nontraditional student. I am older than you and I \nlost my job; I am going back to school, and I do not have much money. \nIf you cut my financial aid, I will not be able to get back on my own \ntwo feet.''\n  ``Senator, I am a single mother, and I am going back to school, and I \nhave two small children. If you cut my financial aid, I will not be \nable to move from welfare to workfare.''\n  I hear it in community colleges; I hear it in public universities; I \nhear it in private schools. I asked my colleagues, I say to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, during markup, ``Have you held town \nmeetings in the campuses? Do you know what the consequences of what you \nare doing here in the Senate will be for students in this country?''\n  Mr. President, this is outrageous.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of a \npetition from 515 students at Inver Hills Community College and \nLakewood Community College.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Petition for Saving Our Student Loan Program\n\n       Students are concerned about federal financial aid cuts \n     Congress proposes to higher education. If these cuts are \n     made, they will affect my ability to go to college and find a \n     living wage job. Please help me continue to have an education \n     that is affordable and accessible. The economic security of \n     our nation depends upon a well-educated work force. America's \n     future rests in your hands.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I simply say it loud and clear, and I \nwill shout it from the mountaintop. I only \n\n[[Page S15748]]\n\nhave probably 30 seconds left. If you want to do deficit reduction, cut \nthe subsidies for the pharmaceutical companies, cut the subsidies for \nthe oil companies, cut the subsidies for the insurance companies, cut \nthe subsidies for the tobacco companies; do not spend more money on \nstealth bombers and Trident and all of the rest, and do not have tax \ncuts that disproportionately go to the wealthiest people.\n  Do not do deficit reduction by denying all too many young people--and \nnot-so-young people because many of our students are older--their \nopportunity for a higher education. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Kennedy amendment. It speaks to basic economic \njustice. I hope 100 Senators vote for it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes \n12 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat what I mentioned at the outset, that \nour amendment is budget neutral. We have been asked about that.\n  Mr. President, in the final few moments, I have been amazed by the \nsilence of our Republican friends in defending an indefensible policy. \nSilence in defending a policy that will put a stranglehold on the sons \nand daughters of working families trying to achieve a better education. \nThe most that was said in defense of this indefensible policy, Mr. \nPresident, by one Member of the Republicans, is that this proposal is \n``changing the parameters of the obligation.'' Let me tell every \nworking family in my State and across the country the truth. This \nRepublican proposal is going to mean more dollars out of your pocket \nand more obligations on the students of this country.\n  In the final breath, Mr. President, there is an extraordinary \nreliance by our Republican friends on raising the revenues. In their \nproposal, they put a tax--described by the majority of the Republicans \nas a ``fee''--on every educational institution in this country. They \nwould mandate a tax on every educational institution. The cruelest part \nof all is that the amount of that tax increases as they provide more \nand more assistance to the neediest students that go to those schools. \nThe institutional tax goes in the opposite direction of every \neducational policy that we have made in the last 30 years. It requires \nmore and more payment by the sons and daughters of working families and \nthe neediest families. That is just an extraordinary admission, Mr. \nPresident, of a bankrupt effort by our Republican friends by taxing \nthese working families.\n  In the Republican proposal, working families are going to have to pay \nmore out of their hard-earned income because of the tax increase in the \nEITC. Then, the same working families are going to pay more out of \nscarce resources for the copays and the deductibles we will have to \nhave.\n  Because of reductions in Medicaid, these working families are going \nto pay even more to provide health care coverage for their children.\n  For what reason? To give a tax break for the wealthiest individuals \nand the wealthiest corporations. That is what this is all about. They \nare taking the money out of the pockets of the neediest families in \nthis country and transferring it to the wealthiest individuals. That is \nthe parameter of the obligation that our Republican friends refer to \nwhen they try to justify their position.\n  Mr. President, this bill and these cuts are too harsh and too \nextreme. But, in addition to their cold heart, Republicans are now \ngetting cold feet. The verdict of the American people is coming in.\n  Republicans are being found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of \nhurting senior citizens on Medicare; guilty of hurting helpless elderly \npatients in nursing homes; guilty of punishing innocent children on \nwelfare; guilty of closing college doors to the sons and daughters of \nworking families; guilty of pandering to polluters and endangering the \nenvironment; guilty of massive giveaways to powerful special interest \ngroups; guilty of taxing low-income workers; guilty of taxing hard-\npressed college students to give tax breaks to millionaires.\n  Whatever became of the anti tax Republicans? I say shame, shame on \nthe Republican Party for using their majority power to hurt the vast \nmajority of Americans. This bill will be dead on arrival at the White \nHouse, and we ought to bury it right here in the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Massachusetts has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I hope we have an opportunity to vote on this amendment \nsoon.\n  What is the Chair's understanding about when we will be able to have \na disposition of this amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, if I could answer briefly the Senator's \nquestion. It is a good one.\n  We have been trying to work on this since yesterday afternoon. It \nappears we are very close to agreement that allows us to start voting \nup or down on these amendments sometime early this afternoon and very \nlate into the evening.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield half a minute on the bill?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have heard that my Republican \ncolleagues are trying to doctor up some different proposal on student \nloan cuts. We have had months to change the proposal. I hope we will \nsupport this amendment that represents the best judgment of parents, \neducators, and working families.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis excellent presentation, and I agree with his remarks. I agree with \nhis conclusion. I hope we can move in an expeditious fashion.\n  I yield 8 minutes off the bill to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been puzzled here for nearly a day \nand a half because we have some very important decisions to make in the \nU.S. Senate, one of which deals with Medicare, and we are not voting on \nthem.\n  Reconciliation is a process that provides us 20 hours. We offered an \namendment that does not take great skill to read. It does not take many \nstaff people to read it. It is very simple.\n  It says, ``Let's reduce this tax cut for the wealthy and use the \nsavings to reduce the cut on Medicare for the elderly.'' That is a very \nsimple proposition.\n  It has been almost 30 hours since it was offered yesterday on the \nfloor of the Senate, and no vote. Why no vote? Is it hard to \nunderstand? Are people still reviewing this? No, that is not why. What \nwe have is a stall.\n  I understand we may be getting close to an agreement, and I hope we \nare, because if we are not, we are going to start reading this \nlegislation--maybe two or three times. It is 1,949 pages, given us \nTuesday night to come to the floor Wednesday morning.\n  Most people here do not have the foggiest notion of what is in it. \nMost of us have some suspicion about what is in it. Most of us believe \nthat this, handed to the wealthier families in America, will provoke \nsignificant smiles because they will find some awfully good news in \nhere for their families. Drive a Mercedes Benz, make half a million a \nyear, there is awfully good news in here for you.\n  If you are an elderly person, dependent on Medicare or a poor person \non Medicaid or a middle-income family trying to send your kids to \nschool, or a poor mother who has a child in Head Start, the news here \nis pretty grim. It says we cannot afford you. It says you better \ntighten your belt because this is coming your way, and this is not good \nnews for you at all.\n  I think some of the pieces of the puzzle are starting to come into \nfocus about who is fighting for whom. Whose side are you on?\n  Here are a couple pieces of that puzzle. This was in the paper \nyesterday. One of the new Republicans over in the House of \nRepresentatives says ``the Democrats once again have it all wrong when \nthey claim the GOP's proposed $500 tax credit for families earning up \nto $200,000 is a tax cut for the rich.'' He says those folks are lower \nmiddle class.\n\n       Heineman, former Raleigh Police Chief, told the Raleigh \n     News and Observer that his salary of $133,000 plus $50,000 a \n     year in police pensions ``does not make me rich. It does not \n     make me middle class. In my opinion that makes me lower \n     middle class.''\n\n  This new Republican, this fellow that has new ideas and came with a \nnotion of change says, ``When I see someone who is making anywhere from \n$300,000 \n\n[[Page S15749]]\n\nto $750,000 a year, that's middle class.'' He said, ``When I see anyone \nabove that, that's upper middle class.'' Oh, really? These are the new \nideas? Middle class at $750,000 a year? Now I can understand why they \ntell us their tax cut is aimed at the middle class. Now it is clear to \nme. I understand how these pieces to the puzzle start to fit.\n  Another big piece--in fact, it is the centerpiece for this puzzle in \nthis morning's newspaper--the Speaker of the House, speaking candidly \nto Blue Cross Blue Shield, an insurance company, says this in talking \nabout Medicare:\n\n       Now let me talk about Medicare . . . we don't get rid of it \n     in round one because we don't think that would be politically \n     smart.\n\n  Let me say that again. The Speaker of the House says, and these are \npeople who say, ``We love Medicare; we want to save Medicare.''\n\n       We don't get rid of it in round one because we don't think \n     that would be politically smart and we don't think that's the \n     right way to go through a transition. But we believe it's \n     going to wither on the vine because we think people are going \n     to voluntarily leave it.\n\n  Now, put these pieces into the puzzle and see if you do not start \ngetting the message. These are people who are going to save Medicare? \nNo, I do not think so.\n  Round one. They do not get rid of it in round one. But guess what? \nThis is a 10 rounder, and by the end of this match they plan on getting \nrid of Medicare. This is all about the middle class--yes, their middle \nclass--somebody making $750,000 a year.\n  I said, good news and bad news around here. I was watching Star Wars \nthe other night with my children. I have not seen that for a long time. \nDoes anyone remember the characters in Star Wars, R2-D2 and C3-PO? I \nwas thinking, if children in this society had names with numbers maybe \nthey would do better; right?\n  Let me give some numbers that do well. I said that a lot of folks do \nnot do well in this. A lot of kids do not do well. Fifty-five thousand \nkids, all of whom have names, will no longer be in Head Start because \nthe majority cannot afford them in the Head Start program. A kid by the \nname of Tim or Martha or Tom, they get bad news, no Head Start program.\n  But if you had an initial like a B-2 or an F-15 or a UH-60 \nBlackhawk--go down this list. I do not have time. But this is a list, \nall of which represent spending add-ons; in other words, money that the \nDefense Department did not ask for, for helicopters, amphibious ships, \nfighters, bombers, star wars, and on and on and on that the Defense \nDepartment said they did not want, they did not need, and they did not \norder.\n  Guess what? The conservatives say, ``We insist you buy it because we \ngot the money to pay for it.'' And then they bring 2,000 pages out here \nto the floor and say, ``We are sorry. We are broke. You are poor? You \nare young? Out of luck.''\n  So we say to them on Medicare, on our first amendment, offered nearly \n30 hours ago, how about establishing priorities here? How about at \nleast forgetting the tax cut notion you got for the wealthiest \nAmericans and using some of that money to provide Medicare for the \nelderly? Do you know what, 30 hours later we cannot get a vote. Why can \nwe not get a vote? Is it because they cannot understand the amendment? \nNo. It is because they are stalling. They do not want to vote on the \namendment.\n\n  One way or another, somehow we are going to vote on this amendment. \nWe might stand here for 6 days, but we are going to vote on this \namendment, and we are going to vote on the education amendment, and we \nare going to vote on the next amendment which is fiscal responsibility, \nwhich says do not give a tax cut until we have a balanced budget.\n  I am a little disappointed about what has been going on the last 30 \nhours. I can understand a shuffle when I see it. I can understand a \nstall when I see it. But nobody ought to claim to us they do not \nunderstand this issue. After 30 hours you would think everybody \nunderstands it well enough to have a vote.\n  So, it is 10 minutes to 1. How about a vote at 1 o'clock? Why do you \nnot give the elderly in this country an opportunity? Express yourselves \nand give us an opportunity to express ourselves about tax cuts for the \nrich and Medicare cuts for the rest? Let us decide if we are going to \nhave a vote soon.\n  If we are near an agreement, I say fine. I want us to have an \nagreement and get through this. But I say, at the end stage of this \nprocess, that I happen to know and all of you in this room know what is \nreally at work. We have a Medicare amendment on the floor. The Speaker \nof the House gives a speech to Blue Cross/Blue Shield. He says he wants \nto save Medicare. And here is what he says in his speech. ``We don't \nget rid of it in round one because we don't think that would be \npolitically smart.''\n  We understand what that means about round two. That is why this is \nimportant. That is why there is some passion in this debate, about a \nlot of folks who have reached their senior status in life and fear they \nare going to get sick and they are not going to have the money to deal \nwith that illness. This is important.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I am sorry. Another 30 seconds. I am trying to conserve \ntime on this side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I will yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the very \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota. What is the date of that \nspeech the Speaker made when he said that this is only round one to get \nrid of Medicare?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The speech apparently was given the other night, October \n24.\n  Mr. SARBANES. On the same day, October 24, Senator Dole made a \nspeech. Listen to this. ``I was there, fighting the fight, voting \nagainst Medicare--1 of 12--because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.''\n  So you have the Republican leader in the Senate and the Republican \nleader in the House, both of whom have been trying to portray \nthemselves as helping Medicare, now bragging about the fact that they \nare against Medicare or that this is only the first round in getting \nrid of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator 30 seconds \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, as I understand it we are now prepared to go \nto the next item that will be offered by the Senator from Arkansas with \n30 minutes equally divided; is that correct?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes. We are prepared to do that.\n  Mr. EXON. So I hope the Chair could recognize the Senator from \nArkansas, following 1\\1/2\\ minutes that I would like to yield at this \ntime to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have repeatedly said on the Senate floor \nthat balancing the Federal budget is so important we need to set our \npartisan differences aside.\n  Unfortunately, balancing the budget was the most serious problem \nfacing our country--until today.\n  The American people are fed up with Washington--and how can you blame \nthem.\n  The single working mother who is holding two jobs to take care of her \nchildren should expect nothing less than having the Federal Government \npay its own bills.\n  Vermonters must balance their checkbooks each month, why should the \nGovernment that they send their taxes to not be held to the same \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, Republicans laud this budget reconciliation bill that \nwe are debating today as the solution to the deficit problem.\n  Well, this bill may balance the budget but the wake it leaves behind \nthreatens to irreparably divide our country. This bill is a cruel prank \non hard working Americans who have asked Congress to get our budget in \norder.\n  The Republican leadership has answered the call to balance the budget \nwith a plan that radically redistributes the wealth of our country.\n  Playing on the desires of hard working Americans, the Republican \nleadership has seized the opportunity to protect the wealthiest in our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S15750]]\n\n  This plan balances the budget on the backs of the people who are \nworking the longest hours, in the lowest paying jobs.\n  Ironically, as these Americans have shouted out the loudest about \ngetting our fiscal books in order, they will be the ones who feel the \npain the most.\n  Under the guise of saving Americans from the burden of debt, the \nRepublican leadership has devastated programs that help hard working \nmen and women realize the American dream of economic opportunity.\n  We are told that in order to save programs, we must first kill them \nso that 7 years from now they will emerge solvent and robust.\n  It is a leap of faith that I cannot make, much to my embarrassment, \nbecause my distinguished colleagues in the majority have been telling \nus what a bold and courageous moment in time that they are seizing.\n  They are the self appointed saviors out to rescue us from the \ntrillions of dollars of debt accrued during the Reagan-Bush \nadministrations. They never mention that latter part--no doubt an \noversight--and in the press of time, it is perfectly understandable why \nthe subject never arises.\n  A case in point is education. This bill makes short-sighted cuts in \neducation. It cuts student loan programs by $10 billion over the next 7 \nyears.\n  Students will be hit with 70 percent of these cuts--increasing the \ncosts to the 20,000 Vermonters receiving higher education and their \nfamilies by at least $5,800 over the life of a student loan.\n  Congress should be working to make education more affordable--not \nless.\n  These additional financial burdens will discourage many students from \ncontinuing their education after high school.\n  The Contract With America has sealed the fate of the next generation \nof Americans. They may never have the chance of post high school \ntraining or a college education--the key to a better paying job.\n  Mr. President, the list of programs that the Republican leadership \nare slashing under the thin guise of reform is long.\n  This bill is a back door version of the New Federalism, the short-\nlived brainchild that was the predecessor of the Contract With America. \nCongress piles up the rhetoric while dumping the tough decisions on the \nStates.\n  Governors are increasingly wary of this, because the cost for \nmaintaining any of these programs will rest squarely on the local \ntaxpayers.\n  We know that Medicaid is a life-line to provide essential health care \nto low-income pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly.\n  It is also the safety net that rescues middle-class families when a \nfactory closes down and the jobs that are available do not provide \nhealth insurance.\n  It spares middle-class families from choosing between nursing home \ncare for a parent or financing the college education of a son or \ndaughter.\n  I think we all agree that the Medicaid reform proposal before us \nturns the program over to the States, at greatly reduced funding \nlevels.\n  Despite all the disclaimers from its supporters, I remain unconvinced \nthat it is anything more than a recurrence of policies that once made \npoor farms and orphanages the sanctuaries for low-income children and \nfamilies in America.\n  I agree that States should have more flexibility, but not at the cost \nof our national responsibility. Our States will find themselves \nhundreds of millions of dollars short of funds to provide necessary \nhealth care over the next 7 years.\n  Vermont already has flexibility through the Federal waiver process.\n  Vermont's plan continues the Federal/State partnership nature of \nMedicaid and enables Vermont to cover 15,000 more of the State's \ngrowing number of uninsured.\n  This bill will nullify Vermont's initiatives to administer the \nprogram more economically.\n  The budgetary pressure on States to make cuts in eligibility and \nbenefits will be very strong. On average, States will lose 30 percent \nof their Federal Medicaid payments by the year 2002.\n  There is no provision in this bill that would provide Vermont, or any \nState, with additional resources in times of economic downturn or \nrecession when the Medicaid rolls have historically increased.\n  Vermont will lose 10 percent on average over the next 7 years and \ncuts are backloaded so that Vermont will lose 27 percent in the year \n2002.\n  This cut is estimated to reduce Federal Medicaid payments to Vermont \nby $205 million over the next 7 years.\n  If the sharp reductions in Federal Medicaid funding cannot be offset \nby managed care savings or cuts in payments to providers, States will \nhave to cut benefits or severely limit the number of people eligible \nunless they are willing to pay a much larger share of the cost of the \nprogram with State funds.\n  Competition among States may contribute to the pressure to restrict \neligibility.\n  Without Federal standards, many predict a race to the bottom where no \nState wants to be seen as providing broader coverage or more generous \nbenefits than its neighbors.\n  While there was much talk about this bill partially retaining an \nentitlement for low-income pregnant women, children, and the disabled, \nthe truth is that the bill fully follows through on the Contract With \nAmerica proposal to provide no assurance to any low-income American \nthat they will get the health care they need.\n  This fact was certified by the Congressional Budget Office earlier \nthis week.\n  The plan also repeals requirements that now protect nursing home \nresidents from being restrained, drugged, or forced to live with \nsubstandard care in disreputable homes.\n  It replaces these safeguards with 50 separate State regulations with \nno standard minimum requirements.\n  I have been pleading for Congress and the President to join in \nbipartisan negotiations on balancing the budget without jeopardizing \nthe success of our health programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] moves to commit the \n     bill S. 1357 to the Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n\n                   motion to commit with instructions\n\n       Mr. President, I move to commit the bill S. 1357 to the \n     Committee on Finance with instructions to report the bill \n     back to the Senate within 3 days (not to include any day the \n     Senate is not in session) making changes in legislation \n     within that Committee's jurisdiction to delay the \n     effectiveness of any revenue reductions until the first \n     fiscal year in which outlays no longer exceed revenues.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is very simple and straightforward. \nThe Members of this body should vote for this on a purely intellectual \nbasis, without regard for partisanship. That is hard for me to say, and \nI know it is hard for people around here to respond to that kind of \nrequest. But it simply says: Do not cut taxes until you balance the \nbudget.\n  I can remember not too many months ago when that idea had great \ncredence in this body, on both sides of the aisle. I had even hoped at \none time that the chairman of the Budget Committee who crafted this \nwhole thing, Senator Domenici, would join me, today, with this \namendment saying we are not going to cut taxes until we balance the \nbudget. Here is what Senator Domenici said on May 29, this year, just a \nfew months ago.\n  ``We are working through some very, very tough terrain,'' he said, \nacknowledging that most battles lie ahead. ``But I am convinced that \nmost people share our view that we must balance the budget first before \nwe cut taxes.''\n  Here is a chart for anybody who chooses to look at this thing \neconomically and sensibly. Here it is. You cut taxes in accordance with \n$245 billion, the figure that is bandied about here, and if you cut \ntaxes by $245 billion over the next 7 years you add $293 billion to the \nnational debt and our children and grandchildren will pay interest on \nthat $293 billion as far as you can see.\n  I do not want to mix Social Security in this, but when you add this \n$300 billion, also bear in mind there are about \n\n[[Page S15751]]\n\n$656 or $660 billion in Social Security surpluses that are going to be \nused. To say we are going to have a balanced budget when we are using \nSocial Security surpluses, when we are $78 billion short even by the \nRepublicans' own numbers, it is a scam to lead the American people to \nbelieve that we are going to have a balanced budget. If we never have \nanother deficit after 2002, our grandchildren and great-grandchildren \nare going to pay interest on this tax cut.\n  You know, the reconciliation bill provides $5,600 per year--listen to \nthis--$5,600 per year in tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of the \npeople in this country, and the bottom 50 percent wind up with less \nmoney than they had before this reconciliation bill passes.\n  What does that say about the values of the U.S. Congress, about their \nattitude--not toward people with stocks who get dividends and interest, \nbut about working people who sweat and toil every day to keep this \nNation going, who get nothing out of this except increases, lowered \nstandard of living?\n  Do you know something else? This bill stands squarely on the \nshoulders of 50 brave Democrats who, in August 1993, passed a \nreconciliation bill. I want you to think about this. If it were not for \n50 brave Senators who stood on their hind feet and voted to raise taxes \non the wealthy and to cut spending accordingly, the Republicans would \nbe faced with raising another $1.081 trillion to balance the budget.\n  The senior Senator from Texas, a candidate for the Presidency, said \nwe want all of those people in the back of the wagon to get out and \nhelp the rest of us pull. They were. Every single Republican in the \nSenate was in the back of the wagon that day when a lot of people lost \ntheir jobs a year and a half later for doing something so sensible. And \nhere they are still in the back of the wagon taking advantage of $1.8 \ntrillion that the Democrats provided, the most courageous, sensible \nthing that the President of the United States has proposed since he has \nbeen President.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a second for a unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous-consent request \nnot be charged to either side. In order to try to accommodate as many \npeople as possible we are trying to shrink down this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, rather than one-half hour of time on \nthis amendment, it be reduced by 5 minutes each to 25 minutes per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend and say, to accommodate a lot of people, \nwe have subtracted 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, our friends on the other side of the \naisle have the best of both worlds. They can criticize and carp about \nthat bill in 1993, and yet they have never tried to undo one penny of \nit; did not undo the gas tax, did not undo the 36-percent tax rate \nincrease, have not done anything about the surcharge, and they get the \nbenefit of over $1 trillion in balancing the budget because 50 Senators \nstood up--and 2 of them are not with us today because they did; and \nabout 17 Members of the House are not with us today because they did.\n  This tax cut is the height of fiscal irresponsibility. That is the \nreason we call it the fiscal responsibility amendment, to do away with \nthe tax cut until we balance the budget. We have the rest of our lives \nto cut taxes. Our first chore is to keep faith with the people of this \ncountry.\n  If you eliminate the tax cut, you do not balance the budget in the \nyear 2002 even by the Republican figures. You can do it in 2001. That \nwould be shocking.\n  But the most important thing I want to say, Mr. President, is do not \ncut taxes when we are running this kind of a deficit. Balance the \nbudget, and then talk about taxes. When you are talking about tax cuts, \ntalk for a change about working people and real middle-class Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Does anyone wish time?\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Michigan 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arkansas.\n  This tax package which is contained in the massive budget \nreconciliation bill is ill timed. It is inequitable. It provides the \n$224 billion tax break which, when fully phased in, would go \ndisproportionally to the wealthiest among us. Indeed, more than half of \nthose tax breaks would go to the wealthiest 14 percent of Americans, \nand we are talking about the fully phased in tax package. In that tax \npackage, while the upper 14 percent get over 50 percent of the tax \nreductions, 14 million Americans of modest means would actually get a \ntax increase.\n  This maldistribution is reason enough to reject this tax package. But \nit becomes all the more unacceptable when one considers the extreme \nlengths to which the majority has gone to pay for these large tax \nbreaks. Senior citizens are hit hard, students are hit hard, and \nworking people are hit hard. But, above and beyond those flaws, there \nis the simple fact that we in this tax package would be providing tax \ncuts before assuring the reality of the deficit reduction that is \nprojected. In other words, under this bill we would be spending the \nmoney before it is in the bank.\n  We have seen this before. In 1981, President Reagan introduced the \nEconomic Recovery Tax Act which had large tax cuts, and also had \nprojections, aspirations, hopes, and plans that the budget would be \nbalanced by 1984. The tax cuts were not made dependent upon those \nprojections taking place. If they had been, we would have been a \ntrillion dollars better off in those years. But it seems to me that \nhistory is so recent that we ought to take its lessons and say to \nourselves that we have to get deficit reduction under our belts before \nwe enact tax cuts. This time let us make sure that projections of \ndeficit reductions turn out to be true before we do the easier part.\n  On October 18, the Congressional Budget Office Director, June \nO'Neill, wrote the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to provide \nthe critical certification which the budget resolution calls for. The \nclaims of a balanced budget are based on that certification, and the \ntax cut is based on an argument that we are reaching a balanced budget \nby 2002, which in turn is based on that certification. But when you \nread the certification, it is a bunch of hedges.\n  The Congressional Budget Office letter says, ``Based on estimates \nusing economic and technical assumptions underlying the budget \nresolution, assuming the level of discretionary spending specified in \nthat resolution, the Congressional Budget Office projects . . .''--and \nlater on the letter says--``the Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat the resulting reductions in interest payments will be $50 billion \nin the year 2002 and $170 billion over the 1996-2002 period.'' Then the \nCongressional Budget Office says, ``Those projections were based on a \nhypothetical deficit reduction path.'' It is based on those \nhypothetical estimates, projections, that the balanced budget claim is \nmade for the year 2002. But even more significant, for the purpose of \nthis amendment which is pending, it is based on those hypothetical \npaths, projections, and estimates that the tax cut is being defended.\n  This letter does not certify much except that the Congressional \nBudget Office has a long list of wiggle words which are available to \nus. And it is the foundation; it is that certification again which is \nthe foundation for the assertion that the budget is going to be in \nbalance in the year 2002. And you cannot help that because you have to \nhave projections and estimates. But what we can avoid doing is \nproviding a tax cut before we know in fact that the budget is going to \nbe balanced.\n  So what this amendment says is hold off the tax cuts until we balance \nthe budget. In fact, let us put the money in the bank before we spend \nit.\n  And, let's not be fooled by the happy talk about reaching a balanced \nbudget. It is not balanced by any commonsense or legal definition. We \nknow already, as Congressional Budge Office Director June O'Neill's \nletter to Senator Conrad acknowledges, this plan falls short of \nbalancing the budget by $105 billion in the year 2002. This is because \nthe Republican majority's budget uses \n\n[[Page S15752]]\n\nthe surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund to mask the real Federal \ndeficit.\n  The law, section 13301 of the Congressional Budget Act, states:\n\n       [T]he receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget \n     authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for \n     purposes of:\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n\n  And, the law further states:\n\n       The concurrent resolution shall not include the outlay and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under Title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.\n\n  We're not only spending the dollars before they are in the bank, we \nare spending them earlier and faster than we are even projected to have \nthem to spend.\n  Nearly half of the savings in this budget are projected to come in \n2001 and 2002, while the tax breaks are set in law now. In fact, the \nbudget resolution assumes $440 billion in discretionary spending cuts \nover 7 years. Only $18 billion of that would be cut next year, less \nthan 5 percent. We know from past history what happens when tax cuts \nare put in law now while most of the actual cuts are to take place \nlater.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues have appeared, in public \nstatements, to agree that a tax cut should be put off until we are sure \ndeficits will drop as predicted. Let's join together on a bipartisan \nbasis and do just that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Wisconsin 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is simple and straightforward. It \neliminates the fiscally irresponsible and reckless tax cut that is the \ncore of this fatally flawed reconciliation package.\n  All the other provisions of the reconciliation bill, in my view, flow \nfrom this singular act of fiscal irresponsibility. Cuts to Medicare and \nMedicaid, student loans and the earned income tax credit, as well as \nthe other provisions in this measure, all driven by the need to fund a \nquarter of a trillion dollar tax cut, are so out of proportion to any \nconsensus the public would support that I think they doom any hope \ntheir supporters might have of really balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, just as we are beginning to climb out of the hole that \nwas dug 14 years ago, somebody wants to shove us back in.\n  Mr. President, we have made remarkable progress in lowering the \nFederal budget deficit during the 103d Congress. The President's \ndeficit reduction package produced $600 billion in lower deficits and \ngot us about half the way there--almost half the way there to a \nbalanced budget, from over $300 billion to about $160 billion. In fact, \nMr. President, but for the debts rung up during the 1980's, we would be \nin balance today.\n  But we still do not have a balanced budget, and we cannot afford any \ntax cut--not the President, not the House, not the Senate tax cut. We \nneed to balance the budget. That should be our first priority.\n  Actually, Mr. President, this bill is really an alchemist's dream. \nThose who have crafted this measure have finally invented a machine \nthat makes gold. The reconciliation bill really amounts to just that. \nIt is a machine that makes gold. All you do is feed health care \nservices for the most vulnerable among us in our Nation, and out comes \ngold.\n  Of course, Mr. President, not everyone shares equally in that bounty. \nThe gold from this machine largely benefits the best off in our Nation. \nThe better off you are, the more you get. The less well off you are, \nthe less you get.\n  I am not going to dwell any further on the distribution issues \nrelating to the tax cut. As I have noted many times on this floor, this \nissue comes to me as an issue of pure fiscal responsibility. Even if \nthe benefits of tax cuts were more fairly distributed, I would oppose \nit. We cannot afford to cut taxes while we still face a Federal budget \ndeficit of $160 billion. Nobody out there believes that makes fiscal \nsense. It is the opposite of sense. And you cannot spend $1 three \ntimes. You cannot say you are spending the dollar to save Medicare and \nthen you are going to use the same dollar to eliminate the deficit and \nthen you are going to use the dollar for tax cuts. You can only spend \nit once. This budget uses it not to save Medicare, not to reduce the \ndeficit, but to fund tax cuts. For that reason, I regard this as the \nmost important amendment in this process, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if the minority leader has a speaker here he \nwishes to recognize at this point?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Is the Senator referring to me?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. He mentioned the minority leader.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Majority leader. I am sorry; I have a hard time breaking \nthe habit.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will have somebody here shortly. If the Senator has a \nshort speech, we would be ready to go after that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Like the previous amendments, this one is also painfully \nsimple. It is an amendment that will not take a dozen staff to explain, \nan amendment that will not take a great deal of research, an amendment \nthat probably should not take a great deal of thought. No one can \nmisunderstand what this is. This amendment says we ought not do a tax \ncut until the budget is balanced. Do not serve dessert before the main \ncourse.\n  It is a pretty simple proposition. My expectation is they will not \nwant to vote on that either. We have been here 30 hours. They do not \nwant to give a vote on Medicare so we will not get a vote on this. One \nof these days we will, I guess.\n  Let me talk about the proposed tax cut. This is the center pole in \nthe tent called Contract With America. This is the center pole of the \ntent, the tax cut. And I understand why. It is enormously popular. Go \ntake a poll and ask people: Would you like a tax cut? Heck, yes, I \nwould like a tax cut; the bigger the better.\n  So I understand why it is there. This is about polls and focus groups \nand finding out what is popular--let us give a tax cut. I wonder how \nthe American people would feel if they were told that every dollar of \nthis tax cut will be borrowed in order to give it. In other words, we \nare going to increase the Federal debt during these 7 years with this \nplan by $660 billion roughly--this plan, a $660 billion increase in the \ndebt and then a $245 billion tax cut. In other words, every single \ndollar plus much more will be borrowed. We will borrow money, float \nbonds to give a tax cut, a substantial portion of which will go to \nupper income Americans.\n  I think most people would say, well, that does not make much sense. \nBut that is not what this debate is about--sense. If it were about \nsense, we would not even have to offer this amendment. We would have \npeople say let us do the honest work and the tough work, the heavy \nlifting to balance the Federal budget. Let us do that. When we are done \nwith that, then let us talk about the Tax Code, what is wrong with it, \nhow do we fix it, who gets a tax cut.\n  That is not what we are doing. What we are doing is pretending to \nbalance the budget and saying now that we pretend to balance the \nbudget, we will offer up a tax cut. Unfortunately, we have a letter \ndated October 20 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. \nI asked, is the budget in balance in the year 2002? The answer is no--\n$105 billion deficit in 2002. That is, of course, if you take the \nSocial Security trust funds and put them in the Social Security trust \nfunds where they should be. If you take them out and use them as \noperating revenue, then you balance the budget.\n  I guess those who took remedial accounting and believe that double \nentry \n\n[[Page S15753]]\n\nbookkeeping means you can use money twice in two different places at \nthe same time, I guess they are comfortable and they can sleep with \nthis. But, of course, if you were in private business and said, let me \ntake the money out of my employees' pension funds and use it on my \noperating statement, you would be doing years at hard tennis at some \nminimum security prison. Instead, it is ``budget technique'' to say, \nlet us misuse Social Security trust funds, show a balanced budget in \nthe year 2002 by misusing that money, and then claim we have a balanced \nbudget so we are going to give a tax cut. Every single dollar of this \ntax cut will be borrowed in the next 7 years and every Member of this \nSenate knows it. They can pretend they did not hear or they did not \nknow; it escaped their attention. But they know it. This amendment is \nvery simple. It is called a ``fiscal responsibility amendment.'' It \nsays, let us do the tough, honest work first, get the budget balanced, \nreally balanced, and then let us decide how to fix our tax system.\n  Having said all of that, I hope one of these hours we will get a vote \nfirst on Medicare and then on the sequential amendments because these \nare not difficult for anybody to understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need. I \nwill be very brief, and then I will yield further time on our side.\n  Mr. President, the fact is it is not surprising that the minority is \narguing against tax cuts. They are the party that raised taxes in this \ncountry in the last Congress by a record-setting $270 billion. In my \nState and across America, everywhere I go, the people I talk to say we \nneed a tax cut to make ends meet. The middle-class squeeze we talk \nabout on the floor all the time is in no small measure the result of \nthe fact that today in America average families send $1 to Washington \nfor every $4 they earn versus $1 for every $50 they earned back in the \n1950's and the 1960's. Those are the families who are paying the bills \nand paying the taxes.\n  As we go through the belt-tightening process here in Washington to \nbring down the deficit, we believe it is only fair to let those hard-\nworking families keep more of what they earn. What we have been \npresented with today is an amendment that says to all of those \nfamilies: Wait. Wait, American families, hard-working families, for \nyour $500 tax credit. Wait, spouses who work in the home, before you \nget your IRA. Wait, to people who want to adopt and need a little help \nmaking an adoption feasible. Wait, to jobseekers who need the \nopportunities created by progrowth tax cuts.\n  We believe the waiting should be over. We say this: If America's \ntaxpayers want to wait for the Democrats and President Clinton to \nproduce a tax cut, fine. But we have already gone through a lot of \nwaiting for the tax cut that was promised in the 1992 campaign by the \nPresident. It has never been delivered. The waiting that this amendment \nsuggests will have to continue will also be undelivered. We are \nprepared to allow hard-working families to realize tax savings now.\n  At this time I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we have entered a new age in American \npolitics. All of us know that. The days are long gone when elected \nofficials can get elected, duck controversy, avoid hard choices, and, \nyes, hide from the judgment of the people. Governing in 1995 requires \nhard choices, adherence to principle and accountability. As party \ndefections increase, as State legislatures and governorships change \nhands, my former colleagues on the other side of the aisle scratch \ntheir heads and ask why. The answer is simple, Mr. President. On the \nother side of the aisle there is no accountability and no willingness \nto make hard choices.\n  Instead, I believe they remain wedded to the status quo politics and \npolicies that have led this country to the verge of bankruptcy.\n  For 60 years the other side has steadily created a Federal monster \nthat now handles $1 out of every $4 in our economy. While the growth of \nthe Government that past half century is stunning, it should come as no \nsurprise to all of us. The politics of the status quo promoted on the \nother side of the aisle operates on the simple premise that the \nAmerican people will always trade their freedom and their hard-won \ndollars for the promise of Government security.\n  ``Tax and spend.'' Yes, Mr. President, ``tax and spend, and the \ndocile American people will never resist. Tax and spend, tax and spend, \nand the American people will never support the reform or repeal of a \nGovernment program. Make the American people dependent on the Federal \nGovernment for everything from income and health care to business \nsubsidies, and they will never resist or even reject us.''\n  These, Mr. President, I believe, are the maxims by which the agents \nof the status quo operate. But, Mr. President, the agents opposed to \nchange have vastly underestimated the American people. The reason, Mr. \nPresident: The price of a balanced budget is so high that the American \npeople will reject any politician who attempts to do the right thing \nand bring the budget into balance. They are dead wrong. We are allowing \nfamilies to keep more of their hard-earned dollars, and we are ending \nwelfare as we know it, and, above all, we are balancing the budget. The \nagents of change have a solemn obligation to do the unheard of, keep \ntheir promises. And I believe we will.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to show two charts in the short time \nI have of what parents can purchase with a $500-per-child tax credit in \nAmerica.\n  For example, with a $500 tax credit, items parents can purchase: a \nwinter jacket, $30; winter boots, $30; athletic socks, $6.50, six pairs \nof those; a sweat shirt, $12; books, $100; a tutor for their child, \n$230, 32 hours. That is $498.50. We checked it out.\n  We also have another chart for the $500 tax credit. Parents can \npurchase 847 jars of baby food or, Mr. President, 2,370 disposable \ndiapers or approximately 6 months of electric bills.\n  The $500 tax credit for working families in America is real, and they \nneed it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the fiscal \nresponsibility amendment. Mr. President, we should not cut taxes until \nwe balance the budget. This reconciliation legislation cuts taxes \nbefore the budget is balanced. This is like eating dessert before \ndinner.\n  I support a balanced Federal budget and I have voted for significant \ndeficit reduction over the past 2 years. But reducing the deficit \ncannot be accomplished if we are simultaneously cutting taxes for the \nwealthiest of Americans.\n  This is fiscally irresponsible. This highlights the Republican's real \npriority in this reconciliation bill--cutting taxes for the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  Balancing the budget must be based on principles that uphold basic \nvalues. Protecting our seniors, providing opportunities for our young \npeople, and protecting the ladders of opportunity for working families \nare my guiding principles. This reconciliation legislation violates \nthose principles by gutting Medicare and Medicaid, cutting student \nloans and repealing the earned income tax credit [EITC].\n  The fact is Mr. President, the Republican tax cut would add nearly \n$300 billion to the national debt by 2002. All but the last few billion \nof the tax cut is borrowed money, under the Republicans own deficit \nreduction timetable.\n  This reconciliation bill is fiscally irresponsible--and don't think \notherwise. Requiring the budget to be balanced before we cut taxes is \nthe responsible, fair and principled action to take. That's what this \namendment ensures. This amendment also ensures that future tax cuts \nwill be targeted to low and moderate-income working American families, \nnot the wealthiest Americans. That is why I support this amendment and \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans are fiscally \ndisastrous. I urge my colleagues to vote for fairness and common sense \nand vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have long believed that it would take \ncourage and wisdom to develop and implement a plan that would lead to a \nbalanced budget. Without the courage to make tough choices and the \nwisdom to place budget policy above partisan politics, \n\n[[Page S15754]]\n\nour ability to develop an equitable plan that can stand the test of \ntime and public opinion is severely limited.\n  While I give our Republican friends credit for bringing this package \nto the floor, I must say that a certain element of this plan does not \nreflect courage, wisdom or equity. A particular concern to me is the \ntax breaks which have been included in the bill.\n  Mr. President, it does not take courage to cut taxes. That is one of \nthe easiest votes a legislator can cast. What takes courage is to \nrevisit politically popular tax cuts at a time we have a nearly $5 \ntrillion debt, and even a unified balanced budget is at least 7 years \naway if we get there at all. And for all the talk about fiscal \nresponsibility recently, how can we endorse a $245 billion tax cut that \nmakes balancing the budget much more difficult and adds to the debt \nover the next 7 years?\n  Mr. President, I was one of three Democrats who supported the \noriginal Senate budget resolution this year because I strongly believe \nthat we have a responsibility to make tough choices that are necessary \nto balance the budget.\n  Unfortunately, during the budget resolution conference between the \nHouse and the Senate, fiscal responsibility gave way to political \nexpediency as tax breaks were added up front and the deep spending \nreductions moved into the next century. Were these particular changes \nwise? In my judgment, absolutely not.\n  I think most in this Chamber would agree we should not be cutting \ntaxes until we prove capable of carrying out these spending reductions \nand actually balance the budget.\n  If we get further down the road and decide spending reductions, \nparticularly Medicare and Medicaid, in this plan are politically \nunsustainable, I fear, Mr. President, that we will abandon the spending \ncuts and leave the tax cuts in place at a time when their cost will \nbegin to explode. And as we have seen before, the end result will be we \nwill simply be further away from a balanced budget.\n  The last point I would like to address is equity. Including the tax \ncut in this plan is not equitable. At a time when we are asking the \nAmerican public to sacrifice by restraining the growth of programs \nwhich benefit low- and-moderate-income individuals, how can we, in good \nconscience, adopt a tax cut which, according to the Treasury Department \nestimates, will disproportionately benefit upper-income Americans? I \nsimply cannot agree.\n  Including $245 billion in tax cuts in this budget package is not \ncourageous, it is not wise, and it not equitable. I would implore my \ncolleagues to reject the proposition that we should have tax cuts \nbefore we have a balanced budget.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n\n\n        your're right mr. president, you raised taxes too much!\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, why after shackling American middle-class \nfamilies with the largest tax increase in history, has Bill Clinton \nfinally admitted that he made a mistake? Why does his confession come \njust days before Congressional Republicans are scheduled to meet in \nconference to finish one of the largest tax cut proposals since the \nKemp-Roth income tax rate reductions brought our economy roaring back \nin the 1980's?\n  Because Bill Clinton knows his taxes did not deliver on his promise \nto improve the economy, bring down interest rates, and thereby reduce \nthe deficit.\n  Tax increases never do.\n  History proves that increases actually poison economic growth while \ntax cuts unlock capital, encourage savings, improve investment, and \ncreate jobs, opportunity, and growth.\n  Kemp-Roth led to the longest peacetime economic expansion in history. \nEighteen million jobs were created, along with four million new \nbusinesses. Family income rose and home ownership boomed as interest \nrates and inflation fell. At the same time, Treasury revenues doubled, \nnot because Americans were paying a higher percentage of their income \nto taxes, but because Americans had higher incomes.\n  We must unlock this kind of growth again. Only by creating an \nenvironment where our economy can expand can we simultaneously cut the \ndeficit and meet necessary Government obligations.\n  Last spring the House passed a 7-year $354-billion tax reduction \npackage, 76 percent of which, would go to family relief, and 24 percent \nto job creation. The plan offers a $500-a-child tax credit, encourages \nsavings and investment, and offers other incentives for economic \ngrowth.\n  The proposal recently passed by the Senate Finance Committee cuts \ntaxes by $245 billion, offers relief for our middle class--with over 70 \npercent of the $245 billion going to families making less than $75,000 \na year--and, like its House counterpart, contains incentives that will \nencourage savings, investment, capital formation, and business growth. \nThese provisions mean more jobs for Americans, greater economic \nsecurity for our families, and stability in our communities.\n  Of the $245 billion Senate relief package, a full $223 billion will \ngo to families. The remaining $22 billion will strengthen businesses \nand lead to increased employment opportunity. It will also improve \nAmerica's ability to compete in the global community, with other \nnations that provide their businesses with strong incentives to compete \nwith us.\n  The four pillars of both proposals are: First, a $500 child tax \ncredit; second, restoration and strengthening of Individual Retirement \nAccounts; third, relief from overbearing estate taxes on families and \nbusinesses; and, fourth, reduction of the top rate of capital gains on \nindividuals and corporations.\n  These measures meet our promise to the American people that in \nWashington we will change business as usual. The current system double-\ntaxes savings, thwarts investment, hinders productivity, increases \nprices, stifles wages, and hurts exports. It is complex, controlled by \nspecial interest groups, and places disincentives on work.\n  Our proposals represent a major step toward correcting these \ndeficiencies, and because we have cut spending, our bill balances the \nbudget while making room for tax relief. The House has acted. Now, the \nfull Senate must pass the Finance Committee's proposal. Following a \nHouse-Senate conference to iron out any differences between the bills, \nboth Chambers must pass this historic reform, and the President must \nsign it into law.\n  Americans need relief. Our economy needs a shot in the arm. Even Bill \nClinton has admitted as much. We call on him to join us in our efforts \nto unleash the potential our economy has to move us into a bold and \nexciting future.\n  He admits he made a mistake. Working together, we can fix it.\n  Martin Feldstein, former Chairman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers and professor of economics at Harvard University \nspells out in a very livid fashion what the 1993 tax increases really \ndid in an article in The Wall Street Journal. I request that article be \nincluded in the Record in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Wall Street Journal]\n\n                 What the '93 Tax Increases Really Did\n\n                         (By Martin Feldstein)\n\n       President Clinton was right when he recently told business \n     groups in Virginia and Texas that he had raised taxes too \n     much in 1993, perhaps more so than he realizes. We now have \n     the first hard evidence on the effect of the Clinton tax rate \n     increases. The new data, published by the Internal Revenue \n     Service, show that the sharp jump in tax rates raised only \n     one-third as much revenue as the Clinton administration had \n     predicted.\n       Because taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal \n     tax rates by reducing their taxable incomes, the Treasury \n     lost two-thirds of the extra revenue that would have been \n     collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior. \n     Moreover, while the Treasury gained less than $6 billion in \n     additional personal income tax revenue, the distortions to \n     taxpayers' behavior depressed their real incomes by nearly \n     $25 billion.\n\n\n                             how it happens\n\n       To understand how taxpayer behavior could produce such a \n     large revenue shortfall, recall that the Clinton plan raised \n     the marginal personal income tax rate to 36% from 31% on \n     incomes between $140,000 ($115,000 for single taxpayers) and \n     $250,000, and to 39.6% on all incomes over $250,000. \n     Relatively small reductions in taxable income in response to \n     these sharply higher rates can eliminate most or all of the \n     additional tax revenue that would result with no behavioral \n     response.\n       If a couple with $200,000 of taxable income reduces its \n     income by just 5% in response to \n     \n[[Page S15755]]\n\n     the higher tax rate, the Treasury loses more from the $10,000 \n     decline in income ($3,100 less revenue at 31%) than it gains \n     from the higher tax rate on the remaining $50,000 of income \n     above the $140,000 floor ($2,600 more revenue at 5%); the net \n     effect is that the Treasury collects $600 less than it would \n     have if there had been no tax rate increase.\n       Similarly, a couple with $400,000 of taxable income would \n     pay $18,400 in extra taxes if its taxable income remained \n     unchanged. But if that couple responds to the nearly 30% \n     marginal tax rate increase by cutting its taxable income by \n     as little as 8%, the Treasury's revenue gain would fall 67% \n     to less than $6,000.\n       How can taxpayers reduce their taxable incomes in this way? \n     Self-employed taxpayers, two-earner couples, and senior \n     executives can reduce their taxable earnings by a combination \n     of working fewer hours, taking more vacations, and shifting \n     compensation from taxable cash to untaxed fringe benefits. \n     Investors can shift from taxable bonds and high yield stocks \n     to tax exempt bonds and to stocks with lower dividends. \n     Individuals can increase tax deductible mortgage borrowing \n     and raise charitable contributions. (I ignore reduced \n     realizations of capital gains because the 1993 tax rate \n     changes did not raise the top capital gains rate above its \n     previous 28% level.)\n       To evaluate the magnitude of the taxpayers' actual \n     responses, Daniel Feenberg at the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research (NBER) and I studied the published IRS estimates of \n     the 1992 and 1993 taxable incomes of high income taxpayers \n     (i.e., taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000, \n     corresponding to about $140,000 of taxable income). We \n     compared the growth of such incomes with the corresponding \n     rise in taxable incomes for taxpayers with adjusted gross \n     incomes between $50,000 and $200,000. Since the latter group \n     did not experience a 1993 tax rate change, the increase of \n     their taxable incomes provides a basis for predicting how \n     taxable incomes would have increased in the high income group \n     if its members had not changed their behavior in response to \n     the higher post-1992 tax rates. We calculated this with the \n     help of the NBER's TAXSIM model, a computer analysis of more \n     than 100,000 random, anonymous tax returns provided by the \n     IRS.\n       We concluded that the high income taxpayers reported 8.5% \n     less taxable income in 1993 than they would have if their tax \n     rates had not increased. This in turn reduced the additional \n     tax liabilities of the high income group to less than one-\n     third of what they would have been if they had not changed \n     their behavior in response to the higher tax rates.\n       This sensitivity of taxable income to marginal tax rates is \n     quantitatively similar to the magnitude of the response that \n     I found when I studied taxpayers' responses to the tax rate \n     cuts of 1986. It is noteworthy also that such a strong \n     response to the 1993 tax increases occurred within the first \n     year. It would not be surprising if the taxpayer responses \n     get larger as taxpayers have more time to adjust to the \n     higher tax rates by retiring earlier, by choosing less \n     demanding and less remunerative occupations, by buying larger \n     homes and second homes with new mortgage deductions, etc.\n       The 1993 tax law also eliminated the $135,000 ceiling on \n     the wage and salary income subject to the 2.9% payroll tax \n     for Medicare. When this took effect in January 1994, it \n     raised the tax rate on earnings to 38.9% for taxpayers with \n     incomes between $140,000 and $250,000 and to 42.5% on incomes \n     above 250,000. Although we will have to wait until data are \n     available for 1994 to see the effect of that extra tax rate \n     rise, the evidence for 1993 suggests that taxpayers' \n     responses to the higher marginal tax rates would cut personal \n     income tax revenue by so much that the net additional revenue \n     for eliminating the ceiling on the payroll tax base would be \n     less than $1 billion.\n       All of this stands in sharp contrast to the official \n     revenue estimates produced by the staffs of the Treasury and \n     of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation before the \n     1993 tax legislation was passed. Their estimates were based \n     on the self-imposed ``convention'' of ignoring the effects of \n     tax rate changes on the amount that people work and invest. \n     The combination of that obviously false assumption and a \n     gross underestimate of the other ways in which taxpayer \n     behavior reduces taxable income caused the revenue estimators \n     at the Treasury to conclude that taxpayer behavior would \n     reduce the additional tax revenue raised by the higher rates \n     by only 7%. In contrast, the actual experience shows a \n     revenue reduction that is nearly 10 times as large as the \n     Treasury staff assumed.\n       This experience is directly relevant to the debate about \n     whether Congress should use ``dynamic'' revenue estimates \n     that take into account the effect of taxpayer behavior on tax \n     revenue. The 1993 experience shows that unless such behavior \n     is taken into account, the revenue estimates presented to \n     Congress can grossly overstate the revenue gains from higher \n     tax rates (and the revenue costs of lower tax rates). \n     Although the official revenue estimating staffs claim that \n     their estimates are dynamic because they take into account \n     some taxpayer behavior, the 1993 experience shows that as a \n     practical matter, the official estimates are close to being \n     ``static'' no-behavioral-response estimates because they \n     explicitly ignore the effect taxes on work effort and grossly \n     under estimate the magnitude of other taxpayer responses.\n\n\n                           current proposals\n\n       In Congress had known in 1993 that raising top marginal tax \n     rates from 31% to more than 42% would less than $7 billion a \n     year, including the payroll tax revenue as well as the \n     personal income tax revenue, it might not have been possible \n     for President Clinton to get the votes to pass his tax \n     increase.\n       Which brings us back to President Clinton's own statement \n     (half-recanted the next day) that he raised taxes too much in \n     1993. Congress and the president will soon be negotiating \n     about the final shape of the 1995 tax package. The current \n     congressional tax proposals do nothing to repeal the very \n     harmful rate increases of 1990. Rolling back both the \n     personal tax rates and the Medicare payroll tax base to where \n     they were before 1993 would cost less than $7 billion a year \n     in revenue and would raise real national income by more than \n     $25 billion. Now that the evidence is in, Congress and the \n     president should agree to undo a bad mistake. \n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the Senator from Florida 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have just heard a speech about change \nversus the status quo. This is one place in which we are all together. \nThis is the status quo. This is deja vu all over again. We started this \nprocess of saying that we were going to meet deficit reduction targets \nand committed to the American people our frugality and our dedication \nto their attainment.\n  We did it under what was called Gramm-Rudman. And in the years from \n1986 to 1990, those 5 years, we had deficit-reduction targets for \nGramm-Rudman that were supposed to bring us to a balanced budget early \nin this decade.\n  What did it, in fact, bring us? More enormous deficits. And every \nyear of Gramm-Rudman, from 1986 to 1990, we failed to meet the deficit \nreduction target. In fact, the total amount of our excess deficits, \ndeficits beyond the target, was $201 billion over those 5 years.\n  Did we change that pattern after President Bush went to Andrews Air \nForce Base and negotiated a new deficit-reduction plan? We did not--in \n1991, 1992, 1993, again, failure to meet the deficit reduction targets \nin excess of $150 billion in just those 3 years.\n  Mr. President, we delude ourselves, we repeat the status quo, not \nengage in change if we are saying that we are going to give ourselves \nthis tax benefit before we demonstrate, first, that we have a serious, \ncredible plan for balancing the Federal budget that is not just smoke, \nmirrors and ideas in the minds of a few people, but rather concrete law \nthat has been passed, signed by the President and is a firm national \ncontract and commitment to its attainment, and, second, a period of \ndemonstrated fidelity to that plan and performance under that plan.\n  I am the grandfather of eight young boys and girls. I know one thing \nabout children: They like to eat their dessert before they will eat \ntheir spinach. That is what we are being asked here to do, is eat the \ncake and ice cream before we have the carrots and peas. I think we \nshould not go down that path one more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator from Alabama's speech was earlier. It was \nhelpful. I have to pick up some groceries on the way home. But I did \nnot find it to be terribly helpful in this debate, saying that \nDemocrats have no accountability, that Democrats are not willing to \nmake hard choices, that we are for the politics of the status quo. That \nis just bunk.\n  I just stood out on the Capitol steps a little while ago endorsing a \nDemocratic proposal that balanced the budget in 7 years, making very \ntough choices but without this tax cut. And one of the hard truths that \nwe have to face right now is, the truth of the matter is Republicans in \nAmerica, Mr. President, not Republicans in this Congress, by the New \nYork Times poll this morning, Republicans in America oppose the tax \ncut. Indeed, more Democrats in America support the tax cut. And the \nmost revealing thing of all is that the lower the income goes of \nworking people, the more they favor a tax cut. Unfortunately, they do \nnot benefit from this tax cut.\n  Indeed, as a consequence of change in the earned income tax credit, \nand according to the Republican Joint Tax Committee, every family under \n$30,000 will have a tax increase.\n\n[[Page S15756]]\n\n  It is remarkable, Mr. President, in addition to not needing to cut \ntaxes, we have got plenty of tough choices to make, and I hope we are \nable to vote in a bipartisan fashion for tough choices, that break the \nstatus quo of deficit financing and move us to a balanced budget.\n  But those are not the only goals that we need to move toward. That is \nnot the only status quo that we need to make. We had another million \nAmericans that moved into the ranks of the uninsured in 1994. We have \nanother 1.5 million that will move to be uninsured in health care as a \nconsequence of what is happening in the health care industry.\n  Almost 50 percent of the babies born in the State of Texas are paid \nfor by Medicaid, working people, Mr. President, as a consequence of the \nstatus quo. There are lots of changes that need to be made. I am \nwilling to make tough votes to change the status quo and move to a \nbalanced budget, but not with a $245 billion tax cut that does not \nbenefit the Americans that need to be benefited.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, really what we are suggesting with this amendment is \ntwo concepts here: It is fiscal responsibility and equity. I know that \nthere are those who believe that these tax breaks are critical. Some, I \nbelieve, honestly believe, I think, this is going to create some sort \nof a massive new growth, although there are no studies that I know of \nthat indicates that is the case at all. But the cruel, hard facts here, \nMr. President, are that what we are talking about is a deficit that \nwill increase.\n  According to the hand-selected head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice by our friends on the other side, they have said this produces a \ndeficit, this proposal, in excess of $93 billion. So for those who are \nseeking fiscal responsibility, the inclusion of $245 billion in tax \nbreaks does not get us there.\n  So, Mr. President, on the question of fiscal responsibility, this is \nirresponsible. On the issue of equity, what we are doing here with this \nproposal is we are taking significant cuts, far beyond what is needed \nto restore the integrity of Medicare or Medicaid, in order to pay for \ntax breaks, the bulk of which go to people at an upper-income category \nand simultaneously increasing the tax obligation of those people at the \nworking class category.\n  If you make $30,000 or less, you have got a $352 tax increase. That \nis what is in this bill. It is in black and white, a $352 tax increase.\n  If you are the top 1 percent of income earners, your tax break is \nalmost $6,000. That is not equitable, Mr. President. It is not fiscally \nresponsible, and it is not equitable. And for that reason, we urge our \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just close by saying that I can \nremember when there were about 10 Republicans last summer who were \nstrongly opposed to a tax cut until we balanced the budget. I do not \nthink the majority leader was very keen for it. And the Senator from \nNew Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, was devoutly opposed to \nit.\n  So what happened along the way? I can only conclude that Newt \nGingrich said, ``This is the major part of the contract. You do not \nhave any choice. You have got to abandon all economic reason and sanity \nand vote for this tax cut.''\n  It is the height of fiscal irresponsibility to do it. But even more \nimportantly, it is a social disaster. It makes the working people of \nthis country second-class citizens. They are in the second tier. I do \nnot want to say the idle rich, but the rich who do not work, who get \ntheir income from the sweat of somebody else's brow, they are in the \nfirst-class tier.\n  Mr. President, the real tragedy is the American people are not asking \nfor this. If you look at the New York Times poll this morning, the \nAmerican people are strongly opposed to a tax cut until we balance the \nbudget.\n  Here is a USA poll taken in December of 1994. Seventy percent of the \npeople in this country said, ``We want the budget balanced before you \ncut taxes.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls 19 minutes. \nThe time has expired on your side.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time, we are prepared to yield \nback the remainder of our time. I inquire before I do as to whether the \nSenator from Nebraska is prepared to proceed with their next amendment? \nIf not, until they are ready I will probably be putting in a quorum \ncall request without the time running against either side.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time not run \nagainst either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas, to be taken off our time on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if you are looking at our budget which is \nnow before the Senate, it addresses two basic facts that I believe \nalarm all working Americans.\n  The first fact is that the average family in America with two little \nchildren, which in 1950 was sending $1 out of every $50 it earned to \nWashington, DC, is today sending $1 out of every $4 it earns to \nWashington, DC. And if over the next 20 year, we do not start a new \nspending program nor eliminate an existing one, to pay for the \nGovernment we have already committed to will mean that in 20 years the \naverage working family in America with two children will be sending $1 \nout of every $3 they earn to Washington, DC.\n  Bill Clinton looks at that trend and says, ``Great, let's \naccelerate.'' We look at it and say, ``It has to be stopped and it has \nto be reversed.'' And that is exactly what we do in our budget.\n  The second figure is a very simple fact and it is an alarming fact. A \nbaby born in America today, if the current trend of Government spending \ncontinues unabated, will pay $187,000 of taxes in their working \nlifetime just to pay interest on the public debt. That is not just \neconomic suicide, that is immoral, and we are determined to stop it.\n  Here is basically where we are. We have written a budget that over 7 \nyears comes into balance. President Clinton has trumpeted the fact that \nthe deficit today is down, but he does not show us that his own budget \noffice shows that under his budget, and the Congressional Budget Office \nshows convincingly, that the deficit now skyrockets under the Clinton \nbudget. He has sent us not one but two budgets, and under both of those \nbudgets, the deficit explodes.\n  We have proposed a budget that achieves balance in 7 years, and now \nthe President is saying to us that unless we increase spending on \nprograms that we do not need and we cannot afford that the President is \ngoing to veto our budget.\n  Well, Mr. President, let me say as one Member of the Senate, there is \nno circumstance under which I am going to go back and rewrite our \nbudget. There is no circumstance under which I am going to agree to \nincrease spending, to continue the deficit spree that threatens the \nfuture of our country and that threatens the future of our children.\n  We have proposed a budget that cuts taxes. It gives a $500 tax credit \nper child for every working family in America. What it means is that if \nwe are successful next year, every working family in America that pays \ntaxes that has two children will get to keep $1,000 more of what they \nearn to invest in their own children, to invest in their \n\n[[Page S15757]]\n\nown family, to invest in their own future.\n  Now Bill Clinton says the Government can spend the money better than \nthat family can spend the money. We reject that. We think history \nproves that notion is wrong and we are confident that the people who do \nthe work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in America agree with us.\n  Our $500 tax credit per child, our elimination of the marriage \npenalty will mean that the average working family in my State will get \nto keep $1,100 more of their hard-earned income to invest in their own \nfuture, to invest in their own children, and we want that to happen.\n  We talk so much about balancing the budget, but it has been so long \nsince we have done it that people forget what the benefits of a \nbalanced budget are. First of all, since we are balancing the budget \nand cutting taxes, the first benefit for a working family with two \nchildren is they get to keep $1,000 more of what they earn.\n  But a balanced Federal budget would mean on an average mortgage of \nthe average working family, that their mortgage payments per year over \nthe next 20 years would be $1,664 less per year. In buying a new car \nevery 4 years and financing it, as most working Americans have to do, \nthey would pay $180 less in interest costs for buying that car every \nyear because we balanced the budget.\n  Because we will have more growth when income is going into expanding \nthe economy, that is $1,385 of income for every working family.\n  You add it all up and the average family in America gains, I repeat, \ngains $4,229 a year directly from a balanced budget. It means over 1.75 \nmillion more jobs annually and reducing the national debt mortgage on \nour grandchildren by $66,000.\n  This budget is a choice: Do you want more income, lower interest \nrates, higher growth, more jobs, less debt on your grandchildren and to \nkeep more of what you earn?\n  We say, ``Yes.'' The Democrats say, ``No, Government can do it \nbetter.''\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] moves to commit the \n     bill S. 1357 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days (not to \n     include any day the Senate is not in session) making \n     changes in legislation within that Committee's \n     jurisdiction to reduce revenue reductions attributable to \n     tax breaks benefiting upper-income taxpayers over the next \n     seven years in an amount necessary to avoid unfair cuts in \n     Medicare payments to rural hospitals and other rural \n     health care providers, to maintain federal support at the \n     levels recommended by the President of the United States \n     for federal agriculture and nutrition programs, and to \n     maintain levels of federal support for education and child \n     care in rural America.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nallotted be reduced to 15 minutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of our side, we will agree to \nthat.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the whole country knows about the Medicare \ncuts in this budget, and the threats they present to rural hospitals \nand to health care for seniors.\n  A lot of people know that a few days ago, the House Speaker Newt \nGingrich called this bill the round one in a long-term plan to kill \nMedicare.\n  Many people know how deeply it will cut student loans and assistance \nfor elementary and secondary education.\n\n\n                           the 1995 farm bill\n\n  But very few people know that this year, the budget is also the farm \nbill. It will reauthorize all the commodity programs and the \nConservation Reserve Program. It will eliminate several more. \nAltogether, for the next 7 years, it sets our national agriculture \npolicy.\n  It is supposed to keep rural economies stable. And it should \nguarantee consumers a safe and dependable food supply at a reasonable \nprice. But on the Senate floor today, we have something entirely \ndifferent.\n  I am sorry to say it, but laying everything about Medicare, tax \nincreases on people making less than $30,000 a year, education and the \nrest aside, this is a terrible farm bill.\n\n\n                           written in secret\n\n  First, it is partisan. It is a hard-line, ideological approach to \nagricultural policy, not an effort to bring people together and take \nthe best from everyone.\n  Second, it is secretive. It was written behind closed doors. And \nvery, very few Americans even know it is up on the floor today.\n  At an absolute maximum, the agricultural part of this budget will get \na grand total of 50 minutes for debate. It is a scandal, but it is not \na surprise. Because if this were my bill, I would not want to say much \nabout it either.\n  But in any case, I want to welcome all my colleagues to the debate on \nthe 1995 farm bill. I imagine the other side will be awfully quiet. But \nwe're here to make up for it.\n\n  We are going to use these 45 minutes to tell the truth about the big, \ngobbling, turkey out here on the Senate floor. And then we'll give the \nother folks a second chance.\n  Our motion to recommit will restore the traditional, bipartisan \napproach to agricultural policy. We can work together, restore some \nfairness and moderation. And if we adopt this motion, our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle can have something to be proud of when they \ngo home and talk to their farmers.\n\n\n                        seven lean years to come\n\n  If you have read Genesis, chapter 41, you know the story of Joseph's \ndream. He compared the 7 years to come with:\n\n       seven kine . . . poor and very ill favoured and lean-\n     fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for \n     badness.\n\n  These seven ill-favored cattle ate up the good cattle, just as seven \nears of corn, ``withered, thin and blasted with the east wind'' ate up \nseven good ears of corn. So Joseph could tell that the future would \nbring 7 years of trouble--7 lean years, in which ``all the plenty shall \nbe forgotten in the land of Egypt.''\n  Well, we may not be as wise as Joseph. And the days of inspired \nprophecy may be gone. But on the other hand, we have a lot more than a \ndream to go on. We have hard facts and numbers. And these facts and \nnumbers tell us that our farmers have 7 pretty lean years ahead.\n  This bill makes dramatic cuts in farm supports, which have already \nbeen cut 60 percent in the past decade. If this turkey survives \nThanksgiving of 1995, the year 2002 will see us fund just half of \ntoday's Conservation Reserve Program. Bad for farmers, bad for hunters, \nbad for recreation.\n  The Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance Program will end. Our \ndeficiency payments--the safety net our producers need in tough times--\nwill be capped. In the very worst years, when our producers need help \nmost, it won't be there.\n  Then look at nutrition. School lunch, daycare meals, and meals for \nsenior citizens are all cut. And these are not surgical strikes--these \nare repeated blows with a meat axe.\n  These cuts affect more than farmers. They affect all of rural \nAmerica. Schools, grocers, bankers, fuel dealers, equipment and \nautomobile dealerships, and even our local and county governments will \nall feel the pinch.\n  And we are doing all this at a time when our competitors in Europe \nare not giving up a thing. They already give their farmers over 10 \ntimes the export subsidies we provide.\n  This budget cuts the Export Enhancement Program by 20 percent, and \nmarket promotion by 30 percent. We will end up exporting less, and that \nmeans lower incomes for farmers.\n\n\n                   keeping young people off the land\n\n  Finally, maybe the most painful item of all. That is the apparent \nexclusion of beginning farmers from all these services. This spring I \nwent to a lot of high school graduations in rural Montana. Places like \nGeyser, Hobson, Stanford, Opheim, Harlem and Dodson.\n  We have some great kids in these communities. They are looking \nforward to a career in agriculture like their parents. They want to \nwork and provide for their families on their own land.\n  This bill shuts them out and puts them at a competitive disadvantage. \nCombine that with the trouble young farmers have in obtaining credit, \nand \n\n[[Page S15758]]\n\nthe message they get from this budget is clear. There is no place for \nyou in production agriculture. There is no place for the small family \nfarm in America.\n\n\n                     our amendment: a second chance\n\n  Well, we can do better. And with our amendment, we will do better.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It says, go back to the drawing board. \nTake it back to the Finance Committee. Restore some sense and \nmoderation to agricultural policy, nutrition and our rural economic \napproach as a whole. The amendment doesn't dictate how we should do it, \nbut it gives us a chance to take a second look and get it right.\n  Let us remember the story of Joseph. He saw the 7 lean years coming. \nHe told Paraoh about his dream. And Paraoh listened to Joseph. He \nchanged his agriculture policy, promoted production, and stockpiled \ncorn. And therefore Egypt got through the 7 lean years.\n  We can do the same. if the folks on the other side will listen, we \ncan take advantage of this second chance. We can vote for the motion to \nrecommit, and come back with a moderate, nonpartisan farm policy that \nis good for everyone. I hope it will get the Senate's support.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, there is kind of a joke in Illinois \nthat goes: ``Just outside of Chicago, there's a place called \nIllinois.''\n  That joke, or that phrase, used in the tourism industry, is based \nupon a notion that when people think of Illinois, they often first \nthink of Chicago, and the rest of the State is overlooked. And that \npart of the State, the part ``just outside of Chicago,'' is rural. That \npart of the State has vital agricultural industry. That part of the \nState is where you will discover more rural communities than any other \nState in the Nation except Texas.\n  In fact, when you discover that fully half of the 11.5 million people \nof Illinois live in the places outside of Chicago, that, I think, \npaints a more accurate picture of what Illinois is about than what our \npopular mythology would lead you to believe.\n  The reason I mention that, Mr. President, is that what happens in \nthis bill, in this Reconciliation Act, with regard to rural programs \nis, therefore, vitally important to the State that I was elected to \nrepresent.\n  I hope always to represent all of that State and speak to the \ninterests of rural Illinois--speak to the interests of what we call \ndownstate as much as any other part of my State. That part of Illinois, \njust outside of Chicago, is a part of Illinois that I am determined to \nsee is not overlooked. But being overlooked, I think, captures the \ngeneral feelings shared by many rural Americans this year when it comes \nto Federal dollars and Federal attention this part of the country needs \nand deserves.\n  Mr. President, rural Illinoisans understand the meaning of shared \nsacrifice. No group of Americans should be asked to share a \ndisproportionate burden of cuts any more than any other group. Rural \nIllinoisans have told me, and I have been around my State in town \nmeetings, the deficit reduction should be a priority for this Congress. \nThey understand that no Federal program should be off limits, that \nnothing should be excluded from review, and that everything should be \non the table.\n  However, they also understand that shared sacrifice is something that \nmeans everybody. Shared sacrifice is exactly what this reconciliation \nbill fails to accomplish.\n  Some Americans will see huge and significant tax cuts from this bill. \nBut more than half of all Americans, including most rural Americans, \nwill see no tax cut at all. What is more, the net effect of the overall \nbill is to tighten the economic vise on rural America.\n  The $13 billion in farm program cuts proposed by this bill means that \nIllinois farmers will lose over three-quarters of a billion dollars in \neconomic protection. With $113 million in title I education cuts, rural \nIllinois loses $3 million at a time when many rural school districts \nface a funding crisis. The cuts proposed for grants and loans for water \nand waste disposal programs mean thousands of rural Americans will not \nhave access to safe drinking water.\n  I understand my time is concluded. I would like a further minute to \nfinish up.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. In closing, Mr. President, for rural America, this \nbill, in fact, is ``Robin Hood in reverse.'' The cuts on the rural \nprograms are needlessly excessive, and given the fact that the tax \nbreaks called for in this bill are absolutely inconsistent with our \nobjective of deficit reduction, I believe we should recommit this bill \nback to the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, just outside of Washington is a place called rural \nAmerica, a place populated by hard-working Americans who are willing to \ndo their share--and then some--to achieve real deficit reduction, but \nwho cannot afford the loss of economic opportunities this bill entails.\n  Surely we can do better than this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to talk about safety nets. The \npolicy relative to agriculture is designed around a safety net. They \nhave target price tied to some degree to the cost of production. This \nis a policy that has been established where there is no payment in good \nyears. When you have a bad year, you need a safety net.\n  The proposal in the House eliminates the safety net. The proposal in \nthe Senate puts gaping holes in the safety net for farmers. The idea of \ndoing away with farm programs over a period of time, in my judgment, \nfails to realize the calamities, the disasters, that farmers face. They \nare subject to weather, they are subject to foreign competition, to \nprice changes, all sorts of disastrous effects that can occur to the \nmarket.\n  I think we are making a serious mistake. We have cut agriculture \nprograms from $30 million in 1986 down to $9 million last year. Here we \ncome along with a $13.7 billion further cut in agriculture over 7 \nyears. I think it is too much. We are not doing right by the farmer. We \nare doing away with the policy of safety net.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield a minute of my time to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I want to mention, also, the safety net in regard to \nrural hospitals and the people.\n  In effect, what we are doing under the Medicaid and Medicare \nsituation, we are eliminating a safety net for hospitals for rural \nAmerica. In my judgment that is a mistake.\n  Safety nets go across the board. In my judgment, this bill is wrong \nin regard to what it does to rural America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 2 minutes is hardly any time at all.\n  Let me just put it to you this way. This is thoughtless. This is not \na farm bill. It is not agricultural policy. It is slash and burn. It is \n$48 billion over the next 7 years. It plays off children and nutrition \nprograms against family farmers, against the environment. It is a 50-\npercent cut in the Conservation Reserve Program, which in my State of \nMinnesota and I bet every State, has brought together those that love \noutdoor recreation and the environmentalists and the farmers.\n  This is really, Mr. President, the opposite of a careful policy--the \nvery opposite of a careful policy. What we have here is the worst of \nall worlds--keep the farm prices low, then have some subsidy. Have the \nsubsidy in inverse relationship to need, with taxpayers having to pick \nup the cost.\n  Mr. President, why do we not understand that rural people are not \ngoing to stay out of sight and out of mind? Why are we picking on the \npeople that we think do not have the voice, picking on the people we \nthink do not have the power, picking on people who are not the heavy \nhitters, not the players, are not the big contributors.\n  That is what this is about. We should not have these tax cuts that go \nto wealthy people. We should not have a Pentagon budget that is $7 \nbillion over what the Pentagon wanted, and we should not lavish \nsubsidies on most of the major large corporations and financial \ninstitutions in the country.\n\n[[Page S15759]]\n\n  Rural people in Minnesota, the people of greater Minnesota, ask for \none thing and one thing only: A fair shake. There is no fair shake and \nthere is no fairness to this plan.\n  That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to support this motion to \nrecommit. I am deeply concerned about the Republican budget proposal \nand its all-out assault on rural America. I understand the need to \nbalance the Federal budget. In fact, I've supported balanced budgets. \nBut, I do not think we should do it on the backs of our working \nfamilies and farming communities. They deserve better treatment than \nthat. Just because the voice of rural Americans is not heard as loudly \non Capitol Hill as others does not mean they can be ignored.\n  This Republican budget attacks rural communities in my State of \nWashington on a number of fronts. Republican cuts to Medicare will \nforce 157,700 older and disabled rural Washingtonians to pay higher \npremiums and higher deductibles for a weakened second class Medicare \nProgram. The cuts will increase the severe financial pressure on rural \nhospitals in Washington. The average rural hospital will lose $5 \nmillion in Medicare funding over 7 years, forcing some to close their \ndoors. In addition, the American Medical Association has stated that \nthe Medicare cuts ``will unquestionably cause some physicians to leave \nMedicare''. Rural America is already suffering from a shortage of \ndoctors when compared to the Nation as a whole and it will only become \nworse under this budget. Rural Americans will be paying more for less, \nand that is unacceptable.\n  In addition, Medicaid cuts will eliminate coverage for children, \nnursing home residents, and people in need of long-term care. As many \nas 2.2 million rural Americans, including 1 million children will be \ndenied medical coverage in 2002 if the Republican plan is adopted. \nGordon Lederer, a farmer in Latah, WA, sits on the board of directors \nof the Tekoa Care Center. Patients pay $90/day at Tekoa, and Mr. \nLederer said that the board does not know how the Care Center will \ncontinue to provide service to the community if the cuts to Medicaid \nare enacted.\n  Mr. President, cuts to the earned income tax credit will cripple \nworking families and their ability to provide for their children in \nrural Washington. The Republican cuts to EITC raise taxes on 49,945 \nworking families in rural Washington by an average of $388 in 2002, \nimposing a $1.4 billion tax increase on rural Americans overall. And \nthere's more.\n  The 25 percent cut to farm programs will reduce farm spending in my \nState of Washington by $290 million, drastically reducing support for \ncommodity programs. I am particularly concerned about the reductions in \nthe loan rate for wheat. These reductions could threaten the viability \nof farms in my State. In fact, I just heard from Mack and June Crow, \nwheat farmers from Oaksdale, WA. Their son now runs the family farm and \nthey are deeply concerned about the impacts of the farm program cuts on \ntheir farm's income and hence, their ability to survive. Farms are a \nsymbol of American bounty recognized worldwide. They are a major part \nof Washington State's export-based economy. Most importantly, they are \na way of life that roots us and grounds us in our history and our land. \nTo balance the budget on the backs of family farmers is not only \nunfair, it is un-American.\n  Republican cuts to education programs will deny basic and advanced \nskills education to 937 children in rural Washington. Small town \nschools in Washington are already having difficulty making ends meet. A \n17 percent cut in title I funds will deny these schools crucial \nassistance as they struggle to adequately prepare our children for the \nfuture.\n\n  In addition, cuts to rural nutrition, housing, and transportation \nprograms as well as cuts to programs designed to protect the \nenvironment and public health add insult to injury, and will further \nundermine our rural Americans attempts to secure a solid future for \nthemselves and their children.\n  Mr. President, this Republican plan to balance the budget unfairly \ntargets rural Americans. It burdens them with far more than their fair \nshare of cuts. I therefore encourage my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who care about rural America to support this motion to recommit.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today my colleagues and I offer an \namendment to the budget reconciliation bill that reaffirms our \ncommitment to rural America. This budget before the Senate today will \ndevastate the hard-working farmers and ranchers that provide our \nNation's food supply. It will also decimate the main street businesses, \nschools and hospitals that make up our rural communities. The \nagricultural cuts in this budget are too extreme, are unfair to rural \nAmerica and should be restored. Our amendment proposes to do just that.\n  No one should be fooled. The agricultural provisions in this bill \nrepresent the bulk of the farm bill. Buried in this 2,000-page document \nis the heart and soul of agricultural policy for the next 7 years. \nThere were no hearings during the development of this bill and no \nopportunity for Democratic input. Now we do not even get a vote on farm \npolicy. It is all rolled up in this enormous budget bill. Everyone \nknows this is not the way farm bills have been developed in the past.\n  This farm bill rips the safety net out from under our hard-working \nproducers by cutting $13.4 billion from farm programs over the next 7 \nyears. In South Dakota that translates into a loss of $460 million for \nour producers. Nationwide net farm income is projected to decrease over \n$9 billion over the next 7 years. Clearly family farmers who are \nalready disappearing at the rate of 600 per week cannot tolerate this \nlevel of income reduction.\n  The pain of this budget does not stop at the farm gate. It bleeds \ninto our rural hospitals. Ten to fifteen rural hospitals are projected \nto close in South Dakota if the proposed Medicaid/Medicare cuts are \nenacted. Some people already have to drive over 50 miles to reach a \nhospital or doctor. After this budget goes into effect they will have \nto drive even farther. Add to that the fact that over 2 million rural \nresidents nationwide will be denied Medicaid, and anyone can see that \nthis budget is a recipe for a health care disaster in rural America.\n  The sad truth of this situation is that it does not have to be this \nway. This severe level of cuts was required only to finance the lavish \ntax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans who do not need them. This \namendment my colleagues and I are offering provides the opportunity to \nsend the agricultural provisions back to the drawing board and to do it \nright.\n  Rural Americans deserve better than what they are getting under this \nbudget. Farmers and ranchers are committed to balancing the budget as \nlong as it is done fairly. Reducing farm income to pay for tax breaks \nis not remotely fair. No one is asking for a handout--only as fair \nshake. This budget gives rural America, the very heartland of the \nNation, little more than a cold shoulder. We can and should do better \nthan that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I have said previously, this bill is \nabout choices: 2,000 pages of making choices.\n  All across this country people got up this morning and ate breakfast \nfood. Some ate rice that was crisped, called rice krispies. Some ate \nflaked corn, called corn flakes; wheat that was puffed, puffed wheat.\n  It is interesting. We have folks that raise these crops. They plow \nand raise wheat and corn. Down South they raise rice. Then we have a \nlot of folks that process it--the ones that put the crisp in it, put \nthe flake in it, put the puff in it.\n  The big agrifactories have plenty of reason to smile at this. This \nbill is a really nice deal for them: tax cuts, major advantages.\n  But, the folks who get up in the morning and plow, they do not have \nmuch reason to smile. They get big cuts.\n  The President said $4.2 billion in cuts. We agreed to that.\n  But the Republican majority came along and more than tripled it. You \ncannot write a decent farm program that way. They painted themselves in \nthe corner.\n  So instead of bringing a farm bill to the floor, which we have always \ndone before, for the first time in history \n\n[[Page S15760]]\n\nthey threw it into a reconciliation bill and hoped nobody would notice.\n  Their approach is to say to farmers, do not worry. If you are a \nfamily farmer in trouble, move to downtown. That is their answer.\n  It is not an answer for North Dakota, in my judgment. A lot of farm \nfamilies rely on us writing a decent family farm program. These people \nwork hard, and all they are asking for is a fair shake.\n  We ought not to ask them to bear the entire burden of all the budget \ncuts. They have had a 60 percent cut in support prices alone in recent \nyears. Now we are told to take a much higher proportion of cuts than \nvirtually any other area of the Federal budget.\n  Frankly, it is not fair and it is not right. It ought not be done.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I spent a crisp Monday morning \nat Claude Bourbeau's farm in St. Albans, VT, with Secretary Dan \nGlickman and a number of Vermont dairy farmers. I wanted to give him a \nchance to visit with some hard-working honest folks who will be \nseverely affected by this budget bill.\n\n  Many of those farmers are concerned about this budget. I am too. I \ntold the farmers that they lose thousands of dollars a year in revenue \nunder the Senate Republican plan.\n  I asked the farmers, ``Which of you could afford a cut like that?'' \nNot a single hand went up.\n  It turns out that I was underestimating the impact when I was in \nVermont. Just this morning, the Food and Agricultural Policy Research \nInstitute and Texas A University released a new study.\n  This new, independent study says that under the Senate Republican \nplan, a typical 70-cow dairy farmer in Vermont would see net cash \nincome fall by $9,050--from $31,120 to $22,070--in the next year. The \nHouse Republican plan is even worse--it would cost a typical farmer \n$17,850. Farm income would decline from $31,120 in 1995 to $13,270 in \n1996. Under these plans, typical dairy farmers will lose 30 to 60 \npercent of their annual incomes. These farmers are already working dawn \nto dusk just to get by.\n  These numbers are consistent with a new analysis that USDA released a \ncouple of days ago.\n  When those farmers in St. Albans hear how bad these cuts are, they \nwill be stunned.\n  This budget is a war on rural America in many ways.\n  Over 27,000 working families in Vermont alone will see their taxes \nincrease because the Republicans are scaling back the earned income tax \ncredit.\n  The typical rural hospital will lose $5 million a year or more in \nMedicare. In rural Vermont, doctors and hospitals will lose $290 \nmillion in Medicare funds. I am afraid that doctors will simply abandon \nthe small towns.\n  Schools in rural Vermont will lose $1.2 million in education funding. \nOur schools cannot afford that kind of hit.\n  Republicans want to create giant tax breaks for rich people and big \ncorporations. The average rural family is not wealthy enough to benefit \nfrom the Republican budget. In Vermont, 63 percent of taxpayers earn \nless than $30,000--those are the people who will see their taxes \nincrease.\n  According to Congressional Research Service, over half of all heads \nof households working in the agricultural sector qualify for the earned \nincome tax credit, which Republicans cut.\n  In 1994, 328,000 farm families qualified for the EITC. Many of these \nwere farm laborers, but 100,000 were farm operators and managers. Over \none-third of all farm operators and managers nationwide will see their \ntaxes increase under this Republican budget.\n  This Nation's farmers are struggling, and this budget says to them, \n``Tough luck.''\n  The Finance Committee cut the EITC but it passed over $200 billion in \ntax breaks. Most of those tax breaks will benefit families earning over \n$100,000 a year. Only 3 percent of rural households earn that kind of \nmoney.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this plan for rural America is the \nequivalent of dropping a neutron bomb in the middle of rural America. \nRemember the neutron bomb? That is where the buildings remain standing \nbut the people are gone. That is what will happen in much of rural \nAmerica if this farm plan and this plan for rural America ever becomes \nlaw.\n  The Republican plan would force farmers off the land. In a low-price \nyear, it would mean a 60 percent reduction in net returns to farmers in \nmy State. It would close hospitals in rural areas. The hospital \nassociation in my State has just done a survey and they say 26 of the \n30 rural hospitals in North Dakota would go to negative returns on \ntheir Medicare patients. It would shutter nursing homes and represents \nunilateral disarmament in the world trade battle over agricultural \ntrade.\n  We would pull the rug out from our producers at the very time our \ncompetitors are already supporting their farmers at a level three times \nours. That would be a profound mistake, not only for the rural parts of \nthis country but for the trade balance of the United States.\n  Agriculture is one of the two areas in which we still enjoy a \nsubstantial trade surplus. We ought not to wave the white flag of \nsurrender in this trade fight. We would never do it in a military \nconfrontation. We should not do it in a trade battle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, obviously I rise to oppose the motion \nthat is before us. It may be well intended, but let me tell you, the \nsimple truth is that this amendment will hurt the very people, the very \nrural America, and the very family farms that, according to their \nstatements, it is intended to help.\n  People on the other side of the aisle probably do not intend it this \nway, but the fact of the matter is, with their tax policy, they do not \nbelieve in taxation, they believe in confiscation. Because, when you \nleave high estate taxes, when you leave high capital gains taxes and \nthe impact of inflation on each, you are in a situation where, when you \ntax inflation, it is confiscation and not taxation.\n  The estate tax laws, the way they are--and they have not been changed \nfor 15 years; the capital gains tax laws, and they have not been \nchanged since 1986--are tying up a lot of property in rural America \nthat will not move because people are not going to pay confiscatory, \nhigh rates of taxation. One sure thing, if you do not need the income \nand you do not have to sell, you are not going to sell and give it all \nto the Federal Treasury, because in most of the farms of America, the \nlifetime of savings is tied up just to create an income and a job for \none family.\n  So, if you want to help rural America, we have to transfer the \nproperty from one generation to another, and I do not know how you are \ngoing to do that if you do not do it by increasing the exemption and \nencouraging people to sell their property.\n  People suggest what we are doing in this reconciliation bill on farm \npolicy is wrong.\n  The fact is that the President's budget is not good for agriculture \nbecause it does not achieve balance in the next 7 years.\n  The Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute ran some numbers \non the impact of a balanced budget on farm income. They estimate that \nby the year 2002, under a balanced budget scenario, farmers will save \n$2.3 billion per year due to expected reductions in interest rates. It \nis important to note that farming is a very capital-intensive industry \nand benefits greatly from low interest rates.\n  Furthermore, FAPRI's preliminary numbers indicate that farmers' cash \nflow will increase $300 million per year due to the increased economic \nactivity resulting from the balanced budget.\n  So the net positive impact on farm income from a balanced budget will \nbe $2.6 billion per year. This gain will be lost if we adopt the \nPresident's budget numbers.\n  Mr. President, another vital point that my Democratic colleagues fail \nto \n\n[[Page S15761]]\n\nmention is that their doomsday numbers on agriculture assume that the \ncuts will be made to the program as it is currently structured. They \nwould want you to believe that the Republicans are taking $13.4 billion \nout of farmer's pockets.\n  This assumption reveals a lack of understanding about how farm \nprograms work and a failure to recognize the important reforms \ncontained in this bill. The next farm bill will significantly reduce \nthe regulatory burden on farmers, allow farmers to plant for the \nmarketplace, and continue to aggressively promote new markets and new \nuses for agriculture commodities.\n  Specifically, farmers will no longer be required to idle productive \nland because of a mandate from Washington. Furthermore, farmers will \nhave the flexibility to produce whatever commodity they chose in \nresponse to market signals. These reform measures, along with reducing \nthe regulatory burden and finding new markets for our products, will \nlead to an increase in farm income in the future.\n  It is true that Government payments to farmers will be reduced. But \nthe future of U.S. agriculture must rest on the ability of farmers to \nearn income from the marketplace. The reforms to the farm programs \ncontained in this budget reconciliation package achieve this goal and \nwill allow our farmers to flourish.\n  So I urge you to vote against this motion. I yield the floor and \nyield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have moved away again a little bit and \nhave gone into posturing this afternoon, I guess not unusually. There \nhas been a good deal of misinformation floating around this budget and \nits effect on rural areas with respect to health care. Contrary to what \nwe have heard, there are several provisions designed to recruit \nproviders and to ensure that 24-hour emergency care is available, which \nwe have not had in my State, even though the Senator from Montana has \nhad some in his.\n  It is interesting, also, that several of the provisions talked about \nhere my friends on the other side of the aisle supported last year when \nthey were in the Clinton health care plan--reducing the updates for \ninpatient hospital services, section 4101. The Republican plan does not \napply 2 percent reductions to all hospitals like the Clinton health \ncare plan did. Rather, it receives the 1 percent reduction.\n  The copayment for health care services--this is a fee we have heard a \ngreat deal about--somehow it was not as devastating last year when it \nwas in Clinton health care plan, section 4134.\n  But, happily, there are a number of provisions that are most helpful. \nOne is the limited services hospitals. Frankly, there are going to be a \ncontinuing number of these in rural areas. With hospitals that are \nbuilt relatively close together, you simply cannot support the hospital \nas a coservice hospital because there is not enough utilization. And we \nhave had some experience with this. Under this bill, they can be \nreorganized and downsized into emergency rooms, or stabilizing \nfacilities, and be reimbursed by HCFA--that is a very important \nchange--so that you will have the facility in the town that cannot \nafford to have a full-blown hospital.\n  Medicare-dependent hospitals. The Clinton 1993 budget let this \nprogram expire, but the Republican plan reinstates it. The purpose is \nto assist high Medicare patient loads in Iowa, Wisconsin, Kansas, and \nother Midwest States. But it also has the extension of the sole \ncommunity hospital. The Republican plan plans to extend these special \npayments to hospitals that have 50 beds or less and are 35 miles or \nmore away from the nearest hospital. Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and other \nRocky Mountain States receive the most money.\n  Medicare HMO payments. It intends to put these on an equal footing \nand to put some parity in these payments. These HMO payments in \nMedicare were based on the fee-for-service history. In one instance, in \nBronx County in New York, the payment was $678 a month as opposed to \nSouth Dakota where it was $177. We need to find some equity in that. \nThis program does that.\n  Medicare bonus payments, payments to primary care physicians to help \nhold primary care providers in rural areas, a 10- to 20-percent \nincrease there if they practice in health care professional shortage \nareas.\n  These are the things that are in this bill to help rural health \nareas. Specifically, we have been working on it for several years with \nour rural health caucus, both in the House and in the Senate.\n  Telemedicine grants. We are going to find that we can save a great \ndeal of money and provide better services by using telemedicine. There \nare some grants here that allow for that to be developed as well as to \ndevelop systems within rural States to deliver services.\n  So, Mr. President, contrary to what we have been hearing for the last \nfew minutes, there are some substantial rural health additions to \nassist in delivering rural health services.\n  I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield now to our distinguished leader in \nagriculture, a strong spokesman in our country for agriculture. I yield \n2\\1/2\\ minutes and to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield the remaining time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, in times past, when rural America was hit with \ndroughts or floods, we brought disaster bills to the floor of the \nCongress. These bills were to ease the suffering of rural communities \nin hard times and to help stop disasters.\n  Yesterday morning we were handed this, a brand new 2,000-page \ndisaster bill. But this bill does not cure a disaster in rural America; \nit provokes one. This is a disaster bill for agriculture. We were \nsupposed to have a farm bill this year with a full debate on a sound \nfood and agriculture policy for the Nation. Instead, agriculture has \nnow been slipped into these 2,000 pages--I bet no one has really read \nthe darned thing--and we have had no opportunity for real debate or \namendments.\n  Once again, agriculture is being forced to take unfair and \nunreasonable cuts amounting to 25 percent over the next 7 years --even \nthough agriculture has already been reduced significantly and commodity \nprograms amount to about one-half of 1 percent of the budget. One-half \nof 1 percent, but commodity programs take a 25 percent cut over the \nnext 7 years. Tell me if that is fair.\n  This is a disaster bill for rural health care. We all know that \naccess to quality, affordable health care in rural communities has been \na serious problem for years--especially for seniors. This disaster \nbill, with its drastic Medicare cuts, makes it even worse in rural \nAmerica.\n  This is a disaster bill for America's farm families, who are already \nhaving a tough time making ends meet. Net farm income in real dollar \nterms will be at its lowest level this year since 1986, in the depths \nof the farm crisis. This disaster bill makes it worse by lowering farm \nincome another $9 billion, according to USDA estimates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority controls 15 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we are in the process of trying \nto work out a unanimous-consent agreement that will start us voting. So \nI am going to suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I finish my statement? May I have enough time to \nfinish my statement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mr. HARKIN. For a minute and a half. I was on a roll, and I did not \nwant to stop.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course; 2 minutes. Can the Senator pick up the roll?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will pick up the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is yielded 2 minutes.\n  \n[[Page S15762]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the chairman for yielding me an additional amount \nof time because I did want to make another point--that this 2,000-page \nbill really destroys our basic commodity programs that we have had to \nput a safety net under our farm families. It puts a hard cap on \ndeficiency payment rates, doubles the percentage of unpaid base acreage \nand decimates USDA's ability to respond to price-depressing surpluses.\n  What if commodity prices and farm income fall as they did in the \n1980s? Under this disaster bill, if corn prices fall to $2 a bushel an \nIowa farmer with a 350-acre corn base--which is a modest size--would \nlose over $10,000 of income protection compared to the current farm \nbill. And, if corn prices fell to $1.80 a bushel, which is not out of \nthe question, that farmer would lose over $17,000 in income protection \ncompared to what we have now in the law.\n  Also, this is a disaster bill for hungry kids. The nutrition cuts in \nthis bill are excessive and unsupportable. It is unconscionable that \nthis bill is cutting our commitment to school lunches, school \nbreakfasts, summer meals, and the special milk program.\n  Mr. President, these drastic cuts to rural America are driven by \nideology and not by common sense. They are unfair, unreasonable, and \nunconscionable.\n  Enough is enough. Rural America is already paying its fair share for \ndeficit reduction. So this amendment offered by the Senator from \nMontana is to send this disaster bill back to the Finance Committee \nwith instructions to pare back the upper income tax windfalls, and to \nreduce the assault on rural America.\n  It is time, Mr. President, to put common sense ahead of ideology and \nto put the interests of rural communities over the interests of a \nprivileged few.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, our side yields back its time, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I have been informed by Senator Daschle, the Democratic \nleader, that they will limit their amendments that they will offer \nafter all time has expired, and with that commitment I now ask \nunanimous consent that all first-degree amendments pending to motions \nto recommit and all pending second-degree amendments be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. This will leave the following issues that need to be \ndisposed of by rollcall votes that have been debated yesterday and up \nto this point today: The Rockefeller motion concerning Medicare, \nfollowed by the Abraham amendment concerning Medicare fraud, and the \nBradley motion concerning EITC; the Graham, of Florida, motion \nconcerning Medicaid; Kennedy amendment concerning education; Bumpers \nmotion concerning deficit reduction; Baucus motion concerning rural \nrestoration.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all votes in this sequence \nafter the first vote be limited to 10 minutes in length, with 2 minutes \nfor explanation between each vote to be equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask that Senator Kassebaum or her designee now be \nrecognized to offer a first-degree amendment concerning education and \nthe time be limited to 10 minutes equally divided in the usual form, \nwith no amendments in order to the amendment, and the vote occur \nimmediately following the vote on or in relation to the Kennedy \namendment in the voting sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I further ask unanimous consent that the next 10 Republican \namendments and the next 10 Democratic amendments be limited to 10 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form, with no amendments in order \nto any of the next 20 amendments offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me explain to our colleague where we go after the \nvoting sequence that will occur after 10 minutes of debate by Senator \nKassebaum or her designee. Republicans will be entitled to offer the \nnext three amendments in a row as a result of a previous agreement. \nThen each side will alternate until the remaining amendments, limited \nto 10 minutes each, have been debated.\n  The Senate will then begin voting on those debated amendments, and \nthen begin voting on all amendments Members are going to offer which \nwould have no debate time. We would just offer it. There will be a \nlittle explanation. It will be the majority leader's intention to keep \nthe Senate in until approximately midnight tonight and resume the \nvoting sequence until concluded on Friday.\n  We could vary a little bit either way this evening depending on how \nmuch progress we make. And I have discussed this with the Democratic \nleader. It is our hope that we could finish voting and have final \npassage by midafternoon tomorrow. That will depend, of course, on \nwhether Members on the other side feel compelled to continue to offer \namendment after amendment after amendment when all time has expired. \nBut that will be determined later. And I thank the Democratic leader \nfor his cooperation.\n  I will be happy to yield to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader for that explanation, and \nthat is in keeping with our agreement. We have three tiers of \namendments. We have just completed our work on the first tier, for \nwhich now there will be votes, without second-degree amendments.\n  Once those votes have been completed, we will go to the second tier, \nfor which there will be debate of up to 10 minutes on either side. I \nshould say 10 minutes total for 10 amendments on the Democratic side \nand 10 amendments on the Republican side.\n  That will then expire all of the time. We will then go to the third \ntier of amendments for which there will be no time, and we will \nencourage Senators to write the purpose of their amendments clearly \nenough to allow the clerk to read the purpose and give us the \nopportunity then to vote.\n  We would also expect that on occasion the managers might find the \nneed to explain a particular amendment. But there would be no time for \ndiscussion of that third tier set of amendments.\n  I think this is a very good agreement. It is what we had hoped to \nachieve now for some time. I appreciate the cooperation of all of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I think this will allow us to \naccommodate our work and accommodate many of the priorities we have \nbeen talking about now for several hours.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I just say to my colleagues this would not \nbe a good day to be absent. Neither will tomorrow be a good day to be \nabsent. I assume there will be anywhere from 40 to 60 votes between now \nand tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I inquire of the majority leader when the vote on the \nBumpers deficit reduction amendment and Baucus rural restoration \namendments will occur. I was a little bit confused as I listened to the \nleader read the list and then say the Kassebaum amendment would come up \nafter the Kennedy amendment. There was an ambiguous point as to when \nthe vote on the Bumpers amendment and vote on the Baucus amendment \nwould occur.\n  Mr. DOLE. They will occur after the Kassebaum amendment or her \ndesignee. So it will be Kassebaum or her designee, then Bumpers, then \nBaucus.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And then the other second-tier amendments?\n  Mr. DOLE. Then second-tier amendments. And then third-tier \namendments, which we hope will find a way to the wastebasket.\n\n[[Page S15763]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just one clarification, I ask the \nmajority leader. I would expect that we will vote en bloc on the second \ntier. I wonder if it would not be appropriate to have a minute, 30 \nseconds on a side, just to remind everybody what that series of second-\ntier votes are prior to the time we vote. We may have done that. I do \nnot have the agreement in front of me. We are going to do that on the \nfirst tier with 2 minutes on a side. We vote on the second tier and \nhave 30 seconds on a side just to be sure people understand.\n  Mr. DOLE. I so amend my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. One minute equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute equally divided.\n  Mr. DOLE. Divided very quickly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have agreed to this, have we not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask, yesterday, when the Abraham amendment was \nbeing discussed on fraud and abuse, we heard a comment from your side \nthat it would be accepted. If that is still the case, we can just save \na little bit of time. We are up against time constraints. I wonder if \nthat is still the case.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would want to consult with our ranking member. It is \nmy understanding we would be able to accept it, but let me confirm that \nafter consultation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In any event, we are not precluding that and if the \nSenator could find that out, we would save a little bit of time.\n  Mr. President, I am informed that the other side ought not work too \nhard on that request. It may be that we do not want you to say yes to \nour request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would ask that the quorum call not be \ntaken from either side as it relates to the time available on the bill, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call at this time will not be \ncharged.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It would not be because a vote is pending in any event. \nWe are just following the rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is correct.\n  The absence of a quorum has been noted. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii has been yielded 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about the \nprovisions in the reconciliation bill relating to Medicare and \nMedicaid. In my judgment, the proposals are a danger to the health of \nmillions of Americans. House and Senate Republicans have called for a \nreduction of roughly $450 billion in health care expenditures over the \nnext 7 years.\n  They argue that they are merely reducing program growth, not cutting \nMedicare. But the facts tell us a different story. We have very good \nestimates of what it will cost to fund the Medicare program over the \nnext 7 years. The fact is that more people will become eligible and we \nwill continue to have health care inflation.\n  The Republican proposal would cut Medicare below both the medical \ninflation rate and the private sector rate by cutting $270 billion, for \ntax breaks, from what is needed to fund the Medicare program. We are \nnot just scaling back Medicare, we are eroding its foundation.\n  Medicare experts estimate that keeping part A solvent through the \nyear 2006 requires $89 billion in cuts, not the $270 billion called for \nunder the GOP proposal. Those who want to cut Medicare argue that cuts \nare necessary to get us to a balanced budget in 7 years. That puzzles \nme.\n  If the objective of this bill is to balance the budget, why are we \nsimultaneously considering a plan to cut taxes by $245 billion over the \nsame period? Clearly, the vast majority of the cuts are not needed to \nkeep Medicare solvent, but are needed to pay for new tax breaks.\n  I am deeply concerned about the size of the Medicare and Medicaid \ncuts, and the fact that the savings will be diverted to provide tax \nbreaks for the wealthy. But my foremost concern is the impact these \nproposals will have on the poor, elderly, and the disabled who will be \ndrastically hurt.\n  Under the Republican proposal, Medicare premiums and deductibles will \nincrease, and the quality and availability of care will be seriously \ncompromised. Seventy-five and eighty-five percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries have incomes under $25,000, and the increase in out-of-\npocket costs could make Medicare coverage unaffordable for many. \nFurthermore, the portion of cuts that do not fall on beneficiaries \ndirectly will be borne by the providers who deliver Medicare services. \nThese cuts will be shifted to the rest of the population in the form of \nhigher medical bills and higher health insurance costs.\n  I would also like to discuss briefly the provisions of the bill \npertaining to the Medicaid Program. In addition to cutting $182 billion \nin Medicaid over 7 years, the proposal before us replaces the current \nMedicaid Program with a block grant capped at fixed dollar amounts each \nyear. The bill would offer only minimal coverage and benefits, \neliminate all Federal Standards for providers and delivery systems, and \nabolish the Federal standards set for nursing homes and institutions \ncaring for the mentally retarded.\n  In 1987, national standards for nursing home care were established \nwith broad bipartisan support. These standards were designed to protect \nnursing home patients because of the horrendous treatment many were \nreceiving and because State regulations were inadequate. Yet the \nRepublican plan to cut Medicaid by $182 billion contains a provision \nrepealing the national standards for nursing homes, even though these \nstandards have improved care substantially.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that we must balance the Federal budget. \nHowever, we must do it the right way. We must ensure a basic safety net \nand make adequate investments for the future. I question the priorities \nset forth in this legislation. This bill does not safeguard health care \nfor our Nation's elderly, poor, or disabled; it does not ensure proper \ncare of vulnerable people in nursing homes; and it certainly does not \nmake adequate investments in our future.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that we recognize the tremendous \nbenefits these programs have made in our society and urge that we \ncontinue the fight for dignity and security for our Nation's most \nvulnerable as we work to balance the Federal budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this budget bill is a raw deal for Vermont. \nIt makes deep and unnecessary cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, student \nloans, and dairy programs that will devastate our economy for years to \ncome. And it will raises taxes on 63 percent of working Vermont \nfamilies. This is the wrong way to try to balance the budget.\n  This bill cuts Medicaid by $182 billion over the next 7 years and \nturns this vital program into a block grant to the States. Over the \nnext 7 years, these cuts will reduce Federal Medicaid payments to \nVermont by $205 million. This plan defaults on our guarantee that \nseniors would receive health care assistance when they need it the \nmost.\n  Vermont's acceptance of this enormous responsibility would leave the \nState hundreds of millions of dollars short of funds to provide \nnecessary health care over the next 7 years.\n  The plan also eliminates requirements for nursing homes to provide \nproper health standards, a loophole that will be seized by some to \nlower the quality of care and life in these institutions.\n  It is not an easy decision to place a parent or a spouse in a nursing \nhome, but often it is the only alternative to ensure that they get \nproper care. And it will be even more difficult if the Republican plan \nprevails.\n  The bill cuts Medicare by $270 billion over the next 7 years. It will \ncut payment rates to providers and hospitals, \n\n[[Page S15764]]\n\nmake seniors pay higher premiums and increase deductibles. Vermont will \nlose $356 million in Medicare payments over the next 7 years, losing \n$88 million in 2002 alone.\n  In Vermont, 73 percent of our elderly population have incomes of less \nthan $15,000. And 1 dollar of every 5 dollars of that fixed income is \nspent on health care. Yet Republicans are cutting Medicare and Medicaid \nto finance tax cuts that will mostly benefit Americans making over \n$100,000 a year--less than 3 percent of Vermonters make that kind of \nmoney.\n  Republicans have the gall to tell us that these massive cuts are \nsupposed to ``preserve, protect and strengthen Medicare.'' I think \nWilliam Wells of Rutland, Vermont, who recently wrote to me, had the \nright response to this claim.\n  With true Vermont common sense, Mr. Wells wrote: I have heard \npoliticians say ``they want to save Medicare.'' Their way of saving \nMedicare is like a hunter `saving' a moose by shooting it and having it \nmounted by a taxidermist. It is still there but no longer functional.\n  Let us be honest with the American people. Congress can balance the \nMedicare budget and keep the system solvent--but the cuts must be \ngradual and spread over a longer period of time.\n  For 30 years, Medicare and Medicaid have contributed greatly to the \ndecline in poverty and improved the health of seniors in America. We \nare now asked to turn our backs on the elderly and distribute the \n``savings'' among our wealthiest citizens.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose any plan that attempts to dismantle the \nhealth care delivery system that has served our Nation's seniors so \nwell.\n  This bill also makes short-sighted cuts in education. It cuts student \nloan programs by $10 billion over the next 7 years. Students will be \nhit with 70 percent of these cuts--increasing the costs to the 20,000 \nVermonters receiving higher education and their families by at least \n$5,800 over the life of a student loan. Because of rising tuition \ncosts, Congress should be working to make education more affordable--\nnot less.\n  These additional financial burdens will discourage many students to \ncontinue their education after high school. The Contract With America \nhas sealed the fate of the next generation of Americans. They may never \nhave the chance of post-high-school training or a college education--\nthe key to a better paying job.\n  This bill also makes deep cuts in our dairy program. The Senate plan \nscraps the price support system for butter and nonfat milk and sharply \nlimits the price supports for cheese. Under the bill, the average \nVermont dairy farm will lose more than $7,000 a year in revenue. These \ndairy cuts will deal another blow to Vermont's dwindling family farms.\n  At a time when many working Vermonters are struggling to make ends \nmeet, the Senate Republican budget would hike Federal taxes on low- and \nmoderate-income families by cutting $43 billion from the earned income \ntax credit--a program that rewards work and compensates for low-wages.\n  This Federal tax increase will also raise State taxes in seven \nstates, including Vermont, that have a State earned income tax credit \ntied to the federal credit. As a result, 27,000 Vermont working \nfamilies earning less than $30,000 a year--about 63 percent of Vermont \ntaxpayers--will be forced to pay higher taxes. This is a double whammy \non working families.\n  Mr. President, this budget bill is a raw deal for Vermont. It will \nleave my home State in an economy crisis for years to come. And I will \nurge the President to veto it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act \nof 1995 is proof that this Congress is willing to make the difficult \ndecisions that are needed to balance our Federal budget. That there is \nagreement between Congress and the executive branch, between \nRepublicans and Democrats, and between the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate, of the need to balance the budget at a date certain is a \nvictory in and of itself. While we may not all agree on how to \naccomplish that feat, we are at least all proceeding toward a common \ngoal.\n  This legislation continues the effort that is already underway in the \nAppropriations Committee to balance the budget. To date the \nAppropriations Committee has reduced Federal spending by $24 billion. \nMy colleagues who have worked to put this legislation together know \nfull well that reducing spending is not an easy task. However, given \nthe size of the national debt, all members know that we must act now \nand make those tough choices.\n  The prime example that we are ready to make tough choices is proven \nin this bill's attempt to reign in the exponential growth in \nentitlement spending. Earlier this year I stated on this floor that I \nwas sobered by the demise of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements \nand Tax Reform. The Commission was unable to agree on a specific set of \nrecommendations on how to address the issue of continued entitlement \ngrowth. I am very happy that the taboo of reforming entitlements may \nfinally be gone. Entitlement spending will continue to grow from 49 \npercent of the Federal budget in 1995 to 59 percent of the total budget \nin 2002. Based on these numbers it is clear the entitlement beast has \nnot been slain, but at least the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1995 takes us in the right direction on the entitlement issue.\n  Like many Members in this chamber, I have some disagreements with the \nspending decisions in this legislation ad drafted. One of those areas \nof disagreement relates to the $11 billion reduction in education \nspending over 7 years. Some members have argued that this cut is small \nin comparison to total spending in this area, or that the impact is \npainless on a per person basis. What these arguments fail to consider \nis the critical role education plays in the success of the Nation's \nchildren, the success of this Nation's industries, and the success of \nthis Nation's standing in the world community. Education is an \ninvestment in the future. The Senate would be shortsighted to cut this \ninvestment short. I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure that this \nprovision can be fixed before the Senate finishes its work on this \nlegislation.\n  I am also concerned that this legislation deals a blow to States that \nhave been innovative in addressing the rise in health care costs. The \nState of Oregon began an experiment in 1994 to expand health care \ncoverage to more Oregonians. The Oregon Health Plan, as it is known, \nhas increased access to basic health care to more than 120,000 low-\nincome Oregonians. This has been accomplished by making rational \nchoices about the effectiveness of health care services and making the \ndelivery system more efficient. Already Oregon has seen significant \nresults. Our costs per beneficiary are 10 percent less than the \nnational average; hospital charity care has decreased by 30 percent; \nemergency room visits are down by over 5 percent; and our welfare \ncaseloads have decreased by 8 percent in the past year. Unfortunately \nthe legislation before the Senate would inadvertently penalize Oregon \nfor being innovative in its delivery of medical services. I am working \nwith the leadership to ensure that this type of creativity and \neffective governing is not penalized.\n  There are a number of tough choices in this legislation and the \nauthors should be commended for their work. However, given the fact \nthat 15 percent of the current budget is spent to pay interest on the \ndebt, these tough choices need to be made. We have before us a proposal \nthat will do the job. While I would like to see some reordering of \npriorities in the legislation, I am looking forward to working with my \ncolleagues to assure that a balanced budget becomes a reality.\n\n\n                           Pension Reversions\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to a \nprovision in the budget reconciliation legislation before us that could \nput at risk the pensions of hard-working Americans. Specifically, I \nrefer to the provision allowing corporations to take money out of funds \ndeemed overfunded by the IRS for deductibility purposes, and use that \nmoney for other employee benefits, without paying an excise tax. Of \ncourse, because money transferred in this manner is fungible, the money \ncould actually be used for almost any purpose.\n  The principal problem with this provision is that pensions funds \nconsidered \n\n[[Page S15765]]\n\noverfunded by IRS for tax policy consideration are not overfunded on an \nactuarial termination basis. As I understand it, this means that while \nthe plans have enough money to meet their current ongoing obligations, \nif for some reason the plan terminated, the people who had paid into \nthat plan would have no guarantee that the plan could provide the \npension benefits that they earned over the years. In such a case, the \nU.S. taxpayer, through the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation \n[PBGC], would be forced to step in and pay the benefits.\n  Mr. President, we know that workers are concerned about their ability \nto retire with a decent standard of living. We also know that our \nNation is suffering from a lack of savings and capital for economic \nexpansion, and that institutional investors like pension funds are the \nsingle largest investors in capital. It therefore makes absolutely no \nsense to me to provide an incentive to decrease pension security, \nsavings, and available capital through provisions like the one included \nin the budget reconciliation legislation before us.\n  I think we should be doing more to promote sound pension plans, and \nexpand coverage for American workers. This provision seems to me to be \ndoing just the opposite: putting existing plans at greater risk without \nexpanding coverage. In the time since this and a similar House \nprovision have come to the public's attention, numerous pension \nexperts, including the American Academy of Actuaries and the PBGC, have \nexpressed concern about the effect this provision could have on pension \nfund soundness. I have also heard from constituents expressing similar \nconcerns. For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to strike this \nprovision.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in many respects this is an amazing debate \nwe are having today, a debate I was not sure I would ever see--should \nwe, or should we not, pass a bill which will get our budget into \nbalance over the next 7 years.\n  It is historic. It is bold. It is unprecedented. And judging by the \nreaction, it is real.\n  Unfortunately, $5 trillion in debt has piled up waiting for this day, \nso even with this action, we are still passing on a huge debt to our \nchildren and their children.\n  When I first got to Washington, after coming from State government \nwhere we had to balance the budget every year, I was amazed at the \ncavalier attitude taken by so many about budget crisis.\n  It did not take me long to learn that walking away from budget \nproblems had become so ingrained that success was defined as holding \nthe deficit to only $200 billion--meaning we only added $1 trillion to \nthe debt every 5 years.\n  Unfortunately, that is where President Clinton remains today. While \nwe are willing to put before the public the real questions--when do we \nstop adding to the debt? When do we get serious about slowing the \ngrowth of runaway programs? When will Congress be willing to actually \nsay No to a special interest, or a pet program and say ``Sorry, I'm \nworried about adding to my kid's debt.''\n  No one said it would be easy--but with the leadership of Senator \nDomenici, and the willingness of Members to stand up and vote for \naction instead of just talking a good game--this Senate will soon take \nthat step.\n  Make no mistake, the step is a big one, as for the first time in 25 \nyears Congress has the opportunity to pass a budget which will get us \nto a surplus--rather than just keep adding to our debt.\n  The budget before us is tough. It sets priorities. It recognizes that \ngovernment cannot do it all. And it makes the statement that the time \nhas come for leaders of today to start paying attention to the \nfinancial and economic devastation thy are creating for tomorrow's \ngenerations.\n  We have heard many speeches about the need to cut spending, reduce \nthe deficit, and get our Nation's books into balance. Everyone who \nlooks at our nearly $5 trillion debt recognizes the need to do \nsomething so that we don't keep piling on that debt for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Over the next few days the American people will have a rare \nopportunity to see exactly what the political leadership's visions for \nour country's future are.\n  Too often Congress legislates for the present, ignoring the costs for \nthe future. Political expediency replaces thoughtful debate, and at the \nend of the day it is with shock and dismay that the public finally \nrealizes what has occurred--and recognizes what additional debt they or \ntheir children will be forced to pay.\n  It takes a long time to build up a $5 trillion debt. And even \nstarting today it will take 7 years to get us to a balance, meaning \nthat we won't even begin paying off a dime of debt until 2002.\n  Some would like us to put off the tough choices for a little longer. \nOthers have abandoned finding a solution to the real budget crisis we \nare facing in their zeal to make political points. And still others \nclaim to be on board with the concept of balancing the budget--they \njust don't like our approach.\n  But as I have said before--talk is cheap. If you say you want to \nbalance the budget, let's see your plan.\n  If you say you understand Medicare is going broke, and must be fixed, \nlet's see your plan.\n  Unfortunately, what we have seen and heard so far is much heat--and \nno light.\n  Medicare is one of the best examples. Medicare today is paying out in \nclaims more than it is collecting in premiums. It is only because of \nthe interest earned on the trust fund's surplus that Medicare is not \ninsolvent right at this moment.\n  This means that as I speak, for every dollar a senior is paying in, \nmore than a dollar in claims is being paid out. So why is everyone not \nsaying stop, something has to be done?\n  Next year even including the interest earned on the trust fund's \nwon't be enough to pay out all the claims. Thus next year Medicare will \nbe insolvent, and it will be forced to start eating into its rainy day \nfund--the money which has been built up in order to be available for \nthe baby boomers who start to retire in the next decade.\n  And then if nothing is done, by the year 2002 the surplus will be \ngone and the entire program will be bankrupt and will be forced to shut \ndown.\n  So again I ask, why is the President not saying we must do something \nto fix this drastic problem--not just delay it again like has been done \nso often before--but actually fix it?\n  Why are my colleagues in the Democratic party not saying let us get \nto work on this problem?\n  Instead they want to paper over the problems in Medicare, only \nfiddling around the edges, while making no effort to make fundamental \nchanges in the program as we realize must be done. We want to make \nsavings by giving seniors a real choice--they offer a 2-year bandaid to \nget them beyond the next election.\n  So what does our bill do? It takes on the task of reforming and \noverhauling Medicare--both to protect it for today's seniors, as well \nas preserve it for tomorrow's. It also expands choices, and bring the \nprogram of the 1960's into the health care system of the 1990's. And it \ngives us 25 years of additional solvency--versus the 25 months of the \nDemocrats' plan.\n  How much clearer can the choice be? A thoughtful long-term solution--\nor a get-me-through one more election BandAid.\n  Mr. President this debate is much bigger than Medicare. It is much \nbigger than Medicaid, agriculture, civil service retirement, or \nwelfare. It is about what financial legacy we want to leave to our next \ngenerations.\n  It is about whether people believe that $5 trillion in debt is \nenough, and whether we in Congress have the courage to hit the spending \nbrakes.\n  I hope we do. And hope that the President will find the courage to do \nthe same.\n  Finally, I would like to express my opposition to the amendment that \nthe senior senator from Arizona has indicated he plans to offer.\n  That amendment would, allegedly, eliminate 12 pork programs--a goal I \nwould support if it delivered on that promise. Unfortunately, however, \nthe amendment would target several programs which are critical to our \ninternational competitiveness and our ability to create high-paying \nexport jobs. Let me quickly touch on just a few examples:\n  First, the amendment would require the Export Import Bank to raise \nloan \n\n[[Page S15766]]\n\nfees which would have the impact of making Exim financing uncompetitive \nvis-a-vis other countries' export finance agencies. That means U.S. \ncompanies will lose deals and U.S. workers will lose jobs.\n  Second, it would reimpose recoupment fees on commercial sales of \nmilitary equipment overseas. The Bush administration eliminated this \nfee because it was making U.S. export uncompetitive and costing jobs. \nIt makes no sense to reimpose it.\n  Third, it would cancel NASA's subsonic and supersonic research \nprograms. These programs are aimed at ensuring U.S. aerospace companies \nretain their technological edge into the 21st century. If it becomes \ntechnically possible, it will be economically viable to build only one \nsupersonic airplane. I want that plane to be built by Boeing or \nMcDonnell Douglas, not by Airbus.\n\n\n                        CAPITAL GAINS--FAIRNESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we need to consider some very important \nfacts concerning the fairness of the capital gains tax rate reduction \nin the reconciliation bill before us.\n  We have heard some statements here on the Senate floor over the past \nfew days by some of our colleagues who believe that a broad-based \ncapital gains tax rate reduction somehow favors the rich at the expense \nof middle- and lower-income taxpayers. I want to set the record \nstraight on this issue.\n\n\n                     Who pays capital gains taxes?\n\n  First, Mr. President, let us start by examining who pays capital \ngains taxes in this country.\n  The fact of the matter is that most of the tax returns reporting \ncapital gains come from taxpayers in the lower- and middle-income \ncategories.\n  Since there are varying views as to where the middle-income category \nbegins and ends, I have prepared two pie charts contained within chart \n1 to illustrate who these taxpayers are.\n  The pie on the left shows that, on average, from 1985 to 1992, 62 \npercent of all returns reporting capital gains came from those \nreporting $50,000 or less of adjusted gross income [AGI]. I repeat, 62 \npercent. This amounted to more than 5\\1/2\\ million taxpayers per year.\n  The pie on the right, Mr. President, shows the same information for \ntaxpayers with higher incomes, but still within what most would \nconsider as the middle-income category.\n  As you can see, 79 percent of all returns reporting capital gains \ncame from those reporting $75,000 or less of AGI. On average, this was \nover 7 million taxpayers per year.\n  Capital gains realization is hardly the exclusive domain of the rich.\n  Actually, these figures dramatically understate the number of people \nin the lower- and middle-income categories who will benefit from the \ncapital gains deduction.\n  It is estimated that about 44 percent of all people reporting capital \ngains recognize such gains in only 1 out of 5 years, on average.\n  In 1986 alone, of the 7.6 million returns reporting capital gains, \n3.1 million of these taxpayers reported no capital gains in the \nprevious year.\n\n\n               The ``Occasional Recognition Phenomenon''\n\n  Since many taxpayers do not have capital gains each year, it is \nobvious that there are millions more of lower- and middle-income \ntaxpayers than this chart indicates who will benefit from a lower \ncapital gains tax rate.\n  This occasional recognition phenomenon also illustrates why the \nnumbers cited for the rich are consistently overstated by capital gains \ntax cut opponents.\n  By only looking at 1-year segments, capital gains tax cut opponents \nerroneously conclude that once a taxpayer experiences an unusually \nlarge capital gains recognition in a particular year, he or she will \nstay in the rich category forever. Such is simply not the case.\n  Take, for example, a typical farming couple in Cache County, UT, who \nhas struggled over the years to make ends meet and finally decides to \nsell the farm and move to the warmer climate of southern Utah.\n  Even though this couple may never have reported more than $30,000 of \nfarming income in any given year, in that 1 year of sale they will be \nlumped in with the rich because they reported a $250,000 of gain on the \nsale of their farm.\n  To conclude that this couple is rich because they realized a large \ncapital gain in only 1 year of their life is ridiculous. Yet, this is \nexactly the basis for many of the statistics given by my friends on the \nother side of this issue.\n  One study looked at those reporting over $200,000 of income per year \nfrom 1981 to 1984. Taking just single-year snapshots of the \nrealizations, such taxpayers accounted for almost 40 percent of all \ncapital gains reported.\n  However, when the entire 4-year period was considered as a whole and \nthe occasional nature of recognitions was taken into account, their \nproportional share dropped to just 22 percent.\n  Thus, the more years that are included in the comparison, the smaller \nthe share of gains going to the so-called rich.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President, studies that show lower- and middle-\nincome taxpayers who receive an occasional larger capital gain as being \nrich are misleading.\n\n\n     Opponents ignore benefit to lower- and middle-class taxpayers\n\n  Now, I am the first to admit that some who are truly wealthy will \nbenefit from a lower capital gains tax rate, and rightly so, as I will \ndiscuss in a few moments.\n  However, the impact of the benefits of a capital gains tax cut to the \nwealthy are greatly overstated, while the positive benefits to lower- \nand middle-income taxpayers are mostly ignored by those who oppose this \nchange.\n  For example, a Treasury Department study estimates that nearly half \nof the dollar value of all capital gains are reported by taxpayers \nreporting wage and salary income of $50,000 or less.\n  Moreover, the same study estimates that three-fourths of all tax \nreturns with capital gains are filed by taxpayers with wage and salary \nincome of less than $50,000. Yet, to listen to capital gains tax \nopponents, one could conclude that only the rich would be affected by a \nlower rate.\n  Mr. President, to get a better feel for how many lower- and middle-\nincome taxpayers will actually benefit from the capital gains deduction \nin this bill, consider the following.\n  It is estimated that about 12 million lower- and middle-income \nworkers participate in some sort of stock equity plans with their \nemployers--12 million.\n  Moreover, many millions of Americans own investments in stocks, \nbonds, and mutual funds. In fact, as of September 1994, there were 93.6 \nmillion mutual fund accounts in America. It is interesting to note that \n52 percent of the 30.2 million families owning mutual funds report \nincomes of $50,000 or below and that 80 percent of those families \nreport incomes of $75,000 or below. This is middle America. This is the \nteacher who married the police officer planning for their future.\n  In addition, millions of people in the lower- and middle-income \ncategories own homes and rental properties that could be subject to \ncapital gains taxes upon sale. This bill will benefit all of these \ntaxpayers.\n\n\n                  Capital gains tax rate differentials\n\n  Mr. President, it is well known that in 1986, Congress raised the \ncapital gains tax rates on the rich, from a 20-percent top rate to a \n28-percent top rate. What is lesser known, however, is that we raised \ncapital gains taxes on middle-income taxpayers as well.\n  For example, a family of four earning the median income saw a 50-\npercent increase in their capital gains tax rate. A family of four \nearning twice the median income--and these would be the upper middle \nclass rather than the rich--saw a 47 percent increase in their capital \ngains tax rate.\n  In 1990, Congress once again created a differential between the top \ntax rate on capital gains income and the top tax rate for ordinary \nincome.\n  By putting in a new 31 percent bracket, but keeping the top rate on \ncapital gains income at 28 percent, we once again began to favor \ncapital gains income--for some.\n  The differential was further increased in 1993 when Congress created \nthe 36 and 39.6 percent tax brackets and again capped the capital gains \ntax rate at 28 percent. The result is that taxpayers in the highest \nbrackets currently enjoy a lower rate on capital gains, but those in \nthe 15 percent and 28 percent brackets do not.\n  As you can see from chart 2, Mr. President, this bill remedies this \nsituation by giving those in the lowest tax brackets the largest \npercentage reductions in their effective capital gains tax rates.\n\n[[Page S15767]]\n\n  Note that the wealthiest Americans will get only a 25-percent \ndecrease in their effective capital gains tax rates, while those in the \nlowest tax brackets will enjoy a full 50-percent reduction.\n  Not only will large investors receive incentives to create jobs, but \nthis relief will now be enjoyed by smaller investors as well.\n  It is high time that lower- and middle-income families get some \nmeaningful capital gains tax relief. For the first time in years, \nlower-income taxpayers will enjoy single digit rates of taxation on \ntheir capital gains.\n\n\n                               Inflation\n\n  One of the best reasons for a cut in the capital gains tax rate is \nthat a sizeable portion of all capital gains reported are caused by \ninflation. In fact, economists estimate that on average, about half of \nall capital gains are inflationary in nature.\n  Mr. President, I have never heard anyone try to argue that taxing \ninflationary gains is fair--either for the rich or for anyone else. \nThere is simply nothing fair about having to pay tax on inflationary \ngains.\n  In fact, a tax on inflationary capital gains is not a tax on income \nat all or even on the increase in the real value of the asset. It is \npurely a tax on capital, very much like the property tax, but assessed \nonly when the property is sold.\n  This bill helps to ameliorate inflationary gains by providing a 50-\npercent capital gains deduction. In most cases, this should effectively \nnullify the tax on the inflation element. This is fair tax treatment--\nfor everyone.\n\n\n                            Tax distribution\n\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed \nconcern that the dollar amounts of a capital gains tax cut will go \ndisproportionately to those in the highest tax brackets. Let me make \nthree points about this, Mr. President.\n  First, despite the continual rantings and ravings by liberals about \ntax breaks for the rich, our tax system has gotten more and more \nprogressive over the past years, as illustrated by chart 3.\n  Note that in 1993, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers paid almost 29 \npercent of all income taxes while the bottom 50 percent of all \ntaxpayers paid less that 5 percent.\n  Since 1980, our income tax system has gotten much more progressive. \nIf capital gains tax cut opponents think our system is so drastically \nunfair, I want to ask them a question: If these percentages do not \nsatisfy you, what percentages will?\n  Second, many millions of American families currently pay no Federal \nincome taxes at all. It makes little sense to talk about these people \nin terms of tax relief. A hundred percent of zero is still zero.\n  By definition, it is impossible to give income tax relief to those \nwho pay no income taxes in the first place. If we want to talk about \ntaking from higher-income taxpayers and giving to lower-income \ntaxpayers, let us call it what it really is--welfare.\n  Third, opponents of capital gains tax relief must assume that \nwealthier taxpayers who realize capital gains take the money and bury \nit in the back yard or stuff it into a mattress.\n  Opponents ignore the fact that this money is almost always \nimmediately put back into the economy, where it goes to work creating \njobs and adding to investment capital available for business creation \nor expansion. The ultimate fairness of the cut in the capital gains tax \nis that economic and job opportunities will be enhanced for all \nAmericans because of this bill.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, for the reasons cited in chart 4, I \nfirmly believe that the capital gains tax cut provisions in this bill \nare fair. They are fair for all American families because all American \nfamilies will derive a great deal of benefit from them.\n  I sincerely hope that my colleagues will take the time to consider \nthe points I have made and vote in favor of this much-needed reform to \nour tax law.\n  The bottom line, as I see it, is that our current capital gains tax \nrates are an effective tax on initiative, investment, and planning \nahead--all things that we say we should encourage people to do.\n  It is time for our tax policy to reflect our national values.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two tables referred \nto in my statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tables were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                Chart No. 1--Who reports capital gains?\n\n\n                                                                Percent\nAGI >$50,000, 3.4 million people.....................................38\nAGI of $50,000 or less, 5.5 million people...........................62\n2.9 million people, AGI >$75,000.....................................21\nAGI of $75,000 or less, 7 million people.............................79\nSource: Treasury Department.\n\n        CHART NO. 2--WHO ENJOYS THE GREATEST TAX RATE REDUCTION?        \n                              [In percent]                              \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \nIncome tax brackets:.................   39.6     36     31     28     15\nCurrent capital gains tax rate.......     28     28     28     28     15\nEffective rate under this bill:......     21     18   15.5     14    7.5\nPercentage Reduction:................     25     36     45     50     50\n*Assumes the Alternative Minimum tax applies.                           \n\n         CHART NO 4.--Why Is the Capital Gains Deduction Fair?\n\n       It gives the largest percentage decrease to those in the \n     lower tax brackets.\n       Most of the returns filed showing capital gains come from \n     lower- and middle income taxpayes.\n       It reverses the 1986 capital gains tax increase on the \n     middle-class.\n       It reduces, if not eliminates, the cruel and unjustifiable \n     tax on inflationary gains.\n       It stimulates the economy to create more jobs and \n     opportunity for those on the lower rungs of the economic \n     ladder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15747-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15767-S15770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PMA VICTORY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to declare victory for \nrural community and small city electric ratepayers. I am pleased that \nboth the House and the Senate budget reconciliation bills do not \ncontain any language requiring a sale of the Southeastern, Southwestern \nor Western Power Marketing Administrations--collectively known as the \nPMAs. As I have stated on this floor many times before, this is a \ncritical issue to my fellow South Dakotans.\n  As my colleagues know, during Senate consideration of the Budget \nResolution earlier this year, my colleague from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, and I offered an amendment that expressed the Senate's \nopposition to the sale of the Southwestern, Southeastern and Western \nArea Power Administrations. The Senate voted overwhelmingly against a \nmotion to table that amendment.\n  The balanced budget reconciliation bill now before us reflects the \nwishes of the Senate. The PMAs represent a government program that \nworks. They provide affordable power to rural communities and small \ncities and still manage to turn a profit for the Federal Government.\n  As I have said again and again, sale of the PMAs would have a \ndevastating effect on South Dakota citizens in rural communities and \nsmall cities--and on people across the country.\n  Public power serves many functions in South Dakota. As a sparsely \npopulated State, utilities are faced with the challenge of how to get \naffordable electricity for those who live in small cities and rural \ncommunities where there are less than two people per mile of \ntransmission line. Public power provides the solution.\n  Public power, purchased through the Western Area Power \nAdministration, known as WAPA, costs South Dakotans an average of 2.5 \ncents less than the market rate. This lower cost is essential to \nencourage economic development in small cities and towns. It allows \nrevenue to be reinvested in additional transmission lines, and better \nservice. The availability of hydropower from the Missouri River to \nrural cooperatives and municipalities has helped to stabilize power \nrates. With 7,758 miles of transmission lines in the Pick-Sloan region, \nWAPA can serve 133,100 South Dakotans--without charging them an arm and \na leg.\n  Public power has brought more than electricity to South Dakota. For \nexample, Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency, based in Sioux Falls, \nhas embarked on a program offering incentives for planting trees. The \ngoal is to plant at least one tree for each 112,500 meters in the \nAgency's membership territory.\n  Public power also brings new jobs to the communities it serves. In \npart due to the low cost of power from East River Electric, there are \nnow three injection molding plants based in Madison, SD.\n  East River Electric also is involved in other economic development \nactivities. It provides classes to help the \n\n[[Page S15768]]\n\ncommunity attract new businesses, and offers grants for feasibility \nstudies associated with economic development projects. South Dakota \nclearly has benefitted from the work of Jeff Nelson, the general \nmanager of the East River Electric Power Cooperative.\n  Public power is a South Dakota success story. It is a source of \ninnovation, development, and community pride. I am sure the same is \ntrue in other small cities and rural communities across America. That \nis why I fought against proposals to sell WAPA and two other power \nmarketing administrations. The proposal to sell the PMAs was a \nbudgetary smoke-and-mirrors effort to disguise a backdoor tax on rural \nand small city Americans.\n  In fact, a PMA sale would force South Dakotans--and public power \nconsumers everywhere--to cover for the rest of America. Why? Because \nthe sale of the PMAs could result in rate increases totaling more than \n$47 million.\n  Some argued that the sale of the PMAs would generate revenue for the \nFederal Government. Would it? Let us look at the facts.\n  PMAs still owe almost $15 billion in principal. Also, more than $9 \nbillion in interest already has been paid to the Federal Government. By \nselling the PMAs, the government would forfeit future interest earning \non the outstanding loans.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] recently released its \nscoring of a House proposal to sell the Southeastern Power \nAdministration [SEPA]. The proposal, approved by the House \nTransportation and Natural Resources Committees, limited the sale only \nto actual power generation and the right to market the power.\n  CBO scored the House proposal to sell SEPA at zero--showing that the \nsale would cause no gain or loss to the Treasury. In other words, CBO \ncertified what I have said all along--that a PMA sale would not \ngenerate net revenue.\n  In addition, CBO estimated that the proposal to sell SEPA would cause \nrates to increase up to 75 percent in some areas. CBO noted that the \nsupposed rate ``cap'' included in the House proposal would do nothing \nto protect 95 percent of the rural electric cooperatives or municipal \nutilities that buy power from SEPA from significant rate increases. \nThis proves what South Dakotans have known all along--selling the PMAs \nwould rob rural ratepayers and destroy a vital community resource.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that with strong bipartisan support, we \nfought successfully to prove the worth of public power. We demonstrated \nhow necessary it is to the lives of rural and small city Americans. I \nam proud of the people of South Dakota who have stated their message \nloud and clear--through thousands of postcards, letters, and phone \ncalls. South Dakotans such as Ron Holsteen, Bob Martin, and Jeff Nelson \nhave been leaders in their opposition to the proposed PMA sale and I \nagain congratulate them and commend their hard work. They and their \ncounterparts are the true heroes in this victorious battle.\n  Public power is a solid investment for the Nation. Public power is \none of the great success stories of South Dakota. There is no question: \nFor now, we have won the war for the continued existence of public \npower. This is a victory for all Americans who reside in small cities \nand rural communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Would the Senator from New Mexico suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator.\n  The absence of a quorum has been suggested. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to Senator Kyl off the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. If there is a single vote on which \nthe American people will judge the success or the failure of this \nCongress, if there is a single vote this session that will change the \ncourse of American history, it will be the vote on the Balanced Budget \nReconciliation Act, which is before us today.\n  This single vote will determine whether we finally face up to the \ngrim reality of a national debt that is $4.9 trillion and growing \ndaily, a debt that now amounts to $18,500 for every man, woman and \nchild in this country, or whether we continue the spending spree that \nwe have been on for the last 20 years at the expense of our children \nand grandchildren.\n  This single vote is more important than the votes on the balanced \nbudget amendment and the line-item veto. Those are the tools that will \nhelp us balance the budget and keep it there. This bill actually \nbalances the budget.\n  This single vote will determine whether we keep the promises we made \nto the American people last fall that we would balance the budget and \nprovide badly needed tax relief or whether it is business as usual: \nPromises out the door as soon as it is time to make the final \ndecisions, the difficult decisions.\n  I believe that this Congress, the new majority and the American \npeople who sent us here last year believe that it is different. We have \nspoken, we have worked, we have voted for the fiscal restraint for \nyears but never had the votes in the Congress to prevail. This time is \ndifferent. We finally have the chance and the numbers to prove what we \nsay is what we mean: That Government is too big, that it costs too \nmuch, that it intrudes too far into the lives of our people and that, \nfinally, we are willing to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, this is the most crucial vote that we will cast, and I \nam assuming that the majority of this body will support this Balanced \nBudget Reconciliation Act and put this country on the right course for \nthe next century.\n  I believe this Congress--the new majority that the American people \nsent here last year--is different. We have spoken, we have worked, we \nhave voted for fiscal restraint for years, but have never had the votes \nin Congress to prevail. This time is different. We finally have the \nchance, and the numbers, to prove that we mean what we say--that \ngovernment is too big, it costs too much, and it intrudes too far into \nthe lives of our people--and that we are willing to do something about \nit.\n  Former Education Secretary Bill Bennett probably said it best in \ntestimony before the Budget Committee earlier this year. He said:\n\n       We have created a nanny state that takes too much from us \n     in order to do too much for us. This has created \n     inefficiency, sapped individual responsibility, and intruded \n     on personal liberty.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time to change course.\n  Fourteen years ago, President Reagan embarked on a similar mission to \ncurb Federal spending, cut taxes, and reduce regulation. He succeeded \nin cutting taxes--and that launched the longest peacetime economic \nexpansion in our Nation's history. And, I will talk about that a little \nmore later.\n  Yes, deficits soared. But that was not because of the tax cuts. It \nwas because the majority in Congress at the time did not have the \ncourage or the will to limit Federal spending.\n  In the budget we have before us, spending growth is limited to about \n3 percent a year. Had Congress been able to exercise the same restraint \nbeginning in fiscal year 1982--the first year President Reagan had full \ncontrol of the budget--the budget would not only have balanced in \nfiscal year 1989, there would actually have been a $73.5 billion \nsurplus. Instead, Congress let spending grow by about twice that rate. \nSpending skyrocketed from $745.8 billion in fiscal year 1982 to $1.1 \ntrillion by fiscal year 1989.\n  So even as revenues grew dramatically--from $617.8 billion in fiscal \nyear 1982 to $990.7 billion in fiscal year 1989--the deficit soared \nbecause spending grew faster. A 60.4-percent increase in revenues was \nnot enough for the spendthrift majority in Congress.\n  To my colleagues who say this is no time for a tax cut, let me tell \nyou that the middle-class tax cut in our budget does not come at the \nexpense of a balanced budget, but as a result of one. It is the \ndividend that the American people receive from the downsizing of \ngovernment: the $200 million reduction in the congressional budget; the \nphasing \n\n[[Page S15769]]\n\nout of the Commerce Department; welfare reform; and the consolidation \nand elimination of other programs to name a few.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has certified that our \nbudget meets its deficit reduction target; will help the economy; and, \nas a result, will produce a $170 billion economic dividend. We can and \nshould return this dividend to the people. The $170 billion, combined \nwith $21 billion from the repeal of corporate welfare, and billions of \ndollars in other savings--none of which comes from Medicare--allows us \nto pay for the tax cut and balance the budget. That is certified by the \nCBO, the agency President Clinton praised as the most accurate \nforecaster of budget numbers.\n  My colleagues, taxes are a problem, but it is not because they are \ntoo low; they are too high. Go out and talk to people in your States. \nListen to them. The typical family now pays over 40 percent of its \nincome in Federal, State, and local taxes. That is more than it spends \non food, clothing, and shelter combined. Americans are working more \nthan 3 hours of every 8-hour workday just to pay taxes to various \nlevels of government.\n  Back in 1948, the typical family paid only about 3 percent of its \nincome to the Federal Government in taxes. The budget balanced that \nyear. In fact, the entire Federal budget amounted to only $29.8 \nbillion--about what we will pay this year for 43 days' worth of \ninterest on the national debt.\n  Mr. President, the American people are not undertaxed. They are \novertaxed. They need relief. When politicians say we cannot afford a \ntax cut now, it is because they do not want to give up the money that \nis available for them--for the politicians--to spend. Well, what about \nhard-working families? What about what they can afford?\n  These are people struggling every day to get the kids to school, go \nto work, and pay their bills. To the family with two kids earning \n$20,000 a year, a $500 per child tax credit means a lot.\n  The Heritage Foundation recently estimated that 344,152 taxpayers in \nArizona--more than 28 million taxpayers nationwide--are eligible for \nthe $500 per child tax credit. Heritage estimated that 47,552 taxpayers \nin Arizona--3.5 million nationwide--would see their entire income tax \nliability eliminated as a result of the $500 per child tax credit. \nThose taxpayers are not wealthy, yet they are the ones who benefit most \nsignificantly from the Senate tax cuts.\n  In fact, 83 percent of the tax reductions in this bill will go to \nthose with annual incomes under $100,000, and 70 percent will go to \nthose with incomes under $75,000.\n  The bill includes a capital gains tax cut. A recent study by the Cato \nInstitute found that the capital gains cut will benefit poor and \nworking-class Americans most. The study found that the tax reduction \nwould unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized capital \ngains, thus promoting investment in new technologies and \nentrepreneurial ventures. It would ``expand economic opportunities for \nworking-class Americans by encouraging capital formation, new business \ncreation, and investment in capital-starved areas, particularly inner \ncities, and lead to the creation of more than half a million new jobs \nand increase wages by the year 2000.''\n  People across America are frustrated. They are struggling day in and \nday out to make ends meet, while they watch the Federal Government \nsquander their hard-earned tax dollars on everything from farm \nsubsidies to pork-barrel highway projects, helium reserves, and welfare \nfor lobbyists. President Clinton even wants us to pay ``volunteers'' to \ndo their work--pay ``volunteers'' in the AmeriCorps program more than \nthe average American earns in a year.\n  People in homes across the country are struggling with an oppressive \ntax burden while Congress and the President argue about who is rich, \nand about how much ``we'' can afford to give up in tax revenue. My \ncolleagues, it is the American people--not government--that needs help, \nand this bill takes a small, but meaningful, step in that direction.\n  This bill is not radical or draconian. In fact, the tax cuts will \ntotal $245 billion over 7 years--just 2 percent of the total amount \nthat the Federal Government will collect over that period. It is \nmodest, and if the American people knew we were having such a battle \nover just 2 percent, they would be stunned.\n  Throughout the debate over the next few days, we will hear a lot \nabout tax cuts for the rich. Whenever politicians start to object to \ntax bills because they do not tax the ``rich'' enough, or they provide \ntoo much relief for the ``rich,'' middle America better hold onto its \nwallet. As I pointed out before, more than 70 percent of the benefit of \nthis cut goes to those with annual incomes of less than $75,000, so we \nare not talking about the super rich at all.\n  Remember in 1990 when Congress was supposedly going to soak the rich \nwith a luxury tax on expensive cars, boats, jewelry, and furs? Well, it \nwas not the rich who ultimately got soaked. The sale of yachts fell by \n73 percent, and boatyards died. Sales of Cadillacs declined 17 percent. \nThe rich simply avoided the tax by not buying the yacht or the \nCadillac, and it was the guy on the line who ultimately paid the luxury \ntax--paid with his job. Congress had to repeal it.\n  In 1993, President Clinton called on the American people to pay \nhigher taxes--he called it making a ``contribution'' to the Government. \nBut it was the average woman on her way to work who found that she had \nto pay a higher price for gasoline to get there. It was the senior \ncitizen making as little as $34,000 per year who found out he was among \nthe ``rich'' President Clinton had in mind; he ended up paying higher \ntaxes on his Social Security.\n  Now President Clinton says he made a mistake in 1993--that he raised \ntaxes too much. I agree that he made a mistake, but if I recall \ncorrectly, he sent up a budget asking for $359 billion in new taxes--\n$100 billion more than he eventually got. It turned out that there was \nno support in Congress for a tax increase of that magnitude, even among \nmembers of his own party. He ultimately had to settle for a tax \nincrease of ``only'' $258 billion--still the largest in history.\n  Yes, President Clinton did raise taxes too much, and we have the \nchance in this bill to undo some of the damage. Not only have people \nbeen taxed too much, but they have lost jobs as well. A constituent of \nmine, Tom Ford from Tucson, AZ, contacted me recently about what the \nClinton tax increase has done to him.\n  Mr. Ford makes a living as a special effects specialist for the \nmotion picture industry. He lost one job on a film called ``China \nSpur,'' which was to have starred Willie Nelson, Ernest Borgnine, and \nHeather Locklear. The film was canceled when the Clinton tax increase \ntook effect because the investor found he did not have enough money to \ntake a risk on the film.\n  Tom Ford worked on another movie, ``Waiting to Exhale,'' with Whitney \nHouston. Again, taxes hurt the little guy. The project went forward, \nbut corners were cut. Salary and hours were reduced. Whitney Houston \ngot her full asking price, and paid all her taxes, as did Gregory Hines \nand Angela Bassett who also starred in the film. But the guys behind \nthe scene--people like Mr. Ford--were forced to work for less. It was \nthey who bore the brunt of the tighter budget that resulted from higher \ntaxes.\n  What does that mean? Wealthier taxpayers like Whitney Houston do not \nget hurt. She has a great deal of talent, and will continue to command \na good wage no matter what taxes are levied. But others are not so \nfortunate. When Mr. Ford does not work, or works fewer hours or for \nless money, he cannot buy the extra equipment he needs for filmmaking. \nAnd this, in turn, means someone who produces the equipment is also put \nout of a job. He cannot buy the new pick-up truck he needs for his \nbusiness. The Ford dealer in Tucson loses a sale, and the factory \nworker in Detroit sees her job threatened because sales fall off.\n  Mr. Ford pointed out the irony in a letter to me. He said, ``the only \ngood thing is that with a lower income brought on by higher taxes, I am \nnow paying less in taxes to the government.'' But that is not what is \nsupposed to happen according to the big taxers.\n  If you listen to the other side in this debate, you will hear that \nhigher tax rates are supposed to bring in more revenue for the \nGovernment. But that is not what Tom Ford's experience \n\n[[Page S15770]]\n\ndemonstrates. High tax rates cost jobs and ultimately reduce revenues \nthat might otherwise accrue to the federal Treasury.\n  That is the experience of the 1980's. Tax revenues increased from \n$517 billion in fiscal year 1980 to $1.03 trillion by fiscal year 1990. \nThey nearly doubled. And that is despite the fact that the top income \ntax rate fell from 70 percent to 28 percent. The share of total Federal \nincome taxes paid by the top 10 percent of taxpayers, ranked by \nadjusted gross income, rose from just under 50 percent in 1980 to more \nthan 57 percent by 1988. During a period in which their marginal rate \nfell by 60 percent, the wealthy paid almost 19 percent more in dollar \nterms in Federal taxes. That is because the tax base expanded as people \nworked more, invested more, and took money out of tax shelters and put \nit into taxable investments instead.\n  Just as the local department store does not lose money when it holds \na weekend sale--volume more than makes up for a reduction in price--the \ngovernment does not lose revenue when it reduces tax rates. Just the \nopposite occurs. With businesses expanding, more people working, and \nmore investments being made, tax revenues will increase.\n  The opposite occurs when tax rates are increased. People change their \nbehavior to avoid the higher tax. After the tax increases of 1990 and \n1993, income tax collections actually declined from 8.6 percent of \ngross domestic product [GDP] to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1994.\n  Even if you disregard the dynamic effect of the tax cuts proposed in \nthe budget before us today, tax revenues are projected to increase \nsubstantially. They will increase from $1.35 trillion in fiscal year \n1995 to $1.85 trillion in fiscal year 2002. That is $500 billion--half \na trillion--more money than we are collecting today.\n  Mr. President, how much is enough? Can the Government not get by with \nan extra 35 percent worth of revenue--an extra half-a-trillion \ndollars--to spend? How much more is needed?\n  Now there is a lot of talk about the spending cuts in this package; \nthat they are too deep or that one group or another is being singled \nout. The fact is, most programs are not being cut at all. Medicare \nspending, for example, will rise from $178 billion this year to $274 \nbillion 7 years from now. In other words, we will be spending 50 \npercent more in 7 years than we spend today. The average Medicare \nbenefit will go from about $4,800 per person today to $6,700 in the \nyear 2002. That is not a cut. Let us be honest. It is not a cut.\n  Student loan volume will grow from $24 billion in 1995 to $36 billion \nin 2002--another 50-percent increase. Be honest: a 50-percent increase \nis not a cut.\n  It is the logic that defines a spending increase as a cut that has \ngotten us into this predicament. It is like giving someone a 50-percent \nraise and having that person quit because he thinks his employer cut \nhis salary. Let us be honest. An increase is not a cut.\n  Let us make no mistake about what these deficits mean. When mom, dad, \ngrandma, and grandpa want more from the government than they are \nwilling to pay for in taxes today--that is a budget deficit--we are all \nhanding the bill, dollar for dollar--plus interest--to our sons and \ndaughters, and their children yet to come.\n  Most people agree that the Federal Government should maintain a \nsocial safety net to provide individuals with the hand up that they \nneed to escape hard financial times. No one here is proposing that we \neliminate that helping hand. But, we have got to find a way to provide \na safety net without leaving future generations with a legacy of debt \nand despair.\n  My grandson was born just 5 months ago and already owns a share of \nthe national debt that is $18,500 and rising. He can expect to pay \n$187,000 in taxes during his lifetime just to pay the increase on the \nnational debt. What will be left of his income to care for his \nchildren? How will the Government care for the needy of tomorrow when \nevery dollar of individual income tax revenue is devoted to interest on \nthe national debt?\n  Mr. President, a balanced Federal budget offers hope. Yes, it will \nrequire that Congress prioritize spending so that the most important \nprograms are not jeopardized. And wasteful programs will have to be \neliminated. Some of the luxuries will have to be postponed to another \nday. A balanced budget will require heavy lifting, but it offers hope \nand opportunity.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that a balanced budget would \nfacilitate a reduction in long-term real interest rates of between 1 \nand 2 percent. That means that more Americans will have the chance to \nlive the American dream--to own their own home. A 2-percent reduction \non a typical 30-year $80,000 mortgage would save homeowners $107 a \nmonth. That is $1,284 a year, or over $38,000 over the life of the \nmortgage.\n  A 2-percent reduction in interest rates on a typical $15,000 car loan \nwould save buyers $676.\n  The savings would accrue on student loans, and credit cards, and \nloans to businesses that want to expand and create new jobs. Reducing \ninterest rates is probably one of the most important things we can do \nto help people across this country.\n  This bill includes incentives to help people buy insurance coverage \nfor long-term health care, and to save in medical savings accounts. It \nincludes a tax credit for adoption expenses, and estate tax reform so \nthat families are not forced to sell their small businesses just to pay \nestate taxes to the Government.\n  This budget represents a break from business as usual. We are finally \nmaking the tough choices the American people sent us here to make. We \nare keeping our promises--for a change.\n  Will some people be unhappy with the bill? Of course. It is always \neasier to hand out money other people earned than it is to say ``no.'' \nWill some say they have been singled out? Of course. But if you look at \nthe myriad of interests that say they have been singled out, you see \nthat no one has been singled out at all.\n  This is a historic debate, the most important vote many of us will \never cast. Let us not miss this opportunity or another one might not \narise until it is too late for our country. Vote for the Balanced \nBudget Reconciliation Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak for 2 \nminutes as in morning business, not to take away from the time on \neither side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just so everyone will understand, we \ncannot be doing this because we are very, very close on getting to the \namendments we have agreed to. In this instance, for 2 additional \nminutes, I will not object, just so Senators on our side know we are \nnot going to be able to do any more of this until we get on the \namendment. At this time, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the order for the quorum \ncall is rescinded.

Mr. President, I understand Senator Kassebaum is \nprepared to offer an amendment with reference to education. I \nunderstand we have 10 minutes on our side and they have 10 minutes on \ntheir side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is not correct in \nthat. There is 10 minutes equally divided, 5 minutes to a side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2962\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provisions relating to loan payments from \ninstitutions, the elimination of the grace period interest subsidy, and \n                the PLUS loan interest rate and rebate)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \nFrist, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. Gorton, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Abraham, and Mr. Gorton, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2962.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1421, beginning with line 15, strike all through \n     page 1423, line 13.\n       On page 1424, beginning with line 2, strike all through \n     page 1426 line 9.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nstrike the provisions relating to loan payments from institutions, the \nelimination of the grace period interest subsidy, and the PLUS loan \ninterest rate and rebate.\n  I will just briefly speak to this, Mr. President, because this has \nbeen something the Labor and Human Resources Committee has worked long \nand hard on. We passed the budget resolution earlier this year in the \nU.S. Senate. The Labor Committee, as a whole, expressed reservations at \nthat time about the magnitude of the cuts that the resolution directed \nus to make in the Federal student loan programs. However, we agreed to \ntry and meet the reconciliation instruction, and we did so.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, on behalf \nof the majority members of this committee, we worked to get a package \nthat met the reconciliation instruction and had the least impact on \nstudents.\n  Much has been said on the Senate floor about the impact on students. \nWe consciously directed the effort so that it would not impact strongly \non students. This amendment would reduce savings by about $6 billion \nfrom the original $10.8 billion that was requested from and produced by \nthe committee. Those costs will be offset by excess savings from the \nentire budget package.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate the provision of the \nbill that would require students to pay for the interest on their \nsubsidized Stafford loans in the 6 months after they leave school. This \nwould have only applied to new borrowers, but we now eliminate that \nprovision. It would eliminate a raise in interest rate and the interest \nrate cap on the PLUS parent loans and would also repeal the assessment \nof a participation fee on institutions of higher education.\n  The main difference between this amendment and the amendment offered \nby Senator Kennedy, is that we leave intact provisions in the budget \nbill that would decrease the size of the direct loan program to a more \nappropriate demonstration size, until we can fully assess the merits \nand feasibility of direct lending. Direct lending does not affect \nstudent eligibility for Federal student loans, nor does it affect the \namount of funds available for loans or the rates and fees charged to \nstudents. They do not make financial aid more affordable or more \naccessible.\n  Mr. President, I just add that there are two members--one, a member \nof the committee, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, and the other is \nSenator Snowe from Maine--who have felt strongly from the very \nbeginning that we simply should not cut into the education funds as \nmuch as the reconciliation request required. They have fought long and \nhard.\n  I will yield what time I have remaining to Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Snowe but I want to point out that a majority of the committee \nis cosponsoring this amendment. We are all united behind this \namendment, and it has been a dedicated effort on the part of the \ncommittee majority members.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute, 21 \nseconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me briefly remind everybody that a \nwhile back, when we were dealing with the budget resolution, 67 of us \nvoted not to cut more than $4 billion out of higher education. This \namendment would bring this level closer to where we in the Senate voted \nearlier this year to be--a $5 billion cut from the $10.8 billion. I \nremind my colleagues of that. I hate to see anybody be inconsistent \nwith their voting, and since 67 voted for something a little more \ndraconian than this, I hope those Senators will stay with us on this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S15774]]\n\n  I will also say, while I believe that we should have direct lending \nstay in as it creates great competition for the programs, and am in \nfavor of having a rate higher than 20 percent that is in the bill now, \nI could not go with the Democratic amendment because it essentially \nopens up direct lending fully. I will therefore be voting against the \nKennedy amendment. But I will be voting in favor, obviously, of the \nKassebaum-Snowe-Jeffords amendment.\n  Our amendment restores the 6-month grace period, eliminates the .85 \npercent institution fee, and lowers the interest rate on PLUS loans. \nReducing the labor committee's instruction from $10.85 billion over 7 \nyears to $5 billion.\n  Let me lay aside the issue of reducing education cuts for one quick \nmoment and explain why this amendment is so important.\n  The amendment offered by my democratic colleagues restored direct \nlending to current law--or a transition to 100 percent. I simply could \nnot support such a provision.\n  I have always been a supporter of testing the direct lending program \nand am on record as opposing the labor committee's bill to limit it to \n20 percent. Twenty percent in my view is too small, it cuts out schools \nthat currently participate in the program--that to me is wrong.\n  However, as I stated during debate of the 1993 reconciliation, I \nbelieve in a slow, implementation of direct lending. It should be \nundertaken thoughtfully and carefully. The amendment offered by my \ndemocratic colleagues is tantamount to a phase-in of direct lending. A \nphase-in suggests something very different than a thoughtful analysis \nof the two programs. My fear is that we have already made the decision \nto go full force without really looking at the advisability of such a \nmove. It is like saying ``ready, fire, and then aim.''\n  For this reason I support a firm cap on direct lending. That cap, in \nmy mind should be set at a point which protects the schools that are \ncurrent participants and allows some room for growth. I suggest that \nnumber be set between 30-40 percent.\n  Mr. President, that is not the amendment we are currently \nconsidering. I offered that suggestion to my colleagues as a bipartisan \napproach. Unfortunately, that amendment coupled with billions of \ndollars in additional student aid, was rejected by the democrats and \ninterestingly also by groups purporting to represent higher education. \nIn particular the council on education.\n  I am truly disheartened that today we may have lost an opportunity to \ndemonstrate to this Congress, the administration and the people of this \ncountry that education is not a partisan issue. Unfortunately, we gave \nup the chance to show that politics takes a back seat to sound policy.\n  I wish we could have put differences aside and discussed the real \nissue--reducing the labor committee's instruction and restore funding \nfor education.\n  Certainly, we must balance the budget but we must cut expenditure not \ninvestment. That is what this amendment does. It strikes the .85 \npercent institution fee, restores the 6-month grace period, and \neliminates the increase in the PLUS interest rate. Support for this \namendment will provide savings to parents, students, and institutions.\n  Eliminating the interest subsidy during the 6-month grace period \ncould increase the debt of an undergraduate who borrows the maximum \n$23,000 by almost $1,000, resulting in additional payments of nearly \n$1,400 over the life of the loan. For a graduate student who borrows \nthe maximum $65,500, the result would be $2,700 in additional debt and \nalmost $4,000 in additional payments.\n  Raising the interest rate and the interest rate cap on PLUS loans \nwould increase the total payments of parents who borrow $20,000 for \ntheir children's education by $1,300.\n  It simply doesn't pay to cut education.\n  Consider the following: More highly educated workers not only earn \nmore, but they work and pay taxes longer then less educated workers.\n\n       Between 1973 and 1993, median family income dropped by over \n     20 percent for families headed by a person with a high school \n     diploma or less; but it held steady for those families headed \n     by someone with 4 years of college; and increased for \n     families head by someone with 5 years of college or more. \n     (Mortenson, June 1995)\n\n  We need to encourage our young people to pursue higher education both \nto keep us competitive and to help balance the budget.\n  Higher education funds cannot be cut any further.\n  Unfortunately, the opportunity for individuals to go on to \npostsecondary education is getting slimmer and slimmer. Pell grant \nawards have not kept pace with college costs. Students have had to \nincrease borrowing in order to make up the difference.\n  In 1985-86, the actual maximum Pell grant of $2,100 paid 58 percent \nof the total annual cost of attendance for a 4-year public institution \n$3,637. In 1993-94, the maximum Pell grant of $2,300 paid only 36 \npercent of the total cost, $6,454.\n  Because Federal grant programs have grown much more slowly than the \ncost of attending college, loans now, 1994-95 account for 56 percent of \nall student aid, up from 49 percent in 1985-96.\n  Borrowing has skyrocketed in recent years to such an extent that the \namount borrowed through the FFEL program from 1990 to 1995 is greater \nthan the total amount borrowed from its inception in 1965 through 1989.\n  With such statistics it is no wonder that polls show more and more \nstudents and families deciding that college is simply out of their \nreach. In fact, close to 20 percent of students consider leaving school \nbecause of debt. Considering the impact on our economy and the future \nearning potential of individuals with a postsecondary degree, this \nstatistic is most disheartening.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and tell the nation \nthat the issue of education spending is a bipartisan issue.\n  I see that the Senator from Maine has arrived. I am happy to yield to \nher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have 5 minutes, as I understand it. I \nwill speak for 2 minutes and then yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. President, this is, first of all, an extraordinary moment because \nit is an initial victory for the students of this country and their \nparents that our Republican friends are hearing their message about the \nunfair, unwise, unjustified additional burden on working families. So \nthat is the good news.\n  The bad news is that what Senator Kassebaum's amendment will \neffectively do is to say to the 1,400 schools that now have direct \nlending that half of them are out. Half of them are out. There is no \nsuggestion about how you are going to cut those out.\n  Under our amendment, we are leaving the choice to the schools, to the \ncolleges. It is so interesting that our Republican friends want to \nclose the option for local control out. We leave it up to the schools. \nIf they want to get in, they can--maximum choice--and we leave it up to \nthe schools to have competition between the direct loan program and the \nguaranteed loan program.\n  Under the amendment of the Republicans, they will be preserving the \n$77 billion that will flow through the guarantee agencies and guarantee \n$5 million in profits. That is not competition. Where is the voice for \ncompetition among the Republicans? Where is the description about what \ncolleges are going to be in and what colleges are going out?\n  The amendment that has been introduced by myself and Senator Simon \ngoes back to what was agreed to in terms of direct loans in 1993. We \npermit the colleges that want to get in, and we establish a ceiling. \nThat was bipartisan. Someone tell me what happened in the 1994 election \nthat was to say that we are going to jiggle the system and force the \nstudents into the guaranty system.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I agree this is a step forward. But it \neliminates--cuts down to 20 percent direct lending. This is, frankly, a \nbrazen kind of pandering to the banks and the guaranty agencies. There \nis not a college or university in this Nation that has a direct lending \nprogram that does not want to keep it. And as our friend and former \ncolleague, Dave Durenberger, said, ``This is not free enterprise, the \n\n[[Page S15775]]\n\nold system, this is free lunch for the guaranty agencies and the \nbanks.'' We write into the law their profit.\n  In terms of the taxpayer, we wrote the budget resolution so that you \nwould count the administrative cost for direct lending but not for the \nguaranty student program. CBO says, under current law, that leaving \nthis 20 percent, as the Kassebaum amendment does, will cost the Nation \n$4.64 billion. All colleges and universities, again, who are in the \nprogram like it. It saves a huge amount of paperwork. Students like it, \nparents like it, taxpayers like it.\n  The Kennedy amendment is budget neutral. We do not add to the \ndeficit. Why are we doing something that colleges like, students like, \nand taxpayers benefit from? We are doing it for one reason and one \nreason only: To benefit the banks and the guaranty agencies.\n  If we want to call this a bank assistance bill--and they have record-\nbreaking profits right now--we ought to do that. If we want to call \nthis an assistance to guaranty agencies, we ought to do that; but if we \nwant to call it an assistance to students bill, then we ought to vote \nfor the Kennedy amendment. Let me just point out that this idea came \nfrom Congressman Tom Petri, a Republican from Wisconsin. Dave \nDurenberger, Republican from Minnesota, was the chief cosponsor of \nthis.\n\n  This should not be a partisan thing. I hope Members on both sides \nwill vote for the Kennedy-Simon amendment. It makes sense for everyone. \nI just appeal to you on behalf of America's students.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Ten seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a clear attempt to strike one of \nthe initiatives of President Clinton--eliminate National Service, \neliminate Goals 2000, eliminate direct lending for education.\n  Our Republican friends cannot stand a good idea when they see one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated \nOctober 26 saying there has been no scorekeeping activities that try to \nprejudice one of the programs versus another; that is, that guaranteed \none versus another.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In your letter of September 5, 1995, you \n     asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to respond to \n     several questions regarding the Credit Reform Act and section \n     207 of the 1966 budget resolution related to the treatment of \n     administrative expenses in the student loan programs. \n     Attached are CBO's responses to your questions.\n       If you wish further details, we will be pleased to provide \n     them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah Kalcevic.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Attachment.\n\n             Responses to Questions From Chairman Domenici\n\n       The Credit Reform Act of 1990 provided that the federal \n     budget would record the cost of direct loans and guaranteed \n     loans on a subsidy basis rather than a cash basis. The act \n     defined the subsidy cost of a loan to equal the present \n     discounted value of all loan disbursements, repayments, \n     default costs, interest subsidies, and other payments \n     associated with the loan, excluding federal administrative \n     costs. Federal administrative costs of loan programs \n     continued to be accorded a cash-accounting treatment. \n     Estimates of proposals affecting student loans made from 1992 \n     through early 1995 used the accounting rules established in \n     the Credit Reform Act.\n       The budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, adopted in June \n     1995, specified that the direct administrative costs of \n     direct student loans should be included in the subsidy \n     estimates of that program for purposes of Congressional \n     scorekeeping. Since June, for estimating legislation under \n     the 1996 budget resolution, the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) has used this alternative definition of subsidy costs. \n     In addition, changes in economic and technical estimating \n     assumptions complicate the comparison of estimates made at \n     different times. The following questions and answers explore \n     the implications of the change in accounting for direct \n     student loans.\n       Question 1: The President proposed, and signed into law in \n     1993, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to replace the \n     guaranteed lending program. What was the time frame adopted \n     for the phase-in of that program when it was initially \n     enacted and what savings estimate was provided by CBO?\n       Answer: The President's fiscal 1994 budget proposed \n     expanding the direct student loan program from a pilot \n     program (which was about 4 percent of loan volume) to a \n     program that would provide 100 percent of all student loans \n     by the 1997-1998 academic year. As part of the request, the \n     President proposed to lower interest rates to borrowers as of \n     July 1997, substantially increase the annual capped \n     entitlement levels for direct loan administrative costs, and \n     subsidize schools for loan origination. The budget proposed \n     no changes in the guaranteed loan program except to phase it \n     out. CBO estimated that the proposal would save $4.3 billion \n     over the 1994-1998 period. These estimates were completed \n     using the CBO February 1993 baseline economic and technical \n     assumptions. The President's proposal became the policy \n     assumed in that year's budget resolution.\n       The legislation passed by the Congress differed \n     significantly from the policies assumed in the budget \n     resolution. The bill met the requirement to save $4.3 billion \n     by limiting the volume in the direct lending program to 60 \n     percent of the total and substantially cutting subsidies in \n     the guaranteed loan program. Specifically, direct loans were \n     to represent 5 percent of total volume for academic year \n     1994-1995, 40 percent for 1995-1996, 50 percent for 1996-1997 \n     and 1997-1998, and 60 percent for 1998-1999. The legislation \n     also provided that the ceiling could be exceeded if demand \n     required it.\n       Question 2: In his FY96 budget, the President proposed an \n     acceleration of that plan so that all student loans would be \n     provided directly from the government no later than July 1, \n     1997. What ``additional'' savings did CBO estimate for the \n     accelerated phase-in under the Credit Reform Act?\n       Answer: The President's fiscal year 1996 budget request \n     included a proposal to expand the direct student loan program \n     to cover 100 percent of loan volume by July 1997. This \n     proposed change was estimated to save $4.1 billion from the \n     CBO baseline over the 1996-2002 period. That baseline \n     incorporated CBO's February 1995 economic and technical \n     assumptions and the direct loan phase-in schedule provided \n     under current law. This baseline reflected the rules that are \n     currently in law for estimating the cost of credit programs.\n       The 1996 budget resolution specified that the direct \n     administrative costs of direct student loans should be \n     included in the subsidy estimates for that program for \n     purposes of Congressional scorekeeping. This change conformed \n     the treatment of the administrative costs of direct student \n     loans with that for guaranteed student loans. For purposes of \n     Congressional budget scorekeeping, the change overrides the \n     Credit Reform Act, which requires that the federal \n     administrative costs for direct loan programs be accorded a \n     cash-accounting treatment.\n       For estimating legislation under the 1996 budget \n     resolution, CBO modified its baseline for direct student \n     loans to include in the subsidy calculations the present \n     value of direct federal administrative costs, including the \n     loans' servicing costs. This change means that direct loans \n     issued in a given year have their administrative costs \n     calculated over the life of the loan portfolio, with \n     adjustments for the time value of the funds. Therefore, the \n     subsidy costs of any year's direct loans will include the \n     discounted future administrative costs of servicing loans \n     which may be in repayment (or collection) for as long as 25 \n     to 30 years. The inclusion of these administrative costs in \n     the subsidy calculations for direct loans increases the \n     subsidy rates for these loans by about 7 percentage points. \n     Consequently, the resolution baseline for student loans is \n     higher than the current CBO baseline. Under the assumptions \n     of the budget resolution baseline, the President's 100 \n     percent direct lending proposal would save $115 million over \n     the 1996-2002 period.\n       Question 3: What would be the long term costs, under \n     scoring rules in effect prior to the 1995 budget resolution, \n     for the above proposal? How would those savings be affected \n     over the life of the loan? How would those costs be compared \n     with the same volume of loans made under the guaranteed \n     program?\n       Answer: The response to the first part of this question is \n     addressed in the previous answer. Compared to the CBO \n     baseline, the President's 1996 budget proposal was estimated \n     to save $4.1 billion over the next seven years. In order to \n     provide an estimate of a proposal to return to 100 percent \n     guaranteed lending by July 1997 under either the CBO or the \n     resolution baseline, we would need more detail than has been \n     provided on how the program would be restructured.\n       Question 4: Did the credit reform amendment adopted as part \n     of the budget resolution direct the Congressional Budget \n     Office to exclude any costs for guaranteed loans?\n       Answer: This year's budget resolution addressed only the \n     budgetary treatment of the administrative costs of direct \n     student loans. By defining the direct administrative costs of \n     direct loans and requiring these costs be calculated over the \n     life of the loan portfolio, the resolution allowed for the \n     costs of direct and guaranteed loans to be evaluated on a \n     similar basis. Thus, all of the program costs for both \n     programs are included in the resolution baseline and are \n     accounted for in the same way, whether they are calculated on \n\n\n[[Page S15776]]\n\n     the basis of subsidy or cash-based accounting.\n       Question 5: Are there any expenses of direct or guaranteed \n     loans that are currently excluded from the government subsidy \n     costs that would be more appropriately be included in that \n     subsidy? If so, what are they and why have they been excluded \n     from the subsidy cost? For example, some have argued that the \n     credit reform amendment did not include the administrative \n     cost allowance which is paid to guarantee agencies.\n       Answer: Indirect administrative costs--those not directly \n     tied to loan servicing and collection--are included in the \n     budget on a cash basis for both programs. Some have asked \n     whether these costs would be more appropriately included in \n     the loan subsidy calculations. Although it might be \n     appropriate to include some or all of these costs in the \n     subsidy calculation, as a practical matter it is not \n     straightforward to determine which costs to account for in \n     this manner. For the most part the costs of government \n     oversight, regulation writing, Pell grant certification, and \n     other similar expenditures are personnel costs of the \n     Department of Education or contracted services. In addition, \n     many of the costs, such as program oversight, are not tied to \n     a single loan portfolio but affect many portfolios and both \n     programs. Allocating these costs to specific portfolios and \n     programs for specific fiscal years would be difficult.\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) \n     eliminated administrative cost allowance (ACA) payments to \n     guaranty agencies. Until that time, the volume-based payments \n     were always included in the subsidy costs of guaranteed \n     student loans. However, OBRA-93 gave the Secretary of \n     Education authority to make such payments out of the $2.5 \n     billion capped entitlement fund for the direct loan program. \n     Any expenditures from this fund would be accounted for on a \n     cash basis. If the Secretary chose not allocate any funds for \n     this purpose, then there would be no payments to guaranty \n     agencies.\n       As part of its current services budget estimates, the \n     Department of Education announced plans to use funds \n     available under the capped entitlement to pay administrative \n     cost allowances to guaranty agencies at one percent of new \n     loan volume for the next five years. Both the CBO baseline \n     and the budget resolution baseline include these planned \n     administrative expenses on a cash basis under the capped \n     entitlement account at the Department's current services \n     levels.\n       It makes little budgetary difference whether these payments \n     are computed on a cash or subsidy basis. Because the payments \n     are made at the time of loan disbursement, their estimated \n     costs on a cash basis or subsidy basis would be essentially \n     the same. As a result, over the 1996-2002 period the cost of \n     the student loan programs and the budget totals would be \n     changed only marginally by accounting for these payments on a \n     subsidy basis.\n       Question 6: What possible mechanisms exist to reclassify \n     these costs as part of the federal subsidy, to be scored on a \n     present value basis?\n       Answer: The guaranty agency cost allowance could again be \n     made an automatic government payment under the guaranteed \n     student loan law. Including the current cash-based indirect \n     administrative expenses for both the direct and guaranteed \n     loans in the subsidy estimates would require amending the \n     Credit Reform Act, but it would be difficult to estimate a \n     wide range of federal personnel-related expenses over a 25- \n     to 30-year period. Determining whether some types of \n     expenditures that are now accounted for on a cash basis \n     should be included in the subsidy calculation would require a \n     more thorough review of the current expenditures of the \n     Department of Education than has been conducted to date.\n       Question 7: Does the credit reform rule adopted as part of \n     the budget resolution provide the proper framework to fairly \n     assess all direct federal expenses of guaranteed and direct \n     loans?\n       Answer: In general, the Credit Reform Act amendment allows \n     direct comparisons between the costs of the guaranteed and \n     direct loan programs.\n       Question 8: Some have claimed that savings associated with \n     the Goodling proposal to repeal direct lending were a result \n     of excluding administrative costs of guaranteed loans. What \n     is the primary reason for the $1.5 billion in savings \n     associated with the Goodling proposal under the new scoring \n     rule?\n       Answer: On July 26, 1995, CBO prepared an estimate of the \n     original Goodling proposal. The proposal had three \n     components: (1) eliminate the authority for new direct \n     student and parent loans effective in academic year 1996-\n     1997; (2) change the annual and cumulative budget authority \n     levels under Section 458 to reflect the elimination of \n     indirect administrative cost anticipated for new direct loans \n     and the termination of payments of Section 458 funds to \n     guarantee agencies and limit the funds to $24 million \n     annually; and (3) reestablish an administrative cost \n     allowance (ACA) for guarantee agencies at 0.85 percent of new \n     loan volume or 0.08 percent of outstanding volume, with an \n     annual limitation on ACA subsides of $200 million. Assuming \n     an enactment date of October 1995, the proposals would reduce \n     outlays for student loans by $227 million for fiscal year \n     1996 and by $1.5 billion over the 1996-2002 period.\n       Relative to the budget resolution baseline, shifting loan \n     volume to guaranteed loans would save $855 million over the \n     1996-2002 period. Administrative expenditures would be \n     reduced by $1.97 billion over the next seven years by \n     lowering the cap. Of this amount, $824 million reflects the \n     elimination of the discretionary guaranty agency payments, \n     and the remainder reflects the elimination of the \n     discretionary guaranty agency payments, and the remainder \n     reflects the elimination of the indirect costs for the \n     phased-out direct loan program. Reestablishing the ACA for a \n     100 percent guaranteed loan program would cost $1.3 billion \n     over seven years.\n       Although the Goodling proposal would have eliminated most \n     of the funds to funds a oversee the phased-out direct loan \n     program by reducing the capped entitlement level for these \n     funds, it did not address the level of appropriated funds \n     that would be necessary to oversee the larger guaranteed loan \n     program.\n       Question 9: Did the Goodling proposal to eliminate the \n     direct loan program and make changes to the guaranteed \n     program you were asked to score, address all federal \n     administrative costs of direct and guaranteed loans? When you \n     applied the new scoring rule, were you able to properly \n     categorize those expenses to provide a completed fair \n     calculation of the cost differential?\n       Answer: All of the cost analyses of the Goodling proposal \n     for both the direct and guaranteed loan programs were \n     completed using the same budgetary treatment for both \n     programs. The Goodling proposal, however, did not address the \n     level of discretionary appropriations necessary to oversee \n     the larger guaranteed loan program.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMON. Under the scorekeeping in the budget resolution, you say \ncount the administrative costs for direct lending but not for the \nguaranteed program, and we asked CBO, how do you score it under current \nlaw? There is a savings of $4.6 billion under direct lending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is a statement in the letter from CBO on that \nissue.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will read it, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want 30 seconds to say thanks to Senator Kassebaum \nand the other Senators who worked on our side. I think they have come \nup with a very good amendment, and I think ultimately the students \nacross America who have been concerned will find they have done an \nexcellent job in taking care of an overwhelming percentage of their \nissues.\n  We thank you for it.\n\n\n                  Vote on Rockefeller Motion to Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chamber will be in order.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the next amendment before us is very \nsimple.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the remarks do not mean anything if we \ncannot hear them. May we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chamber will be in order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The next amendment I will offer is pretty straightforward. It \nbasically creates a mechanism by which the Medicare beneficiaries can \nbe rewarded for assisting us in ferreting out the waste, the fraud, and \nabuse in the Medicare program.\n  Under the amendment, the Secretary of HHS has the responsibility of \nsetting up two programs--one program that in effect is a whistle-blower \nprogram which would provide bonuses to Medicare beneficiaries who will \nidentify Medicare fraud and abuse. The other program would be designed \nto provide bonuses to Medicare beneficiaries who identify waste, and to \nstreamline and make more efficient and less costly the Medicare system.\n  Mr. President, I think this will help us to achieve cost savings in \nMedicare while at the same time providing benefits to Medicare \nbeneficiaries who assist us in that effort.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nNebraska for yielding.\n  As I said, I support the Abraham amendment. It is not a bad \namendment. It is a good amendment. There is nothing wrong with it. I \nwould just point out it is sort of voluntary on the Secretary's part. \nIt does not mandate that they have to do this. It says the Secretary \nmay set these up. That is fine, as far as it goes. I would just say \nthat probably later on today or tomorrow, the amendment that I had \noffered to the Abraham amendment last night will be coming up for a \nvote, which provides for some tough measures. We will talk about that \nlater. This amendment is a good amendment. I intend to support it. It \nis in keeping with trying to give the Secretary more power to cut down \non waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  So it is a good amendment. We will certainly support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand that the Bradley motion is \nnext. I would appreciate, if possible, the Chair recognizing the \nSenator from New Jersey for the purpose of a 1-minute statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the tax \nincrease on people making under $30,000 a year. This bill contains a \ntax cut for estates of $5 million, a tax cut in the amount of $1.7 \nmillion.\n  We are not touching that tax cut, but we are trying to prevent the \ntax increase that will come in this bill for people making under \n$30,000 a year. The EIC offsets income taxes, Social Security, and \nexcise taxes. The other side has talked only about income taxes.\n  Last year, with $114 billion in Federal taxes, only $12 billion of \nthat was income taxes from people making under $30,000 a year. Why \nincrease taxes on those hard-working Americans? These are Americans who \nwork every day, and they pay their taxes, and they support their \nfamilies.\n  This motion is progrowth and profamily. It deserves to be supported \nbecause it is a tax cut for individual working families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield our time to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, let me just tell my colleague from \nNew Jersey, and other colleagues, there is no tax increase for \nindividuals making less than $30,000. That claim has been refuted by \nthe Joint Tax Committee. It is totally false, and people making that \nclaim should really be ashamed of themselves.\n  Mr. President, I am going to put in the Record the facts. The facts \nare, the earned income tax credit grows even under our proposal. It \ngrows. The maximum benefit that anybody can receive today is $3,100. It \ngrows next year to $3,200. And in 7 years it grows to $3,888. It is an \nincrease.\n  This is a program that is a cash outlay program. Eighty-five percent \nof this program is Uncle Sam writing checks, not reducing liability, \nbut writing checks. And it is the most fraudulent program we have in \nGovernment today. GAO said 30 to 40 percent of it was in fraud and in \nerror.\n  It needs to be reformed. That is what we do. This program should be \nreformed. These proposals that we have made, I think, are the right \nthings to do for American families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the table be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n....................................................................... \n\n[[Page S15778]]\n

The pending business is the \nmotion of Senator Graham to commit the bill with instructions. There \nare 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this reconciliation proposal is filled \nwith risk--risk of the unknown, risks that have consequences that are \nbeyond our ability to forecast. There is no area in this entire \nlegislation that has a greater risk to the people of this country than \nthe proposals in Medicaid.\n  We are proposing to cut Medicaid by $187 billion--I repeat, a program \nwhich, last year, had a total Federal expenditure of $89 billion, we \nare going to cut, over 7 years, by $187 billion. It is at risk because \nwe are proposing, for those funds that are left, to place them in an \ninflexible block grant, without Federal participation, in terms of \ndealing with unexpected circumstances, and we are freezing in many of \nthe inequities that have made this program inappropriate in the past.\n  Mr. President, we are putting at risk poor children, our elderly and, \nparticularly, the States of America, as they are all being removed from \nthe safety net that Medicaid has provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the biggest risk is that we not balance \nour budget, and that we continue to spend your children's and \ngrandchildren's money to pay for programs we cannot afford.\n  Obviously, this program is growing so fast, it is unsustainable. \nAnyone who thinks it is being cut is not hearing the facts. We are \ngoing to increase this program to more than $94 billion next year, $124 \nbillion in 2002. And over the entire period of time, this program will \nincrease at a rather healthy rate, while most programs in the National \nGovernment are either frozen or reduced.\n  It is time that we reform this system so we can deliver on what we \npromise. But we also have to deliver on a promise to get interest rates \ndown, to have growth and jobs for our children. We cannot have the \nstatus quo and do that also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment No. 2959 by the \nSenator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] and others.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until conversations cease, we will just have \nto hold up.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. This is an easy \nchoice. My amendment strikes all provisions of the bill that increase \nthe cost for students and families, and preserves choice and \ncompetition in the student loan program at the local level.\n  Senator Kassebaum's amendment rightfully pulls back the unfair and \nextreme provisions that increase the costs for students. It wrongfully \nprevents schools from choosing the loan program that best serves their \nstudents at the local level, and wrongfully provides a Government-\nmandated monopoly to the powerful special interests in the student loan \nindustry.\n  I hope my amendment will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate will vote on an amendment \noffered by Senators Kassebaum, Jeffords, and Snowe that removes all \ncuts affecting students. The Senate Republicans do this without raising \ntaxes or taxing investment. The Republican plan will result in lower \ninterest rates which will benefit all students and all Americans. That \nis what our entire deficit reduction package is all about.\n  I yield any time I have and I move to table.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Could I be advised how long that vote took?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last rollcall lasted approximately 13 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me remind my colleagues three times 60 is a long time--\nwe were about 3 minutes late on that vote--if we start slipping these \nvotes for everybody who wants to step out for 5 minutes. If we just \nstay in the Chamber, we can do this in 10 minutes. I say to my \ncolleagues, we are going to start ringing the bell here in 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. It also slows \ndown the Senate when conversations are going on during debate time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2962\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The issue before the Senate is amendment No. \n2962 by the Senator from Kansas, [Mrs. Kassebaum]. There are 2 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Senator Kassebaum will be recognized when the Senate is in order.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield the time remaining to the \nSenator from Maine [Ms. Snowe].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Kassebaum for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I want to first recognize several of my colleagues who \nhave been instrumental in helping to craft this amendment and reach a \ncompromise on student loan funding.\n  First, the chairwoman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nSenator Kassebaum, who has been a real leader on this issue. She has \nhad to make difficult choices and tough decisions throughout this \nprocess--especially meeting instructions of $10.8 billion in savings \nfor her committee, so I thank her for her work and for offering this \namendment.\n  Second, the majority leader and the chair of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Dole and Senator Domenici--for meeting our concerns and being \nresponsive to our requests all along. Their support was obviously \ninstrumental in crafting this amendment.\n  Finally, one of the main cosponsor of this amendment, Senator \nJeffords of Vermont, for his concern, his support, and his compassion \nfor the needs of America's students.\n  Mr. President, let there be no doubt about it, we are setting a \ncourse for America for the next 7 years and beyond as we debate the \nmeasure before us today. That is a heavy responsibility.\n  But the image of a better America, a stronger America, and a more \nfiscally secure America is incomplete for the next generations without \none critical component: that is, a commitment to education funding and \nto students.\n\n[[Page S15780]]\n\n  I believe one of our duties in this process is to keep the American \nDream alive for our generation as well as the next generation of \nstudents--because we all know that educating today's students is also \nabout preparing tomorrow's workers.\n  While I firmly believed that balancing the budget is the greatest \nlegacy we can bequeath to our children and grandchildren, I do not \nbelieve it requires the sacrifice of educational opportunities to the \nchildren and students today.\n  Let us be clear about this: our two objectives--balancing the budget \nand providing quality educational opportunities--are not mutually \nexclusive entities.\n  I believe we can identify and set budget priorities within the \nframework of a balanced budget. I believe it is possible to be fiscally \nresponsible and also be visionary about our education needs into the \nnext century for the next generation.\n  That is basically what this amendment accomplishes. It is prudent. It \nis responsible. It's fair. And it maintains our commitment to \nexcellence in education.\n  The amendment we are offering today would restore $5.9 billion in \nstudent loan funding that is sorely needed by America's youth to \ncontinue their education.\n  Basically, we are removing the most onerous and punitive provisions \non students that are currently contained in this package.\n  Those provisions we are targeting for removal include the following: \nthe imposition of a 0.85 percent fee on the student loan volume of \ninstitutions of higher learning; the provision increasing the interest \nrate on parent PLUS loans from T-bill plus 3.1 percent, to T-bill 4.0 \npercent; and--most importantly--the provision charging interest on \nstudent loans during the so-called 6-month grace period.\n  I believe we must support this amendment because student loans level \nthe education playing field for so many in this country. In the world \nof education, student loans are the great ``enabler''. They afford \neveryone the equal opportunity to profit from a college education.\n  I should know, I owe my education and much of my career in public \nservice to the student loan program, which sustained me at the \nUniversity of Maine.\n  Now, it is important to add that the Senate has already gone on \nrecord and has made a strong statement in support of increased student \nloan funding.\n  Back in May, when the Budget Committee reported out a resolution that \nincluded a cut of more than $13 billion in student loan funding over 7 \nyears--and when the House reported out a version that included a cut of \nover $18 billion, I joined several of my colleagues in taking action--\nbecause student loan funding programs would clearly result in leaving \nsome needy students locked out of our Nation's colleges and \nuniversities, and therefore locked out of America's work force and a \nsuccessful career.\n  And, with bipartisan support from both sides of the aisle, my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, and I authorized and passed an \namendment that restored $9.4 billion for student loans. No other \namendment, except one, received as much bipartisan support during the \nconsideration of the Senate budget resolution.\n  We should reaffirm that same level of commitment again today, and \nwith this amendment, we now have an opportunity to do so.\n  If we pass this amendment, the Senate's strong support for this level \nof funding will be a strong instruction to the Senate conferees to \nmaintain this level of funding during the upcoming House-Senate \nReconciliation conference.\n  Now, I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwould have wanted more, especially when it come to direct lending. \nObviously, there is a difference of opinion on direct lending.\n  While the amendment we are offering restores critical funding for \nloans, it maintains the bills current cap on direct lending at 20 \npercent. I could support raising this cap to 30 percent, which would \ncover the 1,300 education institutions currently involved in the direct \nlending program.\n  However, the sole purpose of this amendment is to restore funding for \nstudent loan programs. other opportunities may arise on the floor today \nor tomorrow to increase the cap on direct lending.\n  I have worked with many of my colleagues across the aisle, and I know \nthat--in the final analysis--we share the same goals on funding for \nstudent education. That is the most important--the most critical-issue \nhere.\n  Why is this amendment important to our students and to our future as \na nation? What is the value of student loans?\n  it is unmistakable. Student loans have a tremendous impact on our \nnation's economy . . . on personal incomes . . . on careers . . . and \nespecially on providing education to needy citizens.\n  Student loans have given millions of young Americans a fighting \nchance at reaching their own American Dream: in 1993, it gave 5.6 \nmillion Americans that chance, and that was almost double the number of \nloans made 10 years earlier, when it was 3 million, in fact, statistics \nshow that almost half of all college students receive some kind of \nfinancial aid--many through student loans.\n  They have become especially important considering that the cost of \ncollege education and post-secondary education has become a very, very \nexpensive proposition for students, as well as their families.\n  For example, a College Board survey says that 1995-1996 is the third \nstraight year that tuition costs have risen by 6 percent. Since this \nrise outpaces income growth in America, there's heavy borrowing for a \ncollege education--up an average of 17 percent yearly since 1990.\n  Each year, college costs rise 6.6 percent for private college while \nwe have recorded a rise in disposable personal income of only 4.4 \npercent. That 2 percent disparity is what is making student loans a \npipe dream for our college-bound students.\n  In fact, since 1988, college costs have risen by 54 percent--well \nahead of a 16 percent increase in the cost of living. And, more \ntellingly, student borrowing has increased by 219 percent since that \ntime.\n  Without student aid, increasing costs make higher education out of \nreach for millions of Americans.\n  We should not have to bankrupt the families of students in order to \nallow them to send their children to receive a solid college education.\n  You see, when we allow students to get the loans they need to \ncomplete their college education, we are making a sizable, long-term \ninvestment in not only personal incomes, but our economy as well.\n  Men and women who continue their education beyond high school, as we \nhave seen in study after study, have consistently earned more money on \naverage each year than those who do not.\n  In 1990, for example, the average income for high school graduates \nwas almost $18,000. For those who had 1 to 3 years of a college \neducation, earned on the average $24,000. Those who graduated from \ncollege and received a college diploma received on average salary of \n$31,000.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, a person with a \nbachelor's degree will average 50 to 55 percent more in lifetime \nearnings than a person with a high school diploma.\n  The entire country benefits, as well from student loans. For every $1 \nwe invest in education we get enormous returns as a result. Back in \n1990, another study was conducted that analyzed the school assistance \nthat was provided to high school students back in 1972.\n  For every $1 that the Federal Government invested in the student loan \nprograms at that time, the Government received $4.3 in return in tax \nrevenues.\n  According to a study by the Brookings Institute, over the last 60 \nyears, education and advancements in knowledge have accounted for 37 \npercent of America's economic growth.\n  At a time in which education is becoming paramount in this global \narena, where it is going to make the difference for an individual and \nthe kind of living that can be enjoying for themselves and their \nfamilies, education puts them on the cutting edge.\n  Most of all, it puts America on the threshold of competition for the \nfuture.\n  If we deny individuals the opportunity to receive an education \nbecause \n\n[[Page S15781]]\n\nthey lack the financial assistance or the access to financial \nassistance, clearly, we--as a nation, a superpower, and the world's \ngreatest democracy--are going to suffer.\n  Today, let's make sure that we retain policies that will make higher \neducation accessible to millions of low--and middle-income families.\n  Today, let us make a significant contribution to students pursuing a \nhigher education. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, I am very pleased to have \njoined Senator Kassebaum and Senator Jeffords offering this amendment \nthat essentially restores $5.9 billion to the student loan program. \nThis essentially reaffirms the position that has been taken by 67 \nMembers of this body when we had a vote on this issue last spring to \nthe budget resolution.\n  This amendment removes the provision that increases the origination \nfee on student loans. It removes the provision that allows interest \nrates to accrue during the so-called 6-month grace period, and it also \neliminates the provision that allowed interest rates to increase on the \nPLUS loans from 3.1 percent to 4 percent.\n  I think we all acknowledge that college costs have increased in this \ncountry. In fact, since 1988, they have increased more than 54 \npercent--16 percent beyond the growth of income for most families in \nAmerica. That has resulted in increased borrowing of 219 percent for \nindividuals and families all across this Nation so that their family \nand their children can pursue higher education.\n  I think it essential for this country to retain the policies that \nensure access for low- and middle-income families through these \npolicies.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to include as cosponsors of this \namendment Senators Roth, Domenici, Pressler, Stevens, and Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maine has \nexpired.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kassebaum \namendment which strikes from the budget reconciliation bill the \nprovisions relating to a .85 percent school fee, the elimination of the \ngrace period interest subsidy, and the PLUS loan interest rate \nincrease.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to balancing the budget--this is \nprobably the single most important thing we can do for our children and \nour country. Today's students will save money if we succeed in \nbalancing the budget. According to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, a balanced budget will lower interest rates by 1-2 percent \nfor everyone.\n  I am pleased that the leadership has found offsets which will make \nthe Kassebaum amendment revenue neutral. It will allow us to balance \nthe budget without imposing additional costs on students, their parents \nor schools.\n  This bill also benefits students by allowing those who have paid \ninterest on education loans a credit against income tax liability equal \nto 20 percent of such interest up to $500.\n  As the father of three young children, I believe that education is \none of the most important issues facing our nation today. We must \ncontinue to offer students across the country the opportunity to excel \nand obtain their goals. Many students depend on the federal student \nloan programs as their only chance to go to college. This amendment \nwill allow us to preserve those programs without imposing additional \ncosts on students.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I shall vote for the Kassebaum amendment, \nbut I have to say I am doing it with real mixed feelings because it \nfails to address something that every higher education association \nfavors, and that is direct lending. The colleges and universities in \nyour States want direct lending. The bankers in your States and the \nguarantee agencies do not want it because they have a cushy deal going \nright now.\n  The Kassebaum amendment is an improvement over the resolution as it \nis right now, so I will vote yes for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The order of business is the Bumpers motion to \ncommit to the Committee on Finance with instructions.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in 1981, this body, all but 11 Senators, \nvoted for a massive tax cut on the argument that it would help balance \nthe budget. Eight years and $2 trillion later, we all knew we had made \na massive mistake. We are about to repeat it, though not quite the \nmagnitude of that.\n  This amendment simply says what my good friend from New Mexico, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, said on May 30 of this year, that \nthere is one thing our side has agreed on: There will be no tax cut \nuntil we balance the budget.\n  Senator Domenici was right on May 30, and to vote a different way now \nis wrong.\n  The New York Times this very morning shows that a vast majority of \nthe American people, even the wealthy who benefit most from this, are \nall opposed to a tax cut until we balance the budget. It is fiscal \nresponsibility, and that is the reason we call this the fiscal \nresponsibility amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment, I think, points up the \ndifference between the two parties. We have a balanced budget. It has \nbeen certified by the Congressional Budget Office. Once we adopt this \nreconciliation instruction, we will have a balanced budget. Then it is \ntime to give the taxpayers of America some relief.\n  We get a $170 billion economic dividend for getting a balanced \nbudget. What should we do with that money? Should we spend it, or \nshould we give it back to Americans, especially families who are having \ndifficulty raising their children because we whittled down their \ndeduction such that they are kind of on their own?\n  I believe it is right when you have made savings and have a balanced \n\n[[Page S15782]]\n\nbudget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, that you ought to \ngive money back to the people and not let the dividends sit around so \nwe can spend it. The people want to spend their own money. It happens \nto be theirs, not ours.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Bumpers motion, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, according to the pending business, the next \nitem of business is the rural restoration motion.\n  I yield to the Senator from Montana for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the budget bill before us is a raid on \nrural America. It cuts the farm program and begins to eviscerate, \nobliterate the farm program by cutting $13.4 billion over 7 years, 25 \npercent cut. The budget bill cuts health care, disproportionately \naffecting rural America because our hospitals have so many seniors. \nMedicaid is cut, hurting rural America. There is already a tendency for \npeople to leave the farm and go to the city to seek some job to \nsurvive. We here should be sensitive to rural America, not insensitive, \nby raiding rural America. This bill before us raids rural America, \naccelerates the transfer of people from rural America to the city, \nwhich is something we should not do.\n  So my amendment simply says to the Finance Committee, go back and \nrestore some of these provisions that affect rural America, but still \nbalance the budget.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, under the proposed reforms in this bill, \nthe Federal Government will be spending and continue to spend $64.8 \nbillion in outlays over the next 7 years for commodity-related \nprograms.\n  Farmers will benefit the most of all groups of Americans if interest \nrates come down because they rely most on borrowed money, as compared \nwith any other group of business men or women in the country.\n  Farmers and rural America will also benefit from the capital gains \nreduction in this bill.\n  In addition, this amendment instructs the Finance Committee to make \nchanges in programs that are not even within their jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, since that makes it not germane, I raise a point of \norder that this motion violates the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending motion, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sense of the Senate.--The Senate finds that\n       (a) The Senate has held hearings on the social security \n     earnings limit in 1994 and 1995 and the House has held two \n     hearings on the social security earnings limit in 1995;\n       (b) The Senate has overwhelmingly passed Sense of the \n     Senate language calling for substantial reform of the social \n     security earnings limit;\n       (c) The House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed \n     legislation to raise the exempt amount under the social \n     security earnings limit three times, in 1989, 1992, and 1995;\n       (d) Such legislation is a key provision of the Contract \n     with America;\n       (e) The President in his 1992 campaign document ``Putting \n     People First'' pledged to lift the social security earnings \n     limit;\n       (f) The social security earnings limit is a depression-era \n     relic that unfairly punishes working seniors; therefore,\n       (g) It is the intent of the Congress that legislation will \n     be passed before the end of 1995 to raise the social security \n     earnings limit for working seniors aged 65 through 69 in a \n     manner which will ensure the financial integrity of the \n     social security trust funds and will be consistent with the \n     goal of achieving a balanced budget in 7 years.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment signals the Senate's intent \nto move forward expeditiously on reforming the earnings test. The \nmajority leader has let it be known that he will move this matter soon, \nas early as next week depending on the action of the House of \nRepresentatives. I appreciate the leadership of the majority leader, \nand I also want to thank former Finance Committee chairman, Senator \nPackwood, and Senator Moynihan for their help and for their support on \nthis matter.\n  Additionally, I want to note that the House of Representatives today \npassed a similar amendment by the overwhelming vote of 414 to 5.\n  Mr. President, the Social Security earnings test was created during \nthe Depression era when senior citizens were being discouraged from \nworking. This may have been appropriate then when 50 percent of \nAmericans were out of work. But it is certainly not appropriate today. \nIt is not appropriate today when seniors are struggling to get ahead \nand survive on limited incomes. Many of these seniors are working to \nsurvive and make it on a day-to-day basis.\n  Mr. President, most Americans are amazed to find that older Americans \nare actually penalized by the Social Security earnings test for their \nproductivity. For every $3 earned by a retiree over the $11,160 limit, \nthey lose $1 in Social Security benefits. Due to this cap on earnings, \nour senior citizens, many of whom are existing on low incomes, are \neffectively burdened with a 33-percent tax on their earned income.\n  I want to point out this only applies to people who have to go to \nwork. If someone is very rich and has a trust fund, pension, stocks, \nall of the gain that is accrued from that is not taxable. It only \napplies to low-income and middle-income Americans who in our society \ntoday have to go to work tragically for a broad variety of reasons.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of partisanship back and forth \ntoday, some regrettably and some of it is a natural happenstance when a \nrevolution is taking place because that is basically what this is all \nabout.\n  Let me point out that I heard a lot of pleas and cries in behalf of \nseniors on the part of friends on the other side of the aisle. In 1987, \nI came to the floor of this body and sought repeal of the Social \nSecurity earnings test. There was a hearing in the Finance Committee \nchaired by former chairman and former Secretary of Treasury Bentsen.\n  In 1988, I brought this amendment to the floor, and in 1989 I brought \nit to the floor, and in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994. And each time \non the other side of the aisle it was turned down.\n  I am happy to say that now this side is in the majority. In both \nbodies we will repeal the onerous and outrageous earnings test which on \nthe other side they failed to do.\n  Mr. President, if I sound a little excited about that, it is because \nwe have had a lot of rhetoric today about how cruel Members on this \nside of the aisle are to senior citizens.\n  The best way, the most effective way that we can help senior citizens \ntoday is for those who seek to go to work and have to work for a broad \nvariety of reasons to be allowed to keep their earnings. And, by the \nway, it would only be raised up to $30,000.\n  Mr. President, there is a couple who are friends of mine who live \nnear me in northern Arizona. They are low-income Americans. They have a \nson who had prostate cancer. The son has a daughter that he has to take \ncare of in a home. My friend's wife had to go back to work in order to \nsupport her son and her granddaughter. She went to work in a hospital \nwhere she has been working. She dramatically increased her hours \nbecause she is now helping her son who had prostate cancer and was out \nof work. And she gets what? She found out 2 weeks ago that she owes the \nFederal Government $1,200 because she exceeded the $11,000 limit.\n  So her ability to care for herself, her husband, her son and her \ngranddaughter is dramatically penalized because this earnings test puts \nher in the highest tax bracket of anyone in America, amongst the \nrichest.\n  Mr. President, as I said before, there is also a myth that repeal of \nthe earnings test would only benefit the rich. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. The highest effective marginal rates are imposed on the \nmiddle-income elderly who must work to supplement their income.\n  Mr. President, finally it is simply outrageous to continue two \nseparate policies that both keep people out of the work force who are \nexperienced and who want to work. We have been warned to expect a labor \nshortage. Why should we discourage our senior citizens from meeting \nthat challenge?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in order to move things along, we have a \ngreat amount of work to do, we yield back our allotted 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that editorial \nendorsements from several newspapers, and also from various \norganizations, ranging from the Seniors Coalition to the National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens, and others, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Editorial Endorsements\n\n       Chicago Tribune: The skill and expertise of the elderly \n     could be used to train future workers, while bringing in more \n     tax dollars and helping America stay competitive in the 21st \n     century.\n       Los Angeles Times: As the senior population expands and the \n     younger population shrinks in the decades ahead, there will \n     be an increasing need to encourage older workers to stay on \n     the job to maintain the nation's productivity.\n       The Baltimore Sun: The Social Security landscape is \n     littered with a great irony: While the program is built on \n     the strength of the work ethic, its earnings test actually \n     provides a disincentive to work . . . One consequence of this \n     skewed policy is the emergence of a gray, underground \n     economy--a cadre of senior citizens forced to work for \n     extremely low wages or with no benefits in exchange for being \n     paid under the table.\n       Dallas Morning News: Both individual citizens and society \n     as a whole would benefit from a repeal of the law that limits \n     what Social Security recipients may earn before their \n     benefits are reduced.\n       The San Diego Tribune: The benefit-reaction law made some \n     economic sense when Social Security was established in the \n     1930s and the government wanted to encourage the elderly to \n     leave the labor force and open up jobs for younger workers. \n     But with declining birth rates and the nation's need for \n     more, not fewer, experienced workers, the measure is bad for \n     the nation as well as its older workers.\n       Wall Street Journal: The punitive taxation of the earnings \n     limit sends the message to seniors that their country doesn't \n     want them to work, or that they are fools if they do.\n       The New York Times: . . . it is not wrong to encourage \n     willing older adults to remain in the work force.\n       The Orange County Register: Indeed, repealing the tax might \n     actually increase revenues. More people would be working, \n     paying more taxes of all kinds, including the Social Security \n     tax. If our government bureaucrats want us to keep paying \n     their salaries, the least they can do is make it possible to \n     work in the first place.\n       Houston Post: Equity and common sense demand that this \n     disincentive to work be scrapped.\n       The Cincinnati Enquirer: No American should be discouraged \n     from working, as long as he wants to and is physically able \n     to do so.\n\n[[Page S15784]]\n\n       The Indianapolis Star: On the face of it, the game appears \n     rigged in favor of those who stop working at 65 and against \n     those who keep working, in favor of well-to-do retirees and \n     against middle- and low-income retirees who need a part-time \n     job to help with expenses.\n       Forbes: Moreover, people are living longer; the economy is \n     hurt when artificial barriers block the full use of our most \n     productive asset, people.\n       Detroit News: Work is important to many of the elderly, who \n     are living longer. They shouldn't be faced with a \n     confiscatory tax for remaining productive.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 17, 1991]\n\n                       Why Push Them Out of Work?\n\n\n    congress should eliminate outmoded social security earnings test\n\n       There are more than 40 million Americans age 60 or older, \n     many of whom are eager to work beyond normal retirement age \n     but can't afford to, thanks to an outmoded earnings test \n     applied to Social Security recipients. The Senate, in a \n     provision attached to the extension of the Older Americans \n     Act, has voted to eliminate this punitive restriction. The \n     measure now goes to a congressional conference committee, \n     where House conferees will have a chance to accept the \n     Senate's provision. They should do so, and the House should \n     adopt it. Millions of workers would be the better for it, and \n     so would government and society.\n       Current law says that people between the ages of 65 and 70 \n     who draw Social Security and who earn more than $9,720 a year \n     must lost $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 they \n     earn over that limit. This rule effectively applies to those \n     workers a 33% marginal tax rate--higher than anyone else must \n     pay--but there is more. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) says that \n     when federal, state and other Social Security taxes are \n     factored in, the tax bite approaches nearly 70%. If that \n     isn't age discrimination, McCain suggests, nothing is.\n       There is no earnings ceiling for Social Security recipients \n     age 70 or older. It's nonsensical to have one for those \n     younger. Maintaining the arbitrary ceiling and taxing away 33 \n     cents out of every dollar earned from those who exceed it \n     drives millions of productive workers into forced retirement. \n     The nation's economy is not so robust that it can afford to \n     lose willing, able and experienced employees. Federal and \n     state treasuries are not so flush they can pass up the \n     revenues that could be had from taxes on the higher earnings \n     of older workers.\n       Why chase people who want to work out of the labor force? \n     Why make this pool of talent lie stagnant? The earnings \n     ceiling is an echo of an earlier time when it was argued that \n     older workers had to be pushed into retirement to make jobs \n     available for new entrants into the work force. Demographics \n     and the needs of the economy have changed. Millions of those \n     older workers want to go on working without being punished if \n     they earn too much. The time has come to let them do so.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Nov. 17, 1991]\n\n                 Age Discrimination: Lift Earnings Cap\n\n       Congress dotes on its anti-discrimination record. How then \n     to explain why its continuing prejudice is targeted at a \n     particular minority?\n       The earnings cap on Social Security benefits is a form of \n     discrimination. ``The earnings test translates into an \n     effective tax burden of 33 percent,'' Sen. John McCain told a \n     Senate committee. ``Combined with federal, state and other \n     Social Security taxes, it can amount to a stunning tax bite \n     of nearly 70 percent.''\n       The cap on earnings--set at $9,720 for retirees age 65 to \n     70--is ``age discrimination of the worst kind,'' the senator \n     said, and that ``is plainly wrong.'' For every $3 earned \n     above the cap, seniors lose $1 in benefits.\n       As Mr. McCain points out, it is foolish to maintain a \n     policy that keeps people with experience and a willingness to \n     apply their skills out of the work force, especially when the \n     country faces economic stagnation and declining international \n     competitiveness.\n       Punishing people for working is wrong in an even more \n     fundamental way. It violates an American principle known as \n     the work ethic. Surely it is poor social policy to maintain \n     disincentives to productive labor. Better to let seniors who \n     have something to contribute slip back into harness. Besides, \n     many of them need the extra income.\n       The Bush administration argues that eliminating the \n     earnings test would cost $3.9 billion in fiscal 1992. Sen. \n     McCain disagrees. He argues that lifting the cap would save \n     money, both through the collection of additional taxes on the \n     earnings of seniors and administrative savings.\n       A Senate-passed measure to lift the cap is now in a \n     conference committee, where it must be reconciled with a \n     House-approved bill that would not eliminate the earnings \n     penalty. If the House cares anything at all about fairness, \n     it will end the discrimination now in place and free older \n     Americans to work.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 5, 1991]\n\n                   End Social Security Earning Curbs\n\n                    (By U.S. Rep. J. Dennis Hastert)\n\n       When a country doesn't support its stated goals by adopting \n     policies to achieve those goals, its aims become \n     unattainable. Such is the case with our goal of restoring \n     U.S. competitiveness in the global market. We say we want to \n     regain our competitive edge, yet we follow obsolete policies \n     that preclude us from fielding the most productive work force \n     possible.\n       The most pernicious example of this practice is the \n     continued application of the Social Security Earnings Test, a \n     Depression-era relic that penalizes senior citizens who work \n     after they retire. By forcing seniors to, forfeit one-third \n     of their Social Security benefits after they earn more than a \n     ridiculously low amount, the Earnings Test tells the elderly \n     we no longer value their expertise and experience.\n       Seniors between 65 and 70 who earn more than $9,360 are \n     slapped with a 33 percent penalty. In short, the government \n     siphons $1 in penalties for every $3 a productive senior \n     earns over the limit. When coupled with federal taxes, \n     seniors who earn a penalty $10,000 a year are faced with a 56 \n     percent marginal income tax rate--twice the rate of \n     millionaires.\n       The Social Security Earnings Test is age discrimination, \n     pure and simple. Not only does it discriminate against one \n     age group, it also afflicts the seniors who need extra income \n     the most. Seniors can receive stock dividends and interest \n     payments without losing Social Security benefits, but those \n     who work at low-paying jobs to make ends meet are punished \n     for attempting to remain financially independent.\n       At a time in our nation's history when the operative buzz \n     word is ``competitiveness,'' policymakers are hypocrites when \n     they preach the gospel of working harder while retaining \n     outdated policies that strip our labor force of productive \n     and experienced workers. Just as business leaders must \n     modernize their factories, congressional leaders must update \n     public policy.\n       The Social Security Earnings Test was instituted in the \n     1930s to discourage seniors from working and make room for \n     younger Americans to enter the work force. Whether this was a \n     good idea at the time is hardly relevant; as the U.S. \n     population ages, seniors are becoming an increasingly \n     important segment of the labor force. The government should \n     support them, rather than financially penalize them, for \n     remaining active and productive.\n       By the end of this decade, there will be 1.5 million fewer \n     members of the work force aged 16 to 24. Coupled with this \n     trend is the fact that there is a sharply increasing number \n     of older persons relative to the working population. To \n     respond to these challenges, the United States needs to \n     attract more people to participate in the labor force.\n       I have introduced legislation that would help our \n     businesses adapt to the demands of the international \n     marketplace by making our work force more productive. My \n     bill, H.R.   , the Older Americans Freedom to Work Act, has a \n     majority of House members as co-sponsors, as well as \n     considerable support in the Senate (Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-\n     Minn., introduced the Senate version). But many in the House \n     leadership remain opposed to it. The Ways and Means Committee \n     chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), and Social \n     Security subcommittee chairman, Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-\n     Ind.), are laboring under the incorrect assumption that \n     repeal of the Earnings Test will lead to a shortfall in \n     government revenue, when exactly the opposite is true.\n       If the Earnings Test is repealed, more seniors--up to \n     700,000, according to the National Center for Policy \n     Analysis, an economic research group--would rejoin the work \n     force, expanding the tax base and increasing the amount of \n     tax revenue the government receives from these returning \n     workers and taxpayers. As a result, the NCPA reported, the \n     annual output of goods would increase by at least $15.4 \n     billion.\n       The NCPA, in concert with the Institute for Policy \n     Innovation, another research group, revealed these findings \n     in a recently published report, ``Paying People Not to Work: \n     The Economic Cost of the Social Security Earnings Limit.''\n       Repealing the Earnings Test would also be a federal revenue \n     gainer, the groups reported. ``Government revenue would \n     increase by $4.9 billion, more than offsetting the additional \n     Social Security benefits that would be paid,'' the report \n     stated.\n       The few remaining naysayers who continue to oppose repeal \n     of the Earnings Test base their opposition on the belief that \n     Social Security is an insurance policy. Specifically, Jacobs \n     argues that benefits should be allocated only to those who \n     are ``retired''--and if someone is still working, and hence \n     not ``retired,'' he or she should not receive full benefits.\n       This reasoning ignores the difficulty seniors encounter in \n     attempting to survive solely on Social Security or working at \n     a job; seniors frequently need both to make ends meet. \n     Because economic realities necessitate more money than Social \n     Security or, say, a job at McDonald's provides, the Earnings \n     Test must be repealed. Jacobs is simply out of step with the \n     realities of the cost of living in the 1990's.\n       It is disturbing that two powerful committee chairmen are \n     in a position to block landmark legislation that has the \n     official support of a majority in the House.\n       It would be one thing to have the Older Americans Freedom \n     to Work Act deliberated on the House floor and tabled. At \n     least then the merits--or what some believe to be the lack \n     thereof--would have been put in the open and subject to \n     public inspection.\n\n[[Page S15785]]\n\n       But a powerful minority of House leaders are doing \n     everything in their power to make sure this bill is never \n     debated on the House floor. Because of their refusal to allow \n     deliberation on the proposed repeal of the Earnings Test, one \n     can only conclude that they are fearful open discussion would \n     lead to an even greater groundswell of public support and a \n     demand that Congress move swiftly to approve the bill.\n       As our country takes steps to make itself more economically \n     competitive for the 21st Century, it is clear that we will \n     have to use every available resource, especially in the U.S. \n     work force. Remaining competitive in the next century \n     requires adopting policies that foster economic vibrancy and \n     doing away with outdated policies that inhibit it. Repealing \n     the Social Security Earnings Test will both encourage a large \n     portion of the population to remain productive and help \n     bolster the economy. The realities of our economic situation \n     demand that we do so.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                  Air Force Sergeants Association,\n\n\n                                   International Headquarters,\n\n                                Temple Hills, MD, January 8, 1992.\n     Hon.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain. We fully support your proposal to \n     eliminate the Social Security Earning Limit for senior \n     citizens age 65 to 69. Furthermore, we favor additional \n     relief for senior citizens in the age group 62 to 64 who are \n     faced with an even more stringent limit on their earnings.\n       In today's society, Social Security is a supplement to a \n     senior's income which is traditionally pension and \n     investments. Unfortunately, some must continue to work to \n     maintain a quality of life that is becoming evermore \n     expensive.\n       Our opinion is formulated by the following compelling \n     issues:\n       Our nation is faced with a shrinking labor supply for one \n     of the fastest growing sectors of the economy--the service \n     sector. Many seniors are fully capable of and interested in \n     filing these openings.\n       As stated in your fact sheet, we should not have a system \n     that has built-in disincentives that inhibit seniors from \n     working.\n       The current ``cap'' of $8,040 does not permit a senior in \n     the 62-64 age group to work in a minimum wage ($4.25/hour) \n     job for an entire year without incurring a penalty on the \n     last 10% of their income.\n       Seniors represent a growing part of our population who \n     possess skill and attributes that employers are seeking. \n     Seniors offer experience and an excellent work ethic to an \n     employer.\n       Also, in light of the health care reform issue that is on \n     everyone's mind, by raising the earnings ``cap,'' this will \n     allow seniors to avoid the Catch-22 of not being able to work \n     enough hours to qualify for health care at most corporations.\n       In conclusion, we believe that seniors should always be \n     able to work in a minimum wage paying job full time (40 hours \n     per week) without being penalized. To ensure that this is not \n     a future problem, we recommend that the Social Security \n     Earnings Limit be indexed at 25% above the annual full time \n     income based on prevailing federally mandated minimum wage. \n     Currently, that would increase the cap to $11,050. \n     Internally, this would allow us to hire a senior, have them \n     work 30 hours per week, and penetrate the rate range to the \n     second step before reaching this new ceiling.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to express our views on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dianna Morgan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                          National Council of Senior Citizens,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1992.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We urge your support of an early and \n     positive vote for S. 3008, the Older Americans Act (OAA) \n     reauthorization. We believe that further delay in \n     reauthorizing the Act is a disservice to the millions of \n     seniors and their families who depend on vital OAA programs.\n       The National Council of Senior Citizens, comprised of five \n     million seniors active in five thousand clubs and Councils, \n     has made passage of the OAA reauthorization one of our \n     highest priorities for this Session. The Council has \n     historically supported a sound Social Security retirement \n     test amendment has caused a yearlong delay in final passage \n     of the OAA. The two issues should be separated now and \n     support of S. 3008 is the best way of resolving this matter.\n       Inaction on S. 3008 will be the cause of further loss of \n     resources and a weakening of the national commitment to meet \n     the needs of older persons at risk. We trust that we can \n     count on your vigorous support of S. 3008.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lawrence T. Smedley,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Council of Jewish Federations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1992.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Council of Jewish \n     Federations, I am writing to urge the immediate passage of \n     the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, S3008. \n     Millions of older citizens depend on the programs funded in \n     this Act for community and social services, nutrition \n     programs, senior centers, legal assistance, homebound care \n     and assistance, research and demonstration, and employment \n     opportunities.\n       As a network of over 200 Jewish Federations and their \n     affiliated social service agencies, we are charged with the \n     responsibility for providing thousands of elderly people with \n     a life of quality. The Older Americans Act, with its \n     coordination between local, state, and federal agencies, \n     enables us to do this.\n       The Older Americans Act, originally enacted in 1965, has \n     been a framework for providing vital nutritional and social \n     services to the elderly community for over 25 years. At a \n     time when seniors are growing as a population, the Older \n     Americans Act should not be pulled from them. By passing the \n     Older Americans Act the Senate will move one step further \n     along in the process necessary to ensure that the elderly may \n     continue to receive the quality care they need.\n       We urge you to pass this critical legislation immediately.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mark E. Talisman,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                         Older Women's League,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1992.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Older Women's League, I am \n     writing to urge you to pass the Older Americans Act, S.3008, \n     before Congress adjourns.\n       I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is to pass \n     the Older Americans Act. The reauthorization of this \n     legislation and its programs is critical to providing \n     continuing supportive services for millions of older \n     Americans, most of whom are low-income and women. Without \n     final passage, important new programs cannot be initiated and \n     the White House Conference on Aging cannot take place. \n     Amendments of particular importance to OWL are those \n     requiring data collection on long-term care workers, and \n     supportive services for family caregivers.\n       From its inception, the Older Women's League has sought \n     changes in Social Security that would make the system more \n     equitable for women. While OWL has endorsed the Social \n     Security provisions attached to the OAA conference bill \n     passed by the House of Representatives, we believe that these \n     and other changes to Social Security should be dealt with in \n     a more appropriate legislative measure. We hope to continue \n     working with Congress next year to make Social Security \n     equitable for beneficiaries, particularly women.\n       Passage of the Older Americans Act is long overdue. The Act \n     is the cornerstone of services for this country's most \n     vulnerable older population. Congress must reaffirm its \n     commitment to assure the quality of life sought for older \n     Americans as declared in Title I of the Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Lou Glasse,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                          National Council on the Aging, Inc.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1992.\n       Dear Senator: The National Council on the Aging, Inc. urges \n     you to support for immediate Senate action to reauthorize the \n     Older Americans Act, S. 3008.\n       Today, we are joining forces with many other national \n     organizations to seek your help in passing a clean Older \n     Americas Act.\n       For the past two decades, the OAA has provided vital \n     services including congregate and home-delivered meals, \n     transportation, information and referral, advocacy \n     assistance, visiting and telephone reassurance, homemaker \n     services, legal and employment services.\n\n[[Page S15786]]\n\n       Failure to take action on the reauthorization means that \n     none of the many significant improvements in OAA services \n     crafted after long Congressional scrutiny will be initiated. \n     Inaction has already had an effect on the current \n     appropriation process in the House.\n       The delay in passing the OAA jeopardizes those services \n     that allow millions of older Americans to maintain their \n     independence and dignity. This year's amendments, many of \n     which enhance services under the Act, cannot be implemented \n     until it passes. Failure to pass the reauthorization will \n     create a major rift in the covenant between Congress and the \n     older population of our country.\n       I cannot stress strongly enough the importance of passage \n     of S. 3008, the Older Americans Act at this time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Dr. Daniel Thursz,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                       Area Agencies on Aging,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1992.\n     John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the members of the \n     National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, I am writing \n     to urge you to take immediate action to pass the Older \n     Americans Act reauthorization legislation, S. 3008. Thousands \n     of older Americans in Arizona and millions of elders across \n     our nation depend on the services provided under the Act--\n     information and referral, supportive services, nutrition \n     programs, transportation, in-home care and assistance, and \n     the long-term care ombudsman program.\n       Senate inaction on S. 3008 is placing low-income, minority, \n     and frail elders in jeopardy. Because of resulting funding \n     problems, older persons are being denied services, there are \n     increases in service waiting lists, and higher levels of \n     unmet need.\n       As you are probably aware, passage of the Older Americans \n     Act has been stalled by provisions to amend the exemption \n     level of the Social Security earnings test. For the past nine \n     months Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on the \n     earnings test issue. We strongly believe it is time Congress \n     moved beyond this impasse by decoupling the earnings test \n     from the Older Americans Act--by passing S. 3008. Further \n     delay will do a disservice to older persons who depend on \n     Older Americans Act services. We, therefore, urge you to take \n     the necessary steps to obtain immediate passage of this \n     crucial legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Cheryll Schramm,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                    Retired Federal Employees,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1992.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Association of Retired \n     Federal Employees (NARFE), and its nearly 450,000 members, is \n     greatly concerned that the Older Americans Act has not yet \n     been reauthorized.\n       Today, we are joining forces with many other national aging \n     organizations to seek your help in passing a clean Older \n     Americans Act, S. 3008. Unless the Act is reauthorized soon, \n     we fear that service programs that benefit low-income, \n     minority and frail elders will be jeopardized.\n       We hope that you will join with us to urge passage of S. \n     3008 so that Older Americans Act programs for community and \n     supportive services, nutrition programs, senior centers, \n     legal assistance and elder opportunities serving millions of \n     older Americans will be able to continue uninterrupted.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Harold Price,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     National Association of State\n\n\n                                               Units on Aging,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 28, 1992.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Association of State \n     Units on Aging urges your support for immediate Senate action \n     to reauthorize the Older Americans Act, S. 3008. While the \n     Older Americans Act itself has received almost unanimous \n     support on the floor of both Houses, it has been held captive \n     for months by a host of seemingly never ending congressional \n     procedural roadblocks and controversial and non-germane \n     amendments.\n       Failure by the Senate to act swiftly will result in an \n     unconscionable reduction in funds available across the nation \n     to provide meals, transportation, in-home services, jobs, \n     advocacy for nursing home residents, elder abuse prevention \n     and similar, often life-sustaining, services to millions of \n     low-income and frail older persons.\n       NASUA's members are the nation's 57 state agencies on \n     aging, designated by Governors and state legislatures to \n     represent and serve older persons in their states. They have \n     tried to explain to older persons that these frustrating \n     delays do not indicate a lack of congressional support for \n     this program which is so important to them. However, their \n     questions have turned to anger, their frustration to \n     disillusionment.\n       Once again, we urge the Senate's immediate passage of S. \n     3008. Swift action can still avoid unnecessary and \n     unwarranted reductions in Older Americans Act service funds \n     and rescue literally years of congressional work to \n     strengthen the Act from being lost when this Congress \n     adjourns in a few short weeks.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views on this issue \n     of critical importance to millions of older persons.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Daniel A.

Mr. President, I understand this amendment is stacked \nnow. We do not vote on it now. We go next to another Republican \namendment. We had a change in what our next amendment would be. But the \nDemocrats have been advised. This will be the Helms amendment. Senator \nHelms is ready on the floor, and they have a copy of it on the other \nside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2965\n\n(Purpose: To allow senior citizens to continue to choose their doctors)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2965.\n       On page 461, line 13, after the period, insert the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Point-of-service coverage.--If a Medicare Choice \n     sponsor offers a Medicare Choice plan that limits benefits to \n     items and services furnished only by providers in a network \n     of providers which have entered into a contract with the \n     sponsor, the sponsor must also offer at the time of \n     enrollment, a Medicare Choice plan that permits payment to be \n     made under the plan for covered items and services when \n     obtained out-of-network by the Individual.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am sure that I am not alone in my strong \nfeelings that the senior citizens of America must not be deprived of \ntheir right to choose their own doctors.\n  The text of my amendment has been modified to address both my strong \ndesire to preserve the right of the senior citizens and the concerns of \na number of Senators relating to options.\n  The pending amendment stipulates that if a Medicare choice plan \noffers a closed plan HMO within the Medicare margin, that plan must \nalso offer a point-of-service plan enabling senior citizens to exercise \ntheir freedom of choice regarding the selection of physicians.\n  Three summers ago, I had a little encounter with some remarkable \nmedical doctors, who are also my personal friends, in my hometown of \nRaleigh. I was at that time, of course, free to \n\n[[Page S15787]]\n\nchoose the team of surgeons who performed my heart surgery.\n  The point is that all senior citizens enrolled in Medicare should \nhave the same choice that I had. And the pending amendment will enable \nsenior citizens to preserve their right to choose their doctors.\n  Most Americans, whether their health is insured by private firms or \nby Medicare, enjoy their freedom to decide which medical professionals \nwill perform their care and treatment. In reforming Medicare, Congress \nmust make sure that senior citizens know their options and can choose \ntheir doctors and other medical providers instead of being required to \naccept somebody else's lineup of physicians and surgeons.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is considering major reforms to save \nMedicare and prevent its being pushed over the cliff. Medicare must be \nreformed before it goes bankrupt. We agree on that. Otherwise, the \nMedicare trust fund will be flat broke when the 21st century rolls \naround just a few years hence.\n  America's senior citizens--and I am one of them--depend on the health \ncare coverage provided by the Medicare system, and those of us in \nCongress have a duty to make sure that they will not be forced to give \nup their right to choose their doctors. It is vital to their future \nsecurity that our senior citizens retain this right. The power to \nchoose will place senior citizens firmly in control of their health \ncare.\n  Senior citizens may be enticed to join an HMO because they will gain \ncoverage for prescription drugs and eyeglasses and hearing aids--\ncoverages not presently provided by Medicare.\n  However, without some moderating legislation, senior citizens could \nvery well find themselves locked into coverage that limits them to \nservices provided by HMO-affiliated doctors, other professionals and \nhospitals. No longer would senior citizens have the freedom to choose \ntheir own doctors.\n  So, Mr. President, these are the reasons why I am introducing this \namendment, to make sure that all Medicare-eligible Americans who choose \nto enroll in an HMO know their options of choosing the closed panel HMO \nor the point-of-service plan offered by the same insurance company.\n  Mr. President, consider if you will the predicament of a patient who \nrequires heart surgery, and whose HMO will not approve the cardiologist \nwith whom the senior has built up a longstanding relationship. My \namendment will enable women being treated for breast cancer to have \nmore options when choosing a lower cost plan that will allow them to \ncontinue to see the specialists familiar with them and their \nconditions. For this reason, more than a hundred patient advocacy \ngroups have voiced their support for this amendment.\n  Point-of-service plans provide a safety valve to protect seniors who \nfind themselves in the position of needing to see a doctor of choice. A \npoint of service plan enables patients to see physicians and \nspecialists inside and outside the managed care network. If seniors \ncitizens are satisfied with the care they receive within the network, \nthey will feel no need to choose outside doctors and specialists.\n  Mr. President, CBO has given me repeated assurances that a built-in \npoint-of-service feature--the technical term for freedom of choice--\nwould not increase the cost of Medicare. In fact, in testimony before \nthe Senate Budget Committee, CBO stated that ``the point of service \noption would permit Medicare enrollees to go to providers outside the \nHMO's panel when they wanted to, and yet it need not increase the \nbenefit costs to HMOs or to Medicare. . . .''\n  Moreover, the actuarial firm of Milliman and Robertson concluded that \ndepending on the terms of the plan and a reasonable cost sharing \nschedule, there should be no increase in cost to the HMO. In fact, \nthere could actually be a savings.\n  The fastest-growing health insurance product is a managed care plan \nthat includes the point-of-service feature. In fact, in 1993, 61 \npercent of all HMOs offer a point of service option.\n  Building a point-of-service option into health plans under Medicare \nwill not interfere with the plan's ability to contain cost, nor will it \nlimit their efforts to encourage providers and patients to use their \nhealth care resources wisely. It simply will ensure that health plans \nput the patient's interest first.\n  We can save Medicare. We can extend its benefits while lowering the \ntowering costs that beset us today. And my amendment, we can also \npreserve a basic American freedom to choose one's own doctor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that at the expiration or \nyielding back of debate time on each amendment, the amendment be laid \naside to consider the next amendment in order, and that when the next \norder of stacked votes begins, each amendment be voted on in the order \nin which it was offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and that \nit be charged to the 5 minutes on our allocated time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could you hold up on the quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. EXON. Be glad to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are we charging time because we have not given you this \namendment?\n  Mr. EXON. We are having a great deal of difficulty. Since you have \nchanged the order of offering amendments, our Senator was not alerted, \nand we are having trouble getting him here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you like to have 5 minutes and charge it to no \none while the Senator gets down here?\n  Mr. EXON. I would appreciate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are just going to do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent we go into a quorum call for 5 minutes and \nthat it not be charged to the bill or to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend for his courtesy.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have a very \nbrief, 2-minute colloquy with Senator Helms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to Senator Helms, just briefly, there was a little \nevolutionary process that we went through with this amendment. I think \nthe amendment is very good, and I am in support of the amendment. \nInitially the Senator had it that under a managed plan, if a person \nwanted to leave the managed plan in one area of specialty, there was a \nsplit between the additional costs, if there were additional costs, of \n70-30 percent. My suggestion in talking with the Senator and with his \nstaff was it might be a better idea if we had a managed plan that \nallowed the market to take care of that differential so that if an \nindividual went into a managed plan and at a later date wanted to go to \nanother specialist, that individual would pay the differential himself \nso that the patient would have the choice of any practitioner he wanted \nto use and yet the savings of the managed plan would be effected.\n  My question would be, does the Senator think that perhaps this might \navoid a duplication of all kinds of actuarial calculations, just to \nhave one? And maybe we could talk about this or bring this up during \nthe conference.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator's suggestion was excellent, and as he knows we \nundertook to adjust and modify the amendment to conform with the \nSenator's excellent suggestion.\n  Now, the HMO may set up a cost sharing plan in the manner that the \n\n[[Page S15788]]\n\nSenator from Oklahoma suggested. A plan may require that the senior \ncitizen pay up to 100 percent of the difference between what a network \ndoctor would charge and what the HMO would pay for the doctor. And that \nis, of course, one of the many options.\n  My amendment is intentionally silent as to how an HMO should set its \ncost sharing schedule, but as the Senator has suggested, HMO's could \nset deductibles and other specific cost sharing arrangements.\n  So I commend the Senator on his suggestion. The modified version of \nthe amendment is at the desk.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to have a chance to look at that. I think we all want to \naccomplish the same low cost and choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. I give the Senator a copy of the modified amendment which \nis now pending.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, could I get back to understanding \nwhere we are. We were on a 5-minute kind of recess waiting for the \nDemocrats to have an opportunity and then we got a discussion going, \nwhich I think was good, for the record. Now where are we \nparliamentarywise?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 5 minutes \nremaining on his time on the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague.\n  I yield back the 5 minutes of time that was allotted to us in the \ninterest of conserving time and moving ahead.\n  Let me say the next amendment that we have now, which we do not have, \nis the amendment to be offered by Senator Brown, as I understand it. We \nare having a great deal of difficulty with this shifting back and \nforth, trying to accommodate an awful lot of people. We do not mind \naccommodating people, but it is very difficult for us to make a \ndetermination on these things and get the proper people here the way we \nare receiving the amendments, or not receiving them, before they are \nintroduced.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, I say to Senator Exon, I am willing to accommodate \nwhichever way he would like. We are not ready with the amendment that \nwe styled for, the Finance Committee amendment. That is being worked on \nnow. I mean, that is just a matter of fact. We cannot bring it until it \nis done.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. FORD. We have a Brown amendment, and Senator Brown is not even on \nthe list of 17 given to us. And the first four that were given to us--\n--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is No. 17.\n  Mr. EXON. That is a question mark, yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Brown is a question mark?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We never thought he was a question mark.\n  Mr. FORD. That is a question mark on the list the Senator gave to us?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Now, am I to understand that there will only be 10 out of \nthe 17 that the Senator will give us?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. There are only going to be 10 that we will have 5 \nminutes on a side. Any that are left over go into the----\n  Mr. FORD. Third tier.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The third tier with no time.\n  Mr. FORD. The only thing we have on the Brown amendment is a question \nmark?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. We just got it. We do not know who to go to here or to have \ndebate or if we want to even debate. This is getting completely out of \nhand, and we are not doing it properly. We are not being fair to either \nside. I think that we should stop now and go back and get it in order. \nAnd we will have ours. You had the first three, and then we get one, \nand we can tell you who that is and what it is about.\n  But I think we ought to take a few minutes, get them in order so we \nwill know and we can have a decent 5-minute debate on each amendment on \nthe floor.\n  Now, I think the Senator from New Mexico agrees with me because he \nhas been a little bit frustrated by not being able to get them in the \norder in which he told me that we were going to get them.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge that we just take some time to get the \namendments, because we do not know what the Senator from Colorado is \ngoing to offer, except the question mark.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I suggest in the interest of an orderly \nprocess--I already yielded back 10 minutes of our time, which still \nholds--therefore, I would suggest possibly it might be a good idea to \ntake a 15-minute quorum call without being further charged to each \nside, and to come up with an orderly process so we can move \nexpeditiously ahead.\n  Would the Senator from New Mexico respond?\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield.\n  Yes, I say to Senator Brown, I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I did not mean to interfere. I think the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky raises a very valid point. As far as I am \nconcerned, I would be happy to limit my remarks to 1 minute and then to \ndefer for a response time, which would give the distinguished Senator \nsome additional time to review it. I think this is very \nstraightforward.\n  Mr. FORD. We do not even know what it is yet.\n  Mr. BROWN. I delivered a copy.\n  Mr. FORD. We just now got it.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will try to accommodate any way I can.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me say we are in very good \nshape, comparatively speaking. So, I hope nobody is taken in by my \nexaggerations, or perhaps the exaggerations of the other side, on how \nmuddled we are. We are not muddled at all. We were going to offer a \nFinance Committee amendment which is a very important amendment. We \nhave been very forthright. It is not ready.\n  Now, having said that, we do not have your No. 1 amendment from the \nsecond tier. We have a statement of it. We have the Biden tax credit. \nWe have not seen it either. And the Breaux child tax credit has been \ncirculating around, so maybe we have seen it.\n  Now, what we would like to do is to have Senator Brown go next. And, \nI say to the Senator, his is an important amendment, so I would ask him \nnot to take less than 5 minutes. The Senator is entitled to explain it.\n  So we have that. And there are two changes. Let me see if we can help \nto get something done. I do not like being in this position either. So \nwhat we need to do is to get the Brown amendment. Or does the Senator \nhave it now?\n  Mr. BROWN. We have copies, and both sides have it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We ask the Senator that he give us the remainder of his \nfirst three that we do not have.\n  We would like 15 minutes; do it the Senator's way. And we will try to \nget our amendments and get them to the other side. We are having some \ndifficulty because our people did not know exactly when they were going \nto come up. We drew some arbitrary lines on who was in and who was out, \nwhich is tough for some of them.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have a 15-minute \nquorum call--\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Instead of the quorum call, could others address generalities in the \n\n[[Page S15789]]\n\nmeasure rather than just have a quorum call put in? This Senator would \nrequire about 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. Sure.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that we have 15 minutes without \nan amendment, divided equally, for any Senators, half on the other \nside, half on ours, that might want to speak to the bill, and that it \nnot be charged to anything, because we are getting very short of time \nand it is sort of combined--our fault for the time. So let us not \ncharge it to anyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been listening with great attention \nand interest to this very important debate on both sides of the aisle \nregarding the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995.\n  I am pleased to support the budget which follows through on our \npromise to balance the budget by the year 2002, protect Social \nSecurity, and save Medicare from threatened bankruptcy.\n  While there has been much debate focused on the details of this \nmassive package, I would like to address the promise to the American \npeople, present and future, that this bill represents. This is not just \na budget for another year. This is not a package of routine legislative \nchanges. This is a historic commitment to America that deficit spending \nis about to come to an end and has been brought about during this first \nyear of the Republican majority in the U.S. Congress.\n  The net result of a balanced budget will be lower interest rates for \nyears to come and as many as 6 million new jobs. The reforms in this \nbill will give the States more control over critical entitlement \nprograms that have become inflated with the Federal bureaucracy \nmismanagement of many years. These programs range from Aid to Families \nWith Dependent Children to Medicaid. I strongly support these \ninitiatives which will let the States decide how best to solve and \nserve the problems associated with their own citizens.\n  What is best for Virginia is not necessarily the same as what is best \nfor another State. And this Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act will \nmove more power and money out of Washington back to State governments \nand local communities where it properly, in my judgment, belongs.\n  I have received correspondence from many Virginians who support this \nbill because it will both balance the budget for the sake of future \nAmerican families, particularly our children, Mr. President, and will \npave the way for needed relief for the heavy tax burden on our present \nAmerican families.\n  When this budget reconciliation bill is signed into law, we will not \nbe at the end of the trail, but only at the beginning. We will have \nidentified the path and the course, but each year we will have to make \nspending decisions that will keep us on the road that is being defined \nhere today and tomorrow.\n  During my nearly 17 years as a privileged Member of this body, I have \nseen many instances where unforeseen spending requirements from \nhurricanes to peacekeeping operations have arisen and been funded by \nthe Congress. These will surely occur from now until the year 2002 when \nthe deficit is projected to disappear.\n  We are now committed to making our Government live within the funding \nlevels contained in this bill. If emergencies occur, we will have to \noffset their costs with spending reductions. Those budget decisions \nwill be as difficult in the year 2000 as they are this year. But this \npackage is a commitment by the Republican majority and eventually by \nthe entire Congress that we will stay the course.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n           CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUTS: A BOOST TO ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the capital gains tax \ncut provisions in the budget reconciliation bill that lies before us \ntoday.\n  I would like to focus my remarks on the economic effects that these \nprovisions will have on our country.\n  Mr. President, what often seems to get lost in all of the debate \nabout capital gains is economics.\n  Opponents of the capital gains tax cut seem content to promote class \nwarfare while ignoring the economic effects of such a change.\n  It seems to me, however, that instead of worrying about whether the \nso-called rich will pay less in taxes under this bill, the most \nimportant thing to focus on is how to sustain and boost economic growth \nso we can balance the budget and create the jobs needed by the next \ngeneration.\n  The respected economic forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw Hill has \nstudied our capital gains tax provisions very carefully. Their findings \nappear on this chart 1 following this statement.\n  First, we should note that between now and 1999, DRI projects that \nabout 600,000 new jobs will be created as a direct result of the \ncapital gains provisions contained in this bill.\n  Of paramount concern to all of us is the need to expand the job base \nso that no matter where one is on the ladder of success, there is \nopportunity to move up economically.\n  As this chart 2 shows, most of the new job creation taking place in \nthis country is provided by new companies and those that are in the \nearly phases of their growth cycles.\n  Look at the figures--while large companies are in the down-sizing \nmode, small and medium companies are expanding.\n  The expanding companies are not the long established blue chippers. \nThere is more risk involved investing in these emerging enterprises \nthan in mature companies.\n  By lowering the effective capital gains tax rates, the risk threshold \nfor all investors will decrease and this will cause more equity funds \nto become available to companies that are in the growth stage.\n  To illustrate this dynamic, Mr. President, consider the following \nfacts.\n  From 1969 to 1971, there were on average 510 new public offerings in \nthis country per year.\n  From 1972 to 1976, when the effective capital gains rates jumped to \njust over 49 percent, only 145 new public offerings occurred on average \neach year.\n  When the effective capital gains rate fell to 20 percent between 1981 \nand 1986, the average annual new public offerings figure jumped to 577.\n  Between 1987 and 1992, when the capital gains tax rate jumped up \nagain to 28 percent, the number of public offerings dropped to only \n431.\n  While some growth in new company formations can be attributed to the \nfact that our economy was growing during those years, one wonders how \nmuch more it might have benefited if we had not increased the capital \ngains tax rate.\n  Obviously, there is a relationship between the capital gains tax rate \nand the rate at which new companies start and grow.\n  And, because these new and expanding companies are fueling most of \nour job growth--more than 70 percent of all new jobs are in small \nbusiness--we can see that lowering the capital gains tax rate will \nincrease the number of jobs in this country.\n  Mr. President, DRI has made three other projections on chart 1.\n  Because of the capital gains provisions in this bill, we should \nexperience a 4.1 percent increase in our capital stock, a 5.1 percent \nincrease in fixed investments and a 1.2 percent increase in labor \nproductivity.\n  What does capital stock refer to? It refers to our investment in \nplant, equipment, and technology. Even a ditch digger needs a shovel.\n  While hundreds of millions of laborers around the world work for mere \npennies per hour, how is it that most of our American jobs have not \nalready been exported outside of our country? The answer is capital \nstock.\n  We have one of the highest ratios in the world of capital stock per \nlabor hour worked.\n  In other words, for each hour a laborer works, we have more capital \ninvested to support that worker in his or her job than most of our \ncompetitors around the world.\n  As a result, on a per capita basis, American workers are the most \nproductive in the world.\n  This explains how our country grew from a predominantly agricultural \neconomy to a predominantly manufacturing and services economy without \nreducing our agricultural output.\n  It has been estimated that at the turn of the century, about two-\nthirds of the American work force were in farming.\n\n[[Page S15790]]\n\n  Today, only about 3 percent of Americans work in farming. Yet, our \ngrocery stores and storage facilities are filled to overflowing even \nthough the number of mouths to feed has gone up and the number of \nagricultural workers has gone down dramatically.\n  But for this tremendous infusion of capital stock into the equation, \nour American farmers would probably be about as productive and well \npaid as their counterparts in China.\n  Because of the capital investment supporting our workers, we have \nmade their services more valuable which, in turn, has prompted higher \nreal wage rates here than most other countries in the world.\n  Mr. President, the critical relationship between capital stock and \nreal wage rates is illustrated by chart 3. Note that as our capital \nstock grows, real wages increase almost in lock-step. Thus, it is \ncritical that we maintain growth in both capital stock, fixed asset \ninvestment, and worker productivity.\n  And, as the DRI projections show, the capital gains provisions of \nthis bill will do just that.\n  Please note, Mr. President, the DRI projection in chart 1 that our \ncollective cost of capital will drop by 8 percent as a result of the \ncapital gains tax reductions in our bill.\n  Many believe that our relatively high cost of capital is a critical \narea of U.S. weakness when competing in the international marketplace.\n  Thus, in passing a capital gains tax reduction, we can take a \nmeaningful step today toward narrowing this critical competitive gap \nand helping all Americans in the process.\n  It should go without saying that growth in our collective standard of \nliving depends upon growth in our gross domestic product.\n  Mr. President, a 1.4 percent increase in GDP in the DRI projections \ncontained in chart 1 might not seem like very much, but when applied to \na $7 trillion economy, we are talking about an additional $100 billion \nof growth.\n  As can be seen from this chart 4, Mr. President, we treat capital \ngains more punitively than most of our major international competitors.\n  We can also see why the competitors in the Far East are gaining on \nus. We need to respond to this challenge in order to enhance our \ninternational competitive position.\n  Mr. President, much has been said about the wisdom of lowering \ncapital gains taxes at a time when we are trying to balance the budget.\n  In my opinion, tax cuts and balancing the budget are not mutually \nexclusive, especially in the area of capital gains.\n  Before the Hatch-Lieberman capital gains proposal underwent minor \nchanges in the Senate Finance Committee, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation projected that it would result in about $89 billion in lost \nFederal revenues over 10 years.\n  I very much doubt that this projection will be accurate, for a couple \nof reasons.\n  First, both the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation have a poor \ntrack record in estimating the revenue effects of capital gains tax \nrate changes, as can be seen from this chart.\n  In connection with estimated capital gains realizations for 1991, CBO \noriginally projected realizations of $269 billion while the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation projected realizations of $285 billion.\n  In reality, there were only about $108 billion worth of realizations \nfor that year. In other words, the CBO was off by 60 percent and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation was off by 62 percent.\n  Estimating errors of a similar magnitude were made for 1990. In this \ncase, the Bush Treasury Department projected capital gains revenues of \n$48 billion, while CBO projected $53 billion for that same year.\n  In reality, the revenue only amounted to $28 billion. The cumulative \ngap from 1989 to 1992 between the Bush Treasury's revenue estimates and \nwhat actually was realized totaled $85 billion. The CBO was $118 \nbillion off the mark over the same period.\n  The problem is that the economic models used by CBO, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, and the Treasury do not adequately take into \naccount the macroeconomic feedback effects caused by changes in the \ncapital gains tax rates.\n  This explains the wide divergence between their projections and \nreality.\n  It is a fundamental law of economics that people respond to \nincentives. If we tax a good or service more, people buy or produce \nless of it. If we tax capital more, we get less.\n  If we lower the tax on capital, we will create more of it.\n  For years, the revenue estimating agencies of the Federal Government \nhave failed to adequately account for the feedback effects of taxation.\n  DRI has included these feedback effects in its estimate.\n  As the DRI study indicates in chart 1, rather than the loss projected \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation, we should actually experience at \nleast a $12 billion increase in Federal revenues over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Personally, I believe this estimate to be on the conservative side. I \nbelieve a 50-percent capital gains deduction will unlock the floodgates \nof capital gains realizations.\n  There is an estimated $8 trillion in unrealized capital gains in this \ncountry. Even if this bill only unlocks a small percentage of this vast \nmountain of capital, we will have unleashed a tremendous force for \ngrowth in our economy.\n  With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see that we made a \nserious mistake in raising the effective tax rates on capital gains \nafter 1986.\n  Chart 5 shows the foregone realizations that we missed by the 1986 \ncapital gains tax increase.\n  The lighter bars indicate actual realizations. Notice, Mr. President, \nhow they drop off and stagnate after 1986 while the Standard and Poors \nstock index [S & P Index] continued to rise.\n  The dark bars represent what taxable capital gains realizations would \nlikely have occurred if they had kept pace with the S Index, as they \ndid before the capital gains tax increase.\n  This helps explain why our capital gains tax revenues have been so \nanemic since 1986.\n  After jacking up the top effective capital gains tax rate by 40 \npercent, from 20 to 28 percent, some might have expected a similar 40 \npercent increase in capital gains tax revenues.\n  However, we have only managed to generate an average of about 64 \npercent per year of the capital gains revenue received in 1986; 28 \npercent is clearly higher than the tax rate that maximizes capital \ngains revenues to the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, recent history has made it clear that there is a \ndirect relationship between capital gains tax rates and the amount of \nrevenue from capital gains realizations received by the Treasury.\n  Experience shows that reducing the capital gains tax rate actually \nincreases government revenues.\n  Consider the period from 1978 to 1985. On November 1, 1978, the top \ncapital gains rate dropped from an effective 49 percent to 28 percent. \nIt fell again in the middle of 1981 to 20 percent.\n  Rather than experiencing a similar reduction in capital gains \nrevenue, as some might predict, we saw the sharpest increase in such \nrevenues since World War II.\n  Annual capital gains tax receipts grew from $9.1 billion in 1978 to \n$26.5 billion in 1985.\n  In other words, at the same time we experienced a 59 percent decrease \nin the top capital gains tax rate, our annual capital gains tax \nrevenues increased by 191 percent.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare, in effect, saying that no tax benefits should go to the so-called \nwealthy.\n  This is ludicrous. How do we expect to attain the economic objectives \nthat we all are seeking if the wealthy stay on the sidelines as mere \nspectators, rather than as active participants?\n  Some of my colleagues seem to hold that no matter how beneficial a \ncertain course of action is to the economy and to average Americans, \nthat action is totally unacceptable if the rich get any benefit from \nit.\n  Abraham Lincoln once observed that you cannot help the weak by \nweakening the strong.\n  Likewise, we cannot help all Americans by punitively taxing wealth. \nOur progressive income tax already does a good job of that.\n  Trying to craft a set of incentives that exempts from coverage the \nvery \n\n[[Page S15791]]\n\npeople whose conduct is critical to the attainment of our economic \ngoals just will not work.\n  By giving an across-the-board capital gains tax deduction to everyone \nalike, we will encourage an efficient reallocation of resources in such \na way as to stimulate economic growth for all Americans.\n  As I mentioned earlier, at stake in all of this is about $8 trillion \nof locked-in capital gains, which if unlocked, would produce \nsubstantial revenue gains to the Treasury, as well as create more jobs \nand economic growth for all Americans.\n  Let me close Mr. President, with a real-life example that indicates \nthat all of the economic principles I have talked about actually work \nand are not just theories that sound good.\n  As a division of a major parent company, Sungard Data Systems had $30 \nmillion in annual sales but was losing money.\n  The parent company decided to sell this division. Venture capitalists \nbelieved that they could turn things around and return Sungard to \nprofitability. The new buyers were correct.\n  After the sale, the new management generated over $440 million in \nrevenues and about $70 million in operating income.\n   What used to be a 400-employee division before the sale turned into \na 2,400-employee company after the sale. This represents a 500-percent \nincrease in jobs.\n  Did the rich venture capitalists get richer from all of this? Of \ncourse they did. But most importantly, 2,000 people had good jobs that \ndid not exist before. This is the way our economy has always worked.\n  This is America, where it is possible to create wealth for oneself by \ninvesting one's sweat, one's brains, and taking a risk. By so doing, \nthe risk taker creates wealth and opportunity for those around him or \nher.\n  Now is not time to abandon the economic principles that made this \ncountry the greatest economic powerhouse the world has ever known.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the \ntax package reported out of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that items referred to above \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       September 1995 DRI/McGraw Hill study projects the specific \n     economic benefits that will result from a 50 percent capital \n     gains deduction as follows:\n       150,000 new jobs created each year from 1997-2000.\n       4.1 percent increase in capital stock.\n       5.1 percent increase in fixed investment over 10 years.\n       1.2 percent increase in labor productivity.\n       8 percent reduction in the cost of capital.\n       1.4 percent increase in GDP over 10 years.\n       $12 billion increase in federal tax revenues over 10 years.\n       Who Generates the New Jobs?\n       Answer: New Companies and Those in the Early Stages of \n     Expansion:\n       Small Companies: Added 1.6 million net jew jobs in 1993; \n     and 25% job growth per year from 1989 to 1993.\n       Large Companies: Industries dominated by large companies \n     had a net decrease of 200,000 jobs in 1993; and Fortune 500 \n     companies lost about 3% of their jobs from 1989 to 1993.\n\n                    Comparative capital gains rates\n\n                                                                Percent\nUnited States........................................................28\nJapan.............................................................(\\1\\)\nFrance.............................................................18.1\nGermany...............................................................0\nSouth Korea...........................................................0\nTaiwan................................................................0\nSingapore..............................................................\n\n                                                                      0\nLesser of 1 percent of gross sale price of 20 percent of gain.\n\n\n                     U.S. AFFILIATED INSULAR AREAS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman and \nranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, on a matter of very great \nconcern to me--a provision in the House reconciliation bill that is \ninconsistent with House and Senate Appropriations Committee actions and \nwould eliminate our ability to meet some of the most basic needs in the \nU.S. affiliated insular areas.\n  What the House Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs \nhas proposed, and the House has accepted, may appear to many to be \nrelatively noncontroversial--the repeal of a $27.7 million mandatory \nannual appropriation to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands [CNMI] for infrastructure improvement projects. The reality, \nhowever, is that this recommendation would wreck--before it can even be \nimplemented--a carefully negotiated bipartisan, bicameral agreement \nmade by the Conference Committee on Appropriations for Interior and \nRelated Agencies.\n  After outlining the facts in this case, I would hope and urge that \nthe Senate conferees conclude that this proposal is misguided and must \nbe rejected.\n  In the administration's budget request it was recognized that the \nneeds of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for Federal \nfinancial assistance were decreasing due to local economic growth. \nTherefore, the level of financial assistance could be decreased. \nHowever, the Administration and the Appropriations Committees also \nrecognized that there continue to be significant future needs and \nobligations to be met in other island insular areas.\n  The first of these other obligations is fulfilling the intent of \nsection 103(i) of Public Law 99-239, the Compact of Free Association \nAct of 1985, which obligates the United States to undertake radiation \nmitigation measures and to resettle the people of Rongelap who were \nirradiated during the United States' nuclear testing program in the \nMarshall Islands.\n  Second, Public Law 99-239 also authorizes immigration from the former \nTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands to the United States and its \nterritories. In recognition of the impact which this immigration would \nhave on social services, particularly in Guam, section 104(e)(6) of \nPublic Law 99-239 authorizes compensation to assist in offsetting the \nnegative impacts of immigration under the compacts.\n  Third, economic development in remote American Samoa is still unable \nto generate sufficient revenue to meet all of the territory's basic \nneeds. Of greatest concern is the Environmental Protection Agency's \nestimated $30 million backlog in waste water construction. If these \nprojects are not undertaken, then the community will face an increasing \nrisk of contamination of its groundwater, as well as destruction of its \nprotective and productive surrounding coral reefs. In addition, \nAmerican Samoa's hospital facilities are nearing the end of their \nuseful life. The Department of the Interior and the Army Corps of \nEngineers estimate renovation or replacement costs for healthcare \nfacilities to be between $20 and $60 million.\n  Finally, the fourth obligation facing the Federal Government with \nrespect to the islands is fulfilling our commitment to the CNMI. In \n1992, the previous administration and representatives of the CNMI \nreached an agreement under which the Federal Government would provide \n$120 million in financial assistance to the CNMI, to be matched by $120 \nmillion from the CNMI, to meet the capital infrastructure needs of \ntheir rapidly growing population and economy. From 1993 to 1995 much of \nthese funds were provided to the CNMI under the mandatory appropriation \nestablished by section 702 of Public Law 94-241, the Covenant to \nEstablish the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. However, $77 \nmillion remains to be paid under the agreement.\n  Given the extreme pressure on the budget, how were these needs and \nobligations to the islands to be met? Fortunately, the administration \nproposed a solution which would allow the appropriations committees to \navoid the nearly impossible task of meeting these needs through large \nannual discretionary appropriations. The proposal, contained in the \nInsular Development Act (S. 638), was to reallocate the CNMI's $27.7 \nmillion mandatory annual appropriation to meet needs among all of the \nislands. The Energy Committee held a hearing on this bill on May 25, \n1995, and the full Senate passed the bill on July 20. The Office of \nManagement and Budget and the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittees supported the proposal because it would allow for \nsignificant discretionary savings.\n  In short, there is a solution to a set of difficult problems. The \nadministration's original concept was adopted and modified to specify \npriorities and funding levels among these needs. It was then agreed to \non a bipartisan basis by \n\n[[Page S15792]]\n\nthe Conferees on Interior Appropriations, who could now also agree to \neliminate discretionary funding to meet these needs.\n  Mr. President, it is with the greatest disappointment that I view the \nHouse recommendation to repeal the CNMI mandatory appropriation. This \nproposal completely wrecks the carefully crafted policy to meet the \npublic health needs of Samoa, fulfill our commitment to the CNMI, \ncompensate Guam for the negative social impacts resulting from compact \nimmigration, and to acquit ourselves with respect to our commitments to \nthe nuclear testing victims of Rongelap Atoll.\n  I would like to call on my good friend, the Senior Senator from \nLouisiana and the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, to confirm my presentation of the facts in this matter.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is absolutely correct. The provisions of \nthe Interior conference report were the result of weeks of careful \nbipartisan effort. As ranking member of the authorizing committee I \nhave been familiar with each of these issues for many years and have \nshared with the Senator from Hawaii the frustration of trying to find a \nsolution. This is why I joined with my chairman, the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska, in writing to the chairman and ranking member of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee urging that the administration's \nproposal, as modified and reported by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, be included in the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I have been dealing with territorial issues since I first came to the \nSenate in 1972, and I can assure my colleagues that although these \nislands are small and remote, their needs are just as real as those of \nthe States. We have responsibilities to U.S. citizens and nationals and \ncitizens of the former Trust Territory that we simply cannot turn our \nbacks on. After three long years we have finally come up with a \nsolution to meet four of our most pressing problems in the islands. I \nsimply cannot understand how the House justifies its proposal, which \nwould ignore these responsibilities and commitments.\n  Let me reassure my colleague from Hawaii that I will do all that I \ncan to ensure that the Senate position prevails on this matter.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank my good friend and would also like to ask the \nchairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, whether my \nunderstanding on these matters is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree with the Senator's statement. In fact, I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter sent by our Committee to the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee requesting the adoption of S. 638 be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,    \n                                           Committee on Energy and\n\n\n                                            Natural Resources,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 1995.\n     Senator Slade Gorton,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to you concerning the \n     funding for the Department of the Interior's responsibilities \n     for territories and insular areas, including the freely \n     associated states. We are concerned over the action taken by \n     the House in eliminating funding for staffing and for very \n     important programs, such as technical assistance, operations \n     and maintenance improvement, insular management control, and \n     disaster assistance. Each of these programs, while relatively \n     small, have proved to be of critical importance in assisting \n     the various island governments. We understand that both the \n     Departments of Defense and the Interior have also expressed \n     their concern over this action.\n       The elimination of the salaries for all staff is \n     perplexing. Including the FY '95 appropriation, there are \n     over $900 million in funding for the territories and freely \n     associated states that the Department of the Interior is \n     responsible for. The Department has reorganized and placed \n     responsibility under the Assistant Secretary for Policy, \n     Management and Budget. As part of that reorganization, the \n     core permanent staff has been reduced from 45 to 25. We \n     believe that the staffing level should be kept to the minimum \n     necessary to enable the Secretary to fully discharge his \n     responsibilities. We have strongly suggested that they give \n     serious consideration to using at least a portion of the \n     savings to obtain details from other agencies to enhance the \n     Department's ability to deal with problems in the islands and \n     to reduce the need for permanent staff. We expect that \n     further adjustments will be made in the future as the \n     responsibilities of the Secretary change. The expected \n     efficiency and greater emphasis on technical and financial \n     management assistance to the areas will be completely \n     frustrated by the House action.\n       We do not see how the reductions proposed by the House can \n     be supported. As you may be aware, the Senate has passed S. \n     638, which in part would redirect the permissible uses of \n     that portion of the current entitlement for the Northern \n     Marianas not needed to meet the 1992 Agreement on future \n     funding so that the excess could be used for long-term \n     infrastructure planning. Those funds would also provide the \n     ability to meet United States responsibilities in areas such \n     as assisting in the resettlement of Rongelap. In part, the \n     Committee felt that this action would increase the \n     flexibility of the Appropriations Committee to address \n     critical needs such as financial management. Enactment of \n     that provision would also provide a significant portion of \n     the infrastructure funding for American Samoa needed to meet \n     critical health and safety concerns. Given the increasing \n     pressures on the budget, we see no alternative other than \n     reallocation of the excess CNMI funding if essential needs \n     are to be met.\n       Accordingly, we urge you to reject the action taken by the \n     House in eliminating funding for staff and for essential \n     programs for the insular areas. If you agree with the action \n     taken by the Senate with respect to the use of excess funding \n     for the Northern Marianas, we suggest that you seriously \n     consider adopting such a provision as part of the \n     Appropriation measure.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Bennett Johnston,\n       Ranking Minority Member.\n     Frank H. Murkowski,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me also reassure my colleague of my strong desire \nto see that our agreement, as set forth in the Appropriations \nconference report, not be undermined by the House reconciliation \nproposal which contradicts that agreement.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chairman for his reassurance. Mr. President, \nfinally I would like to ask the Senior Senator from Hawaii, for his \nsupport on this matter.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct. It comes as a great \ndisappointment to me that just as the United States was finally coming \nto a resolution on how to meet its obligations on these issues, the \nHouse has proposed to repeal the source of funding that had been agreed \nupon.\n  I stand with my colleagues on the authorizing and appropriations \ncommittees in urging that the Senate insist on its position in \nconference--that the CNMI's mandatory funding be preserved in order to \nimplement the bipartisan, bicameral agreement to reallocate these funds \nas set forth in the Interior Appropriations conference report.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank my colleagues for their support in ensuring that \nthe Senate position prevails on this issue.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \npassage of the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995. This is not \nonly good legislation. It is historic legislation. For the first time, \nin a long time, Congress has the opportunity to vote for a truly \nbalanced budget--not just a theory, not just rhetoric but an action \nplan to realize the goal that many thought impossible.\n  Only once in the past 30 years has the Federal Government had a \nbalanced budget. Every other year we ``deficit spent'' our way toward a \nnational debt that now stands at nearly $5 trillion dollars. That is \n$19,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in the United States. \nBecause the interest on the debt is threatening to consume ever larger \nportions of the budget, this national debt is currently one of the \ngreatest threats to our children's future.\n  For the fiscal year that ended on September 30 the Federal Government \nran a deficit of $161 billion. If nothing is done, and we don't change \nour spending habits, that deficit will rise to $256 billion by 2002. We \nmust stop borrowing from the future and learn to live within our means. \nThis budget reconciliation bill gives us the blueprint to accomplish \nthat task.\n  While the American people made it clear that they wanted the Federal \nbudget balanced, they also made it clear that they wanted meaningful \ntax relief. The Republican leadership heard that message loud and \nclear. Besides balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002, the \nReconciliation Act of 1995 provides the biggest tax cut in history--\nmore than $245 billion. Of \n\n[[Page S15793]]\n\nthese cuts 84 percent go to those making less than $100,000 and 70 \npercent go to those making less than $75,000. These tax cuts are real, \nsignificant tax relief for the families of America. For example:\n\n       A $500 per child under 18 tax credit for couples earning \n     $110,000 or less annually.\n       20 percent credit of interest paid on student loans up to \n     $500 per year, per borrower, for couples with an adjusted \n     gross income of $60,000 or less.\n       Raising the income limits for eligibility for IRA's by \n     $5,000 annually until they reach $100,000 for couples and \n     $85,000 for singles and indexing for inflation and creating a \n     $2,000 IRA for homemakers.\n       Capital gains reform that deducts 50 percent of the gain \n     for individuals that have owned property at least 1 year, \n     which effectively lowers the tax rate to 19.8 percent A \n     reduction of the corporate rate on tax gains to 28 percent. \n     Both changes are effective 10-13-95.\n       Estate tax reforms that will allow more Americans to \n     continue operating family owned business after the death of \n     the primary owner/founder. The first $1.5 million in value of \n     family owned businesses and farms are exempt from tax and the \n     tax on the next $3.5 million is reduced by 50 percent.\n\n  These tax cuts are both responsive and responsible solutions to the \nexcessive taxation that is stealing the financial independence from \nAmerican families across this country.\n  The Medicare portion of the budget reconciliation package is, in \nevery sense of the word, true reform. It takes the current system, \nwhich is so obviously flawed and damaged beyond simple Band-Aid fixes, \nand transforms it into something which will truly work. It will work \nnot only to meet the health care needs of current and future senior \ncitizens, it will work to allow the marketplace, and therefore the \npeople, to shape the future of health care.\n  We all know the level of political rhetoric which has surrounded the \nissue of Medicare reform. The fact remains, however, unless something \nis done, and done soon, Medicare will go bankrupt. This is not a \npolitical issue. This is not a matter of just whether or not \nRepublicans want to change the system. It is a question of whether or \nnot we have the courage to make the tough decisions needed to save the \nsystem. Simply delaying the pending bankruptcy for a couple of years \nwill not be sufficient. We have had enough of that attitude. It is time \nto stand firm and to stop avoiding the difficult decisions before us. I \nbelieve the Republican Medicare reform package does just that.\n  The contents of the Medicare reform proposal have been significantly \nmisrepresented. I believe it is important to point out what the measure \nreported out of the Finance Committee does.\n  The first thing the plan does is provide choice. For too long we have \ntold this Nation's senior citizens that they may not have a choice. \nWhen they turn 65, they are placed on Medicare, whether they want it or \nnot. Until recently, only a few were even allowed to choose managed \ncare options instead of fee-for-service. I believe this is outrageous. \nTo tell people in this country that they may not provide for their own \nhealth care as they see fit violates the basic principles of freedom \nfor which so many of our seniors fought and sacrificed. Some have \nclaimed seniors have all the choice they need, but that is simply not \ntrue. When older people are turned away from a health care provider's \noffice because the provider no longer wishes to struggle with the \nregulations and bureaucracy surrounding the Medicare Program, they have \nno choice. This must simply change.\n  So what kind of choice will seniors get to make? Under the Republican \nproposal they can stay enrolled in the current Medicare program. Those \nwishing to go beyond the present system may choose from traditional \nfee-for-service indemnity health plans--(just like many of them had \nbefore retirement), coordinated care plans, and high-deductible health \nplans with medical savings accounts, also known as MSAs. In addition, \nthe Medicare reform plan allows future enrollees to select from yet \nunforeseen health options as they become available, provided the plans \nmeet minimum Federal standards. This, I would say to my colleagues, is \nthe kind of choice most Americans already have. Do our senior citizens \ndeserve any less?\n  The Medicare reform plan we are debating also addresses another \nissue, fraud, which Idahoans have told me should be one of the primary \nfocal points of any reform effort. I am pleased our plan takes serious \nefforts to reduce health care fraud and abuse. Specifically, the bill \nprovides for the establishment of coordinated efforts by Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials to combat fraud. The bill \nalso instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to exclude \nindividuals convicted of health care fraud from receiving payments \nunder Medicare and Medicaid. Furthermore, the reform package would \nestablish a new criminal statute, with specific criminal penalties, and \nwould also increase fines and civil penalties for health care fraud.\n  With expanded choice and reduced fraud, one must wonder why there is \nso much opposition to our Medicare reform plan. I believe it stems from \nfear based on misinformation. In an attempt to set the record straight, \nI would like to take this opportunity to point out what the reform \npackage does not do.\n  First, this proposal does not cut Medicare. Under the Republican \nplan, Medicare will continue to grow by 6.4 percent each year. Over the \nnext 7 years, expenditures for Medicare will grow by nearly $2,000 per \nrecipient. Only in Washington could a $2,000 increase in payments per \nperson be labeled, by some, as a cut.\n  The GOP plan also does not force people to give up Medicare or to \njoin managed care organizations. As I stated before, the plan offers \nseniors a choice. It lets them, rather than the Government, decide how \none will receive health care. I believe this Nation's senior citizens \ncan make those choices.\n  In addition, the spending reductions included in the Medicare reform \npackage are not, and I will repeat this, are not, related to a tax cut. \nThe bill explicitly states that savings generated from reforming the \nMedicare system may not be used for any purpose other than saving and \npreserving the Medicare system. Whether or not we adopt any tax cuts, \nwe need these savings to preserve the system for current and future \nrecipients.\n  Finally, to those who say smaller savings would be sufficient, I \nwould ask them to define ``sufficient.'' While the Democrat's proposal \nwould prevent the system from going bankrupt in 2002, as it is \ncurrently on a pace to do, it would allow the system to fail only 2 \nyears later. This attitude of ``put it off until it is someone else's \nproblem'' is precisely why the United States is in the economic mess it \nis. As the Medicare trustee's said, ``prompt, effective, and decisive \naction is necessary.'' Simply delaying the inevitable is not a \nsolution.\n  I was pleased to note that my hometown newspaper, The Idaho \nStatesman, shares this view. In a recent editorial the newspaper \nstated, ``Without enormous changes like those proposed by the GOP, the \nprogram will go broke soon after the turn of the century.'' The \neditorial went on to say, ``somebody finally has the courage to begin \nfixing what's been broken for a long time.''\n  Since before I first came to the Senate, Idahoans have told me they \nwant Congress to face the important issues head on, to try to set this \ncountry on solid economic footing. The Medicare reform plan which the \nSenate Finance Committee approved does just that. It will not be easy, \nand it will not be painless, but it will achieve our goals. It will \ncorrect the financial difficulties the program faces, bring the \nefficiencies of the market into play, and give senior citizens the \nfreedom to choose.\n  The Idaho Statesman's editorial ended with the following statement, \n``The numbers clearly show that Medicare, which served one generation \nwell, cannot serve the next one without significant reform.'' The \nRepublican package is just that, significant, and serious, reform.\n  The Finance Committee has also used this bill as a vehicle to \nredirect and energize the earned income tax credit. The EITC is a well-\nconceived and well-intended program designed to encourage work over \nwelfare for low-income families. Unfortunately this worthy intent has \nbeen lost in what has become the fastest growing entitlement program we \nhave. Just since 1986 it has grown from 7 million families receiving an \naverage of $281 to 18 million \n\n[[Page S15794]]\n\nfamilies receiving an average of $1,265. The EITC no longer benefits \nonly families with children but provides benefits to both individuals \nand families without children.\n  The Senate proposal redirects the EITC back to the truly needy, \nreduces the potential for fraud and abuse and puts money where we need \nit, in the hands of low income families with children. We will increase \nspending on the intended beneficiaries at the same time we save the \ntaxpayers more than $32 billion.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Balanced Budget \nReconciliation Act. It is good, smart legislation that demonstrates to \nthe American taxpayer that Republicans are serious about changing the \nbusiness as usual attitude in Congress.\n\n\n                          s-corporation reform\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, there \nare a number of tax issues of significant importance to the 1.9 million \nAmerican businesses that are S corporations that did not get resolved \nduring the Finance Committee markup last week. Many of those issues--\nwhich include the current law's severe limitations on capital \nformation, growth, corporate streamlining, family business planning, \nestate planning, and tax simplifaction--are addressed in a bill I \nintroduced earlier this year with my colleague from Utah, Senator \nHatch. That bill, S. 758, the S Corporation Reform Act of 1995, has the \nbipartisan cosponsorship of a third of the Senate.\n  While it is unfortunate that none of the provisions of S. 758 were \nincluded in the bill reported by the Finance Committee and made part of \nthe Budget Reconciliation Bill that is before us, I am pleased to note \nthat many of these provisions were included in the tax bill passed by \nthe House Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I, too, share the concerns of my colleague \nfrom Arkansas and see S corporation reform as an important step in \nhelping this nation's S corporations stay competive and grow. I firmly \nbelieve that S corporation reform is long overdue, and hope that we can \nwork through the conference process and during the rest of this \nlegislative session, not simply to adopt the key S corporation \nsimplification provisions that have already been included in the House \nbill, but also to address and include several additional provisions \nthat are critical components of S. 758.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Utah. \nSpecifically, I believe that it is very important that we extend the S \ncorporation reform initiative in the budget process to include all the \nitems in the House bill, as well as such provisions as:\n  The ability of S corporations to issue preferred stock and general \nconvertible debt;\n  The ability of S corporations to form ESOPs, so their employees can \nshare in the success of the business;\n  The ability of financial institutions to be shareholders of an S \ncorporation's stock, which is often a critical element of obtaining \nfinancing for corporate growth; and\n  The ability of all members of a family to be counted as a single \nshareholder of an S corporation, since family-owned S corporations are \nfrequently stifled as they continue to grow from one generation to the \nnext.\n  I hope that these issues will be on the table for discussion, and \nthat my colleagues will be willing to help S corporations--most of \nwhich are small and/or family owned businesses--be more effective \ncompetitors in the marketplace.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, and also hope that we will be able to resolve these and \nother critical issues in conference. I will be working closely with \nSenator Pryor in the coming weeks on these very important legislative \nobjectives.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Balanced Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1995 which, for the first time in many years, \ncontrols entitlement spending, restrains the growth of Government and \neliminates annual deficits.\n  What a refreshing contrast this balanced budget reconciliation bill \nis to the budget proposals submitted over the past 2 years by the \nPresident. Those budgets enacted the largest tax increase in history, \ncontained no plan to balance the budget, significantly increased the \nnational debt, failed to restrain growth in nondefense Government \nspending and proposed dangerous reductions in national defense \nspending.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995 \nreverses direction on those policies which are strapping our economy \nand burdening all Americans with an overwhelming national debt.\n  I remind my colleagues that the national debt now stands at over $4.9 \ntrillion. Outlays for interest on the public debt is well over $300 \nbillion per year, exceeding outlays for any other Government Department \nor program, except Social Security.\n  Furthermore, failure to adopt this reconciliation act will result in \nannual deficits exceeding $200 billion for as far as can be projected. \nThat is not an acceptable alternative. We must reduce Government \nspending. We must eliminate these annual deficits, and we must reduce \nthe national debt. The Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act puts us on \ntrack to accomplish those objectives.\n  Mr. President, I support the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1995. I vote yes for reducing the deficit. I vote yes for controlling \nthe growth of Government spending. I vote yes for our families by \nreducing their tax burden. I vote yes for restoring the economic future \nof our Nation. Therefore, I will vote yes for this bill and encourage \nmy colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I was here listening to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina talking a moment ago. As always, I am \nimpressed with his vigor, vitality, and enthusiasm and, indeed, his \nstamina.\n  I also found myself in agreement with much, if not most, of what he \nwas saying. I agree that we should vote yes on deficit reduction, and I \nsee my friend from New Mexico here. I want to tell him how much I \nadmire him personally, the job he has done and the work that he has put \nin over the years on the Budget Committee, the years he has spent \ndedicating himself to budget reductions and trying to achieve a \nbalanced budget for this country. So I do not want him in any way to \nregard the comments I might make in the next few moments as being in \nderogation of my respect and admiration for him.\n  I agree with what Senator Thurmond said; we have to vote yes on \ndeficit reduction. I believe that. I believe we have to vote yes on \ncutting spending. I believe we have to vote yes on reforming programs \nwhich have heretofore been regarded as untouchable, being third rails \nwe cannot touch. I think we have reached the point in our history where \nwe have to look at virtually every program and not decide that any of \nthem are immune from reform, from trimming, from cutting, maybe even \nelimination.\n  But there are other items in this package that I do not support. I do \nnot support drilling in ANWR. I do not support opening that up. I do \nnot, frankly, support calling for tax reductions at a time when we are \ncalling for deep budget cuts. For me, it is the equivalent of putting \nour foot on the brake and putting our foot on the pedal at the same \ntime. It is a personal decision on my part. I feel that I can support \nvirtually all the cuts that are necessary to achieve a balanced budget \nby the year 2002.\n  I was pleased to hear President Clinton indicate that he, No. 1, \nbelieves we should strive for a balanced budget. Initially he said 10 \nyears, then it was 9 years, and now I believe it is even 7 \n\n[[Page S15795]]\n\nyears. I think that is quite a concession on his part, that he agrees \nthat we ought to have a balanced budget within a 7-year timeframe.\n  The dilemma that I face is like that of several other of my \ncolleagues. This may be the only vehicle to date that we have for \nachieving a balanced budget by the year 2002. This may be only part of \nthe process that is underway.\n  This may be act II of a three-part drama that has to be played out \nthat was initiated by the Contract With America, as being part one in \nits adoption, and part two being our deliberations and debate, and, \nultimately, votes here in the Senate and conference with the House, to \npresent a package that will be sent to the President that most, if not \nall, of us anticipate will be vetoed by the President because it does \nnot include some of his priorities. That may be act II.\n  Ultimately, we have to come to act III, which is where we sit down \nwith the President and work out our differences--again, being committed \nto a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  So I will listen with some interest as we proceed throughout the \nevening and into tomorrow as to whether or not I can support the final \npackage. But I indicate today, as I did last evening, I think it is \ninappropriate that we have massive tax reductions at a time when we are \ntrying to balance the budget and cut the deficit to achieve a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. And so I intend to support various amendments \nthat will be offered.\n  I may, in fact, offer an amendment to strike the tax cuts in their \nentirety. But it may be that that matter has already been debated long \nenough on the Senate floor. It is my personal judgment that we ought to \ndo everything we can to make the reductions that we have long deferred \nin making, that we ought to do it within a 7-year timeframe, that we \nshould support our chairman in his efforts for what he has done to \nproduce that.\n  But I must say, Mr. President, that I have great reservations about \ncalling for substantial tax reductions at the same time we are asking \nfor substantial cutbacks in programs.\n  So I will listen with interest as we proceed throughout the evening \nand tomorrow. But I indicate my great admiration and respect for \nSenator Domenici and the effort he has undertaken to produce a \nreconciliation package that, perhaps, is only part two or act II of the \nthree-act drama that has to be played out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes called for under the previous \norder has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is Senator \nBrown's amendment before the Senate, on which he has 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator needs to call that amendment up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2969\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that the $1,000,000 limit on deductibility of \n   compensation paid to an employee is extended to employees of all \n  businesses, and to use the resulting revenues to reduce the Social \n                       Security earnings penalty)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown], for himself, Mr. \n     Abraham, Mr. Santorum, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Craig, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2969.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 8 of subtitle I of title XII, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC.  . $1,000,000 COMPENSATION DEDUCTION LIMIT EXTENDED TO \n                   ALL EMPLOYERS OF ALL CORPORATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(m) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``publicly held corporation'' in paragraph \n     (1) and inserting ``taxpayer (other than personal service \n     corporations)'',\n       (2) by striking ``covered employee'' each place it appears \n     in paragraphs (1) and (4) and inserting ``employee'', and\n       (3) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3) and redesignating \n     paragraph (4) as paragraph (3).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995, except that there shall not be taken into account with \n     respect to any employee to whom section 162(m) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies solely by reason of \n     such amendments remuneration payable under a written binding \n     contract which was in effect on October 25, 1995, and which \n     was not modified thereafter in any material respect before \n     such remuneration is paid.\n       (c) Use of Revenues.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Commissioner of Social Security shall increase \n     the earnings limit otherwise determined for each year under \n     section 203 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 403) by an \n     amount which takes into account the increase in revenues for \n     such year as estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     resulting from the amendment to section 162(m)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 made by the Balanced Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1995.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward amendment, \nand it deals with an area this Congress legislated on in 1993.\n  In 1993, Congress passed a tax provision that placed a limitation of \na million dollars on the deductibility for publicly held corporations. \nThe limit of a million dollars was on the amount they could deduct on \nthe salary of an employee of that corporation.\n  I might say, just in retrospect, that statute had other provisions. \nIn other words, it was possible to earn over a million dollars and have \nit deductible but only if it was incentive pay or fit into other \nprovisions. So it is not an absolute limitation. But that limitation, \nin this Senator's view, was somewhat limited and deficient. It was \ndeficient in that it was not applied evenhandedly, fairly; it was not \napplied to everybody who had a salary in excess of a million dollars; \nit was only applied to a special few. So the suggestion of the first \nhalf of this amendment is simply to be evenhanded and apply that same \nlimitation to employees of all businesses. Again, the tax is on the \nbusiness, not on the employees.\n  Mr. President, I might say two important things here. We have not \nchanged any of the exceptions to this provision. In other words, \nincluded in it was a provision that allowed incentive payments, and so \non. None of that has been changed.\n  In addition, included here is a provision that prohibits them from \nbeing retroactive. That is, if you have an employment contract signed \nprior to today, that is valid and not affected by this provision. But \nit does raise, according to the preliminary estimates we have, $800 \nmillion. That $800 million, according to the amendment, is then used to \nameliorate the impact of the penalty on Social Security tax.\n  As I think Senators are well aware right now, above the threshold \nlevel a very high tax is placed on Social Security recipients, many of \nwhom are not wealthy at all, but are low-income or middle-income and \nstruggling, and they are put into a very difficult penalty situation. \nSo this is a net, even with regard to tax revenue to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  What it does is take that $800 million that will be raised and use it \nto offset the earnings penalty. It will not eliminate the Social \nSecurity earnings penalty. My guess is it will only have a small affect \non it. It will only increase the threshold a small amount of money. But \nthat amount of money will go to working men and women, who retire \nwithout adequate resources and need that money and need to work to make \ntheir household expenses fit.\n  In my view, it is an excellent transfer. It applies even tax \nphilosophy to those who receive over a million dollars in compensation. \nIt provides evenhandedly and uses the money to ameliorate that Social \nSecurity earnings penalty that is so burdensome for so many working \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment and checked \nit with the Finance Committee sources. I am prepared to yield back the \nfull 5 minutes in order to move this thing along. Once again, I would \nlike to take the opportunity to thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis diligence and consideration, in allowing a 15-minute discussion \nperiod when we worked this out.\n  Let me say this. We have unnecessarily delayed the process here, \nthough, because both sides have not been as forthcoming as I think we \n\n[[Page S15796]]\n\nshould be--or that we intend to be, for that matter--in supplying \ncopies of the amendments to the other side. I am not saying it is just \non your side, it is on our side as well.\n  Suffice to say, I am ready to yield the remainder of my time. I \nbelieve--if the chairman agrees--that would take us to the Harkin \namendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, simply to affirm what the Senator \nfrom Nebraska says, I think it is, in fact, part of the agreement \nbetween the leaders that we will know what we are voting on, that we \nwill have copies of these amendments. I have a list here of 17 of what \nare called Republican amendments, and three of them are question marks. \nThere are all kinds of words. There is a word that says kickback, one \nthat says taxes, health care, sugar. There is no way to make any kind \nof a judgment.\n  So I just affirm the view of the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee that we need to have these amendments. It is part of the \nagreement that we would have these amendments and our amendments in \nwriting before we act on them.\n  Otherwise we are just singing in the dark.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2970\n\n  (Purpose: To strengthen efforts to combat Medicare waste, fraud and \n                                 abuse)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment in order is the \namendment to be offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. How much time do we \nhave?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have an amendment that I am sending to the desk, and I \nask for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Graham \n     and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 2970.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, if you believe that waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare \nis just a small problem, then you want to just support the bill and the \nAbraham amendment that was added to it and vote ``no'' on this \namendment.\n  If you have followed the hearings that I have held over the last 5 \nyears showing that what GAO says amounts up to 10 percent of Medicare \nspending goes for waste, fraud and abuse, this is up to $17 billion a \nyear.\n  If you have followed those hearings or read the numerous GAO and \nInspector General reports, then you know we just cannot go after the \nsmall things in waste, fraud and abuse. We have to go after the big \ngame. We have to take a truly comprehensive approach to combatting this \nbilking of the taxpayers and our elderly.\n  Now, the bill has some good provisions in it. I will not deny that. \nThe Abraham amendment which I voted for is also pretty good. But that \njust takes a nick out of it. What we have to do is go after it with \nevery thing we can. The taxpayers and the elderly deserve no less.\n  My amendment, cosponsored by Senators Graham and Biden, both of whom \nwho have worked hard to tackle this problem, makes a number of \nimportant changes. It requires Medicare within 6 months must use state-\nof-the-art commercial software to find billing abuse. GAO estimated the \nfirst full year savings of making this common sense idea at $640 \nmillion.\n  Next, my amendment prohibits Medicare payments for unnecessary and \ninappropriate items like fines owed by health care providers for \nviolations of Federal, State or local laws, personal auto use, tickets \nto sporting events, entertainment, and other things like that. Believe \nit or not, Medicare still has no specific prohibition against paying \nfor those kind of items.\n  Third, my amendment reforms payments to ambulances as recommended by \nthe inspector general. It also reduces paperwork by requiring a \nstandardized claim form for Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Most important, and the heart and soul of this, it requires \ncompetitive bidding for durable medical equipment, medical supplies, \nand oxygen paid for by Medicare. The Veterans Administration has been \ndoing this a long time and the difference in payments is dramatic.\n  How can you say you do not support it in Medicare when you have it in \nthe VA, when the VA spends 4 cents for the same bandage that Medicare \nspends 86 cents for? Oxygen--Medicare spends $3,600 for rental of \noxygen; the Veterans Administration pays less than half that.\n  That is because the Veterans Administration has competitive bidding \nand Medicare does not. It is time we have good old competitive bidding \nin Medicare. That is what this amendment does.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I compliment the Senator from Iowa.\n  Put bluntly, there is no legitimate reason not to be for this \namendment. None. Zero. None. I challenge anyone to tell us why this \namendment does not make sense.\n  Going after fraud should be our top priority, our first priority. The \nbill makes progress but it does not go far enough.\n  At least it is not what the Gingrich bill in the House does which \nmakes it easier for health care providers to engage in fraud. \nLiterally, not figuratively.\n  Last, the point made by the Senator, there is $18 billion in Medicare \nfraud a year and $16 billion in Medicaid fraud a year. I see no \nlegitimate rationale for not tightening this up unless there is some \noutrageous special interest that thinks it would benefit from it. I see \nnone. Prosecutors want it. Prosecutors ask for it.\n  I held a hearing in my State where I had the top prosecutors from \nPhiladelphia and the top prosecutors from the State of Delaware. They \npoint out that the House bill, which set them back decades--this bill \nwould not do much. Our bill would make a significant impact on their \nability to deal with health care fraud.\n  I thank my colleague for his leadership and allowing me the minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will reserve my time if the other side wants to speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes in opposition to Senator Cohen.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, ordinarily I find myself in agreement with \nthe Senator from Iowa, dealing with health care fraud, but I must say \nin this particular circumstance I have to rise in opposition, not \nbecause I am opposed to what he is seeking to do but rather I believe \nthat while his proposal for addressing fraud and abuse in the health \ncare system has merit, they also compromised some of the more important \nfacets of the health care fraud bill we were successful in including in \nthe Finance Committee package as such.\n  For the past several years, we have been holding hearings. As a \nmatter of fact, it was a report that the minority staff issued on \nhealth care fraud which produced the estimates from GAO, as well as our \nown staff, showing that there is $100 billion being lost annually in \nour health care system.\n  As far as the Federal portion of that, it is anywhere from $27 to $40 \nmillion, depending on which Federal programs are included. We are \nlosing billions of dollars through our health care system through fraud \nnow.\n  What we have tried to do in the proposal that was agreed to by the \nFinance Committee is to structure it in a way that actually produces \nsavings--this $4.2 billion.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa, as I understand it--\nunfortunately, because of the time limitations we have, I believe some \nof my provisions have been deleted that are in the health care fraud \nbill. I am advised that CBO has concluded that this dilutes some of the \n$4.2 billion in savings.\n\n[[Page S15797]]\n\n  One of the justifications for persuading the Finance Committee to \ninclude the health care fraud bill that I had authored was to get some \nsavings. CBO now scores it at $4.2 billion. This at least raises a \nquestion as to whether or not we have diluted that and it calls into \nquestion in terms of how much we will save.\n  The Senator from Iowa may use a different method of calculating those \nsavings.\n  What we have tried to do is structure it in a way which we could get \nthe provider groups to agree. This has been no easy task. We have met \nwith provider groups, with consumers, with health care advocates, with \nthe FBI, with the Justice Department, with the White House.\n  We put together a package which we believe enjoys broad support which \nhas been scored as saving $4.2 billion. Under these circumstances, I \nfind myself compelled to rise in opposition not because I am opposed to \nwhat the Senator from Iowa seeks to do, but by virtue of the fact this \nmay undermine to some degree and dilute to some degree, which I do not \nknow what extent, the $4.2 billion which has currently been scored by \nCBO.\n  For those reasons I rise in opposition to the amendment of the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute and \n50 seconds and the Senator from Iowa has 1 minute and 14 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am somewhat disappointed. I thought this \nwas perhaps one amendment that we could get Republican agreement on.\n  This is a good amendment. There may be reasons to oppose it, but I do \nnot know what they are and they have not been explained to me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am befuddled, Mr. President, because I say to my friend \nfrom Maine, the CBO--which I want on the record--the CBO has scored our \namendment as saving more money than is in the bill. I want that on the \nrecord. That is so.\n  We did not weaken the provisions in the bill, we significantly \nstrengthened them. For example, as I pointed out, we require the \ncommercial software, we reduce the paperwork by having one claim form. \nWe required the competitive bidding and we prohibit the Medicare \npayments for unnecessary things like personal use of automobiles, \ntickets to sporting events, things like that.\n  And CBO has certified that this amendment saves more money than the \nunderlying bill's provisions.\n  Mr. COHEN. We are basically in accord with what we are seeking to do, \nbut I have been advised that CBO indicates this would reduce the $4.2 \nbillion by----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely not. CBO said today it would save $4.7 \nbillion, considerably more than the underlying bill. Let there be no \nquestion about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa is expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the balance of our time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Harkin amendment to remove fraud and \nabuse from Medicare is a giant step in the right direction--saving \ntaxpayer money, urging us toward a balanced budget, and striving for \ngreater efficiency.\n  However, the amendment is based on a concept both necessary and \ncontroversial. This amendment would require competitive bidding for \nMedicare part B items and services.\n  I have heard from owners of numerous medical supply businesses in my \nState who tell me they will be driven out of business by this amendment \nprovision. They tell me services will be cut to rural areas. They tell \nme services involved with setting up and instructing about medical \nequipment is essential for patients, and will be threatened under this \namendment.\n  Senator Harkin has made changes to his amendment language, to \nmaintain access to services for rural and underserved areas. He has \nmade changes to assure quality assurance standards, so that large \ncompanies are not able to undercut their competition simply by \nproviding shoddy supplies and equipment.\n  He points out the large difference between prices for supplies at \nVeterans Administration hospitals--which have competitive bidding--and \nprices from providers under Medicare part B. He makes a good case for \nsolving some of our Medicare cost problems with a clear goal to find \nefficiency through competitive bidding, rather than just a budget \ndecision.\n  In light of these changes, I will vote for the amendment, but I want \nto be sure that we are doing everything we can to make this transition \nsurvivable for small business.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds in \norder to have items printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to have printed in the Record \nvarious documents, including a letter from the inspector general of the \nDepartment of HHS and statements by the Secretary of the Department and \nthe Attorney General. They all go to the point that we need to have as \nstrong an antifraud position as possible in the Senate version of the \nMedicare bill, because the House version is woefully weak. I support \nthe joint efforts of my colleagues from Iowa and Maine in assuring that \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the documents be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Office of \n           Inspector General,\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 1995.\n     Re H.R. 2389: ``Safeguarding Medicare Integrity Act of \n         1995.''\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: You requested our views regarding the \n     newly introduced H.R. 2389, which we understand may be \n     considered in the deliberations concerning the ``Medicare \n     Preservation Act.'' We strongly support the expressed \n     objective of H.R. 2389 of reducing the fraud and abuse which \n     plagues the Medicare program. The proposed legislation \n     contains some meritorious provisions. However, if enacted, \n     certain major provisions of H.R. 2389 would cripple the \n     efforts of law enforcement agencies to control health care \n     fraud and abuse in the Medicare program and to bring \n     wrongdoers to justice.\n       The General Accounting Office estimates the loss to \n     Medicare from fraud and abuse at 10 percent of total Medicare \n     expenditures, or about $18 billion. We recommend two steps to \n     decrease this problem: strengthen the relevant legal \n     authorities, and increase the funding for law enforcement \n     efforts. Some worthy concepts have been included in H.R. \n     2389, and we support them. For example, we support:\n       A voluntary disclosure program, which allows corporations \n     to blow the whistle on themselves if upper management finds \n     wrongdoing has occurred, with carefully defined relief for \n     the corporation from qui tam suits under the False Claims Act \n     (but not waiver by the Secretary of sanctions);\n       Minimum periods of exclusion (mostly parallel with periods \n     of exclusion currently in regulations) with respect to \n     existing exclusion authorities from Medicare and Medicaid; \n     and\n       Increases in the maximum penalty amounts which may be \n     imposed under the civil monetary penalty laws regarding \n     health care fraud.\n       As stated above, however, H.R. 2389 contains several \n     provisions which would seriously erode our ability to control \n     Medicare fraud and abuse, including most notably: making the \n     civil monetary penalty and anti-kickback laws considerably \n     more lenient, the unprecedented creation of an advisory \n     opinion mechanism on intent-based statutes, and a trust fund \n     concept which would fund only private contractors (not law \n     enforcement). Our specific comments on these matters follow.\n\n\n 1. making civil monetary penalties for fraudulent claims more lenient \n   by relieving providers of the duty to use reasonable diligence to \n               ensure their claims are true and accurate\n\n       Background: The existing civil monetary penalty (CMP) \n     provisions regarding false claims were enacted by Congress in \n     the 1980's as an administrative remedy, with cases tried by \n     administrative law judges with appeals to Federal court. In \n     choosing the ``knows or should know'' standard for the mental \n     element of the offense, Congress chose a standard which is \n     well defined in the Restatement of Torts. Second, Section 12. \n     The term ``should know'' places a duty on health care \n     providers to use ``reasonable diligence'' to ensure that \n     claims submitted to Medicare are true and accurate. The \n     reason this standard was chosen was that the Medicare system \n     is heavily reliant on the honesty and good faith of providers \n     in submitting their claims. The overwhelming majority of \n     claims are never audited or investigated.\n       Note that the ``should know'' standard does not impose \n     liability for honest mistakes. If the provider exercises \n     reasonable diligence and still makes a mistake, the provider \n     is not liable. No administrative complaint or decision issued \n     by the Department \n\n[[Page S15798]]\n\n     of Health and Human Services (HHS) has found an honest \n     mistake to be the basis for CMP sanction.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 201 would redefine the term \n     ``should know'' in a manner which does away with the duty on \n     providers to exercise reasonable diligence to submit true and \n     accurate claims. Under this definition, providers would only \n     be liable if they act with ``deliberate ignorance'' of false \n     claims or if they act with ``reckless disregard'' of false \n     claims. In an era when there is great concern about fraud and \n     abuse of the Medicare program, it would not be appropriate to \n     relieve providers of the duty to use ``reasonable diligence'' \n     to ensure that their claims are true and accurate.\n       In addition, the bill treats the CMP authority currently \n     provided to the Secretary in an inconsistent manner. On one \n     hand, it proposes an increase in the amounts of most CMPs \n     which mnay be imposed under the Social Security Act. Yet, it \n     would significantly curtail enforcement of these sanction \n     authorities by raising the level of culpability which must \n     be proven by the Government in order to impose CMPs. It \n     would be far preferable not to make any changes to the CMP \n     statutes at this time.\n\n\n   2. Making the Antikickback Statute more Lenient by Requiring the \n Government to prove that the significant Intent of the Defendant was \n                                unlawful\n\n       Background: The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal \n     offense knowingly and willfully (intentionally) to offer or \n     receive anything of value in exchange for the referral of \n     Medicare or Medicaid business. The statute is designed to \n     ensure that medical decisions are not influenced by financial \n     rewards from third parties. Kickbacks result in more Medicare \n     services being ordered than otherwise, and law enforcement \n     experts agree that unlawful kickbacks are very common and \n     constitute a serious problem in the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       The two biggest health care fraud cases in history were \n     largely based on unlawful kickbacks. In 1994, National \n     Medical Enterprises, a chain of psychiatric hospitals, paid \n     $379 million for giving kickbacks for patient referrals, and \n     other improprieties. In 1995, Caremark, Inc, paid $161 \n     million for giving kickbacks to physicians who ordered very \n     expensive Caremark home infusion products.\n       Most kickbacks have sophisticated disguises, like \n     consultation arrangements, returns on investments, etc. These \n     disguises are hard for the Government to penetrate. Proving a \n     kickback case is difficult. There is no record of trivial \n     cases being prosecuted under this statute.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 201 would require the \n     Government to prove that ``the significant purpose'' of a \n     payment was to induce referrals of business. The phrase ``the \n     significant'' implies there can only be one ``significant'' \n     purpose of a payment. If so, at least 51 percent of the \n     motivation of a payment must be shown to be unlawful. \n     Although this proposal may have a superficial appeal, if \n     enacted it would threaten the Government's ability to \n     prosecute all but the most blatant kickback arrangements.\n       The courts interpreting the anti-kickback statute agree \n     that the statute applies to the payment of remuneration ``if \n     one purpose  of the payment was to induce referrals.'' United \n     States v. Greber, 760 F.2d 68, 69 (3d Cir. 1985) (emphasis \n     added). If payments were intended to induce a physician to \n     refer patients, the statute has been violated, even if the \n     payments were also intended (in part) to compensate for \n     legitimate services. Id. at 72. See also: United States v. \n     Kats, 871 F.2d 105, 108 (1989); United States v. Bay State \n     Ambulance, 874 F.2d 20, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1989).\n       The proposed amendment would overturn these court \n     decisions.\n       However, the nature of kickbacks and the health care \n     industry requires the interpretation adopted by Greber and \n     its progeny. To prove that a defendant had the improper \n     intent necessary to violate the anti-kickback statute, the \n     prosecution must establish the defendant's state of mind, or \n     intent. As with any intent-based statute, the prosecution \n     cannot get directly inside the defendant's head. The \n     prosecution must rely on circumstantial evidence to prove \n     improper intent. Circumstantial evidence consists of \n     documents relevant to the transaction, testimony about what \n     the defendant said to business associates or potential \n     customers, etc. These types of evidence are rarely clear \n     about the purposes and motivations of the defendant. The \n     difficulties of establishing intent are multiple by the \n     complexity, size, and dynamism of the health care industry, \n     as well as the sophistication of most-kickback scheme \n     participants. Documents are ``pre-sanitized'' by expert \n     attorneys. Most defendants are careful what they say. In most \n     kickback prosecutions, the Government has a difficult task to \n     prove beyond a reasonable doubt that even one purpose of a \n     payment is to induce referrals.\n       If the Government had to prove that inducement of referrals \n     was ``the significant'' reason for the payment, many common \n     kickback schemes would be allowed to proliferate. In today's \n     health care industry, very few kickback arrangements involve \n     the bald payment of money for patients. Most kickbacks have \n     sophisticated disguises. Providers can usually argue that any \n     suspect payment serves one or more ``legitimate purposes.'' \n     For example, payments made to induce referrals often also \n     compensate a physician who is providing health care items or \n     services. Some payments to referral sources may be disguised \n     as returns on investments. Similarly, many lease arrangements \n     that indisputably involve the bona fide use of space \n     incorporate some inducement to refer in the lease rates. In \n     all of these examples, and countless others, it is impossible \n     to quantify what portions of payments are made for nefarious \n     versus legitimate purposes.\n       Where the defendant could argue that there was some \n     legitimate purpose for the payment, the prosecution would \n     have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, through \n     circumstantial evidence, that the defendant actually had \n     another motive that was ``the significant'' reason. For the \n     vast majority of the present-day kickback schemes, the \n     proposed amendment would place in insurmountable burden of \n     proof on the Government.\n\n\n   3. CREATION OF AN EASILY ABUSED EXCEPTION FROM THE ANTI-KICKBACK \n             STATUTE FOR CERTAIN MANAGED CARE ARRANGEMENTS\n\n       Background: There is great variety and innovation occurring \n     in the managed care industry. Some managed care \n     organizations, such as most health maintenance organizations \n     (HMOs) doing business with Medicare, consist of providers who \n     assume financial risk for the quantity of medical services \n     needed by the population they serve. In this context, the \n     incentive to offer kickbacks for referrals of patients for \n     additional services is minimized, since the providers are at \n     risk for the additional costs of those services. If anything, \n     the incentives are to reduce services. Many other managed \n     care organizations exist in the fee for service system, where \n     the traditional incentives to order more services and pay \n     kickbacks for referrals remain. In the fee for service \n     system, the payer (like Medicare and private insurance plans) \n     is at financial risk of additional services, not the managed \n     care organization. While broad protection from the anti-kick \n     statute may be appropriate for capitated, at-risk entities \n     like the HMO described above, such protection for managed \n     care organizations in the fee for service system would invite \n     serious abuse.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 202 would establish broad new \n     exceptions under the anti-kickback statute for ``any \n     capitation, risk-sharing, or disease management program.'' \n     The lack of definition of these terms would result in a huge \n     opportunity for abusive arrangements to fit within this \n     proposed exception. What is a ``disease management program?'' \n     Does not that term include most of health care?\n       Nefarious organizations could easily escape the kickback \n     statute by simply rearranging their agreements to fit within \n     the exception. For example, if a facility wanted to pay \n     doctors for referrals, the facility could escape liability by \n     establishing some device whereby the doctors share in the \n     business risk of profit and loss of the business (i.e., they \n     would share some risk, at least theoretically). Then, the \n     organization could pay blatant kickbacks for every referral \n     with impunity.\n       If the concern is that the kickback statute is hurting \n     innovation, as observed above, there is now an explosion of \n     innovation in the health care industry, especially in managed \n     care. No one in Government is suggesting that HMOs or \n     preferred provider arrangements, etc., formed in good faith, \n     violate the kickback statute. There has never been any action \n     against any such arrangement under the statute.\n\n\n   4. Inappropriate expansion of the exception to the anti-kickback \n                         statute for discounts\n\n       Background. Medicare/Medicaid discounts are beneficial and \n     to be encouraged with one critical condition: That Medicare \n     and/or Medicaid receive and participate fully in the \n     discount. For example, if the Medicare reasonable charge for \n     a Part B item or service is $100, Medicare would pay $80 of \n     the bill and the copayment would be $20. If a 20 percent \n     discount is applied to this bill, the charge should be $80, \n     and Medicare would pay $64 (80 percent of the $80) and the \n     copayment would be $16. If the discount is not  shared with \n     Medicare (which would be improper), the bill to Medicare \n     would falsely show a $100 charge. Medicare would pay $80, but \n     the copayment would be $0. This discount has not been shared \n     with Medicare.\n       Many discounting programs are designed expressly to \n     transfer the benefit of discounts away from Medicare. The \n     scheme is to give little or no discount on an item or service \n     separately billed to Medicare, and give large discounts on \n     items not separately billed to Medicare. This scheme results \n     in Medicare paying a higher percentage for the separately \n     billed item or service than it should.\n       For example, a lab offers a deep discount on lab work for \n     which Medicare pays a predetermined fee (such as lab tests \n     paid by Medicare to the facility as part of a bundled \n     payment), if the facility refers to the lab its separately \n     billed Medicare lab work, for which no discount is given. The \n     lab calls this a ``combination'' discount, yet is a discount \n     on some items and not on others. Another example is where \n     ancillary or noncovered items are furnished free, if a \n     provider pays full price for a separately billed item, such \n     as where the purchase of incontinence supplies is accompanied \n     by a ``free'' adult diaper. Medicare has not shared in these \n     combination discounts.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal. Section 202 would permit discounts on \n     one item in a combination to be treated as discounts on \n     another item in the combination. This sounds innocent, but it \n     is not. Medicare would be a big loser. Discounting should be \n     permissable for a supplier \n\n[[Page S15799]]\n\n     to offer a discount on a combination of items or services, so \n     long as every item or service separately billed to Medicare \n     or Medicaid receives no less of a discount than is applied to \n     other items in the combination. If the items or services \n     separately billed to Medicare or Medicaid receive less of a \n     discount than other items in the combination, Medicare and \n     Medicaid are not receiving their fair share of the discounts.\n\n\n   5. UNPRECEDENTED MECHANISM FOR ADVISORY OPINIONS ON INTENT-BASED \n             STATUTES, INCLUDING THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE\n\n       Background: The Government already offers more advice on \n     the anti-kickback statute than is provided regarding any \n     other criminal provision in the United States Code.\n       Industry groups have been seeking advisory opinions under \n     the anti-kickback statute for many years, with vigorous \n     opposition by the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the HHS \n     Office of Inspector General (OIG) under the last three \n     administrations, as well as the National Association of \n     Attorneys General. In 1987, Congress rejected calls to \n     require advisory opinions under this statute. As a \n     compromise, Congress required HHS, in consultation with the \n     Attorney General, to issue ``safe harbor'' regulations \n     describing conduct which would not be subject to criminal \n     prosecution or exclusion. See Section 14 of Public Law 100-\n     93.\n       To date, the OIG has issued 13 final anti-kickback ``safe \n     harbor'' rules and solicited comment on 8 additional proposed \n     safe harbor rules, for a total of 21 final and proposed safe \n     harbors. Over 50 pages of explanatory material has been \n     published in the Federal Register regarding these proposed \n     and final rules. In addition, the OIG has issued six general \n     ``fraud alerts'' describing activity which is suspect under \n     the anti-kickback statute. Thus, the Government gives \n     providers guidance on what is clearly permissible (safe \n     harbors) under the anti-kickback statute and what we consider \n     illegal (fraud alerts).\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal. HHS would be required to issue advisory \n     opinions to the public on the Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback \n     statute (section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act), as \n     well as all other criminal authorities, civil monetary \n     penalty and exclusion authorities pertaining to Medicare and \n     Medicaid. HHS would be required to respond to requests for \n     advisory opinions within 30 days.\n       HHS would be authorized to charge requesters a user fee, \n     but there is no provision for this fee to be credited to HHS. \n     Fees would therefore be deposited in the Treasury as \n     miscellaneous receipts.\n       Major problems with anti-kickback advisory opinions \n     include:\n       Advisory opinions on intent-based statutes (such as the \n     anti-kickback statute) are impractical if not impossible. \n     Because of the inherently subjective, factual nature of \n     intent, it would be impossible for HHS to determine intent \n     based solely upon a written submission from the requestor. \n     Indeed, it does not make sense for a requestor to ask the \n     Government to determine the requestor's own intent. \n     Obviously, the requester already knows what their intent \n     is.\n       None of the 11 existing advisory opinion processes in the \n     Federal Government provide advisory opinions regarding the \n     issue of the requestor's intent. An advisory opinion process \n     for an intent-based statute is without precedent in U.S. law.\n       The advisory opinion process in H.R. 2389 would severely \n     hamper the Government's ability to prosecute health care \n     fraud. Even with appropriate written caveats, defense counsel \n     will hold up a stack of advisory opinions before the jury and \n     claim that the defendant read them and honestly believed \n     (however irrationally) that he or she was not violating the \n     law. The prosecution would have to disprove this defense \n     beyond a reasonable doubt. This will seriously affect the \n     likelihood of conviction of those offering kickbacks.\n       Advisory opinions would likely require enormous resources \n     and many full time equivalents (FTE) at HHS. The user fees in \n     the bill would go to the Treasury, not to HHS. Even if they \n     did go to HHS, appropriations committees tend to view them as \n     offsets to appropriations. There are no estimates of number \n     of likely requests, number of FTE required, etc. Also, HHS is \n     permanently downsizing, even as it faces massive structural \n     and program changes. The possible result of the bill is a \n     diversion of hundreds of anti-fraud workers to handle the \n     advisory opinions.\n       For the above reasons, DOJ, HHS/OIG and the National \n     Association of Attorneys General strongly oppose advisory \n     opinions under the anti-kickback statute, and all other \n     intent-based statutes.\n\n\n    6. Creation of trust fund mechanism which does not benefit law \n                              enforcement\n\n       Background: In our view, the most significant step Congress \n     could undertake to reduce fraud and abuse would be to \n     increase the resources devoted to investigating false claims, \n     kickbacks and other serious misconduct. It is important to \n     recognize that the law enforcement effort to control Medicare \n     fraud is surprisingly small and diminishing. There is \n     evidence of increasing Medicare fraud and abuse, and Medicare \n     expenditures continue to grow substantially. Yet, the staff \n     of the HHS/OIG, the agency with primary enforcement authority \n     over Medicare, has declined from 1,411 employees in 1991 \n     to just over 900 today. (Note: 259 of the 1,411 positions \n     were transferred to the Social Security Administration). \n     Approximately half of these FTE are devoted to Medicare \n     investigations, audits and program evaluations. As a \n     result of downsizing, HHS/OIG has had to close 17 OIG \n     investigative offices and we now lack an investigative \n     presence in 24 States. The OIG has only about 140 \n     investigators for all Medicare cases nationwide. By way of \n     contrast, the State of New York gainfully employs about \n     300 persons to control Medicaid fraud in that State alone.\n       Ironically, the investigative activity of OIG pays for \n     itself many times over. Over the last 5 years, every dollar \n     devoted to OIG investigations of health care fraud and abuse \n     has yielded an average return of over $7 to the Federal \n     Treasury, Medicare trust funds, and State Medicaid programs. \n     In addition, an increase in enforcement also generates \n     increased deterrence, due to the increased chance of fraud \n     being caught. For these reasons, many fraud control bills \n     contain a proposal to recycle monies recovered from \n     wrongdoers into increased law enforcement. The amount an \n     agency gets should not be related to how much it generates, \n     so that it could not be viewed as a ``bounty.'' The Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of HHS would decide on \n     disbursements from the fund. We believe such proposals would \n     strengthen our ability to protect Medicare from wrongdoers \n     and at no cost to the taxpayers. The parties who actually \n     perpetrate fraud would ``foot the bill.''\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 106 would create a funding \n     mechanism using fines and penalties recovered by law \n     enforcement agencies from serious wrongdoers. But none of the \n     money would be used to help bring others to justice. Instead, \n     all the funds would be used only by private contractors for \n     ``soft'' claims review, such as, medical and utilization \n     review, audits of costs reports, and provider education.\n       The above functions are indeed necessary, and they are now \n     being conducted primarily by the Medicare carriers and \n     intermediaries. Since the bill would prohibit carriers and \n     intermediaries from performing these functions in the future, \n     there appears to be no increase in these functions, but only \n     a different funding mechanism.\n       These ``soft'' review and education functions are no \n     substitute for investigation and prosecution of those who \n     intend to defraud Medicare. The funding mechanism in H.R. \n     2389 will not result in any more Medicare convictions and \n     sanctions.\n       In summary, H.R. 2389 would:\n       Relieve providers of the legal duty to use reasonable \n     diligence to ensure that the claims they submit are true and \n     accurate; this is the effect of increasing the Government's \n     burden of proof in civil monetary penalty cases;\n       Substantially increase the Government's burden of proof in \n     anti-kickback cases;\n       Create new exemptions to the anti-kickback statute which \n     could readily be exploited by those who wish to pay rewards \n     to physicians for referrals of patients;\n       Create an advisory opinion process on an intent-based \n     criminal statute, a process without precedent in current law; \n     since the fees for advisory opinions would not be available \n     to HHS, our scarce law enforcement resources would be \n     diverted into hiring advisory opinion writers; and\n       Create a fund to use monies recovered from wrongdoers by \n     law enforcement agencies, but the fund would not be available \n     to assist the law enforcement efforts; all the monies would \n     be used by private contractors only for ``soft'' payment \n     review and education functions.\n       In our view, enactment of the bill with these provisions \n     would cripple our ability to reduce fraud and abuse in the \n     Medicare program and to bring wrongdoers to justice.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 June Gibbs Brown,\n     Inspector General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Press Conference of Attorney General Janet Reno on Health Care Fraud, \n                            October 18, 1995\n\n       Attorney General Reno. Thank you, Secretary Shalala.\n       The House Medicare bill would make it more difficult for us \n     to prosecute medical providers for fraudulent conduct against \n     patients and the Medicare system. These provisions are \n     totally inconsistent with the provisions in the Senate bill, \n     which would facilitate our law enforcement efforts against \n     health care fraud that harms us all, and particularly our \n     most vulnerable.\n       I understand that some members of the House have indicated \n     that law enforcement should not be criminally prosecuting \n     health care providers who engage in fraud. I just don't \n     understand that, for I believe that health care fraud is so \n     detrimental to the health and to the pocketbook of all \n     Americans that I made health care fraud one of my priorities \n     in the Department of Justice. I believe perpetrators of \n     health care fraud should not be immune from criminal \n     prosecution because they commit a crime in an office, in a \n     boardroom, in a laboratory, rather than in the street. White \n     collar crooks who pay or take kickbacks endanger the health \n     of patients and steal money from us all.\n       Experts estimate it may cost Americans as much as $100 \n     billion a year. That is why we need stronger, not weaker, \n     provisions in the House bill. The Senate bill, under the \n     leadership of Senator Cohen and with bipartisan support, \n     provides those strengthened provisions.\n\n[[Page S15800]]\n\n       Particularly at this time, we need to preserve every \n     Medicare trust fund dollar; we cannot allow Medicare money to \n     be spent on bribes paid to doctors and others as inducement \n     for the referral of Medicare patients. Even more importantly, \n     we cannot allow financial inducements to corrupt the \n     professional judgment of medical providers--providers who \n     Americans have been taught to trust. Decisions which \n     physicians make day in and day out--whether and where to \n     hospitalize a patient, what laboratory tests to order, what \n     surgical procedure to perform, what drug to prescribe, and \n     how long to keep a patient in a psychiatric facility--affect \n     the health and well-being of our elderly patients and our \n     children. Allowing these decisions to be made under the \n     influence of kickbacks is just plain wrong.\n       The House bill would place a very high, additional burden \n     on the Government in its attempts to prosecute those who pay \n     or receive kickbacks for the purpose of inducing the referral \n     of Medicare business. Existing law requires the Government to \n     prove that one purpose of the kickback was to induce the \n     referral of health care business. The language of the House \n     bill would require that the Government prove that the payment \n     was made for the significant purpose of inducing the \n     referral. That's language that would immunize arrangements \n     that are dressed up to disguise the payor's motive. This \n     would seriously undermine our efforts and it would place \n     beyond the reach of prosecution many kickbacks which are \n     calculated to induce referrals and which adversely affect the \n     judgment of medical providers. From the perspective of \n     Federal law enforcement and, I believe, from the perspective \n     of patients who seek their doctors' advice, this result is \n     simply not acceptable.\n       Ultimately, this isn't a choice between prosecuting violent \n     crime and prosecuting health care fraud. Both of them do real \n     harm to real people and both deserve vigorous enforcement \n     action. I hope that the House legislation will support, \n     not undermine, our efforts.\n       Question. Why are the Republicans gutting the statutes?\n       Attorney General Reno. You would have to ask them, but I \n     have heard it said that they said we shouldn't prosecute \n     these cases while we have robbers and murderers on our \n     streets. And my response is we need to do both with vigor.\n       Question. Secretary Shalala, what's your theory about why \n     this is happening up in the House?\n       Secretary Shalala. Well, I have long ago learned not to \n     anticipate the motivations, but they clearly are weakening \n     our ability to get fraud out of the system, particularly--\n     it's particularly damaging during an era, as the Attorney \n     General pointed out, where we need to squeeze every dollar we \n     can out of Medicare to invest in the trust fund. And the last \n     things we should be doing is wasting money or letting people \n     rip off the program.\n       Question. [inaudible] uniform deadly health policy that you \n     approved yesterday. Tell us, do you think it will clear up \n     some of the confusion left over from the Ruby Ridge damage?\n       Attorney General Reno. Again, I think this is an important \n     step forward because for the first time, all of the major law \n     enforcement agencies in the Federal Government have joined \n     together in a uniform policy. And I think it will help people \n     to understand when deadly force can be used. It will apply to \n     each agency and I am very delighted about that.\n       Question. What is the real change that this policy makes?\n       Attorney General Reno. This policy will--the real change.\n       Question. What's the difference from the way it would be.\n       Attorney General Reno. Different departments had different \n     provisions and this consolidated in one, I think, a very firm \n     statement on the policy of both the Treasury Agency and the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Question. What tangible impact do you expect the changes to \n     have on the deadly force policy.\n       Attorney General Reno. I think it will enable those \n     enforcement officers involved to understand when they can and \n     can't use deadly force and I think the message will be clear.\n       Question. Secretary Shalala, will you ask the President to \n     veto this bill unless this is modified?\n       Secretary Shalala. There are so many provisions in the \n     Republicans bill that I have already sent a letter to the \n     Hill, indicating that if they adopt the bill as it's now \n     written that I will recommend that the President veto it. I \n     will join with the Attorney General after we review these \n     provisions in an additional comment for the President, \n     advising him on the bill. But these are simply unacceptable \n     and I think that's our point today.\n       Question. Are all these are provisions for Medicare and \n     Medicaid violations only or do some of them include kickback \n     statutes that cover general medical operations, not \n     Government programs?\n       Attorney General Reno. No, it covers some Government \n     programs. We would like to see it expanded to others: to the \n     Federal Health employees benefits program, to the \n     CHAMPUS program on behalf of the Department of Justice.\n       Question. But it doesn't cover kickbacks----\n       Attorney General Reno. In the private sector.\n       Question [continuing]. Not involving Medicare or Medicaid?\n       Attorney General Reno. That's correct.\n       Question. Do you know, as a practical matter, how the \n     change in the standard of proof would affect the prosecution?\n       Secretary Shalala. I think the cases that we gave you as an \n     example we would probably not be able to prosecute.\n       Attorney General Reno. If I can prove one purpose is to \n     induce the referral of Medicare business, that's one thing. \n     But to have to prove that the significant purpose is to \n     induce the referral of Medicare business significantly \n     heightens the standard. I think it produces confusion as to \n     what is meant by significant. And I think it undermines what \n     the kickback statute is trying to prevent.\n       Any time you bribe someone to get business you are \n     impairing or presenting a chance for the impairment of \n     judgment. That should never--the fact that you get money for \n     referring business, particularly medical business, should \n     never be a factor in the physicians' or the providers' \n     judgment. It should be what is in the best interest of that \n     patient, what is the most cost-effective medical treatment. \n     And a significant purpose or one purpose, it is critically \n     important that there not be bribery to secure Medicare \n     business.\n       Question. How does that, in turn, make it harder to \n     prosecute?\n       Attorney General Reno. I might be able to prove that it is \n     one purpose, but having to prove that it is the significant \n     purpose heightens the standards of proof.\n       Secretary Shalala. In fact, the Inspector Generals--all of \n     them have signed on to a letter to the Hill that basically \n     said it would bring those kinds of cases to a standstill \n     because it raises the bar pretty high.\n       Question. It sounds like it would make it pretty easy for \n     those involved in the kickbacks to get around it, doing \n     something illegal by masking and not making----\n       Attorney General Reno. All they would have to do is \n     disguise it and say it's for this reason or for that reason \n     or it has something to do with the patient's care and I might \n     not be able to prove that it is a significant purpose. It has \n     that chance of disguising what is really a bribe.\n       Question. Attorney General Reno, on another subject, what \n     is the Justice Department's position on the U.S. Sentencing \n     Commission's guidelines on crack cocaine versus powder \n     cocaine and the pending legislation that deals with that?\n       Attorney General Reno. We have said and made clear that \n     prosecutors, police officers, and most of all, the residents \n     of communities across this nation that have been impacted by \n     crack cocaine, understand that the marketing and distribution \n     systems and nature of the drug have had a terrible, terrible \n     impact on many neighborhoods and that its impact reflects the \n     need to have some distinction in the manner in which crack is \n     treated. But the Justice Department has made clear that it \n     favors a review of the 101 ratio, to adjust it, to make \n     it fairer.\n       It is our hope that legislation that is pending now which \n     rejects the one-to-one ratio because of the impact on \n     communities across this nation also would provide--ask the \n     Sentencing Commission to study it again in this coming year \n     to come up with a recommendation that reflects the impact of \n     crack on the community but also achieves fairness.\n       Question. What would you suggest would be a good ratio?\n       Attorney General Reno. We are going to be reviewing with \n     all concerned--as part of--I serve as part of the ex officio \n     members of the Sentencing Commission--that balance.\n       Question. Secretary Shalala, given that the [inaudible] is \n     taking a completely different approach, isn't there every \n     reason to believe it will be worked out in Congress?\n       Secretary Shalala. We long ago have learned not to depend \n     on one House versus another House. I think we are pointing \n     the contrast out between this House bill, which is going to \n     the floor tomorrow, and our ability to work in a bipartisan \n     manner with the Senate. Obviously, we hope in conference we \n     will be able to work it through, but we want to make it very \n     clear that what the House is doing is unacceptable. And most \n     members of Congress probably don't know what's in the bill, \n     since it was moved so quickly.\n       Question. Have you considered asking the American Medical \n     Association to join you in urging the Republicans to change \n     this?\n       Secretary Shalala. There are numerous organizations that \n     have now spoken out on this issue. Most of them have been the \n     State Attorney General, for example, and the Inspector \n     Generals. The American Medical Association, with a handful of \n     important exceptions, have joined us on all issues that are \n     related to fraud and abuse because they are absolutely \n     opposed to, number one, having to police themselves; and \n     number two, I think they very much favor anything we can do \n     to help them to clean up the profession.\n       Question. So where exactly are they on this?\n       Secretary Shalala. You will have to go ask them.\n       Question. Are you talking about the American Medical \n     Association or American medical associations of various \n     types?\n       Secretary Shalala. Well, of various types.\n       Question. Not the American Medical Association?\n       Secretary Shalala. I don't know the position of the AMA at \n     this moment.\n       Question. [inaudible.]\n       Secretary Shalala. Well, the self-referral changes that are \n     being referenced is whether \n\n[[Page S15801]]\n\n     a doctor can own a laboratory and then refer his own patients \n     to a laboratory in which he has a financial interest. That \n     law was changed a number of years ago because of the abuse \n     that was found in the system. There were 45 percent more \n     referrals if the doctors owned the lab. And that was barred \n     by the law. And the American Medical Association has favored \n     repealing the law which we are, of course, opposed to.\n       Question. Are there any examples of fraud cases that stand \n     out that would be good to pinpoint, related to this?\n       Attorney General Reno. One of the cases--where is Jerry \n     Stern--is NME case of last year. Our recovery in that case \n     was $379 million and that was based in significant part on \n     this provision that we are trying to defend today in terms of \n     kickbacks.\n       Question. Do you have any idea what would have happened had \n     the law been [inaudible]?\n       Attorney General Reno. I think, again, you can't quantify \n     it. But any time you have to prove that some--rather than \n     just one purpose, that it was the significant purpose, you \n     raise the bar real high. Thank you.\n       (Whereupon, at 1:55 p.m., the press conference adjourned.)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, could I ask if it will be in order to \nask for the yeas and nays or to table the Harkin amendment even if we \nnow proceed to the amendment of the Senator from Arizona?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be in order to do that when the \namendment recurs for a vote.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2971\n\n     (Purpose: To eliminate corporate welfare in Federal programs)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Faircloth, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2971.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I yield myself 4 minutes of the 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment, which has \nbeen endorsed by the Citizens Against Government Waste and Citizens for \na Sound Economy, which would terminate or substantially reform a dozen \nFederal programs identified by the Progressive Policy Institute and the \nCato Institute as amongst the most egregious forms of corporate welfare \nin the Federal budget. These amount to savings of about $60 billion \nover the next 7 years. They are the Marketing Promotion Program, the \nadvanced light water reactor, Forest Road Construction Program, highway \ndemonstrations, military export sales, broadcast spectrum auction, \nExport/Import Bank, the B-2 bomber, Travel and Tourism Administration, \nsub- and supersonic research----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a friendly \ninquiry?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I only have 4 minutes, I say to my colleague.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May I have 5 seconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If you ask unanimous consent, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Can the Senate get a copy of your amendment now? We \nhave nothing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I do not want to embarrass the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will make sure the Senator gets a copy of the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We delivered a copy of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. A copy of the amendment, I understand, has been delivered \nto the Senator from West Virginia. I certainly understand his \nfrustration if he did not have a chance to see the amendment.\n  Mr. President, continuing--sub- and supersonic research; terminates \nthe NASA program which conducts aircraft design activities, which can \nbe undertaken by the private sector; oil and gas research and \ndevelopment; rural electric utilities service.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing new about these programs. They are \nitems we have been discussing on the floor of the Senate for many \nyears. They each have one thing in common; in a time of fiscal \nnecessity, we can no longer afford them.\n  We are considering historic legislation to place the Federal budget \non a 7-year path toward balance and to reform unsustainable entitlement \nprograms which threaten to bankrupt our Nation. If we are going to \nrestore fiscal sanity and if we are going to ask poor people to take \ncuts in their programs, if we are going to reduce the rate of growth of \nmany, many programs that have been designed as a safety net for those \nless well off in our society, if we are going to have credibility with \nthe American people, we had better go after this corporate pork and we \nbetter do it soon. Otherwise, we will open ourselves to justifiable \ncriticism that we take care of corporate America while we do not take \ncare of citizens who are less fortunate than we in our society.\n  I think it is an important amendment. I think it is going to put the \nSenate on record as to exactly where we stand on some of these programs \nthat have clearly, clearly not required Federal funding in order to \ncontinue.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to the Cato Institute and Progressive \nPolicy Institute. Although they represent different ideological \nperspectives, they joined together to identify corporate welfare \nprograms and to articulate the destructive role that they play in the \nFederal budget and the economy.\n  As time is limited on debate, I offer these insights as offered by \nthese groups. The Cato Institute says:\n\n       Corporate welfare is an enormous drain on the Federal \n     Treasury for little economic benefit.\n\n  The Progressive Policy Institute says:\n\n       The President and Congress can break the [budget] impasse \n     and substantially reduce most spending and projected deficits \n     * * * if they are willing to eliminate or reform scores of \n     special spending programs and tax provisions narrowly \n     targeted to subsidize influential industries.\n\n  I reserve my 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at a time when deep cuts are being \nproposed in Medicare, Medicaid, education, the earned income tax \ncredit, welfare benefits, and other important programs for senior \ncitizens, children, and working families, it is essential to see that \ncorporate welfare--government subsidies to wealthy corporations--bears \nits fair share of the sacrifices needed to put the Nation's fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  I welcome the opportunity to work with Senator McCain and other \nSenators in this bipartisan effort. We have identified a dirty dozen \nexamples of corporate welfare that ought to be ended or drastically \nreduced.\n  My hope is that the current efforts will become the foundation for a \nlonger-term initiative to deal more effectively with the wider range of \ncorporate welfare provisions on both the spending side and the tax side \nof the Federal budget.\n  At a time when we are cutting billions of dollars from health \nbenefits for the elderly, it makes no sense to continue to give away \nbillions to wealthy telecommunications corporations by failing to \nobtain fair market value by auctioning electronic spectrum.\n  At a time when we are imposing billions of dollars in taxes on our \nworking families, it makes no sense to spend billions of dollars on \nadditional B-2 bombers that the Pentagon doesn't want and the Nation \ndoesn't need.\n  At a time when we are imposing new burdens on education, it makes no \nsense to confer excessive subsidies on oil and gas companies.\n  At a time when we are cutting benefits for the disabled, it makes no \nsense to continue to provide subsidies for major companies to market \ntheir goods overseas.\n  Our current amendment will end these and several other forms of \ncorporate welfare. It also calls for a base-closing type Federal \nCommission to deal with this equally flagrant type of corporate \nwelfare--the lavish Federal subsidies dispensed to wealthy individuals \nand corporations through the Tax Code.\n  Over the next 7 years, these tax subsidies will cost the Treasury a \ntotal of $4.5 trillion. Yet they undergo no annual review during the \nappropriations process or during reconciliation. Once enacted, they can \ngo on forever, with no effective oversight by Congress.\n\n[[Page S15802]]\n\n  The Commission we are proposing will examine all existing tax \nsubsidies and make recommendations to Congress that will be subject to \na ``yes'' or ``no'' vote by the Senate and the House.\n  I commend Senator McCain and our other colleagues for their work on \nthis important issue, and I am hopeful that the Senate will approve our \namendment. Our action on this legislation is part of a longer-term \ninitiative to insist on congressional scrutiny of all Federal \nsubsidies.\n  At a time when so many individuals and families are being asked to \nbear a heavy burden of budget cuts, there should be no free rides for \nspecial interest groups and their cozy subsidies.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant support of the amendment \nfrom the Senator from Arizona to cut spending from 12 programs.\n  I am supporting the amendment because, at a time when we are debating \na budget bill to cut programs and assistance for the most needy in our \nsociety, I find it hard to pass up an opportunity to cut billions of \ndollars from programs like the B-2 bomber, and oil and gas subsidies.\n  However, while I will support this amendment, I am extremely unhappy \nwith the decision by the proponents of this amendment to cut loan \nprograms for rural electric cooperatives, who depend on those funds to \nkeep utility rates reasonable for rural residents.\n  I am equally unhappy with the choice of the proponents of this \namendment to eliminate the Market Promotion Program, on the heels of \nthe successful effort to eliminate the corporate subsidies from that \nprogram, and target it toward small businesses and cooperatives.\n  So while I must reluctantly vote in support of this amendment to cut \nbillions of dollars, if it does prevail, I will work to have the Rural \nUtility Service loans and the Market Promotion Program restored in \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this amendment has very broad jurisdictional \nproblems with a whole series of committees. It is the opinion of this \nSenator that probably the primary committee of jurisdiction would again \nbe the Finance Committee. Therefore, I will yield to a member of the \nFinance Committee, the Senator from West Virginia, for remarks to be \nincluded in our 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I appreciate the action of the \nranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  This amendment which we have not yet--let me say first of all, it \nwill be my hope that our side will not take a position on this, because \nwe are simply unaware of what it is. In fact, it appears to be many, \nmany things.\n  It starts out with the elimination of the Market Promotion Program \nfor agriculture, I think. It appears to be part Agriculture, part \nFinance, part Commerce Committee. It gets into the termination of the \nAdvanced Light Water Reactor Program. I am thoroughly unqualified to \nreview that. It talks about timber access roads. That is an Energy \nCommittee matter. It talks about United States Travel and Tourism, \nUSTTA. That is something I strongly support. Other Members may not. I \nsuspect the Senator from Arizona does not.\n  There is a private sector funding for certain research and \ndevelopment by NASA relating to aircraft performance. That is the \nformal title. What that means I have absolutely no idea, and I have no \nway of finding out in the next 2 or 3 minutes.\n  There are many other things--the recoupment of certain Department of \nDefense costs for equipment sold directly by contractors to foreign \ncountries and international organizations.\n  So, my plea would be for all my colleagues to take this 21-page \namendment, between the time now--having no position on it, as would be \nmy recommendation to my ranking member on the Budget Committee--and the \ntime that we vote, and Senators make up their minds as best they can.\n  I am absolutely unable, having had this for a period of 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes, to make heads or tails of it, since it is many things and, I \nsuspect, many things to many people. This is not, it strikes me, in \nterms of process, one of the Senate's finer moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, following up the inquiry that was made just \na few moments ago by the chairman of the committee, I would also \npresume we have not made up our minds on this side of the aisle on this \namendment. I also assume that, without taking action now, it would not \npreclude us from making a point of order which might lie against this \namendment at some future date before the vote is taken; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order can be made when the \namendment comes up again.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does Senator McCain have any additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 51 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senator from West \nVirginia, we did distribute this amendment much earlier today. I am \nsorry he did not get it.\n  Also, I would like to point out that Senators Feingold, Kerry, and \nKennedy are also cosponsors of this amendment. So some Members on his \nside of the aisle obviously are aware of it.\n  I am also aware that a budget point of order can be lodged against \nthis amendment, and I do not expect it to pass, Mr. President. I am \nbeing very frank. But I will tell you what. We are going to be on \nrecord as to what we support and what we do not support in the way of \ncorporate pork and whether we are really willing to make the sacrifices \nnecessary to reduce this unconscionable debt of $187,000 per child in \nAmerica while we support corporations all over America with taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Is there any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a minute and 40 seconds available to \nthe Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. We have 40 seconds left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I am prepared to yield that back in a moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from West Virginia----\n  Mr. EXON. I see the majority leader in the Chamber. Is he seeking \nrecognition?\n  Mr. DOLE. No.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  I thought Senator Rockefeller was finished.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In responding to the Senator from Arizona and what I \nam sure is a very good-faith--I know is a very good-faith effort, if \nSenators Feingold, Kennedy and others are in fact cosponsors of it, one \nwould never know by looking at the amendment because only the name of \nthe Senator from Arizona is listed. And this is part of what I am \ntalking about. If we are going to make serious decisions about the \nenormous variety of programs, we have to do this in some kind of more \nintelligent way. Now, the rules may preclude us from doing that because \nthe agreement has already been made, but this is many things to many \npeople.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Has all time expired?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, the yeas and nays are being \nrequested. Again, I want to make it clear that would not preclude us \nfrom making a point of order before the vote is taken. That is correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Arizona. We imposed on him \nthis afternoon, having called down and you were not ready, and I \napologize for that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it appropriate for the Senator from Nebraska to make a \n\n\n[[Page S15803]]\n\npoint of order at this point and we move to waive the point of order, \nor does that take place at the time of the vote?\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say we are looking at this. I do not know whether \nwe are going make a point of order against this or not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. We are simply reserving the right to do that at a certain \ntime, and I will not give that up at this juncture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not Senator Byrd's \namendment that is next pursuant to the previous agreement?\n  Mr. FORD. That would be the Senator's prerogative.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am just asking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has no specified list and therefore \npresumes it is to up to the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, Senator Byrd will be next in line, and I am \npleased to yield to him whatever time we have on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2972\n\n (Purpose: To strike the reductions in highway demonstration projects \n             and to provide an offsetting revenue increase)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Ford, proposes an amendment numbered 2972.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 6002.\n       On page 1746, line 11, strike ``2001'' and insert ``2000''.\n       On page 1747, strike the matter between lines 7 and 8, and \n     insert:\n\nFor calendar year:                                   The percentage is:\n  1995..............................................................100\n  1996...............................................................80\n  1997...............................................................60\n  1998...............................................................40\n  1999...............................................................20\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, less than 4 years ago, Congress passed the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA. That \nlegislation modernized our Federal Aid Highway Program by targeting \navailable resources on the most critical needs. The bill before us \nwould rescind $712 million for certain highway projects funded in ISTEA \nand previous appropriation acts. This represents a substantial retreat \nfrom the commitments made in ISTEA and in those appropriations acts.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will restore full funding for these \nimportant highway projects in 48 States. By rescinding these Federal \nfunds, the bill before us would require States to cough up an \nadditional $712 million for these projects. In effect, this would cause \nStates to have to increase their matching share from 20 percent to as \nmuch as 32 percent in order to complete these projects.\n  Currently, the Department of Defense shows a total unobligated \nbalance in excess of $10 billion for ongoing military construction \nprojects, yet no one--no one--suggests that we should rescind 15 \npercent of these unobligated balances in defense and thereby ensure \nthat these projects cannot be completed.\n  If we seek to reduce our Federal budget deficit by worsening our \ninvestment deficit in our Nation's infrastructure, we will have done \nabsolutely nothing to improve our national prosperity. We will only dig \nour Nation into a deeper hole characterized by excessively congested \nand deteriorating roads and bridges.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, there are currently \nmore than 234,000 miles of nonlocal roads across the Nation which \nrequire improvements immediately or within the next 5 years. \nAdditionally, 118,000 of the Nation's 575,000 bridges, more than one in \nfive, are structurally deficient. Our current highway capacity is being \nstretched beyond its limits, and what is our response at the Federal \nlevel? Just as is the case with our Federal budget deficit, we are \nleaving the mess to our grandchildren.\n  To fully offset the effects of the restoration of these critical \nhighway projects, my amendment includes a modification to section 12803 \nof the reconciliation bill which phases out the tax deductions \npresently allowed for the interest paid on company-owned life insurance \npolicies over the period 1996 to 2001. Companies have used this \nloophole to earn profits at the expense of the taxpayer by insuring \nemployees, then borrowing on the policy and deducting the interest on \ncompany tax returns. Both the Senate and House bills proposed to phase \nout this loophole.\n  My amendment would simply require the phaseout in the Senate bill to \nbe completed in 4 years rather than 5 years. My proposal would retain \nthe key employee exception as contained in the Senate bill. My \namendment would restore highway moneys to 48 States, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Bumpers and Mr. \nPryor be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, Mr. President, 48 States will lose money unless my \namendment is adopted. They will lose money for highways. I do not blame \nthe committee that had to meet its instructions and did so by \nrescinding $712 million in highway funds. But I have provided an \noffset, and therefore I hope that this amendment will be adopted.\n  I have received letters of support of my amendment from the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association, the American Trucking \nAssociation, and the Associated General Contractors of America.\n  Mr. President, let me just read a few of those States that lose \nmoney. Alabama will lose $12.8 million; Arizona, $2.8 million; Arizona, \n$31.5 million; California, $43.8 million; Connecticut, $5 million; \nFlorida, $27.9 million; Georgia, $10.8 million; Hawaii, $3 million; \nIdaho, $8 million; Illinois, $29 million; Indiana, $8 million; Iowa, $9 \nmillion; Kansas, $9 million; Kentucky, $4.6 million; Louisiana, $13.8 \nmillion; Maine, $10.9 million; Maryland, $12.6 million; Michigan, $23 \nmillion; Minnesota, $23.5 million; Mississippi, $2.9 million; Missouri, \n$9.3 million; Montana, $3 million; Nebraska, $2.8 million; Nevada, $5.8 \nmillion; New Hampshire, $4.3 million; New Jersey, $29.3 million; New \nYork, $40 million----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that this \ntable, along with three letters in support of my amendment, be printed \nin the Record. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     HIGHWAY FUNDS

American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: The documented backlog of highway and bridge \n     needs in the United States was estimated at more than $290 \n     billion by the Department of Transportation in its 1993 \n     report to the Congress. Despite this huge deficiency in \n     infrastructure investment, the reconciliation bill (S. 1357) \n     now before the Senate would reduce funding for highways by \n     $522 million in fiscal year 1996 and an additional $165 \n     million in fiscal year 1997.\n       The 4,000 members of the American Road & Transportation \n     Buildings Association (ARTBA) strongly urge that you support \n     an amendment to S. 1357 to be offered by Sen. Robert C. Byrd \n     that would preserve existing funding levels.\n       Cutting highway funding at this time would be in conflict \n     with the conference report on the fiscal 1996 transportation \n     appropriations bill (H.R. 2002). That measure reflects the \n     importance of highways to the country by increasing funding \n     for their improvement. The federal highway program was, in \n     fact, the only mode to receive a higher funding level than in \n     fiscal 1995.\n       According to the Federal Highway Administration, America's \n     highways provide 88 percent of the nation's personal \n     transportation in addition to a large proportion of its \n     commercial movement. Congress is expected shortly to approve \n     designation of the National Highway System, a 159,000-mile \n     network of roads intended to be the nation's backbone \n     transportation system and the focus of federal highway \n     investment in the years ahead. Clearly, this is no time to \n     cutting already-inadequate funding for highway improvements. \n     Furthermore, most of the proposed reduction is for activities \n     supported by the Highway Trust Fund, a pay-as-you-go \n     financing system supported by user fees. The sought budget \n     savings can be found in other areas less crucial to this \n     country's future.\n       ARTBA's nationwide membership is involved in the planning, \n     design, construction, financing and operation of all forms of \n     transportation facilities. It includes contractors, engineers \n     and planners, equipment manufacturers, materials suppliers, \n     public officials, financial institutions and educators. \n     Again, we urge you to support Senator Byrd's amendment to S. \n     1357.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   T. Peter Ruane,\n     President & CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               American Trucking Associations,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I am writing to indicate the support of \n     the American Trucking Associations for your efforts to \n     restore $712 million in badly needed highway funding.\n       A Department of Transportation report estimated that the \n     backlong of highway and bridge needs in the United States was \n     in excess of $290 million. The conference report on the FY \n     '96 Department of Transportation Appropriations bill (H.R. \n     2002) recognized this problem by increasing highway funding. \n     Your efforts to restore that funding is in line with the \n     priorities set out in H.R. 2002.\n       We support your amendment to S. 1357, the Budget \n     Reconciliation Act, and urge your Senate colleagues to \n     approve this amendment.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Timothy P. Lynch.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: The 33,000 members of the Associated \n     General Contractors of America strongly support your \n     amendment to S. 1357 that will restore much needed funding \n     for highway projects.\n       Your recognition of the problems that the existing \n     provision (section 6002) will cause the highway program are \n     greatly appreciated. As you are so keenly aware, your \n     amendment restores $715 million in highway funding for 48 \n     states (only Alaska and Delaware escape the cuts included in \n     Section 6002). Elimination of this funding mid stream will \n     simply delay needed construction and could cost as many as \n     36,000 jobs.\n       In addition to eliminating current funding for projects \n     (many of which are under construction) that have been \n     previously approved by both the House and Senate, Section \n     6002 also sets a bad precedent by using highway trust fund \n     money to offset the general fund deficit and will adversely \n     impact the baseline for highway funding which could lower the \n     amount of resources made available for critical highway \n     construction in the future.\n       Thank you for your continued vigilance in ensuring adequate \n     investment in the Nation's Surface Transportation Programs.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Stephen E. Sandherr,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                          Congressional Relations.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was not privy to drafting the \nprovisions in the Finance Committee, and from the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I wonder if Senator Chafee might take half my \ntime and explain this as he sees it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this provision that is referred to as a \nloophole was entirely legal over the years that it was enforced, and in \nthe Finance Committee, after considerable \n\n[[Page S15805]]\n\nnegotiation in what we are doing in retroactively repealing something, \nif you would, the belief was that doing it over 5 years was a fair \nmethod of proceeding.\n  And the belief was that to do it in 4 years--a very abbreviated \ntime--was just not fair. So, Mr. President, this is an intricate, \ncomplicated system, and a complicated piece of legislation. But we felt \nin the Finance Committee that indeed there was considerable pressure to \ngive a longer time to phase it out. But we arrived at 5 years thinking \nthat was a fair way of doing it, and the 4 years just does pose a \nsevere problem and difficulty upon those who chose to use this type of \ncompany-owned life insurance policies. So, Mr. President, that was the \nrationale for going to the 5 years.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the House phases it out in 4 years. The \nSenate phases it out in 5 years. So either way it gets phased out. I \nsuggest we phase it out in 4 years, and apply that money to these \ninfrastructure projects in 48 States of the country. Let us cast a vote \nfor America and the future of America.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do not want to look at this in terms of \nwhether we are voting for America or not. People would not want to \nstand up here and suggest they were not voting for America. I suspect \nthey believe the amendments are for America.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that we are doing something \nretroactively. And it was our belief that 5 years was the fair way. \nNow, I suppose you could do it in 1 year. But that does not make it any \nfairer. So, Mr. President, that was the basis on which we did the 5 \nyears in the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would just make a couple of quick \npoints. Senator Byrd knows that I have great respect for him and I am \nfully aware of his constant and persistent desire that we spend money \non infrastructure. But I think the only possible way, assuming it is \nnot subject to a point of order, that this amendment should be adopted \nis if the U.S. Senate thinks that the demonstration highway projects \nwere a good thing.\n  The demonstration highway projects did not treat all States equally. \nAs a matter of fact, by being demonstration projects, some States got a \nlot more than others. So the distinguished Senator is now looking at \nthat and saying some States would lose and some States would gain, but \nthis is not a formula where everyone was allowed demonstration \nprojects. This is a nonformula.\n  The demonstrations were established by committee or by appropriation \nor in that way. And anybody interested in whether this is a fair \ndistribution among our States can just look at the list which I do not \nchose to read here tonight, but there are some very disproportionate \nreturns of money to certain States and very little to other States that \nshould have the same amount on population and highways. But the \ndemonstrations were not set out in any fair way in the beginning.\n  So if you think the highway demonstration programs were great, then \nobviously you ought to put them back in here whereas the committee \ndecided that they did not think they ought to be in and we ought to \nsave money. So that is going to be the issue. That is if it is not \nsubject to a point of order. And the reason I say ``if,'' my instinct \ntells me it is, but then I think of who offered it, and I am quite sure \nhe made sure it was not subject to a point of order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. If we do not adopt this amendment, then we are \nretroactively wiping out those infrastructure projects in 48 States of \nthis country. I hope the Senate will adopt the amendment. I did not \nmention Pennsylvania, $111 million; Ohio, $22 million; Texas, $29 \nmillion; Virginia, $14 million; West Virginia, $66 million. I have only \nread some of them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator mentioned West Virginia?\n  Mr. BYRD. I mentioned West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Mexico has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not going to ask for the yeas and nays or move to \ntable. I will wait for the vote, the time that it comes up.\n  Senator Chafee, I believe, is the next one.\n  Does the Senator have a copy of Senator Chafee's amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. We do. I might say at this time, following Senator Chafee's \npresentation, I will yield our 5 minutes, which is the jurisdiction of \nthe Finance Committee, to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair would be good enough \nto tell when I have used 3 minutes.\n  As I understand it, we have 5 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the Chair could tell me at the end of 3 minutes, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator is offering an amendment, he \nneeds to send it to the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2973\n\n  (Purpose: To guarantee coverage under the medicaid program for low-\nincome aged, blind, and disabled individuals eligible for supplemental \n  security income benefits under title XVI of the Social Security Act)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am sending the amendment to the desk, an unprinted \namendment, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself and \n     Mr. Conrad, proposes amendment numbered 2973.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would ask that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 767, strike lines 12 through 15 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(3) provide for making medical assistance available to \n     any individual receiving cash benefits under title XVI by \n     reason of disability (including blindness) or receiving \n     medical assistance under section 1902(f) (as in effect on the \n     day before the date of enactment of this Act); and''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Conrad and myself. What it does, it guarantees Medicaid \neligibility for low-income individuals with disabilities. Under the \nlanguage reported by the Senate Finance Committee, States are required \nto provide coverage to persons with disabilities.\n  However, and here is the hitch--the States are given complete \nlatitude in establishing the definition of who is disabled. It could be \nonly those who are quadriplegics who are blind are considered disabled. \nI mean, they can have any definition the States wish. What our \namendment does is it sets a minimum standard by requiring States to \nprovide coverage to children and adults with disabilities who receive \nbenefits under the Supplemental Security Income Program [SSI].\n  But here are the important words, the SSI Program, as amended by the \nwelfare reform bill which we passed here a month or so ago, we passed \nhere by a vote of 87 to 12. So this is a very restricted group. This is \nnot the SSI group that we worry about that included substance abusers, \nfor example. That is not in this category. Only the neediest \nindividuals qualify for SSI. They all have incomes below the poverty \nlevel and indeed currently they have to--they cannot be above 75 \npercent of the poverty level and qualify. Now, this is a pretty low-\nincome group.\n  Why is this amendment important? Without this requirement, States \nwill have the ability to exclude from coverage a group of individuals \nwho depend on this Medicaid coverage as their only source of health \ninsurance coverage. There is no place else they can go. You say get \nprivate insurance. Well, they first cannot afford it. And second, they \nall have preexisting conditions, and so therefore would not be \nqualified.\n  Mr. President, there is no mandated benefit package in this proposal. \nThese are the facts. We do not mandate a benefit package. We leave that \nup to the States. All we are saying is, you have to cover this group. \nAnd how do you describe this group? You describe them \n\n[[Page S15806]]\n\nby the SSI description as we had it in the welfare program. So, indeed, \nwith no mandated benefit package, the States could say, ``For this \ngroup there will be one aspirin a year.'' That could be done. But at \nleast you have to cover everybody in the group with whatever the \nbenefit package is.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important to remember that we are \ngiving the States, over the next 7 years, $800 billion--$800 billion, \nMr. President. And they are going to receive their allocations based on \nthe fact of those whom they covered in 1995, and in the group that they \ncovered in which they got their money are these disabled. So, Mr. \nPresident, these are a very, very low-income group in our society. They \nare being cared for very frequently by their parents and others, kept \nin the community. And without this safety net they would have to in \nmany cases be institutionalized at a far higher cost. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in preserving this critical safety net.\n  I yield time to Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Chafee in \noffering this amendment. Mr. President, simply put, this provides \nhealth care support to the most severely disabled individuals in our \nsociety. Senator Chafee and I received a letter of support from the \nConsortium for Citizens With Disabilities, 30 national organizations \nthat work to support the disabled. They said, and I quote:\n\n       We believe that your amendment to establish a minimum floor \n     of eligibility for children and adults with disabilities is a \n     fundamental component of ensuring a basic safety net for low-\n     income people with severe disabilities.\n\n  Mr. President, health care is not an option for these people, it is a \nnecessity. They have it today. They should not be at risk for losing it \ntomorrow.\n  During Finance Committee deliberation, we received this \ncommunication. It said:\n\n       Mr. Senator, if you are a person with mental retardation, \n     these services are not optional. Remember, this is a lifelong \n     condition which cannot be cured like substance abuse or \n     unemployment. Also remember, it is not a self-inflicted \n     condition, but rather one that a person is born with.\n\n  Mr. President, States should not cut severely disabled people from \nMedicaid. That is the premise of this amendment. I hope our colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, first, I want to compliment the \nSenator from Rhode Island, because actually it was the Senator from \nRhode Island and myself in the Finance Committee who put up this \namendment, which won 17 to 3, and then it sort of disappeared. It \nparticularly disappeared with respect to the disabled. It should be \nunderstood the Senator is entirely correct in his amendment, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support his amendment.\n  On the other hand, it is also important to understand that by voting \nfor this amendment that we are not going to be making a prince out of a \nfrog; that the underlying Medicaid bill which encompasses this \namendment is, in the judgment of this Senator, a disaster.\n  This amendment will help. I do not want to in any way diminish that. \nThis is pregnant women, children, and the disabled, and it is a \nguarantee. The guarantee was not there before.\n  The Senator is right when he says the States now have to make a \ndetermination under the current law what ``disabled'' means. Good \nheavens, 50 different definitions coming in on ``disabled.''\n  The point is, it is a good amendment in a bad bill. The States will \nstill lose 30 percent of their Medicaid funding. In the case of my \nState, it is a little more than that. On nursing home protection, \nFederal standards are wiped out. That really does bring up the specter, \nand some say, ``Well, you are just making a fuss over this.'' What a \nfuss. The standards we passed in 1987 by which you could no longer \ntether, that is tie down, an elderly person in a nursing home or drug \ninto passivity an elderly person, is wiped out. So that is now possible \nunder the underlying bill.\n  These are terrible things. Children with primary care needs, early \ndetection, early protection, no immunization--it is not a good bill. \nBut the amendment is good and the Senator from Rhode Island has \nsuggested an amendment that ought to be adopted.\n  So I just simply make that point and compliment the Senator \nsignificantly for now getting the word ``guaranteed'' coverage into the \nlegislation. I compliment him on that and urge my colleagues to support \nthe Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Has all time been used on the amendment before us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 1 minute, \n50 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if I could have just a portion of that.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield half of it to my colleague.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wait a minute; wait a minute. How do we get all 10 \nminutes in favor of the amendment? I do not want to argue against it. \nYou cannot allocate the time to the other side if they are in favor of \nthe amendment. Is that not the rule? If it is not, I am mistaken.\n  Mr. EXON. I do not think the rule specifies that. But in a matter of \nfairness, I agree to the chairman's--who wishes to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is such an outstanding amendment. I do \nnot think there is any opposition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not so sure but you are right. But I want to make \nsure we do not have all 10 minutes. I thought we were going to save 5.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Why do we not save time and just adopt it?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We cannot do that right now. It may come to pass.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield half my time to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield? Will the \nSenator from Rhode Island correct the misstatement of the Senator from \nWest Virginia about pregnant women, children and disabled as opposed to \nthe elderly?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am going to stick what we have here, which is we are \nsolely dealing with low-income individuals with disabilities. Mr. \nPresident, I tell you, when you are talking 75 percent of poverty, you \nare really talking about poor people.\n  But the key thing I want to stress here is these folks are being \ncared for in the community very frequently by their parents. And do not \nthink these are 6-year-olds and their parents are 35. Their parents are \nfrequently 65 and these individuals are 40 years old. But they are \nbeing cared for in the community, because they have this safety net of \nMedicaid coverage that is there in case they get ill. Otherwise, I am \ncertain that they would end up in institutions at a far greater cost to \nthe public and all of us.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope the amendment will be adopted.\n  Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator yield? I indicate my support for the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. If the manager wishes to \nspeak in opposition, he is entitled to have 5 minutes restored in \nopposition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not choose to speak in opposition. Does any \nSenator want to speak in opposition? What I would like to do is take my \n5 minutes and I would like to yield 2 minutes of that to Senator Cohen. \nHe can speak in favor of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes has expired in support.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have 2 minutes \nto speak in favor of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager is entitled to 5 minutes in \nopposition. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I thank my friend. I rise in support of the \nChafee amendment. Senator Chafee has tried valiantly to include the \npoorest of the poor in our system, and for anyone to object to having \nthe disabled included--I might say, it does not go far enough perhaps, \nbecause as I understand the Senator's amendment, it includes pregnant \nwomen and children and does not include elderly; it includes disabled \nbut it leaves it up to the States to define what ``disabled'' is.\n  I know the Senator was eager to use the SSI determination for \n``disabled.'' Is that the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right. It has already been adopted. Pregnant \nwomen and children up to the age of 12 and 100 \n\n[[Page S15807]]\n\npercent of poverty, that is covered. And also the disabled are to be \ncovered, but the definition of ``disabled'' was not made.\n  Mr. COHEN. My understanding is now you have included the definition \nthat has been acknowledged under the SSI determination.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As changed by the welfare bill.\n  Mr. COHEN. Then please let me lend my strong support for that, and I \nwant to thank my friend from New Mexico for allowing me a moment or two \nto express my support.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, is this the proper time to ask for the \nyeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be appropriate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do so. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank everyone.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thought he was next. I was mistaken. I \nbelieve Senator Breaux is next.\n  I yield our 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2963\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for a partially refundable child tax credit)\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2963.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Overpayments of tax.''\n\n       ``(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, my colleagues, the largest item in the \nFinance Committee bill, by far, is the $500 per child tax credit. It \ncost $141 billion over 7 years. That is a lot of money. Some people \nthink we should not have a tax cut at all. But this bill is going to \nhave a tax cut in it. The largest one is going to be a per child tax \ncut at $500 per child. I would think that all of us, if we know it is \ngoing to pass, should at least agree on one thing--the largest number \nof families that need it should get it.\n  Here is what my amendment does. It addresses a problem that is very \nreal. Simply stated, the Republican proposal only is a credit against \nincome tax. It is not a credit against the largest tax that people pay \nin this country, that is, the payroll tax. For 75 percent of American \nfamilies, they pay more in payroll tax than in income tax. This child \ntax credit is not an offset against the payroll tax. This chart shows \nthat. The blue line is the payroll taxes that people pay on average. \nThe orange line is an estimate of their income tax.\n  So you see, families making $16,000, all the way up to families on \nthis chart making almost $27,000, are paying far more in payroll taxes \nthan they are paying in income taxes.\n  The figures show that under the Republican proposal, something like \n44 percent of all the children in America would only get a partial or \nno credit at all, because the credit is only against the income tax. \nMany families do not even pay that much in income tax.\n  If you have a family that has two children, that is a $1,000 credit. \nBut if they are only paying $700 or $500 in income tax, they do not get \nto use the credit. Therefore, simply stated, my amendment makes the \n$500 per child tax credit a credit against both the income tax or the \npayroll tax. We spend the same amount of money--not a dime more, not a \ndime less. But we cover 44 percent more children. We cover about 31 \nmillion more children living in families, and if we are going to spend \nthis money for a credit, let us make sure they get it.\n  The second chart tells you what we are talking about when we look at \nfamily earnings and how much they pay in income taxes--the actual \nnumbers. A family making $20,000 a year is at about $458 in income tax. \nThat would not even pay for the credit for one child. But that same \nfamily is spending over $1,500--$1,530--in payroll tax. My amendment \nsays that the $500 per child tax credit can be used as a credit against \nthe payroll tax, as well as an income tax, so that the family making \n$20,000 will get some of the benefits of this massive program that we \nare passing. What is wrong with saying let us make sure that the most \nnumber of children get the benefit?\n  I have seen some of the Republican charts that say, well, under this \ncredit, this proposal, we get a huge credit against income tax. Sure, \nthe problem that is most families pay more in payroll tax, and it is no \noffset whatsoever against the payroll tax. So for families making under \n$30,000 a year, for most of them it is no benefit at all.\n  Look at this chart. This is every State in the country. This is the \nmedian household income. In Louisiana, it is $25,000. Under the \nRepublican proposal, if you are in a family making less than $30,000 a \nyear, you are not going to get the benefit of a per child tax credit. \nSo my proposition is very simple. If you want to add about 31 million \nmore people to the rolls and give them the benefit, for the same amount \nof money--exactly the same amount of money--my credit goes out to \nfamilies making up to $75,000 a year. It starts to phase out at $60,000 \nand eliminates it at $75,000 per family, but it makes it refundable \nagainst a payroll tax. By spending the same amount of money, we cover \n31 million more children. I think that is what we are trying to do.\n  I got this wonderful note from the Christian Coalition saying they \nare going to target this amendment. They say, ``We are going to portray \nthis amendment as a vote to gut the $500 per child tax credit.'' It \ndoes not gut it; it is the same amount of money. We are just covering \n31 million more children in this country by making it a credit against \nthe payroll tax. They say they want to make sure they get the most \nnumber of people covered. That is exactly what my amendment does. They \nsay, well, his starts to phase out at $60,000 per year. That is true, \n\n[[Page S15808]]\n\nbut it goes up to the same amount, $75,000, that the original \nRepublican proposal did. Just by making it refundable against the \npayroll tax----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Forty-four percent more children are covered.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first let me say that I agree with the \nSenator from Louisiana in wanting to make this tax cut refundable \nagainst the FICA or payroll tax, because I argued many months and many \ntimes that we should do this and expand the tax credit, because FICA is \none of the most regressive.\n  But this is not the way to do it. This is not the way to pit one \ngroup of hard-working, tax-paying families against another group of \nfamilies that struggle every day to try and make ends meet, to provide \nfor his or her family.\n  Nearly 75 percent of the tax credits in the Republican plan go to \nfamilies making under $75,000 a year, those hard-working families who \nhave been asked to pay.\n  This is the real crux of the argument: They have been asked to pay \nmore of their income to Federal taxes every year, year after year. Our \nplan does target low-income families with increases in the EITC credit, \nalready giving $24 billion this year, growing to like $30 billion, and \nin the next year, $40 billion plus. So those families are seeing an \nincrease in their earned-income tax credit. They are getting tax relief \nor more money in their pockets.\n  But who is forgotten? The families forgotten are those making between \n$30,000 and $75,000 a year. They are forgotten for the EITC program. \nThey do not get the benefits here. Yet, they are remembered one day of \nthe year--tax day--when they are asked to spend more and more of their \nmoney. I would like to work with the Senator from Louisiana to try and \ndefine ways to shrink the size of the Federal Government, to save \nadditional moneys, to be able to expand even farther the tax credits, \nto give more persons tax relief. But let us not pit one group who are \nasked to pay and pay, and pay more of their income, as well as their \nFICA. Their FICA taxes are also being deducted.\n  Let us give them credits and not pit one against the other. Let us \nnot take money from the taxpayers. Let us work to shrink the size of \nthe Government and give more Americans more of their money back in the \nform of tax credits. I would like to work with the Senator from \nLouisiana in doing that. But I do not support this, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield me 60 seconds? I \ndo not think I have any time left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has used his time. \nThe Senator from New Mexico has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nFirst of all, everybody should know this amendment starts phasing out \nthe child tax care credit at $60,000. The credit that we have in the \nSenate bill, when coupled with the earned-income tax credit, achieves \nthe same goal as the Breaux amendment. It relieves the lower-income \nfolks of the payroll burden. His would be to the contrary. The child \ncredit and EIC is already in excess of the family's Federal payroll \ntaxes. The employee and the employer share for families living at or \nnear the poverty line. A family earning under $12,500, with two \nchildren, and families with earnings under $15,500 will have the same \neffect under our bill. Yet, we will be able to cover more Americans \nbecause we do not stop it at $60,000.\n  So I do not believe we ought to do this. Frankly, I am not a great \nfan of refundable anything because I believe they are rampant with \nfraud. We just got through a situation with EITC, and it is about 25 \npercent fraudulent because we are giving people a check back as a \nrefundable tax credit. Some may be for that. I do not think it is a \nvery good policy. The same thing will happen to this one if we do it \nthis way.\n  Mr. GRAMS. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from Louisiana said \nmore children would be covered. Actually, under his bill, because he \nwould limit the age at 15 and not 17, as in our proposal, 5 million \nchildren between the ages of 16 and 17, whose families' income fall \nbelow $75,000 a year, would not be denied this child tax credit. It \nwould cover fewer children and not more. So I think the whole crux of \nthis plan is to give tax relief for families.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in closing, I do not believe we ought to \nstop a child tax credit at 16 years of age. I have been through this, \nand that is about the time they start to get really expensive. There we \nare stopping it just about at that time, while in our bill we add two \nmore years, which is much better in terms of really helping middle \nincome families when they need it the most.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will vote against the Breaux amendment. \nAlthough I have expressed support for making the $500-per-child tax \ncredit refundable against the FICA tax, this amendment is the wrong way \nto achieve this objective. First, it dramatically limits the $55 credit \nfor many middle-class families. Second, it limits the number of \nchildren who would qualify for the credit.\n  For families earning between $60,000 and $75,000, this amendment \nwould unfairly prevent them from receiving the $500 child tax credit.\n  It is my hope that FICA refundability will be raised during \nconference and that a solution will be adopted which will provide much \nneeded tax relief to all American families.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table that amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think it comes to our side. Senator Bond is next.\n  Mr. EXON. When Senator Bond finishes, I wish to yield the 5 minutes \non our side to the discretion of the Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2975\n\n(Purpose: To increase the health insurance deduction for self-employed \n   individuals and to strike the long-term care insurance provisions)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and eminent leader of \nthe Budget Committee for this time. I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Pryor and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Mr. \n     Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 2975.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1553, beginning with line 13, strike all through \n     page 1588, line 24, and insert:\n\n   Subchapter A--Health Insurance Costs of Self-Employed Individuals\n\n     SEC. 12201. INCREASE IN DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS \n                   OF SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       (a) Increase in Deduction.--Section 162(l) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``30 percent'' in paragraph (1) and \n     inserting ``the applicable percentage'', and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Applicable percentage.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), the applicable percentage shall be determined as \n     follows:\n\n``For taxable years                                   The applicable in\n  beginning in                                           percentage is:\n    1996 and 1997................................................... 60\n    1998 and thereafter..........................................100.''\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n  Mr. BOND. There is a great injustice in our tax law, an injustice \nthat I suspect everyone in this body has addressed at some time or \nanother. That is the inequity in the deductibility of health insurance \ncosts.\n  I do not think I need to tell my colleagues that corporations \nhistorically can deduct 100 percent of the health care insurance \npremium that they pay for employees, and the employees do not have to \ndeclare any of the employer-paid health insurance premiums as income. \nAt the same time, the self- \n\n[[Page S15809]]\n\nemployed farmers, the small business men and women of this country \ncannot deduct more than 30 percent.\n  This body took a great step forward earlier this year when we \nreinstated for last year the 25-percent deduction and increased that to \n30 percent. Frankly, that is not enough.\n  In my role as chairman of the Small Business Committee, I have heard \nfrom small businesses in my State and across the country who are \nconcerned, and greatly concerned, rightfully so, about health care.\n  The occupant of the chair and I know, because we have worked on \nhealth care issues over recent years, one of the biggest problems we \nface are those who are uninsured, because they are limited to a 30-\npercent deduction as self-employed people for health care insurance \npremiums.\n  Under the amendment that I am offering today with Senator Pryor, we \nwill increase the deduction for self-employed to 60 percent next year, \n60 percent the following year, and then in the year 1998, increase that \nto 100 percent. Mr. President, I believe that is the way to achieve \nequity and ensure that more of the self-employed are insured.\n  The offset to this provision--we seek to offset by taking out the new \nprogram for long-term care insurance included in the Finance Committee \nmarkup. I think it is a good idea down the road, or perhaps even before \nwe complete work on this bill, to start providing some incentives for \nlong-term insurance. I think it makes a great deal of sense. I think \nfirst we have to address the basic inequity.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Missouri for \nyielding to me, and I thank the distinguished manager, Senator Exon of \nNebraska, for giving me the opportunity to address this issue.\n  We all know last spring the Congress passed and the President signed \ninto law H.R. 831. This was a bill to restore the 25-percent health \ncare deduction for the self-employed and for the farmers of America. As \nmy colleagues may remember, Mr. President, this deduction had expired \nand the self-employed were receiving absolutely no health care \ndeduction at all for a period of time. It was an absurd position in \nwhich to place small businesses and the family farm.\n  H.R. 831 also increased the deduction for 30 percent for 1995 and for \nall years in the future. It was a very good step, a positive step for \nsmall business and for the family farm.\n  I was proud, by the way, to join Senator Roth and Senator Bond and \nothers in a letter with 73 of our colleagues who promised not to offer \nor support any amendment on the floor. It was a strong statement, but \nwe underscored our recognition of the importance of the health care \ndeduction for the self-employed.\n  Last week when the tax bill came before the Senate Finance Committee, \nI was disappointed that the chairman's markup did not include any \nprogress on the deduction front. I offered an amendment to increase \nthis deduction to 50 percent--from 30 percent to 50 percent. I was \nfurther disappointed when this amendment failed on a party-line vote.\n  I am very proud to join with Senator Bond this evening on the floor \nof the Senate in an amendment to increase the self-employed deduction \nnot to 50 percent, Mr. President, but to 100 percent. There is where it \nshould be, and that is what our amendment does.\n  It is an issue of parity. It is an issue of increasing coverage for \nsmall business and for farmers, for making insurance more affordable. \nIt would move the 30-percent rate to 60 percent in 1996 for deduction. \nIn 1997, it would continue at 60 percent. By 1998, Mr. President, we \nwould have a 100-percent deduction for small businesses, for the self-\nemployed, and for the farm families of America. I think it would do \nmore to basically make insurance more affordable and to provide \ninsurance for many, many more millions of Americans that have labored \nunder a very inequitable situation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArkansas, who has been a champion of this deduction for a long time. It \nis a pleasure to work with him on this amendment.\n  I want to advise my colleagues that we have received strong letters \nof support from a whole host of organizations--agriculture and small \nbusiness, including the Farm Bureau Federation, ABC, Chamber of \nCommerce, H.E.A.L., Association for Self-Employed, Association of Home \nBuilders, Cattlemen's Association, National Restaurant Association, \nNFIB, National Retail Federation, Small Business Legislative Council, \nSociety of American Florists.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Support the Bond/Pryor Amendment\n\n                                                 October 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Small Business, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We, the undersigned organizations, \n     support your and Senator Pryor's amendment to Reconciliation \n     to increase health insurance deductibility for the self-\n     employed.\n       For years, large corporations have been deducting 100 \n     percent of the cost of their health insurance while self-\n     employed business owners like sole proprietors, Subchapter S \n     corporations and partnerships have been limited to 30 \n     percent--which was just increased five percent this year. \n     This is simply unfair and must be changed.\n       We believe that before the Congress authorizes a costly, \n     new deduction for any other kind of health care benefit self-\n     employed small business owners and farmers should get 100 \n     percent health insurance deductibility.\n       Thank you for your leadership on behalf of the self-\n     employed.

For a time, the deduction was 25 \n     percent, but it was a temporary deduction and we found \n     ourselves fighting each year to justify a provision that \n     should not require a constant defense.\n       The prohibition on such deductions is an anachronism from \n     the 1950s, based on an outdated concept of how business \n     entities should be taxed under our system. In the modern day \n     business environment, this policy is simply unfair. Frankly, \n     we believe, if not for the issue of revenue, Congress would \n     have already changed this law.

Kit Bond,\n     Chairman, Senate Small Business Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bond: It is my understanding that you intend \n     to offer an amendment during the budget debate that would \n     raise the health insurance deduction for the self-employed \n     from the current 30 percent level to 100 percent. On behalf \n     of the National Association for the Self-Employed, I \n     completely support your efforts.\n       Raising this deduction level would create tax equity \n     between corporate America and small business. Currently, \n     large businesses can deduct 100 percent of the premiums they \n     pay on behalf of their employees for health insurance \n     coverage. The self-employed can only deduct 30 percent of \n     their costs. And the self-employed who pay for their own \n     insurance are primarily paying with after-tax dollars, \n     effectively making the policies more expensive. A 100-percent \n     deduction would give the self-employed the equity they \n     deserve.\n       Also a 100-percent deduction would enable many self-\n     employed to purchase a health insurance policy, a luxury many \n     cannot currently afford. I believe passing a 100-percent \n     deduction would significantly decrease the number of \n     uninsured individuals in this country.\n       We have polled our 320,000 self-employed members and 100-\n     percent deductibility of health insurance premiums is the No. \n     1 issue of concern to them. Please do not hesitate to call on \n     me. I stand ready to assist your efforts in any way I can.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Bennie L. Thayer,\n     President/CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Small Business Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kit: The U.S. chamber of Commerce Federation of \n     215,000 businesses (96% of whom are small businesses), 3,000 \n     state and local chambers of commerce, 1,200 trade and \n     professional organizations, and 75 American chambers of \n     commerce abroad strongly supports your small business \n     amendment to the Balanced Budget Reconciliation bill. Your \n     amendment would allow the self-employed and small businesses \n     to deduct 100% of their health insurance costs, a benefit \n     currently available only to large corporations.\n       As you know, the Chamber has long maintained that the self-\n     employed and unincorporated small businesses should receive \n     the same tax treatment currently available to corporations. \n     Sound tax policy dictates full deductibility of premium of \n     self-insurance cost as ordinary and necessary business \n     expenses. There is no valid tax policy reason for treating \n     the smallest businesses any differently. It is vitally \n     important to the nation's economic security that the smallest \n     businesses, frequently new and often struggling, should be \n     granted a measure of security equal to that of larger \n     corporations.\n       Once again, the Chamber commends your work on behalf of our \n     nation's small businesses and looks forward to working with \n     you towards resolving this issue. The inability of the \n     nation's smallest businesses to deduct the full cost of their \n     health insurance, and the inequity in being denied an \n     advantage granted to their incorporated fellows, has been a \n     thorn in the side of small business and the self-employed for \n     years. It is time that thorn is removed and equality is \n     restored.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Promotional Products\n\n\n                                    Association International,\n\n                                     Irving, TX, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Promotional Products \n     Association International (PPA), I wish to express our \n     support for your amendment to increase the deduction the \n     self-employed may take for their own health care costs.\n       Under current law, they may deduct only 30 percent of their \n     health care costs, and the current deduction was only \n     recently made permanent. For the millions of sole \n     proprietors, partners, and S Corporation shareholders, \n     including PPA members, this is an unfair penalty with no \n     sound basis in tax policy.\n       The current policy dates back to another era in tax policy, \n     when business entities such as sole proprietorships were \n     viewed upon with great suspicion. Now, decades later, \n     economic and social policy has evolved to the point where we \n     find more and more individuals opting to structure their \n     small business in such a fashion. These small businesses are \n     an increasingly important source of strength in our economy.\n       It is time to give them the same opportunity to deduct \n     their health care costs as any other business.\n       The promotional products industry is the advertising, sales \n     promotion, and motivational medium employing useful articles \n     of merchandise imprinted with an advertiser's name, logo, or \n     message. Our industry sales are over $6 billion and PPA \n     members are manufacturers and distributors of such goods and \n     services.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                H. Ted Olson, MAS,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     National Home\n\n\n                                      Furnishings Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Home \n     Furnishings Association [NHFA], I wish to express our strong \n     support for your amendment to the budget reconciliation bill \n     to increase the deduction the self-employed may take for \n     their own health care costs. It is long overdue.\n\n[[Page S15811]]\n\n       It is unfair to penalize small business owners solely \n     because they elect to do business as a sole proprietorship, \n     partnership, or S Corporation, yet that is what the current \n     tax code does with respect to their own health care costs.\n       As you know, for the first time this year, the self-\n     employed can deduct 30 percent of their health care costs. \n     For many years, they were not allowed to deduct even that \n     much. We all know what health care costs these days, and it \n     is simply unfair to impose such a harsh penalty which does \n     not have any sound tax policy justification to support it.\n       The NHFA represents approximately 2,800 retailers of home \n     furnishings throughout the United States. Thank you for your \n     efforts on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Patricia N. Bowling,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                       World Floor\n\n\n                                         Covering Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the World Floor Covering \n     Association [WFCA], representing floorcovering retailers \n     throughout the United States, I wish to express our strong \n     support for our amendment to the budget reconciliation bill \n     to increase the deduction the self-employed may take for \n     their own health care costs. It is about time this inequity \n     in our tax policy was resolved once and for all.\n  Mr. BOND. Now, Mr. President, I know there are a number of my \ncolleagues who feel very strongly about the long-term care insurance \nprogram. We have had discussions about finding other offsets to this \namendment so that we may be able to start on that long-term care \nprospect. I will be most anxious to work with my colleagues because I \nthink everybody here at one time or another has expressed his or her \nstrong support for the full deductibility of health care.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to modify the \namendment prior to a vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I do not understand what \nthat means.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I could respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You mean, if you find another source of revenue?\n  Mr. BOND. There are minds far brighter than mine and people with far \ngreater access to the intricacies of this measure who are embarking on \na good-faith effort to find offsets to get them scored by the Joint Tax \nCommittee.\n  I sincerely hope we can find a way to accommodate both the long-term \ninsurance and the health care. I believe very strongly that the health \ncare deductibility for self-employed must be done. I would like to be \nable to work with my colleagues who support the long-term insurance \nprogram so that can be accomplished.\n  At this point we do not have an offset. I want to make sure this \nmeasure is before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Dole wants to be recognized in opposition.\n  Mr. DOLE. Only in opposition to the long-term care.\n  I think in this matter, a lot of the debate in the last 2 or 3 days \nhas been long-term care--Medicare, Medicaid. We are trying to get the \nyounger people involved in long-term care so that when they arrive at \ntheir senior years, they will have long-term care through the private \nsector.\n  It is something we have worked on in a bipartisan way in the Finance \nCommittee for years. We finally have it in the bill. We believe it is a \nvery good provision.\n  I do not object to the amendment that is pending. I hope they can \nfind another revenue source. I support what Senator Bond and Senator \nPryor are trying to do. The self-employed should have the same rights \nas everyone else, the same deduction. I hope that if we can find \nanother revenue source--because I really believe the long-term care \namendment, although this is very important, is just as important, or we \nwill be back here in 10, 15, 20 years, somebody will be back here \nwondering why we did not do something to get people interested in \nbuying insurance and getting a deduction.\n  I hope we can resolve it before we have the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we said we had no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we were entitled to 5 minutes in \nopposition, because the other side was in favor. But I am just going to \ntake a minute and say I compliment Senator Bond for what he is trying \nto do. But I, too, hope he will find another offset, because I truly \nbelieve, in the midst of a national debate on Medicare and Medicaid, \nmuch of which is long-term care, we have come to the conclusion that \nthe missing link out there is that not many people have long-term care \nprotection.\n  That is getting to be a bigger and bigger burden of our Government. \nWe are going to be less and less able to do it. That we start, in this \nbill, moving in the direction of letting that happen for people who \nwant to save for themselves and buy insurance and get an appropriate \ncredit, seems to me to be very positive. I hope the Senator from \nMissouri, for whom I have great respect, would agree with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I cannot disagree with a thing my \ndistinguished colleague from New Mexico has said. I had the pleasure of \nmeeting with business men and women in his State. Both of these are \nimportant in his State, my State, and the rest of the country.\n  I do want to make sure this bill has the deductibility phased in, \nfull deductibility for the self-employed and small businesses. We are \nmost anxious to work cooperatively with colleagues on both sides to \naccomplish this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time I had in opposition.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 2 minutes and 9 \nseconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Will Senator Exon like some time?\n  Mr. EXON. I will wait until the Senator finishes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, just for 1 minute. On many occasions we, \nall of us, I assume, have gone to town meetings or wherever and said we \nbelieve the self-employed, small business, farmers of our country need \nto have the same rights and same deductibility, especially in \npurchasing their health care coverage for themselves and their \nemployees. This is exactly what Senator Bond and I are trying to craft \ntonight, that opportunity. I hope we can give that to these individuals \nwho truly create the jobs in America and who really are deserving of \nthis opportunity to participate in the health care system of America.\n  I hope we can work out something and I pledge my best efforts to do \nso.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 1 minute and 15 \nseconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I would like to use that 1 minute, if I might, for a brief \ncolloquy between myself and the chairman of the committee. I think we \ncan jointly announce some good news. I think we are moving quite well \nhere. The amendments I have next, that I think are agreed to on the \nother side--next will be Senator Biden, then Senator Snowe, then \nSenator Dorgan, then Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and then Senator \nKerry of Massachusetts.\n  I am pleased with the way we are cooperating on both sides and the \nfact the Senators are here, prepared to offer their amendments in a \ntimely fashion.\n  Is that the schedule for the next amendments, in that order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I would make sure and confirm on our side that, \nwhen we have done Senator Gramm of Texas, it is my calculation that we \nwill have had 8 of our 10, still leaving us with 2. If that is \neverybody's understanding, then I am perfectly in accord.\n  Mr. EXON. It appears to me that is accurate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for just a moment? I did not \nhear the Senator from Nebraska. What was the order of the next 50 \nminutes, did he say?\n  Mr. EXON. The next amendments, 10 minutes each, equally divided. The \nnext will be Senator Biden followed by Senator Snowe followed by \nSenator Dorgan followed by Senator Phil \n\n[[Page S15812]]\n\nGramm of Texas followed by Senator Kerry of Massachusetts.\n  With that, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Biden, from the State of \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes a motion to \n     commit with instructions.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \nmotion be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n\n                   motion to commit with instructions\n\n       Mr. President, I move to commit the bill S. 1357 to the \n     Committee on Finance with instructions that the Committee on \n     Finance report the bill back to the Senate within 3 days (not \n     to include any day the Senate is not in session) with \n     identical language, except that the Committee on Finance \n     shall include a provision in the bill which would provide tax \n     relief to middle-class American families and which would help \n     middle-class families meet the rapidly rising costs of a \n     higher education by providing a tax deduction of up to \n     $10,000 per year for the costs of a college education for \n     individual taxpayers with adjusted gross income of not more \n     than $90,000 and for married couples with adjusted gross \n     incomes of not more than $120,000. The Committee on Finance \n     should also include a provision which offsets the costs of \n     this proposed tax deduction by restricting the growth of tax \n     expenditures, except for the deductions for mortgage \n     interest, health insurance, state and local taxes, and \n     charitable contributions.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this goal is straightforward. It is simple \nand I think consistent with what I heard everyone over the last 2 years \ntalk about. We all stand before this body, in both parties--I do not \nquestion the motivation of anyone in either party--and we always talk \nabout the need to give immediate relief to middle-class taxpayers. \nAdmittedly, in this bill there is some relief for middle-class \ntaxpayers in the tax portion, and that is the $500 child care tax \ncredit. I would argue--I will not take the time now--the additional \ncost to middle-class families as a consequence of the cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid will offset that, but that is a different question.\n  One of the things we also talk about is the goal and dream of every \nAmerican family, whether it is the richest businessman or poorest \nwelfare mother, and every middle-class family, and that is providing \nfor the education for their children.\n  Frankly, as the Presiding Officer knows, it is getting harder and \nharder for middle-class families--and I mean that in a broad range, \npeople making from $30,000 to $90,000 individually or up to $120,000 as \na family--to be able to afford a college education. I would like to \ntake a look at what is happening here, very quickly, in the limited \namount of time that I have. This is what has happened since 1980.\n  The orange represents the cost of public college tuition. I want to \nmake sure we understand now I am talking about State universities. I am \nnot talking about private universities, whether the Syracuses or the \nHarvards or the Yales or the Georgetowns of the world, which are a \ngreat deal more expensive than the cost of public tuition and fees. And \nI am not even talking about room and board. I am not even talking about \nthat--just college tuition and fees. Since the 1980's the college \ntuition and fees for public universities have increased 236 percent. \nThe median household income in America has gone up 82 percent.\n  If you go back to 1980 you can see how every single, solitary year \nthe gap is widening, in what I do not know anyone would disagree with \nis the ultimate middle-class dream most American families have, like \nthe one my father had, he never went to college: give my son and my \ndaughter a college education.\n  When I went to school, this gap was not so wide. If you take a look \nat what has happened in terms of, again, income for median families, \nmiddle-income families, in 1980, 4.5 percent of median household income \nwas what it cost to send someone to college. Now that is almost \ndoubled, it is 8.4 percent. That is for one child.\n  The bottomline is it is getting incredibly difficult for middle-class \nfamilies, or any family to send their child to college. So the result \nis, in 1980, as I said, it took 4.5 percent of the median household \nincome to pay for tuition and fees. I am not talking, now, about room \nand board. Today it takes 8.4 percent, almost double, just for tuition \nand fees for a public university.\n  Education is one of the best investments we can make in American \nsociety. I have voted for investment tax credit for businesses. I voted \nfor tax credits for them buying machinery and all of those things which \nmake sense in my view.\n  I can think of nothing that makes more sense than encouraging \nAmerican families to invest in a post-high school education for their \nchildren. It seems to me it is about time they should get a break.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, this motion to recommit is simple. It \ninstructs the Finance Committee to include in the budget reconciliation \nbill a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for the costs of a college \neducation.\n  Let me tell you why this is important. In my years of public service, \nI have found that no matter what differences may divide us, there is \nalways one constant thing that unites us. We all have the same dream.\n  Think about it. No matter who you talk to--black or white, rich or \npoor--every American family dreams that their children will go to \ncollege. It was my dad's dream for his children, and it was, and is, my \ndream for my children. It remains the dream of every middle-class \nAmerican family.\n  But, that dream is now at risk. This last summer, a poll was \nconducted of undergraduate students and parents with children in \ncollege. Of those surveyed, 87 percent--nearly 9 out of every 10 \nAmericans--believe that the cost of college is rising so fast that it \nwill soon be out of reach for most Americans.\n  It should be no surprise why the overwhelming majority of Americans \nbelieve that. At the rate we are going, it is true. It is getting \nharder and harder for middle-class Americans to afford a college \neducation.\n  It makes you begin to wonder what exactly the word public means when \nyou say ``public higher education.''\n  A college education is slipping out of reach of middle-class \nAmericans. And, if they still want to fulfill the dream, it means that \nmore and more young people must borrow more and more money to go to \ncollege.\n  One more statistic--and perhaps the one that boggles my mind the \nmost. Of all the money ever borrowed under the Federal Government's \nguaranteed student loan program, 22 percent of it has been borrowed in \nthe last 2 years.\n  Let me say that again. The guaranteed student loan program has been \nwith us for 30 years. And, of all the money borrowed during that time, \nalmost one-fourth of it has been borrowed in just the last 2 years.\n  We are saddling the next generation with enormous debt before their \nadult lives even begin. And, I am not talking about the abstract terms \nof the Federal debt. No, this is saddling the next generation with \nindividual, personal debt.\n  When today's college students walk down the aisle at graduation, they \nare handed not only a diploma, but a big i-o-u. And, for too many, it \nis either that, or no college at all.\n  So, I have a very simple proposition. We should give a tax deduction \nof up to $10,000 per year for the costs of a college education. Under \nmy motion to recommit, this tax deduction would be limited to single \ntaxpayers with incomes under $90,000 and to married couples with \nincomes under $120,000. And, it would be paid for by limiting the \ngrowth--not cutting, just limiting the growth--in tax expenditures.\n  Mr. President, education is one of the best investments we as a \nsociety can make. It is one of the best measurements of future economic \nwell-being. And, it is more important now than ever before. Previous \ngenerations could make a solid middle-class living with only a high \nschool education. No more.\n  In fact, there was an interesting point made in a Wall Street Journal \narticle last week. Working families save primarily by investing in \nhuman capital--that is, education.\n  Yet, when businesses invest in machine capital, they are not taxed. \nMiddle-class families, when they invest in \n\n[[Page S15813]]\n\neducation, are taxed to the hilt. Education is treated as consumption, \nnot investment.\n  And, as a Nobel Prize economist once put it, the tax code treats \nmachines better than it does people.\n  It is time for that to change.\n  From the establishment of the land-grant university system in the \nlate 1800's to the GI bill at the end of World War II to the creation \nof the Pell Grant and Guaranteed Student Loan programs in the 1960s, \nthe Federal Government has been committed to seeing that young people \ndesiring to go to college would not be turned away because of the cost. \nIt was a national goal to see a college education within reach of every \nAmerican.\n  Now, as that goal begins to slip out of reach for many middle-class \nfamilies, it is time to renew our commitment to ensuring access to a \ncollege education for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis proposal.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time if I have any.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I regrettably disagree with my friend \nfrom Delaware. Actually, to pick out two of the many tax expenditures, \nthat is, two mortgage deductions--that is a very large one--and health \ninsurance and freeze all the rest seems to me totally unreasonable. Let \nme just go through a couple.\n  We are freezing pension contributions. That is one of the largest tax \nexpenditures we have, and we think it is fair. Education that employees \nget from their corporations, you would freeze that deduction. The R \ntax credits for American corporations. The one thing they have asked \nfor is that they get to deduct in a special way the research and \ndevelopment costs of their business, something needed to keep them \ncompetitive. Arbitrarily we decide those are all frozen so that we can \nprovide this special tax treatment for those people with children going \nto college.\n  Now, we would like to do that. We would like to do a lot of things, \nbut, frankly, to take the tax code and say all these other provisions \nthat are good for our country, we just decide to freeze them so we can \ndo that, in light of the fact that we have provided significant \nassistance to middle-income Americans--in this bill, there is a credit \nfor student loan interest, a credit for 20 percent of the interest paid \non the student loan during the taxable year if the taxpayer has an \nadjusted gross income of $40,000 to $50,000 as a single taxpayer, \n$60,000 to $75,000 as a couple--it is capped at $500 per year per \nborrower, $1,000 per return--that is pretty fair. With all the other \nthings we are trying to do, it seems to me we ought to in a more \norderly way look at such things as the pension deductions and the \nexpenditures for education that employers give to employees, and many \nother good tax expenditures that are out there right now working for \nAmericans.\n  So at the right time, I will move to table the amendment, but for now \nI yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 53 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know my friend has put a whole flock of \nkids through college, and so I know his commitment to college.\n  Let me just say very briefly my amendment restricts the growth of tax \nexpenditures in those areas. It does not in fact freeze them.\n  No. 2, tell middle-class taxpayers that R is more important for \ncorporations, which I support, than freezing--even if you were to \nfreeze--than it is to be able to send their kid to college. Ask the \naverage middle-class American taxpayer what is a better investment. Who \nis going to do the R if we do not get these kids to college?\n  Lastly, I say to my friend, the $500 cap on student loan interest is \nworthwhile and is necessary but it does not compare to $10,000 that a \nmiddle-class family would be able to deduct. They need help now. They \nneed help now, Mr. President, and this is the most direct and immediate \nway to do it.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think it returns to our side and \nSenator Snowe has an amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. EXON. Before Senator Snowe is recognized, to expedite things, \nwhen Senator Snowe finishes, I yield half of our 5 minutes to the \nSenator from West Virginia, who I understand also supports it.\n  I reserve the other half of the time in case any opposition surfaces.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2976\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the coverage of \n        treatment for breast and prostate cancer under Medicare)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe], for herself, Mr. \n     D'Amato, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Biden, Mr. Mack, Mrs. Hutchison, and \n     Mr. Gramm, proposes an amendment numbered 2976.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 606, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7058. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING COVERAGE FOR TREATMENT \n                   OF BREAST AND PROSTATE CANCER UNDER MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) breast and prostate cancer each strike about 200,000 \n     persons annually, and each claims the lives of over 40,000 \n     annually;\n       (2) medicare covers treatments of breast and prostate \n     cancer including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation \n     therapy;\n       (3) the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA) \n     expanded medicare to cover self-administered chemotherapeutic \n     oral-cancer drugs which have the same active ingredients as \n     drugs previously available in injectable or intravenous form;\n       (4) half of all women with breast cancer, and thousands of \n     men with prostate cancer which has spread beyond the \n     prostate, need hormonal therapy administered through oral \n     cancer drugs which have never been available in injectable or \n     intravenous form; and\n       (5) medicare's failure to cover oral cancer drugs for \n     hormonal therapy makes the covered treatments less effective.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     medicare should not discriminate among breast and prostate \n     cancer victims by providing drug treatment coverage for some \n     but not all such cancers, and that the budget reconciliation \n     conferees should amend medicare to provide coverage for these \n     important cancer drug treatments.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  I am offering this amendment in conjunction with Senators D'Amato, \nShelby, Biden, Mack, Hutchison, and Gramm that expresses the sense-of-\nthe-Senate that the budget reconciliation conferees should amend \nMedicare to provide coverage for certain oral cancer drugs that are of \nenormous benefit to breast and prostate cancer victims. Currently, \nMedicare discriminates among breast and prostate cancer victims by \nproviding certain drug treatment coverage for some but not all such \ncancers.\n  Back in 1993, when Congress expanded Medicare to help pay for the \ndiagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, gaps in coverage were \ninadvertently created which denied coverage for certain oral cancer \ndrugs. This is because in 1993, the Medicare OBRA provisions allowed \nthe coverage of oral cancer drugs that were previously available in \ninjectable or intravenous form.\n  However, half of all women with breast cancer, that is, 50 percent, \nand thousands of men with prostate cancer which has spread beyond the \nprostate, need hormonal therapy that is administered through oral \ncancer drugs that have never been available in injectable or \nintravenous form.\n  Let us consider the potential benefit of covering these oral \nestrogen-based cancer drugs for elderly populations.\n  Breast cancer and prostate cancers are very similar. First, both \ndiseases strike approximately 200,000 Americans per year.\n  Second, both diseases take over 40,000 lives each year. While breast \ncancer affects 1 in 9 women, prostate cancer affects 1 in 11 men every \nyear, and for both diseases the number of reported cases is rising \nrapidly. In fact, the number of reported cases of prostate \n\n[[Page S15814]]\n\ncancer is increasing to an alarming degree, an expected 90 percent \nincrease between 1983 and the year 2000.\n  Finally, these diseases are prevalent among women and men whose age \nmakes them eligible for Medicare.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's preliminary analysis revealed the \ncoverage of the breast cancer portion of this amendment at a savings of \n$156 million over 7 years.\n  So I am asking, Mr. President, that we support this resolution \nbecause I think it is the next logical step in fighting both breast \ncancer and prostate cancer. It does not make sense that we do not \nprovide coverage for the next generation of drug treatment for both \nprostate and breast cancer treatment. It will save money in the long \nrun under Medicare, and it certainly will make it easier to be \nadministered to those patients, especially those who live in rural \nareas because it is an oral type of drug rather than having to be \nadministered in outpatient or in inpatient facilities.\n  In 1991, Congress made a significant investment under the Medicare \nprovisions for breast cancer screening. It only makes sense then to \nprovide this kind of extensive coverage with the new kinds of drugs \nthat are coming on the market that will be reimbursed under the \nMedicare system. By denying coverage for treatment to half the \npopulation of breast cancer patients, we are not taking full advantage \nof the investment that Congress has already made.\n  In 1994 alone, Medicare will have spent an estimated $640 million on \nbreast cancer treatment. Yet, here we find that Medicare will not cover \nsome of the treatments that could be provided for women because they do \nnot reimburse an oral form of drug. In this case, for example, it is \ntamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a new drug on the market for the treatment of \nbreast cancers at certain stages and yet because it was not available \nin intravenous or injectable form it cannot be reimbursed under the \nMedicare system because it is an oral drug. I do not think it makes \nsense. It certainly does not make sense for the future. It does not \nmake sense for the lives and the health of the individuals who are \nvictims of breast or prostate cancer.\n  So I would urge that the Senate go on record in preventing the \nrecurrence of breast and prostate cancer by advocating that Medicare \nreimburse for such coverage.\n  Mr. President, I would ask for the yeas and nays, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include Senator \nCohen, of Maine, as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield 10 seconds to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I wish to thank my \ncolleague from Maine. As an original cosponsor of her amendment, I \nwould like to point out two things very quickly.\n  One, this was an oversight in the first place. It was never intended \nthat this drug should not be covered. And No. 2, it is vitally \nimportant to the health and safety of millions of Americans. I think it \nis a good amendment, and I am glad she is introducing it.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, let me put this in two forms. One is, \nI think this amendment has a virtuous purpose, and I will support it. \nIt is a wish. It is just simply a wish. That is why it is put in the \nform of a sense of the Senate. We are hoping that the reconciliation \nconferees will approve Medicare. I support it. In fact, I worked on \nmatters of this oral use of cancer pills and other things in the past.\n  But I would be very surprised, quite frankly, if we can in Medicare \nbuy a single new aspirin, much less prostate cancer and breast cancer \nremedies, under the $270 billion cut which the underlying bill of the \nmajority contemplates, let alone any more coverage whatsoever for \ncancer. And I think that Senator Snowe understands that, making this, \ntherefore, a sense of the Senate.\n  Keep in mind, please, my colleagues, that we are cutting $270 \nbillion. We were devastating everything from graduate medical education \nto rural hospitals, to premiums, to original research in any area. You \nare going to find a lot of people--in fact, I notice our colleague from \nMassachusetts coming in--you will find a lot of people not going into \nresearch medicine to come up with new cures for prostate cancer or \nbreast cancer because of what is happening to graduate medical \ninstitutions.\n  But all we had to do to get this amendment and to be able to pass \nthis amendment was, in fact, to do what the Democrats wanted to do, \nwhich was simply cut $89 billion from Medicare. But, no, they wanted to \ncut $270 billion in order to be able to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator has used his 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Nebraska controls the time.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield--has the Senator finished? Does the \nSenator need more time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. One minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Medicare, let us face it, has been put on the \nchopping block. These are huge, huge cuts that are going to be made in \nthe next 7 years that our people have absolutely no concept of. And \nhere we are talking about adding on services. I am for that. I am for \nSenator Snowe. She is an excellent Senator, and her sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is excellent and it should be supported.\n  But the division on the one hand of the virtue of that purpose and \nthe utter devastation of Medicare is a very awkward coupling, to say \nthe very least. I hope and pray Medicare can do more for breast cancer, \nfor prostate cancer, but I will guarantee you it cannot so long as we \nare cutting $270 billion out of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, since no others are seeking time, I will be \nglad to yield back our time.\n  Is there any time on this side?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include Senator \nJeffords as a cosponsor of this amendment, and I will yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Has all time been yielded back on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not all time has been yielded back yet.\n  Mr. EXON. May I request all time be yielded back? I yield back our \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator yield back all his?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine yields back. All time \nis yielded back.\n  Mr. EXON. I believe the next order of business would be an amendment \noffered by Senator Dorgan of North Dakota.\n  I yield 5 minutes to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2977\n\n (Purpose: To end deferral for United States shareholders on income of \ncontrolled foreign corporations attributable to property imported into \n                           the United States)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Bumpers, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2977.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 1 of subtitle I of title XII, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 2.

This is a very important amendment. It is one that \nactually has previously been passed by the House of Representatives a \nfew years ago. My amendment simply ends something called ``deferral'' \nfor someone who closes their plant in the United States, moves it to a \ntax haven country, makes the same product and ships it back to the \nUnited States. This is about moving jobs overseas.\n  We have had a circumstance in this country for some while where we \nsay to somebody, ``If you close your manufacturing plant in America, \nmove the jobs overseas, make the same product, ship it back to the \nUnited States, we will give you a tax break. Stay here and you pay \nincome taxes. Move your jobs overseas and do your manufacturing \noverseas, we will give you a tax break.''\n  We have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs during the same time that \nSingapore has experienced a 46-percent increase in manufacturing jobs. \nThat is not a coincidence. We give a tax break for people to ship their \njobs overseas.\n  Let me give you an example of that. Here is a company that I will not \nidentify. I will just tell you it makes pants, a pants company. This \ncompany had 280 of its employees apply for trade adjustment assistance \na few months ago.\n  What does that mean? It means they lost their jobs because of \noverseas competition. The same company, whose employees now have lost \ntheir jobs here in this country, same company, describes with its \nfilings what it does, performs most of its sewing and finishing now \noffshore in order to keep production costs low. It means they have \nmoved their jobs out of this country.\n  Then it says in its financial reports, this same company has \nundistributed retained earnings of $21 million, November 1994. No tax \nhas been paid on them because the management intends to indefinitely \nreinvest them in foreign countries.\n  What does this mean? It means they get a tax break. They would have \npaid $7 million in taxes had they stayed in this country and \nmanufactured. But, no, we say to them, ``If you move your operation \noutside of this country, move your American jobs elsewhere, give the \njobs to foreigners, shut your plant down here and move your jobs \noverseas, we'll give you a tax break.''\n  My legislation is very simple. It says, end the tax break for people \nwho want to move their jobs overseas. End the tax break. It does not \nmake any sense. No one, in my judgment, can honestly defend this kind \nof practice.\n  Use the money that we develop as a result of this amendment to reduce \nthe Federal debt. That is what this amendment is about.\n  This amendment I offer on behalf of myself and Senators Kennedy, \nReid, Feingold, and Bumpers.\n  I have heard a lot of debate about a lot of financial issues, but I \nnever heard anyone in this country who can defend a part of the Tax \nCode that says, ``We will be willing to provide a tax break if you will \nonly close your doors to your manufacturing plant in the U.S.A. and \nship the jobs to some foreign land.''\n  If we cannot end this sort of thing, how can we talk to the American \npeople about good jobs? Sixty percent of the families in this country \nnow have less income than they did 20 years ago. Why? Because good jobs \nare moving overseas. There are a lot of reasons for that, but at least \none of those reasons is we have an insidious, perverse incentive in our \nTax Code to reward those with a tax break who would move their jobs \noverseas.\n  This amendment very simply says, ``Let's at least stop that. Let's \ndecide jobs in this country are important. We want to retain good jobs, \ngood-paying jobs, manufacturing jobs. Let's stop the flight of American \njobs out of America.'' And one way to do that, among many others, is to \ndecide to straighten out the Tax Code.\n  The fact is, President Clinton during the last campaign talked about \nthis issue. We have had people on all sides of the political aisle talk \nabout it. I was helpful in getting this passed through the House of \nRepresentatives in 1987, I believe it was. It subsequently was dropped. \nIt was subsequently dropped in conference. This bill had extensive \nhearings. I held a hearing on this bill in the U.S. Senate. So this \nbill meets the criteria. We understand what this is about. This \namendment makes sense. I hope that this amendment will have the support \nof Members of the \n\n[[Page S15816]]\n\nSenate. This makes good sense for our country.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield such time as he may need to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by Senator Dorgan. In doing so, let me say at the beginning, I \nam not happy with companies that move abroad to a tax haven or cheap \nlabor for the purpose of manufacturing products that are sold back to \nthe United States. None of us can be happy with the export of American \njobs.\n  At the same time it is important to understand that we are in the \nglobal economy and that if we are to provide well-paying, good jobs for \nour people, it is important that we become a vital force in the global \neconomy that is now emerging. The United States must become competitive \nin this global economy.\n  My concern with the Dorgan amendment is that in hearings held before \nthe Finance Committee in the past, Treasury has testified that this \nkind of legislation is very difficult to administer.\n  It has been pointed out, for example, what do you do in the case of a \nplant that sells both to the United States and to other companies \nabroad? Obviously, we want to encourage American business to compete in \nforeign markets, but would that company be entitled to the deferral, or \nhow would you administer it?\n  Let me say that it is my intent, upon the completion of \nreconciliation, to look at a number of these important and complex \ninternational trade questions. We have purposely avoided in this \nreconciliation containing any amendments or provisions dealing with \nforeign trade or international matters. And as I have indicated, one of \nour reasons for taking this approach is that this is a matter of \nextreme complexity, of greatest importance to our economy and the \ncreation of jobs in America. For that reason, we have not, as I said, \nincluded any provisions involving international trade matters in this \nlegislation. For that reason, the Dorgan amendment is not appropriate \nas part of this legislation.\n  Again, let me say that it is my intent as chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over trade, that we will be holding a \nseries of hearings dealing with the kind of problems that are raised by \nthis amendment. But until we have a better idea of how to address this \nproblem so that we do not, in the process of trying to correct one \nproblem of people fleeing abroad to tax havens that sell back here, \nthat we do not hurt those who are going abroad for a legitimate \npurpose, to become competitive in international markets.\n  So, for these reasons, I must respectfully disagree with this \namendment. I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we do not need to study this; we need to \nstop it. Anybody who thinks that a tax break for moving American jobs \noverseas is good for this country probably thinks Elvis is living in a \ntrailer park in St. Louis.\n  Nobody I know believes it is good tax policy to spend $2.2 billion in \nthe next 7 years encouraging companies to shut their doors here and \nmove their jobs overseas. What kind of nonsense is this? If we cannot \nsupport an amendment like this, we ought to turn off the lights and \nlock the door in this place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Michigan has 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. We yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time, I believe the next item in order will be \nthe amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2978\n\n  (Purpose: To provide States additional flexibility in providing for \n                        Medicaid beneficiaries)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2978.\n       On page 767, strike all after ``(2)'' on line 6 through \n     ``(4)'' on line 16.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Texas yield for one \nmoment? After the Senator has made his presentation, I yield 5 minutes \nto Senator Rockefeller in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the whole logic of block granting Medicaid \nso that States could run the Medicaid Program with less money than if \nwe had kept it as an entitlement is a belief that States can run the \nprogram better. In fact, both Democratic and Republican Governors have \ncome to the national capital and said to us: ``If you will let us run \nMedicaid, we will provide better health care and we will do it cheaper \nand we will share the savings with you.''\n  On a bipartisan basis, they have supported our efforts to block grant \nMedicaid to the States, the logic being that States are capable of \nmaking decisions about running Medicaid, the logic being that the \nGovernor and the legislature of the various States love people who \nreceive benefits from Medicaid in their State at least as much as we \ndo. They know those people more intimately than we do, and, obviously, \nthose people are capable of putting them out of office directly, \nwhereas they may not be able to vote against a Senator from another \nState.\n  In the markup in the Finance Committee before I became a member, an \namendment was added that created a new entitlement. This is an \nentitlement imposed upon the States. The entitlement basically says \nthat while we are giving States the ability to run Medicaid, that we \nare going to intervene at the Federal level and mandate that no matter \nhow they structure their programs they have to provide three \nentitlements. Specifically they are told by us that there are three \ngroups of people that they must cover.\n  There are groups that we would not want to cover; there are groups \nthat the States would cover. But every Governor I know is outraged \nabout this provision that mandates a State-mandated program for \npregnant women, for children under the age of 12, and for disabled \nindividuals.\n  The point is this: Not that anyone wants to deny service to pregnant \nwomen or children under 12 or disabled people, but who are we in \nWashington to decide how the States are going to run this program? Is \nit not the ultimate arrogance for Washington to believe that only we \ncare about pregnant women, that only we care about children under 12, \nthat only we care about the disabled, and if we let the uncaring \nGovernors, if we let the uncaring legislators run their program in \ntheir State, they are not going to take care of their own people?\n  I totally and absolutely reject this. This amendment flies in the \nface of everything we are trying to do in Medicare, everything that my \nparty stands for, and I think this Big Brother Washington approach has \nto end.\n  I do not believe we are going to strip this rotten amendment out of \nthis bill, but I want to have a vote on it. The whole logic of the \nMedicaid reform is we are going to let the local leaders who know their \npeople best and who care the most make the decisions. The idea that we \nare creating a new entitlement and we are imposing it on the States, \nand now in a new provision we are going to, in essence, let people go \ninto Federal court and sue the States on these issues, I think that \nclearly is a retreat from what we promised the States when we gave them \nless money to let them run the program, and I reserve whatever seconds \nmay remain on my time.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment should absolutely be \n\n[[Page S15817]]\n\ndefeated on both sides. It has this wonderful kind of a kind-hearted \ntitle to it. It talks about ``flexibility.'' The purpose is, of course, \nto get rid of all of this. If the Senator wants to have a vote on \ngetting rid of Medicaid or getting rid of care for pregnant women, for \nchildren under the age of 12, or the disabled, why does he not suggest \nthat?\n  We have been through this so many times before. ``Let the States \ndecide what being disabled means.'' So then you have 50 different ideas \nof what a disabled person is, and it is complete chaos. I really do \nbelieve this is a country which has not given up on the idea that if a \nchild is sick, no matter what its family's income is, that the child \nshould get care. If a poor person is ill, or needs a test because \nsomething is desperately wrong and nobody knows what it is, America is \nthe kind of country where you should be able to get that test without \nworrying about something called ``flexibility.''\n  I believe that health care is about giving people the opportunity to \ngrow up to be what they really want to be. Health care is an enormous \npart of that. This Senator, in what appears to be a ``kind'' amendment, \nbut what is really, in the judgment of this Senator, a very mean-\nspirited amendment, would just get as far away from doing anything for \npregnant women and children and the disabled as the Senator possibly \ncould. It is an amendment which should be absolutely crushed.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas says this is a new \nentitlement. Let us look at what the present law is. The present law \nmandates that, in every State of the Nation, the State must provide \nMedicaid coverage for every child 5 and under up to 133 percent of \npoverty, and for those over the age of 5, it is up to age 12 and lower, \nto 100 percent of poverty; and that increases it by a year each year so \nthat by 2002, every child up to the age of 18 will be mandated \ncoverage. So this is no new entitlement.\n  Second, the Senator from Texas says, ``What arrogance for us to say \nto these States they must cover children up through the age of 12, 100 \npercent of poverty and below. What right have we to levy such a mandate \non the States?'' What he fails to mention is that we are sending the \nStates $800 billion over the next 7 years--not million, but billion, \nwith a ``b.''\n  When you send out money like that to the States, it seems to me you \nare entitled to ask for something. What do we ask for? We say they must \ncover poor children, 100 percent of poverty, up through the age of 12. \nDo we say what kinds of coverage, what the health care package is? No. \nIt could be the most modest package. Indeed, one aspirin a year could \nbe the health care package.\n  So to say this is arrogance, when we demand that the States cover \nthis little group, come on now. I thought this was being offered with a \nsense of humor, but I see the Senator is serious about this.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope this amendment is resoundingly defeated \nbecause we have to stand for something around this place. When we send \nout $800 billion, we are entitled to ask for something on behalf of the \nStates' poor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 23 seconds. \nThe Senator from Texas has 48 seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to conclude the debate.\n  Mr. President, we are reducing funding for the existing Medicaid \nProgram by $187 billion. The Governors agreed to this reduction. But on \none basic part of the agreement, they asked that if we were going to \nreduce funding that we let them run their program, which they are \nfunding in conjunction with us.\n  Now what is happening is the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from Rhode Island are saying, OK, we are giving you less money, \nbut we are going to tell you how you have to run this program. As for \nthis talk of ``getting rid of Medicaid''--nobody is talking about \ngetting rid of Medicaid. And ``mean spirited''--I flatly reject the \nnotion that the Senator from West Virginia loves the children in Texas \nor Rhode Island more than the Governor of Texas and the Governor of \nRhode Island loves the children in their own States.\n  The tide of history is moving against the ``Washington knows best'' \npolicies advanced by the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, and this provision may stick today, but its days are \nnumbered. We have to stop telling the States how to run programs in \ntheir own jurisdiction, based on our own arrogance that only we know \nbest and only we care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I believe, under the agreement, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry is next. I yield to him 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2979\n\n            (Purpose: To increase the Federal minimum wage)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 2979.\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC.  . MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       ``(1) The federal minimum wage has not been raised since \n     1991; and\n       ``(2) The value of the minimum wage, after being adjusted \n     for the bite of inflation, is at its second lowest annual \n     level since 1955, with purchasing power 26 percent below its \n     average level during the 1970s and 35 percent below its peak \n     value in 1968, and unless it is increased it will in 1996 \n     have its lowest value in over 40 years; and\n       ``(3) The value of the minimum wage as a percentage of the \n     average nonsupervisory wage averaged 52.2 percent during the \n     decade of the 1960s, 45.8 percent during the decade of the \n     1970s, 40.4 percent during the decade of the 1980s, and \n     currently is 37.7 percent; and\n       ``(4) The minimum wage earned by a full-time worker over a \n     year fails to provide sufficient income for a family of three \n     to provide that family a standard of living even reaching the \n     national poverty level, and, in fact, provides an income that \n     equals only 70 percent of the federal poverty level for a \n     family of three; and\n       ``(5) There are 4.7 million Americans who usually work \n     full-time but who are, nevertheless, in poverty, and 4.2 \n     million families live in poverty despite having one or more \n     members in the labor force for at least half the year: and\n       ``(6) Nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults, \n     and 60 percent are women; and\n       ``(7) The decline in the value of the minimum wage since \n     1979 has contributed to Americans' growing income disparity \n     and to the fact that 97 percent of the growth in household \n     income has accrued to the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans \n     during this period; and\n       ``(8) The effects of the minimum wage are not felt only \n     among the lowest income workers and families but also are \n     felt in many middle-income families; and\n       ``(9) The preponderance of evidence from economic studies \n     of the effects of increases in federal and state minimum \n     wages (including studies of state minimum wage increases in \n     California and New Jersey) at the end of the 1980s and in the \n     early 1990s suggests that the negative employment effects of \n     such increases were slight to nonexistent; and\n       ``(10) Legislation to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an \n     hour was introduced on February 14, 1995, but has not been \n     debated by the Senate--\n       ``Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Senate should debate and vote on whether to raise the minimum \n     wage before the end of the first session of the 104th \n     Congress.''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 3 minutes, Mr. President. I emphasize that \nthis is a sense of the Senate, No. 1; and, No. 2, it does not set a \nspecific figure at this time, though many of us would like to.\n  It simply says that the Senate will go on record as being prepared to \ndebate and vote on the raising of the minimum wage, which was \nintroduced last February, that we will vote on it before the end of \nthis first session.\n  Why is that important, Mr. President? Well, from 1979 until 1995, 79 \npercent of the increase in household income in America has gone to the \ntop 20 percent--the 20 percent wealthiest Americans. The minimum wage \nwhich, during the 1960's, was at about 52 percent of the nonsupervisory \nwage, and during the 1970's was at about 45 percent, and during the \n1980's was at about 40 percent, is today at 37 percent of the \nnonsupervisory wage.\n  That means, Mr. President, that for those two-thirds of the people on \nthe \n\n[[Page S15818]]\n\nminimum wage who are adults--60 percent women--they are working at 70 \npercent of poverty level in this country today--70 percent of poverty \nlevel. Now, the whole theory of this country for years was based on the \nnotion that we would value work, and if people went to work they would \nbe able to break out of poverty. During the 1960's and 1970's, we \nrespected that by keeping the minimum wage commensurate with the \npoverty level.\n  But ever since 1991, where we only caught up to a small percentage of \nthe decrease of the prior 9 years, when there was no increase, we have \nhad another 13 percent decline in the value of the purchasing power of \nthe wage. So the wage, today, has a 26-percent purchasing power of what \nit had previously, and it is about to be at a 40-year low. In over 40 \nyears, by 1996, if we do not change the minimum wage, it will never \nhave been so low.\n  Mr. President, if you are going to be pro-family, if you are going to \nbe pro-work, if you are going to be pro-community, you have to respect \nthe notion that somebody ought to be able to take home a decent wage \nfor an hour's work and for a week's work. The fact is, Mr. President, \nthat under the current constraints, it is impossible for people to be \nable to do that, and we must go on record as really being pro-family, \nin an effort to try help them. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my colleague in urging the \nSenate to accept the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Members can wonder \nwhy this is appropriate. Included in the legislation is the earned \nincome tax credit, which is a program to try to provide some relief for \nthe working poor. That program helps to provide assistance, \nparticularly with heads of households who have children.\n  The minimum wage is for those families that do not have many \nchildren. The minimum wage provides the greatest advantage for the \nsingle heads of household.\n  This amendment is prochildren because 70 percent of those that work \nfull-time have children in their families. This amendment is for women, \nworking women, because 60 percent of all minimum wage earners are \nworking women.\n  This is for full-time workers, Mr. President. Sixty-six percent of \nall minimum wage recipients are full-time workers.\n  Once again, if we care about children, if we care about working \nwomen, if we care about making work pay in America, we will support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes \nremaining and the Senator from Massachusetts has \\1/2\\ minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. The minimum wage worker today will earn $8,500 for full-\ntime work. The poverty line is $12,500. Every economist, conservatives \nand liberals alike--at Harvard, and Friedman, say you have to have a \ncombination of the earned income tax credit and the minimum wage to \ntruly permit people to break out of poverty.\n  We can do this, as every study shows, without losing jobs--in fact, \nas New Jersey showed, creating further employment.\n  I hope my colleagues will go on record as being willing simply to \ndebate and vote on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator from New Mexico in his typical gracious \nand wonderful way be willing to give me 15 seconds?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As the evening passes, I am getting less and less \ngracious.\n  I ask Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, did he mention a great \neconomist from the University of Chicago in his wrap-up?\n  Mr. KERRY. I did not mean to. I meant to mention the one from \nHarvard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It was not Friedman from Chicago?\n  Mr. KERRY. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Because he does not think this works at all. He thinks \nthis makes for more people--I do not have any time left and we will get \non with a vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. There are 101 economists and 3 Nobel laureates, and 7 past \npresidents of the Economic Association who endorse this increase.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2980\n\n           (Purpose: To make technical amendments to title V)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President I have an amendment on behalf of the \nEnergy Committee, for Senator Murkowski, the chairman, and Senator \nJohnston, the ranking member. It is a technical amendment that will \ncorrect the reconciliation statute that the Energy Committee passed. I \nbelieve it is acceptable.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. \n     Murkowski, for himself, and Mr. Johnston proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2980.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (1) On page 304, line 20, delete ``follows:'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``follows (except that all amounts in excess of \n     $20,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 and all amounts in fiscal \n     year 2004 shall not be available for obligation until fiscal \n     year 2006):''.\n       (2) On page 361, line 7, delete ``thereafter,'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``thereafter, except for fiscal years 2003 \n     and 2004,''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Am I correct, I say to the whip, is this acceptable?\n  Mr. FORD. I do not know. I have not seen it. Apparently, the Budget \nCommittee ranking member is willing to accept it.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection. I agree to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it appropriate under the unanimous consent that we \nadopt this amendment, or must we hold it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is a unanimous consent agreement to \nadopt the amendment, that may be done.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we should keep it going. It is the ninth \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will put it in the sequence in this particular \nposition.\n  Mr. EXON. According to my list we have Senator Kennedy next.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have one amendment remaining.\n  I want to state to the distinguished ranking member, Senator Exon, \nthe majority leader requests that we do some of your amendments, giving \nus additional time. They are not yet finished in terms of drafting. It \nmust be one with at least 5 minutes on a side.\n  Could you proceed to the Kennedy-Wellstone-Pryor and reserve our one \nremaining?\n  Mr. EXON. That sounds reasonable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we come in perhaps after 30 minutes and are ready, \nwe could intervene.\n  Mr. EXON. I see nothing wrong with that. We can move on to the \nKennedy amendment, the next amendment on my list. I yield 5 minutes to \nSenator Kennedy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2981\n\n   (Purpose: To strike the provision allowing the transfer of excess \n                            pension assets)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of myself and \nthe Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mrs. Kassebaum, proposes an amendment numbered 2981.\n       Strike section 12807.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, this proposal allows corporations to remove money from \npension plans and use it for nonretirement purposes. That particular \nproposal is included in the Republican measure that is now before the \nU.S. Senate.\n  The Republican budget, therefore, hits older Americans not once but \ntwice. The Medicare cuts are an outrage and so is the raid on workers' \npensions. No one can claim they are saving \n\n[[Page S15819]]\n\nthe pension system. The pension system is not broken. We have no right \nto give away $20 billion of pension funds that do not belong to us and \ndo not belong to the Federal Government.\n  The $20 billion that the Republican budget gives away belongs to \nworkers and retirees who have given up wages to have that money \ncontributed to their pensions. The bill is an invitation to corporate \nraiders and greedy executives to loot the pension plans of their \nworkers and retirees.\n  What looks like overfunding today can be underfunding tomorrow. The \nSenator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, put it well several years ago \nwhen she said, ``If stocks and bonds drop in value, as they will at \nsome point, these surpluses could evaporate like the morning mist.''\n  The history of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation over the past \n20 years makes it clear that today's well-funded company can become \ntomorrow's massive pension bankruptcy.\n  Congress should be worried about plan underfunding, not how to give \naway surplus assets that have been built up for retirees. The danger of \nunderfunded plans is what Congress ought to be addressing.\n  We passed the Pension Protection Act last year to strengthen pension \nfunding. It makes no sense to turn around a year later and weaken \npension funds in a way that puts both retirees and taxpayers at risk.\n  This issue presents a stark choice about who we represent here in the \nSenate. Which side are we on? Are we on the side of the workers and \nretirees who struggle to find some economic security in their old age? \nOr on the side of the wheeler dealers, corporate raiders, and the super \nrich? I want the Senators to say no to this raid on retirees and defeat \nthis unconscionable attack on the pension funds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments this \nafternoon to discuss a provision in the reconciliation package that has \nattracted relatively little attention to this point.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the House reconciliation bill includes \na measure designed to generate approximately $10 billion in tax revenue \nby doing away with penalties Congress imposed in 1990 on pension fund \nwithdrawals. The House proposal generally allows companies to take \nmoney from pension plans that are more than 125 percent funded and use \nthose funds for any purpose, without informing their workers.\n  In response to a wave of corporate takeovers and pension raids in the \n1980's, Congress in 1990 imposed an 50-percent excise tax on pension \nfund reversions, except in limited circumstances. The idea was to make \nit costly for companies to take assets from their pension plans. And, \nin fact, the raids on assets ceased almost entirely. Before this \nchange, however, about $20 billion was siphoned from pension funds in \njust a few years, many pension plans were terminated, and thousands of \nworkers saw their pensions replaced by risky annuities that provided \nlower benefits.\n  The reconciliation package before us includes a pension reversion \nmeasure that is similar to the House proposal. Under the Senate bill, \nexcess pension assets could be wihdrawn--with little or no penalty--to \nfund active and retiree health benefits, underfunded pension plans, \ndisability benefits, child care, and educational assistance plans.\n  Mr. President, this represents a significant change in pension \npolicy.\n  I understand that there are approximately 22,000 pension plans \ncovering 11 million workers and 2 million retirees that have assets in \nexcess of 125 percent of current liability, and that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimates that the pension reversion provisions \ncontained in both the House and Senate bills could result in the \nremoval of tens of billions of dollars in assets from these plans.\n  Therefore, while the Senate proposal clearly is more limited than the \nHouse proposal, I nevertheless must oppose it. I understand there will \nbe an amendment to strike this provision that will be offered by the \nranking member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nSenator Kennedy. I want to make clear to my colleagues that I intend to \nsupport that amendment.\n  The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, which I chair, \nshares jurisdiction over the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n[ERISA] with the Committee on Finance. In the past, the Labor Committee \nhas taken an active role in pension security and pension reversion \nissues. In fact, the provision reported by the Finance Committee \ncontains modification to title I of ERISA, which clearly fall within \nthe Labor Committee's jurisdiction.\n  Yet the Labor Committee did not consider the pension provisions \ncontained in the legislation before us. And neither the Finance \nCommittee nor the Labor Committee has held hearings to consider \nmodifications of this nature in the pension reversion area.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the Senate proposal clearly is more limited \nthan the House proposal. I also believe that there may be valid reasons \nto revisit the pension reversion penalties that were imposed in 1990.\n  However, given the actions that led to the imposition of the excise \ntax, I strongly believe that any modifications in this area should be \ngiven full consideration by the committees of jurisdiction and that we \nshould weigh heavily the genuine possibility of adverse consequences to \nplan participants, the Federal pension insurance program, and the \nnational savings rate that may result from a change in pension policy \nof this magnitude.\n  Therefore, I intend to support the Kennedy amendment and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In an earlier debate I mentioned this is legislation \nfilled with risk. We have now identified another one of those areas of \nrisk. Have we forgotten so soon? It was just a matter of a few years \nago when we were having pension plans across America fail because they \nwere underfunded.\n  In many cases, they failed because they had been used by corporate \nraiders as a means of financing mergers and acquisitions which then \ndestroyed the jobs of the very people for whom the pension fund was \nintended to protect.\n  I cannot believe in 1995 we are about to not only make it easier but, \nI am going to suggest, positively encourage this type of behavior. Why \nwould we encourage this behavior? If a chief financial officer of a \ncorporation failed to take advantage of this program, he or she ought \nto be fired for corporate malfeasance.\n  Here is what we are about to do. We allow a corporation in profitable \nyears to overfund their pension, to put in more than is required in \norder to meet that year's annual pension amount. Then, when the \ncorporation in a business cycle has a not-so-good year, we are allowing \nthem to reach in and withdraw those funds.\n  What is the significance to the U.S. Treasury? They take a full \ndeduction when they put the money in the pension. They pay no taxes \nwhen they take it out, because they had planned to take it out in a \nyear in which they owe no taxes.\n  This is an outrage, Mr. President. It is a disgrace that it is part \nof this legislation. It has no part in a bill which is intended to \nbalance the budget, to balance the budget of the Federal Government off \nthe security and hard work of working men and women who depend on these \nfunds for their well-being, and to turn it over to corporate raiders.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Republicans' revenue recommendations \ncontain a slew of tax breaks for businesses that do not belong in a \ndeficit reduction bill. One of the most egregious of these special tax \nbreaks is a provision on corporate pension transfers that would allow \nemployers to take billions of dollars in excess assets from pension \nplans to the extent of their costs for other employee benefits--such as \nhealth care for active employees--without paying the current-law excise \ntax. The proposal opens the door for up to $47 billion to be removed \nfrom the pension system, thereby endangering workers' retirement \nsecurity and increasing the risk to the Pension \n\n[[Page S15820]]\n\nBenefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] and U.S. taxpayers.\n  The Republicans have included this provision among a small group of \nso-called corporate welfare reforms that raise revenue through \nrestrictions on tax rules under which the affected companies currently \noperate. The pension transfer proposal, however, is hardly a reform; \nrather, it is a conspicuous corporate welfare program of its own. The \nproposal merely frees workers' pension funds to be used for general \ncorporate purposes, such as executive bonuses or extra shareholder \ndividends.\n  Earlier this year, the Finance Committee devoted several weeks to \nhearings on how to increase our Nation's savings rate. We found that \nthe savings rate is terribly low, and that the high rate of consumption \nwas hurting the economy. Yet, the Finance Committee has now recommended \nto the Senate a provision that both weakens the retirement security of \nemployees and removes assets from a key source of savings--employees' \npension funds.\n  Despite Republican assertions to the contrary, the proposal poses a \nserious threat to the security of the affected pension plans. First, \nthe pension transfer proposal generally would measure excess assets \nusing a standard that is easily manipulated and thus, I believe, \ninappropriate for this purpose. Under the provision, a pension plan \nwould be considered to have excess assets, eligible to be withdrawn, to \nthe extent its assets exceed 125 percent of the plan's current \nliability. Under this standard, the employer is free to use a range of \ninterest rate and mortality assumptions, and need not account for the \neffect of early retirement or contingent events such as plant \nshutdowns. Thus, an employer can choose favorable actuarial assumptions \nto minimize the plan's liabilities and maximize the excess assets it is \nentitled to withdraw from the retirement plan under the proposal. \nConsequently, the cushion provided by the proposal cannot ensure that \nadequate funds remain to fulfill the amount of the employees' accrued \nbenefits.\n  The laxity of this standard is demonstrated in PBGC's analysis of \nseveral large plans. PBGC's analysis of 10 large plans revealed that a \ntransfer in accordance with the provision in the bill could leave those \nplans with less than 90 percent of the funds needed to pay benefits on \ntermination. PBGC would be expected to pay the difference, up to the \nguaranteed level.\n  Moreover, the current liability standard is highly susceptible to \nshifts in the stock or bond market. The stock market is currently at an \nall-time high; any subsequent drop in the market could have a \nsignificant adverse effect on a plan's asset values, thereby causing a \nplan that currently has excess assets under the proposal to become \nunderfunded. Thus, a more substantial cushion is necessary than that \nprovided by the proposal to protect against future market shifts.\n\n  The Republicans note that the standard used in this proposal is the \nsame standard enacted for pension transfers for retiree health benefits \nin the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act [GATT]. However, the two \nprovisions are vastly different in scope. The potential transfers \nallowable under this proposal would dwarf the amount of transfers \nallowable for use in meeting retiree health costs under GATT. Care was \nalso taken in GATT--unlike in the Republican proposal--to create a \nprotective firewall that is, a maintenance of effort requirement. Thus, \nthe proposal will increase considerably the risk of loss to the PBGC.\n  Finally, by exempting employers from the current law excise tax, the \nproposal encourages employers to use pension plans as tax-sheltered \ncorporate piggy banks. Under current law, if an employer terminates its \nplan and takes a reversion, an excise tax of 50 percent of the \nreversion applies. One purpose of the excise tax is to recapture the \ntax benefit the employer enjoys from earnings that have grown tax-free \non the contributions to the pension plan. In 1990, GAO found that an \nexcise tax of between 17 percent and 59 percent was necessary--\ndepending on the plan population and the underlying investments--for \nthe Federal Government to recapture the tax benefit to employers when \nassets in a pension plan are withdrawn by the employer. In addition, \nthe proposal removes the deterrent effect of the excise tax on plan \nterminations: An employer can first take the excess assets and \nsubsequently terminate the plan, thus avoiding the excise tax because \nthere would be no additional assets left to revert to the employer as a \nresult of the termination.\n  Yet, employers under the committee's proposal are exempted from the \nexcise tax, and are merely required to include the amount taken into \nincome. Any company with a net operating loss carryover can offset the \nincome from the pension transfer with its accumulated net operating \nlosses. Thus, the tax paid by employers on a reversion under this \nproposal could be zero. Moreover, under this proposal, an employer can \neasily terminate its plan after draining it of excess assets, thus \navoiding the termination excise tax altogether.\n  Senate Republicans argue that the use of the pension transfers under \nthe proposal is restricted to meeting the costs of other qualified \nemployee benefits--primarily health benefits for active employees. Make \nno mistake: This requirement is merely cosmetic. The proposal allows \nemployees' pensions to be siphoned off for general corporate use. \nNearly all employers who would take advantage of this proposal already \nprovide health benefits to their employees. Thus, using these excess \nassets for existing health benefits merely frees up funds they would \nhave spent anyway, to be used in turn for executive bonuses, extra \nshareholder dividends, or the like.\n  In light of all these defects, I believe the proposal is \nfundamentally flawed as a matter of retirement and tax policy, and \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts has \\1/2\\ minute remaining.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield our 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Mr. Roth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, excess pension assets do not belong to \nemployees. The reason for this is that under a defined benefit pension \nplan, the employer promises to pay an employee a fixed monthly \nretirement benefit. Under current law, after these benefits are fully \nfunded the employer can take out excess assets upon plan termination.\n  Excess pension asset transfers will not reduce or jeopardize workers' \npensions. Only the most overfunded pension plans will be allowed to \ntransfer excess pension assets. According to a former chief actuary of \nthe PBGC, only 1 percent of plans covered by the PBGC terminate in a \ngiven year without sufficient assets. And after the passage of the \nstringent funding rules in last year's GATT legislation, it is \nreasonable to expect the incidence of plan failures will decrease in \nthe future.\n  The proposal also contained several provisions designed to guard \nagainst plan underfunding. First, employers are required to keep a \nsubstantial cushion of excess pension assets in the plan. And I point \nout this is the same measure that President Clinton proposed for \nretiree health transfers in the Retirement Protection Act of 1994.\n  The other side has attacked this proposal. But is it not interesting \nthat their own President proposed the same measure that is contained in \nthe legislation before us tonight.\n  The minimum cushion is 125 percent of plan liabilities, and in many \ncases the cushion is as high as 150 percent of plan liability. In fact, \na national actuary firm prepared a study that concluded that more than \n70 percent of the overfunded plans will be subject to a cushion greater \nthan 125 percent of plan liability. At these funding levels, the \npension plan will always be at the full funding limit.\n  In fact, plans at the full funding limit are not permitted to make \nnew contributions to the pension plan. Plan trustees are required to \nuse a plan asset valuation method that results in the largest asset \ncushion. And, to guard against fluctuations in interest rates and stock \nmarket values, the proposal requires plan trustees to use January 1, \n1995, or the most recent valuation date before the transfer, whichever \nresults in the largest asset cushion.\n  Employers must use the excess assets to fund ERISA-protected employee \n\n\n[[Page S15821]]\n\nbenefit plans that cover a broad group of employees. That is a most \nimportant point that must and should be understood. Employers can only \ntake out the excess assets to fund other ERISA-protected employee \nbenefits that cover a broad group of employees. That is just common \nsense. And the plans that can be funded with excess assets are limited \nto--and let me spell them out--other retirement plans of the employer, \nincluding underfunded retirement plans; active and retiree health \nplans; child care; disability; and educational assistance.\n  This is a good plan, and, for that reason, I must oppose amendment of \nSenator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the final 30 seconds to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Jeffords, \nMoynihan, Bingaman, Exon, Wellstone, Simon, and Graham be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in vigorous support of removing \nthese provisions in this bill because we are dealing here with a very \nserious problem of pension plans. This will result in tens of billions \nof dollars being withdrawn from employee pension plans at a time when \nwe are in absolute need of improving our pension capacity. It is done \nwithout any hearings. It is a matter that is within the jurisdiction of \nour committee. We would want desperately to make sure that what things \nare done are done correctly and appropriately.\n  I vigorously oppose the provisions that are in the bill and support \nthe strike amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REPEAL OF EXPENSING OF INTANGIBLE DRILLING COSTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) this legislation, as reported by the Senate Committee \n     on the Budget on October 23, 1995, significantly reduces \n     funding for medicare and medicaid, student loans, food \n     stamps, and other federal efforts critical to working \n     families across the country, in order to pay for tax breaks \n     to benefit primarily wealthy corporations and others;\n       (2) this legislation will significantly increase the tax \n     burden on an estimated 17 million working families, by \n     modifying the earned income tax credit, which has enjoyed \n     longstanding bipartisan support;\n       (3) the Congressional Joint Tax Committee has estimated \n     that tax expenditures cost the United States Treasury over \n     $420 billion annually, and they estimate that amount will \n     grow by $60 billion to over $480 billion annually by 1999;\n       (4) Congress should reduce the federal budget deficit in a \n     way that is responsible, and that requires shared sacrifice \n     by eliminating many of the special interest tax breaks and \n     loopholes that have been embedded in the tax code for \n     decades, making the tax system fairer, flatter and simpler;\n       (5) eliminating special interest tax breaks would enable \n     Congress to do real tax reform, making the system fairer and \n     more simple by flattening the current tax rate structure and \n     eventually providing real tax relief for working families;\n       (6) the savings generated by eliminating these special tax \n     breaks immediately can be used to reduce the deficit.\n       (b) Elimination of Deduction for Certain Intangible \n     Drilling and Development Costs.--Section 263 (relating to \n     capital expenditures) is amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end of subsection (c) the following \n     new sentence: ``This subsection shall not apply to costs paid \n     or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.'', and\n       (2) by striking subsection (i).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to costs paid or incurred in taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 1995.\n       (d) Revenue Lock Box.--\n       (1) Amount of deficit reduction.--Effective in 1996 and not \n     later than November 15 of each year, the Director of OMB \n     shall estimate the amount of revenues resulting from the \n     enactment of this section in the fiscal year beginning in the \n     year of the estimate and notify the President and Congress of \n     the amount.\n       (2) Reduction of deficit.--On November 20 of each year, the \n     President shall direct the Secretary of the Treasury to pay \n     an amount equal to the amount determined pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) to retire debt obligations of the United \n     States.\n       On page 1550, beginning with line 13, strike chapter 3 of \n     subtitle B of title XII, and insert:\n\n     SEC. 12161.

Mr. President, this amendment scales back corporate \nwelfare in the Tax Code by eliminating several loopholes, including the \ndeduction for intangible drilling and development costs for oil, gas, \nand geothermal wells, the corporate minimum tax provisions, the foreign \nearned income exclusion, and section 936, the possession tax credit. It \nlocks all of the savings away to be used for deficit reduction--and \nonly for this purpose.\n  The savings from these amendments, all to go for deficit reduction, \nrange between $60 and $70 billion, depending on \n\n[[Page S15822]]\n\nwhose estimates you use. I do not have time to go through each of these \ncorporate welfare provisions, but let me simply say that over and over \nand over again this week we have been talking about basic fairness, and \nthat closing these loopholes is an attempt to make the Tax Code fairer.\n  I will tell you right now, as people in the country look at this \ndeficit reduction bill, they know that it is based upon the path of \nleast political resistance. They know that it is disproportionately \nworking families and middle-income people and low- and moderate-income \npeople who have been targeted.\n  Mr. President, I do not know one citizen in Minnesota, or in any of \nour States, if the truth be told, who would not agree with the \nproposition that we ought to close some of these loopholes. And by \nclosing some of these loopholes, with these benefits going primarily to \nlarge companies that do not need the benefits, that have not been asked \nto tighten their belts, instead of allowing these to continue we would \nhave more money to slash the deficit further, to invest in law \nenforcement, in education, in children, in health care, in \ntransportation, in child care, in child nutrition programs.\n  It is a matter of priorities. Donald Barlett and James Steele won a \nPulitzer for their book here, ``America: What Went Wrong?'' They are \ntwo really fine investigative reporters for the Philadelphia Inquirer. \nAnd in the section of the book ``America: Who really Pays the Taxes?'' \nthey have an interesting paragraph:\n\n       For over 30 years, Members of Congress and Presidents, \n     Democrats and Republicans alike, have enacted one tax after \n     another to create two separate and distinct systems, one for \n     the rich and powerful called the privileged person's tax law, \n     and another for everyone else called the common person's tax \n     law.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment will move us back toward a Tax Code \nthat treats people fairly. It is time for some basic fairness, and that \nis the meaning of this amendment.\n  I reserve the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it sounds good to talk about getting rid \nof depreciation and intangible drilling costs for the oil and gas \nindustry in the United States until you understand that most of these \ngo to independent producers, those who really find the diminishing \nsupply of both oil and gas in America. These are not exceptional \ndepreciation allowances. They are not some gift. They are absolutely \nnecessary unless we want to make a decision that America's own oil and \ngas production should disappear and we should not have any.\n  We are importing oil now, about half of our needs, and that is \ngrowing. And speak of losing jobs and losing growth. This industry that \nwe would now try to take away the last, the last thing they have that \nmight give them a chance to survive, succeed, employ people and produce \noil, has already lost 250,000 jobs since the oil slump began.\n  We fought Desert Storm, and make no bones about it, because oil is \nprecious to the United States, because it is a commodity without which \nour American economy for now and the foreseeable future cannot work.\n  Now, why would we come to the floor in a balanced budget activity and \ndecide that we are going to take away what will keep the little \nindustry we have left for producing oil and gas and the men and women \nwho work in it, produce it and make a living? To me, it seems \nabsolutely absurd. It seems kind of like backward economics to go out \nthere and pluck this industry, perhaps because there is none in some \nStates, or perhaps people think when oil and gas is mentioned it is \nExxon or that it is Mobil--nothing wrong with them, but obviously in \nthe United States, the principal people working and producing oil and \ngas are independent producers. They are finding most of the new oil. \nThey are operating most of the rigs out there now. And I might just \nsay, at this particular time we have the lowest rig count since we \nstarted keeping records. That means that even with these allowances we \nare hardly keeping pace with producing any new oil in America's oil \npatch.\n  Now, Mr. President, Senator Nickles wants to speak about a minute or \nso on this, and if the Senator would permit me, I will reserve the \nremainder of my time and let the Senator complete his with the hope \nthat Senator Nickles will arrive.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just take a minute and then wait \nto respond later, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, we have on the part of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle a proposal for exporting more \noil now from the North Alaska slopes, at the very time we are saying we \nare worried about our own supply. That is already contained in this \nbill.\n  Second, this is typical of what happens when we try to scale back \ncorporate welfare and close tax loopholes. Every time you take on a \npowerful interest like this as opposed to regular people, opponents \nclaim that the sky is going to fall in. It is not true that this change \nwould spell the demise of the oil and gas industry. Just like other \nindustries and other businesses, they should be made to capitalize \ntheir costs, to write off their costs over a longer period of time--the \nlife of the asset. This is a special exemption, just for one industry. \nThat is what is going on here. And this is why people do not trust this \nprocess. Every time it is a powerful interest whose benefits are under \nfire, we hear all sorts of reasons why they cannot be asked to tighten \ntheir belts. But, boy, when it comes to Medicare, when it comes to \neducation, when it comes to children, belt-tightening is all the rage. \nThis amendment basically says, let us have a standard when it comes to \nsome deficit reduction. Let us have standard of fairness.\n  I will reserve the rest of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I regret to tell my friend, Senator Wellstone, that \naverage people use oil. Without oil for America, average people suffer. \nMedicare suffers. Hospitals close.\n  Does anyone recall when we were in the small embargo situation with \nIran and the cars were piled up at our gasoline stations? They were \neven shooting each other in the excitement of trying to get up there \nand see if they could get some gasoline in their cars.\n  All the gasoline comes from oil. Why should we stop producing oil in \nthe United States, take away the tax deductions that are legitimate \nthat they have? They are just as legitimate as everybody else's \ndeduction. They are not a gratuity or a gift. So it might be nice to \nsay, let us take out after this industry, but it is amazing when this \nindustry does not produce the very people who Senator Wellstone is so \nworried about are the ones who suffer because everybody suffers. Our \nstandard of living suffers. Inflation goes rampant. And I do not want \nto take that chance.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator has 1 minute, 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take 30 seconds on this.\n  I remind my colleague that altogether this particular exemption is \nonly about $2.5 billion over the next 5 years. This is a whole package, \nworth tens of billions, that says, let us close these tax loopholes. \nPeople in the country want us to.\n  Second, Mr. President, in all due respect to my good friend from New \nMexico, this is exactly the line we so often hear: the sky is falling \nin. No one is talking about eliminating the oil industry. Nobody is \ntalking about not having oil business. We are just saying, how about \nclosing these tax loopholes so that when companies do not pay and----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 30 seconds have expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thought the Chair said I had 1 minute, 45 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry. The Chair thought the Senator \nmeant to notify him when 30 seconds expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry. Let me finish very briefly and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Other people pay more.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S15823]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time is on the other side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute to Senator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Nickles has 1 minute and 5 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. I just heard about it. I understand he says, well, we want \nto take away this advantage, IDC. Really, what my colleague is saying \nis, you should not be able to deduct ordinary out-of-pocket, \nnonrecoverable business expenses. That is ludicrous. It should not \nhappen. He happens to be wrong on that issue.\n  I think I heard my colleague say that he wanted to eliminate the 936 \nbenefit that goes towards Puerto Rico. We do that in this bill. We do \nit in the bill over 7 years and over 6 years. There are two different \nways you count that benefit. We phase it out over 6 or 7 years. I think \nit is a responsible provision. I guess he wants to do it immediately, \nbut you have a lot of firms that have made investments. I think that \nwould be very inappropriate.\n  My colleague may call it corporate welfare, but again I think this \ncommittee has taken some very responsible action in allowing people to \ndeduct their out-of-pocket, nonrecoverable business expenses as should \nbe allowed and phasing out the tax benefit that was directed towards \nPuerto Rico.\n  So I would urge the Senate to oppose my colleague's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, facts are stubborn things. It is a fact \nthat IDC's are a special exemption. With my amendment, you could still \nin this industry capitalize your costs, depreciate them over a longer \nperiod of time, just like with most other industries.\n  This is just a special exemption that most other businesses do not \nget. We have been talking about the tax rate in Puerto Rico. In 1993, I \nwanted to phase it out, even though I was sympathetic to concerns that \ndoing so suddenly would be unfair. That didn't happen. And now, we have \n7 to 10 more years provided for in this bill. My amendment says that by \n1997 we have to eliminate it.\n  My amendment says, colleagues, that we have to make tough choices. \nBarlett and Steele have it right. What do you have? One person's tax \ncode is called the ``privileged person's tax law,'' and for everyone \nelse, call it the ``common person's tax law.'' It is time we \nunderstand: regular people pay more because these loopholes allow often \nvery profitable companies--some of the largest and most powerful \ncompanies in the country--are paying less.\n  This is revenue that the Government does not collect. We ought to \nhave deficit reduction here. This is between $60 billion to $70 billion \nof deficit reduction based on a standard of fairness. We would have \nmore for education, more for children, more for health care, more for \nlaw enforcement.\n  This is a perfect example of whether or not we will be willing to \nvote for people we represent or whether or not we are too beholden to \npowerful special interests. That is what this amendment speaks to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of my prepared statements on each \nof the four loopholes, elaborating on my policy rationale for closing \nthem, be included in the Record before the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, is all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the good news is that according to my \nrecord--and I believe my colleague will agree--we have three amendments \nleft in this tier 2 category: Pryor, Conrad and Roth, in that order.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Finance Committee--Roth. We have been calling it \n``Finance Committee.'' Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Pryor, Conrad, Roth--Finance Committee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would the Senator from Nebraska yield for a moment, a \nsplit second?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold be \nincluded as an original cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I now recognize Senator Pryor from Arkansas for his \namendment and yield him the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I yield myself 5 minutes and have an exchange \nwith the Senator, a conversation that our leader asked me to have, if \nthe Senator would?\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have 17 amendments that are completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has no time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am informed the Senator from New Mexico has \nno time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Where is the time, all on the Democrat side?\n  Could the Senator yield me 4 minutes to engage in this conversation?\n  Mr. EXON. I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, Senator Dole has suggested, since \nwe have 17 amendments to vote on now, we would like to vote on them \ntonight--that will put us well beyond 12 o'clock, and we will vote on \nthem all--that we put over two amendments until morning, and that be \nthe Pryor amendment and what the Senator has heretofore called the Roth \namendment. And we would not change anything about those amendments in \nterms of votes--5 minutes of debate, and everything else--but they \nwould be two that we would not lay down tonight.\n  We would go ahead and put Conrad's in, if you would like, and that \nwould leave two amendments for tomorrow. And then we could use this \nevening to see what the remaining lists of amendments are. We have 2 \nhours or 3 hours that we are going to be down here. The Senator's side \nand ours could put together the list which would follow after the end \nof our second tier, which is the goal. The Roth----\n  Mr. EXON. I would have to check on it. Could we put in a brief quorum \ncall and see if--this surprises me. I do not know whether there is \nobjection to it or not.\n  I know Senator Pryor is ready to go. Could we put in a quorum call \nfor a few minutes?\n  Mr. FORD. Would the Senator yield for one moment? We have another \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. You talked about the Pryor amendment. We have the Simon-\nConrad amendment that is also mentioned. The Senator says take that one \ntonight and have Pryor tomorrow?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I called it Conrad. I am sorry.\n  Mr. FORD. I do not believe Senator Pryor is going to be willing to \nmove his away from tonight.\n  Mr. EXON. Wait a minute. How many amendments? We have Pryor, Conrad, \nRoth. Is it Conrad-Simon? All right. We have three amendments; right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We call it Conrad; he calls it Simon.\n  Mr. EXON. All right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One wears a bow tie.\n  Mr. EXON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand they have two amendments on \ntheir side. We will hold our Roth amendment until morning. So we will \nproceed with theirs at this point.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  I now recognize Senator Pryor, as I did previously, and have awarded \nhim the 5 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Chair for \nrecognizing me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2983\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the continuation of requirements for nursing \n                  facilities in the Medicaid Program)\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, in this 2,000-page piece of legislation, \nthe \n\n[[Page S15824]]\n\nbudget reconciliation bill of 1995, we would think that just about \neverything under the sun would have been thought of and included in \nthis to consume some 2,000 pages.\n  But what we did not include in this reconciliation bill is something \nvery, very vital, Mr. President, because those are the nursing home \nstandards that we have had enacted since 1987, and if we fail to \nreenact those same nursing home standards on the Federal level, we will \nbe failing to protect a very, very fragile and vulnerable asset, which \nis the elderly population of this country, some 2 million now residing \nin these American nursing homes.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk. I send it to the \ndesk on behalf of myself and Senator Cohen of Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I have several cosponsors. I will not read all of those at \nthis time. It will consume too much time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for himself, Mr. \n     Cohen, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Simon, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Kohl proposes an amendment numbered 2983.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 889, line 21, strike all through page \n     897, line 19, and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2137. QUALITY ASSURANCE STANDARDS FOR NURSING \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       ``The provisions of section 1919, as in effect on the day \n     before the date of the enactment of this title, shall apply \n     to nursing facilities which furnish services under the State \n     plan.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, since we enacted OBRA 1987, we have seen a \ndramatic change in the care of the nursing home patients in our \ncountry. For example, we have seen a 38 percent decline in the number \nof physical restraints. Since the enactment of the OBRA 1987 nursing \nhome regulations, which was, I might say, a bipartisan effort--the late \nJohn Heinz, former Senator Durenberger, former Senator George Mitchell, \nformer Senator Jack Danforth from Missouri--we have seen a dramatic \nadvance in all of the things that make the quality of care in nursing \nhomes better; for example, in resident outcomes, a 50 percent increase \nin the number of dehydration cases that we have solved, and no longer \ndo we find many of these patients dehydrated.\n  We see also just a characteristic of the nursing home population, Mr. \nPresident. And how are we going to afford to look them in the eye and \nsay that we failed to adopt any Federal standards in the budget \nreconciliation bill and we are going to say to the 77 percent of those \nwho need help dressing, to the 63 percent who need help in toileting, \nthe 91 percent who need help bathing, ``We are sorry, you can just make \nit on your own. We are doing away with all Federal standards. We are \ngoing to leave it to the States''?\n  But, Mr. President, the reason we have Federal standards today as a \nresult of OBRA 87 is because the States were not meeting their \nobligation and their challenge.\n  Mr. President, I know that there are two or three of my colleagues \nwho want to speak. I know that Senator Rockefeller wants 30 seconds. I \nyield 30 seconds to Senator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Senator from \nArkansas. If there was a sense upon my colleagues of nervousness just \nbefore Senator Pryor offered his amendment--there was a lot of \nhuddling--in the sense of what was going to happen, my colleagues \nnoticed correctly. I think that there was an effort to try and not have \na vote on this tonight, because this is one of the most important \namendments that we will vote on in this entire, somewhat bizarre \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment. I point out that the arguments \nagainst this amendment are going to be that we ought to let the States \nhave unbridled responsibility, discretion as to how to set these \nstandards.\n  I should point out that in the year 2002 in my State, which has the \nhighest percentage of persons over 80 in the country, that we are going \nto have 35 percent less funds than is currently projected to meet the \nneeds of our elderly, our frail elderly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If there is any prescription for abuse, it is a 35-\npercent cut in funds and no Federal standards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Without \nobjection, the Senator's request is granted.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I yield 20 seconds to the Senator from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my father was in a nursing home for 3 \nyears. He had Alzheimer's. We could go and visit him and make sure he \nwas OK. But one of the things we need to know is when people are in a \nnursing home, they are often too sick to care for themselves or they \nare too sick to say how they are being cared for. If we do not have \nFederal standards around safety and staffing to be sure that our--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am looking for Senator Cohen, our \ncosponsor on the other side. I do not see him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If Senator Mikulski needs an additional 20 seconds, I will \nbe glad to yield to her.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the idea of safety is absolutely \ncrucial, that we need adequate staff, but we need to have those \nstandards so that if anyone is too sick to say how they are being cared \nfor, we know that we are preventing their abuse, we know that they are \nreceiving the right medication, we know that they are being adequately \ncared for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nhas 10 seconds left.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to conclude by thanking the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen, for not only being a \ncosponsor, but also having labored for many years in this particular \nfield. He supports strongly this amendment. I also would like--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I also would like to acknowledge Senator \nBoxer of California who has truly spoken on many occasions and feels \ncompassionate about this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Chafee is going to explain where \nwe are. Let me just suggest, at Senator Cohen's suggestion, Senator \nChafee, and others, the so-called Finance Committee amendment, which \nyou are going to have an evening to look at, will have everything in it \nSenator Cohen wants and even further improvements than the one before \nus. So I do not want anyone to think we have done that after we defeat \nyour amendment tonight, because it is in there and you all will see it \nwhen we get it circulated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for \nhis efforts in connection with the nursing home standards and, indeed, \nhe and I have worked together in the Finance Committee. I voted with \nhim in connection with his amendment, which was defeated 10 to 10.\n  Since then, in conjunction with Senator Cohen and others on this \nside, we have prevailed upon what you might call the managers of the \nbill to put in a very good Federal nursing home standard provision. As \nregards nursing homes, there are two provisions in here that I think \nare superior to the provision that Senator Pryor has, although I am not \nintimately familiar with everything that he has.\n  One, in the provision that we have, we remove the costly and \nduplicative requirement that standards perform so-called preadmission \nscreening and annual resident review, which is known by the acronym of \nPASARR, and that \n\n[[Page S15825]]\n\nwould not be included and it is my understanding that this is a rather \ngood provision.\n  Second, we have a proposal that if the States have tighter inspection \nrequirements than the Federal, then the States can apply to the \nSecretary of HHS for a waiver and have those tighter provisions \nincluded as the inspection requirements or the standard requirements \nfor the nursing homes within that State.\n  You might say, ``Well, how do they go about enforcing it?'' We have a \nprovision that it can be enforced by HCFA. So we think that this has a \nlot of provisions in it that have merit.\n  I urge those on the other side to take a look at this provision that \nis in the so-called managers amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still not quiet in the Chamber. The \nSenator is entitled to be heard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Quickly, because it is on my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I agree with what you just said. I would like to be able \nto compare the specifics of what is going to be offered with what \nSenator Pryor and others have offered. When will we have that \nopportunity?\n  Mr. DOLE. I can respond. I think that language is ready now. I think \nwe are working on some other language, but that language is ready. That \nis why we wanted to wait until the morning so we can compare that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The difficulty is we are going to get this sometime in \nthe morning and then be expected to vote on it. We are going to vote on \nthis amendment tonight; correct?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I think the suggestion was to put the vote off until the \nmorning and to give you a chance to look at this particular provision.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The vote on Senator Pryor's amendment off until tomorrow?\n  Mr. DOLE. Both.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Both; we ask for both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises Senators to please go \nthrough the Chair so we keep some control.\n  Who seeks time? There is 1 minute 28 seconds left.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate that we have addressed this \nconcern, and I think as Senator Chafee pointed out, if we really want \nto find the best provision, we ought to compare the two. We may not \nvote on the Pryor amendment tonight. I will decide how many amendments \nwe vote on this evening. So we will have an opportunity to look at the \nlanguage in both.\n  If you are looking for a political vote, we can have the political \nvote, but if you are looking for the best provision--it was worked out \nwith Senator Cohen, Senator Snowe, Senator Chafee, and others on this \nside of the aisle. We think it is a pretty good provision. So I hope if \nwe are interested in getting the best provision in the bill, we will do \nas Senator Domenici suggested: Wait until morning, have a vote, find \nout which is the superior provision, and then vote accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair apologizes. The Chair did not ask \nthe Senator from Rhode Island if he would yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Do I still have control of the time?\n  I would have been delighted to have yielded that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I again apologize and give back 20 seconds.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Was there another question, or does that satisfy \neveryone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 18 seconds left to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask Senator Cohen if he wants to say \nanything?\n  Mr. COHEN. I believe I will get 2 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time left on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes off the bill to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, let me specifically address the issue \nwhether or not this is a political effort on the part of my colleague \nand friend from Arkansas, Senator Pryor.\n  We had a hearing this morning dealing with nursing home standards. I \nwant to say, for the benefit of all who are here, I have been working \nwith Senator Dole, Senator Chafee, Senator Snowe, and others, to try to \nmake sure that the standards that were set in place by OBRA 1987 go \nback into place, that we have Federal standards and Federal enforcement \nof the nursing home rights, as such. Senator Dole has been most \namenable to that.\n\n  I think Senator Chafee is correct that we have actually made some \nimprovements in cutting back on some of the things that do not need to \nbe there, that are costing money and are duplicative. One issue \nremaining in my mind is, in fact, the extension of the waiver, so-\ncalled, to the States that have higher standards than required by \nFederal law. The concern I have is that if such standards are so high \nthat they therefore would apply for a waiver, what in fact would be the \nrole of the Federal Government as far as oversight and enforcement? If \nthere will be strict oversight and enforcement, I would recommend we \nsupport the bill that we offered as part of the managers' bill. If, \nhowever, that is a major loophole that would be seen as such by those \nin the business itself--the nursing home industry, providers and \nconsumers--I would have problems supporting the substitute contained in \nthe managers' bill. I have not seen the language.\n  I think Senator Dole is correct. We ought to put this off until \ntomorrow so we can compare the language. If we are satisfied there will \nbe adequate oversight and enforcement authority retained by the Federal \nGovernment, I would recommend to my colleague from Arkansas that we \naccept the managers' bill.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If my friend from Maine will yield, Mr. President, let me \nremind my colleagues that in the managers' amendment to be offered by \nSenator Roth tomorrow, the nursing home provision is only a very, very \nsmall part of it. There is going to be, as I understand it, a change in \nthe Medicaid formula, also encompassed in the managers' amendment. This \nis only a small section of it.\n  I think we should go ahead according to schedule. We have all been \nhere all day, playing by the rules. Let us vote for the Pryor amendment \nand the Pryor-Cohen amendment tonight, and if we need to change it \ntomorrow, we can, and we can look at it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. All time \non the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we are down to the final amendment, as I \nunderstand it, we will be debating tonight. Therefore, I yield the 5 \nminutes on our side to Senator Simon for his distribution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2984\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], for himself and Mr. \n     Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered 2984.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is the amendment you have read about \nin the Washington Post when it says a ``Good Budget Compromise.'' This \nis the amendment the New York Times has editorialized about. This says \nbalance the budget, number one. And we have a comprehensive program to \ndo that. Number two, we eliminate the tax cut. \n\n[[Page S15826]]\n\nSenator Specter said, ``If you would have a secret vote, 20 Republican \nSenators would not vote for the tax cut.''\n  To say we are going to balance the budget, and then start with a tax \ncut, is like having a New Year's resolution to diet and start with a \ngreat big dessert.\n  Third, we take the CPI and reduce it by one-half of 1 percent. At the \nFinance Committee meeting, Senator Dole said, in talking about looking \nat the CPI, ``This is something we should have addressed years ago.'' \nThis is still below what the special economist said should be a drop of \nbetween 0.7 to 2 points.\n  Third, we help the less fortunate in our society. Instead of a \nsavings of $270 billion in Medicare, it is $168 billion. Instead of \n$187 billion in Medicaid, it is $83 billion. Welfare reform--there is \n$36 billion more for poor people. Discretionary spending, $79 billion \nmore. Veterans programs are assisted. Agriculture programs are \nassisted. Student loan programs are helped.\n  This is a balanced program that makes sense and it balances the \nbudget in a prudent way. I hope we can move in this direction.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Illinois. This is an amendment \nfor those who disagree with cutting taxes by $245 billion at the very \ntime we are adding $1.8 trillion to the national debt. This is the \namendment for those who are concerned that the Medicare and Medicaid \ncuts are too severe. This is the amendment for those who oppose cuts in \neducation. This is the amendment for those who want welfare to be work-\noriented but protect the children. This is the amendment for those who \nare concerned about the raid on rural America contained in the \nunderlying bill. This is the amendment for those who recognize that CPI \noverstates the cost of living. The advisory commission to the Finance \nCommittee said it is overstated by .7 to 2.0. That means adding $600 \nbillion to the national debt over the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this amendment to \nfairly balance the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have on the amendment, and how much \ntime do they have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes; the \nminority has 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me remind Senators of a couple of \nthings. First of all, the Consumer Price Index provides $115 billion of \nthe money needed to balance their budget. In addition, Medicare is \ngetting cut, or hit, or reformed $168 billion. So we are doing both \nMedicare and CPI. And then, third, and equally as important, the fiscal \ndividend that is not supposed to be there until you are in balance--\nthat is how we thought it worked, that you get to balance and you get a \nfiscal dividend--they take the $170 billion fiscal dividend, before in \nbalance, and put it in their balanced budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair cannot hear the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased that the Chair is concerned, and I thank \nhim. I want to close by saying that I really do not believe this is the \nkind of budget we want to adopt here tonight. I think if anybody had a \nreal chance to look through it and go into detail, they would agree \nwith the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I want to go through the three. You get $115 billion by changing the \nCPI by .5. I was wondering a little while ago--my friends on the \nDemocrat side were concerned because we had not given them our \namendments. Most are one page. We just got this one now, in case \nanybody wonders, which is all right. I am not complaining. It is just \nthat we do not know very much about it. These few little facts are \nabout the best I can do.\n  Mr. FORD. Now you know how we feel when we have 2,000 pages.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think you got those pursuant to the rules. They were \nbefore you all. This was presented right here, tonight, to us. I do not \nwant to take any more time. I will yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield 50 seconds to my colleague from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nIllinois. I will not make a full statement at this time. I will put one \nin the Record. Suffice it to say--I say this to my good friends on the \nother side of the aisle--this is where we ought to be going. This is a \ntough, fair, principled budget that reflects the kind of distribution \nthat we ought to be looking toward if we are going to come up with a \nreasonable solution to the fiscal challenges that are facing the \ncountry today, and it does it without a $245 billion tax cut that we \nsimply cannot afford and should not be giving under the circumstances.\n  I am pleased to join my fiscally responsible colleagues in offering \nan alternative that I think meets the test that this country is looking \nfor us to meet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  In terms of the fiscal dividends that Senator Domenici is talking \nabout, we balance the budget also, so we have the same savings on \ninterest.\n  In terms of the size of this--and I recognize this is not going to \npass tonight--but I think this may be the basis for a compromise that \nwe may move toward. I think there is a lot of common sense in this.\n  In terms of the CPI, it is less than was recommended to the Finance \nCommittee by the economic experts, and what it means for a person who \nis in the median on Social Security getting $770, it would be a \nreduction of $3.85 for which that person gets more help on Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  I think seniors would welcome this proposal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yielded back my time, but I ask unanimous consent to \nretrieve 1 minute of it to yield to Senator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I \njoin him in opposition to this amendment.\n  Although I compliment the sponsors of the amendment for saying we \nshould use an accurate CPI, they do not go as far as that that was \nproposed by a group of economists that said we should use from 0.7 \npercent even and maybe above 1 percent. Whatever the percent is, it \nshould be accurate, and most estimates are that 0.5 percent, which \nwould save something like $115 billion, is on the low side. So I \ncompliment them for doing that.\n  I rise in opposition to their proposal because they want to spend \n$245 billion more so we do not tax more. I would like to give taxpayers \na break for $245 billion and reduce spending to pay for it. That is the \ndifference between the two.\n  I compliment them for a very significant element of this package and \nhope that ultimately we will use accurate CPI reflection in all of our \ncost-of-living adjustments.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand, all the amendments have \nbeen offered that will be offered this evening in tier 2. The committee \namendment will be offered tomorrow morning.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the votes scheduled to begin now be \nlimited to 8 minutes after the first rollcall vote, with 1 minute for \nexplanation between each vote to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me persuade my colleagues we will have about 18 votes \nhere. If we all stay in the Chamber we will probably save 20 or 30 \nminutes. There are not many places to go at 9:30 at night around here. \nThey can watch the ball game right off the floor. Hopefully, we will \naccommodate one another by being here.\n  The first vote will be the normal 15 minutes plus 5 to give people \ntime to come back from wherever they want to come back from.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the request include 1 minute before the \nfirst vote?\n  Mr. DOLE. One minute before each vote equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  We will start tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, and we hope to have 7\\1/\n2\\-minute votes after the first vote, so we ask all Senators to remain \nin the Chamber--not overnight but be back here.\n\n[[Page S15827]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Exon would join in \nrequesting from his side what I request for our side.\n  We still have a third tier, which are all the amendments that will \nnot get debated. We would like to use the evening now while we are here \nvoting to have you get as many together so we know, maybe tonight or \nearly morning, how many you have. And we have some. Perhaps we can give \nthe Senators an idea, then, by midmorning on how many there are.\n  Mr. EXON. I advise my colleague we have been working on that. We were \ntalking about it a few minutes ago in the Cloakroom. We do not have a \ndefinitive number. We have made major reductions generally in the area \nthat we have been indicating to you in our series of negotiations about \nwhere we think we will end up. I do not know that I can give a specific \nnumber tonight. I will explore that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first amendment is numbered 2964 by \nSenator McCain and others; 1 minute, equally divided. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on this amendment? \nDoes the Senator from Nebraska yield back the 30 seconds?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Did we order the yeas and nays on all the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection for all the yeas and \nnays to be ordered at one time?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered on all amendments that have been \ndebated so far.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2964\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll on amendment No. \n2964.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.

Ladies and gentlemen, the next amendment is \namendment 2965 by Mr. Helms, 1 minute equally divided.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 minute equally divided on this \namendment prior to the vote.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from North Carolina.\n  This is going to be a long night unless we can get quiet after these \nvotes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think this is one of few times when both \nsides are in favor of an amendment. It is to protect the right of \nsenior citizens to choose their own doctors if they wish.\n  I think the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. Domenici, has a \nclarification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to say for the Republicans, there is a \ntechnical error on the explanation. This amendment has been modified so \nthat the language in our Whip Notice--it says, ``if you don't comply, \nthey are not eligible for Medicare reimbursement''--is out of this. It \nis not in this amendment. I think the amendment deserves to be adopted.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this amendment pretends that the \nRepublican budget's destructive plan for Medicare will preserve the \nsenior citizen's ability to get their care through fee for service and \ncontinue to see his or her own doctor.\n  Now, it is fine to pretend, so vote for the amendment. It is all \nright. It is not going to do any harm. Make no mistake. There is no \nguarantee of anything in the Helms amendment for seniors and their \nfuture ability to see their own doctor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on every \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, this will be an 8-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is an 8-minute vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. This is the test. If we all stay here, we may finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2969 offered by the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown]. The yeas and \nnays are ordered.\n  There will be 1 minute equally divided on the question.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE. The time is running.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is running. Who wants to claim the 30 \nseconds on each side?\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] is \nrecognized for 26 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWN. The measure that is before the Senate takes a 1993 \nlimitation on business' ability to deduct salaries in excess of $1 \nmillion and applies it, not to just publicly traded corporations to \nwhich it applies to now, it applies it to nonpublicly traded \norganizations and other business. It is a fairness question. It is \ngrandfathered for any existing contracts, but I might say the money \nthat is raised goes to reduce the Social Security earnings penalty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield back our 30 seconds.\n\n[[Page S15828]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me observe that, out of the three votes, \nwe have had two unanimous votes. Maybe some could be done by voice \nvote. It would save some time. Otherwise, we are going to stay on the \neight-minute schedule, and I urge my colleagues to stay on the \npremises.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2970\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 2970.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is the fraud, waste, and \nabuse amendment. It saves $600 million, by CBO's estimate, more than \nthe underlying amendment. This is a culmination of 5 years of hearings.\n  All of the things in this amendment were recommended by the Inspector \nGeneral's office and by GAO. It saves more than $600 million. In sum, \nall I can tell you is what this does. It says that when the Veterans \nAdministration pays 4 cents for a bandage and Medicare pays 86 cents, \nsomething is wrong. Let us pay the same thing as the Veterans \nAdministration. That is what this amendment does.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Cohen.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the anti-fraud provision in the Finance \nCommittee measure has been the product of over 3 years of effort on my \npart. I have had to work with Justice, FBI, the White House, providers, \nconsumers, and they support the provision as written.\n  In addition to that, there is a deletion under my bill which would \nallow the criminal fines imposed under the violation to go back into \nthe Medicare trust fund. That is deleted under the Senator's amendment.\n  I urge that we reject this amendment for a variety of reasons but, \nmost of all, because it would make a last-minute change over something \nthat is accepted by virtually everybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane to \nthe provisions of the reconciliation bill pursuant to section \n305(b)(2). I raise a point of order against the pending amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the ayes are 43, the nays are 56. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is rejected. The \npoint of order is well taken and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2971\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next amendment is amendment No. 2971. \nThere are 30 seconds on each side for debate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment removes about $60 billion \nworth of corporate pork over a period of 7 years. It has bipartisan \nsupport.\n  For the information of my colleagues, it does not include the auction \nof public safety spectrum. Obviously, that would be exempt from the \nauction of spectrum.\n  Mr. President, I understand the point of order may be lodged against \nthis amendment. It makes no sense to lodge a point of order against an \namendment that would reduce spending, which is what this legislation is \nsupposed to be all about.\n  Mr. EXON. The pending amendment would add two new matters to the bill \nand violate the prohibition of nongermane amendments. I raise a point \nof order that the pending amendment is therefore not germane and thus \nviolates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to waive the point of order and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in this \namendment by Senators Conrad and Frist.

Point of order. The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will please come to order. Those Senators in front of the \nChair, please take your conversations to the cloakroom.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Do I start my 30 seconds over?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, I will start. This amendment adopts the same \ndefinition of ``disabled'' as we used in the welfare bill which we \npassed 87-12. It does not include substance abuses. That is a mistake \nin the little chit that was circulated here. These individuals are at \n75 percent of the poverty level or less. They cannot get health \ninsurance. This safety net is essential to them if they are going to \nstay in the community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, two excellent Senators are offering \nthis amendment and trying to protect the basic Medicaid coverage for \nthe very poorest, very oldest and disabled Americans.\n  I hope everybody will vote for it. But, again, you cannot turn a frog \ninto a prince. The underlying bill would require 200 such amendments to \nmake it agreeable. I hope people will support this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we not get to speak against it, since both sides \nwere for it? There was no opposition.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would ask unanimous consent to proceed for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. This is another infringement on the Governors. We are going \nto turn over these programs, make them entitlements, and give them \nblock grants, and make it impossible for Democrats or Republicans to \nadminister the program.\n  We had this argument. We discussed it long and hard with the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island. I hope we would defeat this amendment. If you do not \nhave any faith in your Governor, then vote the other way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

INCREASE IN DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS \n                   OF SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       (a) Increase in Deduction.--Section 162(1) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``30 percent'' in paragraph (1) and \n     inserting ``55 percent''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, when I raised the question of deductibility \nof health insurance, I said we were looking for another offset. I have \nbeen able to work with the managers and the majority leader. They have \nenabled us to eliminate the offsets which would have taken out the \nlong-term care insurance, and we are able to raise the deductibility \nfor self-employed individuals and small business people from 30 to 55 \npercent. I believe that this is something we can work with in \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have already been ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am the cosponsor on this side of the Bond \namendment. I strongly support this amendment. We hoped, originally, \nthat we would be able to permit the self-employed to deduct 100 percent \nof their insurance premiums, and this looks like they are going to take \nabout 55 percent. This is the best we could do, but it is better than \nin the past.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can I ask what the offset is?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the time has expired.\n  Mr. DOLE. We did not need an offset. We found another area where they \noverestimated or underestimated, or whatever it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I thank the Chair.\n  First of all, I would like to say that this amendment is cosponsored \nby Senators D'Amato, Shelby, Biden, Mack, Murkowski, Hutchison, Gramm, \nCohen, and Jeffords.\n  This amendment is a sense of the Senate that would provide coverage \nunder Medicare for breast and prostate cancer.\n  When changes were made in Medicare back in 1993, there was an \ninadvertent omission whereby oral drug treatment was not covered under \nMedicare for breast and prostate cancer.

The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is an extraordinarily simple amendment. \nWe have in the Tax Code of the United States an incentive, a tax break, \na tax deduction for somebody who closes their plant in this country and \nmoves the jobs overseas to a tax haven, produces the same product with \nforeign workers, then ships the product back to the United States.\n  This simply gets rid of the tax break for companies that move the \njobs overseas. If we cannot close this tax loophole, we cannot close \nany tax loophole. I would hope we will have an affirmative vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  This amendment contains extraneous material and is not germane and \ntherefore subject to a point of order under the Budget Act.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays \non the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This will be the last vote this evening, and we will start \nvoting tomorrow morning at 9:15. The first vote will be on the \namendment by----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. The \nSenate will please come to order.\n  This is the last vote. Senators will please listen.\n  Mr. DOLE. Senator Gramm of Texas. The first vote will come on his \namendment, and the first vote will be 20 minutes in length. Then we \nwill go back to our 8 minutes after the first vote. We have had 20 \nvotes today. I wish to thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Are we going \ntomorrow by the schedule of amendments offered, and then we go down \nthat line and then we are on, will be on the last ones?\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. We are going to go down--that is right, yes.\n  Mr. FORD. We go as introduced.\n  Mr. DOLE. Then we go to tier three.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOLE. Then tier four and tier five.\n  Mr. FORD. Ten.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the budget act. The yeas and nays are ordered.

On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are \n52. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The amendment falls.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was rejected.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n               list of extraneous matter (the Byrd Rule)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the Budget \nAct, I submit a list of material considered to be extraneous under \nsubsections 313 (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) on behalf of the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n  Section 313(c) of the Budget Act states:\n\n       The inclusion or the exclusion of a provision shall not \n     constitute a determination of extraneousness by the Presiding \n     Officer of the Senate.\n\n  In addition, this list does not represent the Budget Committee's \nposition on the program or policies represented in these provisions or \na waiver of a point of order against these provisions. The Budget Act \nrequires the committee to simply identify potential violations under \nthree components of the Byrd rule and the committee has complied with \nthe law.\n  That a provision appears on this list does not mean it will \nautomatically be deleted from the bill. A Senator must raise a point of \norder against the provision and the Presiding Officer must sustain the \npoint of order. The Byrd rule may be waived in the Senate by an \naffirmative vote of 60 Senators.\n  This list is a compilation of items identified by both the majority \nand minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee. The staffs did not \nagree on every item, but the differences were small when one considers \nthe controversial and comprehensive nature of this bill. I want to \nthank the staff. The Byrd rule has evolved over the past 10 years and \nidentifying those provisions that violate the rule is a very difficult \nexercise.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995--Possible Extraneous \n                        Provisions; Senate Bill\n\n(Prepared by the Republican Staff of the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, \n                             October 1995)\n\n                                       EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS--SENATE BILL                                       \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Provision                                            Comments/Violation                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY                                      \n                                                                                                                \nSec. 1113(a)(4), 1113(c), and (e) (2)..................

The inclusion or exclusion of a provision shall not constitute a         \n  determination of extraneousness by the Presiding Officer of the Senate.                                       \n\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee was \nkind enough to discuss with me in advance the list that he just \nsubmitted for the Record. I, in turn, have shared with him my view of \nwhich items in the bill violate the Byrd rule against extraneous matter \nin reconciliation.\n  There is a great deal of agreement on these two lists, but some \ndifferences persist. To make the Record more complete, I submit my list \nof extraneous provisions and ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  At the close of debate on the bill, after Senators and the \nParliamentarian have had a full, fair chance to review these lists, I \nintend to raise an omnibus point of order under the Byrd rule against a \nlarge number of provisions that we have determined to be extraneous. I \nask unanimous consent that my list be printed in the Record to give \nSenators the maximum amount of notice as to which provisions are under \nreview for that purpose.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nList of Byrd Rule Violations to the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act \n                                of 1995\n\n   (Prepared by the Democratic Staff of the Senate Budget Committee, \n                           October 25, 1995)\n\n                                                                                                                \n\n[[Page S15835]]\n                              EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS, RECONCILIATION 1995--Continued                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtitle and Section                   Subject             Budget Act Violation         Explanation     \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Title I                                                    \n                                                                                                                \n                                             COMMITTEE: AGRICULTURE                                             \n                                                                                                                \n                                            Compliance: 1,5 yes; 7 no                                           \n                                                                                                                \n1113(b)(3)(B)......................

Mr. President, I am honored to serve as a member of the \nAdvisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations [ACIR]. In this era \nof ``new federalism,'' the government must create a partnership with \nstate and local governments that is based on balanced, decentralized \ndecision making. These governments have been the laboratories for \nchange for the last 20 years. A streamlined and more flexible \nintergovernmental system will offer significant opportunities for state \nand local governments to develop more innovative and cost effective \nmethods of delivering programs and services. State and local \ngovernments are now ready to rise to the challenges of this new era in \nhistory--the Information Age--where experimentation and local control \nare needed.\n  For example, as this Congress moves to balance the budget and restore \nfiscal responsibility and accountability at the federal level, it \ncannot do so on the backs of state and local governments. My \ninvolvement in drafting Public Law 104-4, the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nLaw, was an effort to relieve this burden. As a former Wyoming state \nlegislator, I am well aware of the hardships the federal government \nplaces on states and localities.\n  I look forward to working with the other members of the ACIR in \nimplementing the unfunded mandates reform law and sharing with my \nSenate colleagues the effects of federal policy making on state and \nlocal governments. Together, we can usher in a new era of government \nand restore federalism as the founding fathers intended over 200 years \nago.\n\n[[Page S15841]]\n\n\n                   FRANCES W. NOLDE, PIONEER AVIATRIX\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was recently advised of the passing of \na distinguished American, Frances W. Nolde, of Reading, PA. In addition \nto an illustrious career as a pioneer in aviation and in the theater, \nshe is the mother of a distinguished Washingtonian, H. Christopher \nNolde, who is the husband of another distinguished Washingtonian, Mrs. \nSylvia Nolde, who was my Executive Assistant for almost 14 years after \nserving in a similar capacity with Senator Jacob Javits.\n  Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the life of Frances W. Nolde \nwith a brief recitation of her career for the Congressional Record.\n  Frances W. Nolde was a woman ahead of her time, whose life spanned \nnearly the entire 20th century. She made unique contributions to the \nfield of aviation as a pilot, World War II Civil Air Patrol leader, \nvisionary, and achiever, all the while raising a family of seven \nchildren, founding and directing a country day school, and receiving \nacclaim as a civic leader in her home community. Musically talented, \nwith a flair for the dramatic, Mrs. Nolde had a budding career on stage \nand in radio.\n  Born in Deposit, NY, in 1902, she attended Oberlin Conservatory of \nMusic and graduated from Syracuse University with a BA and BS in Music. \nShe married Carlton Brown, who later became an accomplished Hollywood \nscreen writer. Their marriage ended in divorce.\n  Frances lived in the New York City area and played in a hit Broadway \nmusical ``Lady Be Good,'' starring Fred Astaire in the 1920s, and \nstarred in one of the first radio soap operas, under her stage name \nGloria Gay.\n  Upon marrying a successful businessman, Hans W. Nolde, Frances moved \nto Reading, PA, where she was one of the first to combine career and \nfamily and became well known for civic and philanthropic activities. \nShe was a board member of the Junior League and founded and directed \nThe New School, and country day school.\n  A pioneer in aviation, Frances Nolde was one of the early women \npilots, beginning in 1940. During World War II she commanded a Civil \nAir Patrol [CAP] courier base, flying cargo and key personnel for the \nwar industries. She held the rank of full colonel, the highest \nallowable to women at that time, and was the first National Director of \nWomen in Aviation for the CAP.\n  In 1948 she won the inaugural All-Women's Transcontinental Air Race--\nPowder Puff Derby--from Los Angeles to Miami.\n  The Distinguished Citizen's Award for Leadership in the Advancement \nof Aviation was presented in 1950 to her by the Altrusa International \nOrganization.\n  Mrs. Nolde served as an Airport Commissioner and arranged with \nGeneral Carl A. Spaatz and the U.S. Air Force to rename the Reading \nmunicipal Airport as the General Carl A. Spaatz Field.\n  She later became associated with the Reading Aviation Service and was \nPublic Relations Director of Aviation Consultants, Inc.\n  Upon her divorce from Hans, she moved to the Washington, D.C., area \nwhere she lived for more than 40 years. During that time she was \nemployed by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the Director of General \nAviation in the Defense Air Transportation Administration. She was \nresponsible for the Civil Air Reserve Fleet and the National Emergency \nAirlift Plan. Mrs. Nolde was a member of the American Newspaper Women's \nClubs, the Top Flight Club, and the Ambassador's Club.\n  Her accomplishments and contributions include: vice-president \nNational Aeronautics Association; delegate to Federation Aeronautique \nInternationale [FAI]; vice-president, FAI Economic Technical \nCommission; Governor 99's (International Organization of Women Pilots) \nand Vice President of its Contest Division; Vice President and \nTreasurer of Aero Club of Washington, DC.; Board of Governors and \nmembership Chairman of National Aviation Club; member President's \n``Women's Advisory Committee on Aviation.''\n  Mrs. Nolde held a commercial pilots rating, and logged more than \n10,000 hours flying time over her outstanding aviation career. A full \nbiography can be found in Who's Who In The World Of Aviation and also \nin Who's Who of American Women.\n  A long time resident of Bethesda, MD, Mrs. Nolde was 93 when she \npassed away on October 22. She is survived by her son, H. Christopher \nNolde, of Washington, D.C.; daughter Sally Lutyens of Manset, ME; \ndaughter Frances D. Nolde of Maynard, MA; 9 grandchildren and 8 great-\ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15840-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15841-S15842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, Chuck Grassley is a man I much admire. \nSomeday when I am out of here teaching a college course, I plan to cite \nChuck as a model Senator. He is not aware that I am placing this into \nthe Congressional Record, and I am sure that he would protest the cost. \nHowever, I believe it is well worth it because he is probably the \nhardest working, most decent Senator around here. I often say, ``Chuck \nGrassley is a real U.S. Senator. He is the real McCoy.'' He keeps a low \nprofile but gets a lot done around here that never is credited to him. \nHe is the type of a U.S. Senator that I particularly like. While some \nare retiring from this body with much fanfare, and others are holding \npress conferences about their achievements, Chuck Grassley keeps \nquietly working away. In the end, he will go down as one of the great \nU.S. Senators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na recent article that appeared in The Hill on October 25, 1995.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Oct. 25, 1995]\n\n Sen. Charles Grassley--Iowa Republican Stands Out as Workhorse Among \n                           Senate Showhorses\n\n                           (By Albert Eisele)\n\n       You can't get much more grassroots than Sen. Charles \n     Grassley (R-Iowa).\n       Early this month, the 62-year-old crusader against federal \n     waste was at the wheel of an International Harvester 1450 \n     tractor, hauling a load of soybeans to a grain elevator near \n     his family farm in northeastern Iowa.\n       The only working farmer in the Senate, Grassley interrupted \n     his farming chores to issue a press release informing his \n     constituents he had regained his Agriculture Committee seat, \n     which he was forced to give up in January when committee \n     assignments were redistributed after Republicans took control \n     of the Senate.\n       But last week, Grassley was back in the Senate, behind the \n     closed doors of the Finance Committee helping Republicans \n     work out disagreements over their controversial $245-billion \n     tax cut package, and then defending that package from \n     Democratic criticism in full committee.\n       ``If you're concerned about balancing the budget, you'll be \n     for this program,'' Grassley declared as he and his GOP \n     colleagues sent their historic tax package to the Senate \n     floor as part of the even more historic budget reconciliation \n     bill.\n       Then, using a metaphor appropriate to his Iowa origins and \n     his parochial view of his role in the Senate, once described \n     by Congressional Quarterly as ``pigs and pork,'' Grassley \n     said, ``The people of this country are tired of living high \n     on the hog, and not worrying about our children or \n     grandchildren paying for it.''\n       For the man who is the philosophical heir of the late Rep. \n     H. R. Gross (R), the quintessential penny-pinching legislator \n     whom Grassley succeeded in the House in 1974, it was a \n     characteristic moment.\n       Never hailed as an intellectual giant or an inspiring \n     orator, the easy-going third-term senator has made his name, \n     and compiled a truly imposing campaign record, by balancing \n     the needs of Iowa farmers and small businesses with the \n     national yearning for fiscal discipline in government.\n       Despite one of the lowest profiles in the Senate, Grassley \n     has managed, by stint of sheer hard work, country-bred \n     political smarts and a low-octane ego, to place himself in \n     the middle of the Senate debate over the big ticket issues of \n     tax cuts, budget balancing and welfare reform at the heart of \n     the Republican revolution.\n       As a member of the Finance Committee, the number two \n     Republican on the Budget Committee behind Chairman Pete \n     Domenici (R-N.M.), and a member of the House-Senate \n     conference committee on welfare reform which holds its first \n     meeting today, Grassley is perfectly positioned to add to his \n     already impressive electoral achievements in Iowa, where he \n     has never lost a race.\n       Elected to the state legislature while studying for a \n     doctorate at the University of Iowa--he left school after he \n     was elected and never returned--Grassley took over his family \n     farm after his father died in 1960.\n       By 1974, when he won a narrow victory over a Democratic \n     opponent to replace the retiring Rep. Gross, Grassley has \n     bought additional acreage--it's now just under 600 acres--and \n     turned the farm over to his son Robin, who still farms it, \n     with weekend help from his father in the fall and spring.\n\n[[Page S15842]]\n\n       Then, in 1980, after Iowa voters dumped liberal Democratic \n     Sen. Dick Clark in favor of conservative Republican Roger \n     Jepson two years earlier, Grassley took on Clark's liberal \n     Democratic colleague, John Culver, after winning 90 of the \n     state's 99 counties in the GOP primary.\n       His emphasis on pocketbook issues and his earnest demeanor, \n     which belied Culver's charges that he was a tool of the Moral \n     Majority and New Right, earned Grassley an unexpectedly \n     comfortable victory with 54 percent of the vote.\n       Amazingly, for someone whose name and accomplishments are \n     little-known outside of Iowa, and widely discounted inside \n     the Washington Beltway, Grassley has one of the best records \n     as a campaigner of anyone in the Senate. Of the 43 senators \n     who have run for three or more terms, Grassley is the only \n     one, other than John Warner (R-Va.) and two others who ran \n     unopposed, who has significantly improved his electoral \n     margin in each of the last three elections.\n       After winning 54 percent of the vote in 1980, he easily \n     disposed of his Democratic challenger in 1986 by taking 66 \n     percent of the vote, and crushed his opponent in 1992, \n     highly touted state Sen. Jean Lloyd-Jones, by winning 70 \n     percent of the vote.\n       The latter victory was one of historic proportions as he \n     carried every single county while winning by the largest \n     statewide margin in the county, and winning more votes than \n     any candidate in the history of the state--President \n     Eisenhower had the old record.\n       Grassley has an uncanny ability to translate national \n     issues, such as defense fraud, tax reform, out-of-control \n     government spending, congressional accountability, and \n     international trade--especially for Iowa farm and \n     manufacturing products--into issues of local appeal.\n       Grassley scored one of his major successes earlier this \n     year when the 104th Congress enacted its first piece of \n     legislation, the Congressional Accountability Act that made \n     Congress subject to the same labor and anti-discrimination \n     laws that apply to all Americans. Grassley has been pushing \n     for such a law since 1989.\n       But it was his attack on government waste and fraud that \n     first brought him public attention. In 1984, as chairman of \n     the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Practices, he \n     publicized the notorious $7,600 coffee maker bought by the \n     Air Force. Then, in 1990, he won headlines by uncovering \n     Pentagon purchases of $999 screwdrivers and $1,868 toilet \n     seats.\n       Grassley is proudest of two major achievements, passage of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act and his work with Rep. \n     Howard Berman (D-Calif.) in promoting the 1986 ``whistle \n     blower'' provisions, known as the ``qui tam'' amendments to \n     the False Claims Act, which enabled the Justice Department to \n     recover more than $1 billion in civil fraud cases since 1986.\n       Over breakfast in the Senate Dining Room last week, \n     Grassley, who had a very un-Iowa-like breakfast--a grapefruit \n     with honey and black coffee--commented, almost \n     apologetically, on the fact that very little major \n     legislation bears his name.\n       ``Sometimes I think the passage of legislation might not \n     necessarily be the best way to measure a person's most \n     important accomplishments,'' he said. ``Sometimes, it's what \n     you might do to stop a bad administrative action or get an \n     amicus brief before the Supreme Court on child pornography.''\n       Grassley has already signed onto Senate Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole's (Kan.) presidential bandwagon, so it's no surprise he \n     predicts Dole will win the bellwether Iowa caucuses next \n     February. But he concedes that Dole will have to beat the 38-\n     percent figure he got in 1986.\n       And for those who want to bet a long shot, the most \n     successful politician in Iowa history offers this startling \n     advice: ``Keep an eye on Phil Gramm [R-Texas]. He's the one \n     to watch.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15841-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15842-S15843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NAOMI ROSENBLATT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, it has been my great privilege to have \nattended Naomi Rosenblatt's bible classes over the past few years. I \nhave found her teaching to be directly related to my duties in the U.S. \nSenate. She is a splendid teacher, but more importantly, a fine, \ninsightful person. I wish that time would allow me to attend more of \nher classes.\n  Naomi Rosenblatt takes the approach that the great stories of the \nBible are relevant today--as we struggle with some of the same issues \nin running the United States as Joseph faced in running ancient Egypt \nfor the Pharoah.\n  Recently a review of her new book appeared in the Washington Post. It \nsummarizes some of her classes that I have attended along with certain \nother Senators and journalists. I ask unanimous consent to have the \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Post, October 15, 1995]\n\n                         The Bible Tells Us So\n\n                          (By Jonathan Groner)\n\n       In an era when many of our politicians are still trying to \n     locate the proper place of religion in American life, Naomi \n     Rosenblatt has for several years played the role of Bible \n     teacher to many of Capitol Hill's movers and shakers. The \n     weekly Old Testament classes led by Rosenblatt, an Israeli-\n     born Washington psychotherapist, have captivated tough \n     political professionals like senators Larry Pressler and \n     Arlen Specter and journalists William Safire and Marvin Kalb, \n     Wrestling with Angels, co-written with her longtime student \n     Joshua Horwitz but bearing Rosenblatt's stamp as chief \n     author, grows out of these sessions.\n       It's Rosenblatt's first book, and what a fascinating effort \n     it is; part biblical interpretation, part self-help treatise; \n     a book that adopts an unmistakably Jewish perspective yet \n     remains accessible to readers of all backgrounds.\n       Rosenblatt's ambitious project was to traverse the entire \n     book of Genesis--amply familiar for the stories of Adam and \n     Eve, Noah and the flood, the Tower of Babel, and the \n     wanderings of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--and to \n     derive from it universal and psychologically valid lessons \n     about human character. Her approach to the first book of the \n     Bible is inseparable from her therapeutic method.\n       Rosenblatt says that her role as interpreter of the text is \n     to provide ``a psychological and spiritual examination of the \n     multigenerational family,'' by which she means the family of \n     Abraham, Sarah and their descendants. Sibling rivalries, \n     midlife crises, blended families, guilt and personal \n     responsibility--these are the therapist's stock in trade. \n     Rosenblatt is able to convince me, most of the time, that \n     these also represent useful interpretive tools in \n     understanding the biblical text.\n       Two thousand years ago, a rabbi said in the Mishna that he \n     had learned more from his students than from his teachers. In \n     struggling with these old riddles, Rosenblatt too enjoyed the \n     assistance of her students. Like the Talmud, Wrestling with \n     Angels is a distillation of discussions held over a period of \n     years. And the questions with which Rosenblatt grapples, as \n     she fully understands, were already noted by the rabbis of \n     the Jewish tradition, who provided their own answers. What \n     was the real nature of the sin of Adam and Eve? Why did God \n     command Abraham to sacrifice his only son? With whom was \n     Jacob really wrestling in his nocturnal encounter with the \n     ``angel''? What was the secret of Joseph's success in Egypt?\n       Yet Rosenblatt's method yields new solutions, or at least \n     new versions of old solutions. Here is her interpretation of \n     Jacob's wrestling with the angel: ``Is this `man' his twin \n     brother, Esau, with whom he wrestled in the womb and whom he \n     must confront the next morning? Is he Jacob's shadow self, \n     the darker part of his psyche that doubts and fears--that he \n     must integrate before he can become whole? Could he be an \n     angle of death, Jacob's fear of mortality rising up to greet \n     him on the eve of his brother's revenge? . . . It seems to me \n     that the `man' is all of these.'' Rosenblatt's sensitive \n     reading takes full advantage of the ambiguity and \n     mysteriousness of the biblical story, which is a dream an \n     allegory, or both.\n       As might be expected, Rosenblatt is at her most convincing \n     when she touches on the portions of Genesis that deal \n     explicitly with intra-family conflicts. The text tells us \n     this directly in Chapter 25, after all: Of her twins, Rebekah \n     preferred Jacob, while Isaac, their father, chose Esau as his \n     favorite. From these facts sprang rivalry and disruption that \n     continued for generations. Rosenblatt's psychological filter \n     is helpful here. She explains, for example, that the story of \n     Jacob and Esau ``is a strong warning to us of the danger to \n     children when parents draw them into the shifting power \n     balance of their marriage.'' That's as true now as it was \n     then.\n       Rosenblatt's thoughts often echo and extend some of the \n     interpretations already found in Jewish tradition. The result \n     is as if one were seeing the old stories with new eyes. The \n     tradition notes, for example, that once Isaac was consecrated \n     and nearly sacrificed on the altar by Abraham, he took on a \n     personal holiness and thus was never allowed to venture \n     beyond the holy land of Israel. Speaking from a psychological \n     perspective, Rosenblatt also recognizes how circumscribed \n     Isaac's life was. As a child growing up in the shadow of a \n     famous father, she argues, Isaac ``never experiences the \n     cathartic personal transformation that the other patriarchs \n     undergo.''\n       Or Rosenblatt explains how Jacob's ``emotional blindness on \n     his wedding night mirrors Isaac's physical blindness when \n     bestowing his blessing on his son [Jacob].'' This echoes an \n     old rabbinical interpretation that emphasized how the onetime \n     deceiver, Jacob, was later himself the victim of deception.\n       Not all of Rosenblatt's interpretations are on target. My \n     understanding of the conflict between the wives of Jacob was \n     not measurably aided by Rosenblatt's digression on the \n     dilemma of 20th-century women who are torn between career and \n     motherhood. Nor did her cursory discussion of the attempted \n     seduction of Joseph in Egypt, citing modern views of sexual \n     harassment, add anything to my thinking on either the Joseph \n     narrative or the harassment dynamic. She somewhat \n     shortchanges the whole Joseph narrative, a section of Genesis \n     that gets better treatment from the brilliant contemporary \n     critic Robert Alter.\n\n[[Page S15843]]\n\n       But these are minor points. Rosenblatt's students on \n     Capitol Hill feel privileged that she is their teacher, and \n     now that this book is available, all of us who take the Bible \n     seriously can consider ourselves similarly blessed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15842-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

WISS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding judge, a faithful naval officer, and a remarkable \nindividual, the Honorable Robert E. Wiss, a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces. Judge Wiss was 66 when he passed away on \nMonday morning, October 23, 1995.\n  Judge Wiss was born in Chicago, IL in 1929 and graduated from the \nUniversity of Illinois in 1950. He entered the service in that same \nyear for 3 years of active duty but he did not end his military career \nat that point. He continued in the reserves and finally retired in 1988 \nas a rear admiral in the Navy's Judge Advocate Generals Corps.\n  Judge Wiss was an excellent lawyer who received his degree from \nNorthwestern in 1956 and taught law at John Marshall Law School. He was \na member of numerous bar associations and was admitted to practice \nbefore over a half dozen courts to include the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He was truly a talented individual who loved the military, understood \nit mission, and believed in a strong national defense. He fully \nunderstood as well the need for the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nJudge Wiss believed that the system was better than any other system of \njustice in existence but if change was needed, it should be pursued \nwith vigor. If no change was in order, however, Judge Wiss did not \ntolerate anything short of complete adherence and respect for that \nsystem.\n  In the eyes of those who knew him, he was a legal figure of great \nstature. In his own mind, he was never important, only extremely \nfortunate. All people mattered to him and his wife and children most of \nall. Our thoughts and prayers will be with his wife Charlene and his \nthree daughters, Julia, Karen, and Laurel. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15843-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15843-S15844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN MEMORY OF JUDGE ROBERT E. WISS OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \n                          FOR THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. NUNN. I join with Senator Thurmond in paying tribute to the \nmemory of Judge Robert E. Wiss of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nArmed Forces. Judge Wiss, who was in the midst of his term on the \nCourt, passed away on October 23, 1995.\n  Judge Wiss joined the court in 1991 after a distinguished career in \nboth the public and private sectors. In his civilian career, he served \nas a special counsel to the city of Chicago and as general counsel to \nCook County. He had a very successful private practice, rising to \nsenior partnership with the firm of Foran, Wiss, & Schultz. He also was \na distinguished teacher, serving on the faculty of the John Marshall \nLaw School in Chicago. He also played a leading role in many bar \nassociations and civic activities.\n  In addition to his very active civilian practice, Judge Wiss had a \nlifelong commitment to military law. He served on active duty from 1950 \nto 1953, and in the Naval Reserve from 1953 to 1988, advancing to the \ngrade of rear admiral. Highlights of his military career included \nservices as director of the Naval Reserve Law Program and commanding \nofficer of the Navy and Marine Appellate Review activity.\n  Judge Wiss appeared before our committee in 1991 following his \nnomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces--\nwhich was then denominated as the Court of Military Appeals. He \nreceived the unanimous approval of our committee and was confirmed by \nthe Senate.\n  In his 4 years on the court, Judge Wiss distinguished himself by his \nthorough scholarship, probing questions, and keen interest in \npreserving the dignity and fairness of the military justice system. He \nwill be missed by his colleagues on the court, the lawyers \n\n[[Page S15844]]\n\nwho practiced before him, and his many other friends and admirers. I \nwould like to extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Charlene, and to \nhis children, Julia Leahy, Karen Wiss, and Laurel Latimer. They can be \nvery proud of his outstanding contribution to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15843-4", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SUPERFUND REFORM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I wanted to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the concerns of a prominent South Dakotan regarding the \nSuperfund program.\n  Like many of my colleagues, during the August recess, I spent \nconsiderable time back home talking to my constituents. While in South \nDakota, one issue came up on numerous occasions: Superfund reform. This \nissue is important to small business men and women throughout South \nDakota.\n  Recently, an op-ed by Bill Huebner of Rapid City, SD, was published \nin the Wall Street Journal. This article details Mr. Huebner's own \nunfortunate experience with Superfund. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We all agree that the current Superfund program does \nnot work. It is one of the most expensive environmental programs on the \nbooks. Despite the vast amounts of taxpayer dollars that have poured \ninto the Superfund, the program has a very low success rate. One of the \nprime causes of this low success rate is a confusing and costly \nliability system. This system is unfair to small businesses. It \nencourages excessive and costly litigation.\n  I am encouraged by the draft proposal drawn up by my esteemed \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Smith. As chairman of the \nSuperfund, Waste Control and Risk Management Subcommittee, he has \nassumed the daunting task of rewriting the existing Superfund law. I \nlook forward to working with him to create a new Superfund law based on \nfairness and common sense. We should not insist on a system that calls \non small businesses that have complied with past laws and regulations \nto continue shouldering the burden of cleaning up our hazardous waste \nsites.\n  Bill Huebner's article represents not only the concerns of South \nDakota small business leaders, but of all small business men and women \nacross the country. They are the innovators who collectively make our \neconomic engine run. For that reason, we should take their concerns and \nexperiences to heart in our reexamination of the Superfund program.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 26, 1995]\n\n                         My Superfund Nightmare\n\n                           (By Bill Huebner)\n\n       I'm sitting here at my desk starting at a three-foot-high \n     pile of letters, legal motions, and other documents. That \n     pile of paper tells my Superfund story--a 3\\1/2\\-year \n     nightmare that cost my company time, money and business.\n       For those who don't know, Superfund is the federal \n     government's program to clean up America's worst hazardous \n     waste sites. It was established by Congress in 1980 with $1.6 \n     billion in funding. Today, 15 years later, more than $20 \n     billion in government and private sector funds have been \n     spent. More than 1,300 hazardous waste sites have been \n     identified by the Environmental Protection Agency. But only a \n     tiny fraction of these sites have actually been cleaned up.\n       Where did Superfund go wrong? Read on.\n       Back in November 1991, I received a letter addressed to Ace \n     Steel & Metals, claiming I owed $47,000 as my share of the \n     bill to clean up the Douglas County, Neb., Superfund site. \n     Between 1940 and 1982, the letter said, the property had been \n     owned by a series of battery recycling companies. Apparently, \n     some battery lead and acid had seeped into the ground, \n     creating a hazardous waste area.\n       There were only a few problems. First my company is Act \n     Steel & Recycling, not Ace Steel & Metals. Second, we never \n     sent any batteries to Douglas County. And third, we weren't \n     even in business until 1989--a full seven years after they \n     said the last battery was dumped.\n       A simple case of mistaken identity. I thought. In 1989, we \n     bought about 20 % of the assets of a company called Ace \n     Salvage, as well as the right to use the ``Ace'' name. That \n     company was still in business, operating as Lipp Ventures. \n     Lipp had sent the batteries to the Douglas County site, so \n     they must be the one the EPA wanted. A letter from my lawyer \n     explaining the situation should clear the whole thing up, \n     right? Wrong.\n       Our first letter generated no response, so we sent another. \n     This time, we documented everything. We sent copies of our \n     original articles of incorporation from 1989, proving that we \n     couldn't have been responsible for the problems at the \n     Douglas County Superfund site.\n       Again, no response to speak of. Just a letter of \n     acknowledgment saying thank you very much for the \n     information, but you still owe $47,000. Needless to say, as a \n     small business, we didn't have an extra $47,000 to spare--in \n     fact, that was more than our profit for the entire year. We \n     had to fight on or go out of business.\n       Finally, after 3\\1/2\\ years, Lipp's attorney settled with \n     the lawyers from Douglas County. No one ever admitted there \n     had been a mistake, but Ace Steel & Recycling was removed \n     from the case ``with prejudice.'' That means the plaintiff \n     reserves the right to bring us back into the lawsuit, so we \n     might not be out of danger yet.\n       Don't think for a minute that my case was some kind of \n     freak accident. More than 20,000 small and medium-sized \n     businesses, community groups, and other organizations across \n     America have been dragged into the Superfund mess.\n       The primary problem with Superfund is its unfair liability \n     system known as ``retroactive, strict, joint and several \n     liability.'' Retroactive liability gives the EPA the power to \n     make companies pay to clean up problems that occurred before \n     Superfund was passed, even if they followed every rule on the \n     books at the time. And under joint and several liability, a \n     single company can be forced to finance the entire cleanup \n     cost, no matter now marginal its contribution to the site.\n       With marching orders like those, you can easily guess the \n     EPA's standard operating procedure: Track down every company \n     with even the most remote connection to a Superfund site, \n     force them to pay, or drag them into court. Most companies \n     fight the charges, rather than pay to clean up a problem they \n     had little or no responsibility for creating. All the \n     litigation caused by Superfund's notorious liability scheme \n     is the main reason it now costs $30 million and takes 12 \n     years to clean up the average Superfund site.\n       Congress will shortly begin debating Superfund reform \n     legislation. Its top priority must be total repeal of \n     retroactive liability. Superfund reform opponents claim that \n     ending retroactive liability will let polluters off the hook \n     and force taxpayers to pick up the bill. Not true. The \n     program will still be financed by a tax on oil and chemical \n     companies and other large corporations. Individual taxpayers \n     won't have to pay a penny--unless Congress keeps Superfund on \n     it failed course for another 15 years.\n       Repealing retroactive liability will put an end to wasteful \n     litigation and force the EPA to focus on cleaning toxic waste \n     sites instead of harassing innocent companies. Superfund \n     cleanup could start immediately. And think of how many \n     additional Superfund sites could be cleaned up if 50% of the \n     money wasn't wasted on lawyers and bureaucrats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15844-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10:56 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1322.

This initiative, which has been made more \n     important by the reorganization of military facilities and \n     base closures around the world, has been nominated for major \n     recognition through the Innovations in American Government \n     program coordinated by the Harvard University Kennedy School \n     of Government; and\n       ``Whereas, the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service \n     is charged with the mission of selling Department of Defense \n     assets, reutilizing resources, transferring property and \n     materials, and encouraging the recovery of metals.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the Endangered Species Act \nof 1973, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                the endangered species conservation act\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill that \nI believe will restore Americans' faith and confidence in the \nGovernment's ability to \n\n[[Page S15850]]\n\nprotect the environment and our future.\n  I am talking about reform of the Endangered Species Act, first \nenacted in 1973. If we do nothing, the act will collapse under the \nweight of regulation and inefficiencies.\n  Everyone I speak with considers themselves an environmentalist, and I \nbelieve they are right. We all want a future for our children. We only \nhave one planet, and we must do all we can to protect it and the \nspecies living on it.\n  We can all agree with the goals of the act--identify species and \nhabitat in danger of extinction and try to reverse the process for \nthose that we can. Unfortunately, many Americans have come to destruct \nthe act and its bureaucracy. We need to restore a balance in order to \nallow the act to work.\n  That is why I am introducing my Endangered Species Conservation Act \ntoday. I consider myself a probusiness environmentalist. Some may think \nthat is an oxymoron, but I do not believe so. Here is why: Without a \nhealthy economy, we will not have the resources needed to conserve the \nrare species among us.\n  How can we have both?\n  My Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife Subcommittee held \nextensive hearings on the act this spring and summer. We held hearings \nin Washington, DC, Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming.\n  In those hearings, some common themes emerged. First, almost everyone \nagreed it is time to reform the Endangered Species Act.\n  We heard that from almost everyone, from the unemployed timber worker \nin Idaho to the Secretary of the Interior. And I intend with this bill \nto bring about the meaningful and substantial reform to the act that \neveryone has asked for.\n  While all of us agree on the general goals of the Endangered Species \nAct, the message that we received at our hearings is that the ESA is \ntoo much regulation, too much Federal control, and too much Government. \nThat message has come through loud and clear. People who have to live \nwith the ESA are angry with how the Government uses it against them. \nThe ESA relies too often on untested science, bureaucratic delays, and \nexcludes State and local government from decisions that affect their \nown people, and threatens private property rights.\n\n  An example of this is the case in Idaho, where a Federal judge \nthreatened to shut down all activities in six national forests. The \nloggers, miners, ranchers, businessowners, and the thousands of jobs \nthey provide were at risk because Federal agencies were not talking to \neach other.\n  We must bring balance back to the process of saving rare and \nthreatened species. This is not just an issue in my home State of Idaho \nor elsewhere in the West. Indeed, the Endangered Species Act has \nimplications in the Northeast, where the Atlantic Salmon remains a \nconcern, the Southwest with the Mexican Spotted Owl, the Red Cockaded \nWoodpecker in the Southeast, and the Midwest's whooping cranes. Nearly \nevery American has a stake in this debate, and I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that nearly every American will understand the reasons why \nmy bill will be better for people, species, and the environment.\n  The said truth is that since 1973, only a handful of species have \nbeen successfully removed from the endangered species list. Yet despite \nour efforts to document the cost, untold millions of dollars have been \nspent in the effort. We need a bill that works better, more \neffectively, and actually accomplishes what that original 1973 law \nintended to do.\n  I believe this bill will do that by allowing science to take its \nproper place in the debate. Science, not political science, should \ndetermine whether a species is at risk of extinction. Right now, it is \nthe other way around, with a political decision made first on a species \nand then the necessary data found to justify that decision. Science \nshould provide options for public policymakers. Until we use science to \nallow us to make the best public policy decisions, and until we openly \nmove into the political arena and discuss the competing concerns facing \nour country, we never will be able place our society's priorities in \nbalance.\n  I believe that is where Congress has abdicated its responsibilities. \nCongress tells Federal agencies to go out and make the ESA work, but \noften the only tools those agencies have are the blunt instrument of \nregulation.\n  Examples like the 29 homes lost to fire in southern California \nbecause homeowners couldn't cut fire lines due to ESA regulations have \neroded public confidence in the act, and have made them openly \nskeptical of its goals. I doubt whether many Americans will make the \nStephens' Kangaroo Rat a priority over those 29 homes. Under the ESCA \nwe would find a way to protect both the Stephens' Kangaroo Rat and the \nprivate property rights of the 29 homeowners.\n\n  In this manner this legislation restores the balance to the equation \nand allows for a healthy economy, vibrant communities, better species \nprotection, and hope for our children's futures. It makes the \nEndangered Species Act actually work better and stronger and is good \nreform. If we do nothing, public opposition to how the act has been \nimplemented will cause it to fail altogether. I do not think anyone \nhere wants that to happen.\n  Let me go over the major provisions of the ESCA: This bill \neffectively separates science from politics; it is designed to actually \nconserve species while recognizing the rights of private property \nowners; the current act's mandate to recover every species regardless \nof cost or consequence is changed to allow us to prioritize our \nNation's needs and to conserve species in the process; the ESCA \ninvolves State and local governments in the conservation process and \ntreats them as equals; we remove bureaucratic delays that destroy the \nrelationship between property owners and Government; this bill provides \nincentives to encourage the protection of endangered and threatened \nspecies; it makes all Federal agencies partners, instead of \nadversaries, in the conservation of species.\n  This bill introduces several innovations and new ideas that I think \nare crucial to bringing balance to the act. First, we recognize the \nprogress science has made in genetics. Genetics are not even mentioned \nin the 1973 act. In the ESCA we recognize genetics as a measure of \nspecies distinctness. And, as requested by the scientists, we protect \nthe biological species and genetically distinct populations and \nsubspecies.\n  Whether a species should be listed is measured in human generations, \nbecause I believe we must look to our children's future, and how we can \nprovide for them. Is this sound science? I believe so because \npopulation biologists tell me they can now make such forecasts within \nthose bounds.\n  The fact remains we are spending millions of dollars now and putting \njobs and communities at risk with no clear policy, priorities, or \nability to measure results. We must acknowledge that extinction is a \nnatural phenomenon over which man has limited control. Today we have an \nopportunity to reform the Endangered Species Act to do a better job of \npreventing the increasing loss of species. Congress must take a \nforceful step in this area, because we can't afford to let the courts \ndistort our good intentions.\n  I do not expect this bill to be embraced by those in our country who \nview this issue only from the extremes. But extremists get very little \naccomplished. I contend that extremists probably deserve each other and \nought to be on some remote island where they have to help each other. \nThe balance between people and our natural world can only be maintained \nwith a partnership--a partnership brought about by legislation like \nthis.\n  If we do nothing, and do not work together, and if we continue to \nrely solely on regulation instead of incentives we will fail. That is \nsomething we cannot allow for our present and for our childrens' \nfuture.\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthe Endangered Species Conservation Act [ESCA] introduced by Senator \nKempthorne.\n  The Endangered Species Act [ESA] has been misused and twisted from \nits original intent, and I believe the bill we are introducing today \nputs us back on track.\n  Montana's largest industry is agriculture. If you asked Montana's \nfarmers and ranchers what law they want Congress to fix, most will say \nthe Endangered Species Act. The wood products industry represents \nalmost half of \n\n[[Page S15851]]\n\nwestern Montana's economy. If you ask the folks who make a living in \nthe woods what law is currently infringing on their ability to make a \nliving for their families, they'll tell you about grizzly bears and \nroad closures--once again coming back to the Endangered Species Act.\n  There is no doubt that we must reform the ESA. It is the single most \nrestrictive law that Montanans and other American who rely on the land \nto make a living, must deal with. The communities in Montana lack the \neconomic stability and predictability they deserve. The current law has \nmany communities in Montana and throughout our Nation living on pins \nand needles. The bottom line is communities are hurting.\n  We need to change the ESA so that it truly protects and recovers \nspecies, won't cost millions of dollars per species, and will protect \nprivate propertyowners' rights. The bill we're introducing today \naccomplishes these goals.\n  Emphasis must to placed on recovery. The current law emphasizes the \nlisting of species instead of protecting and recovering species. In \norder to do this, the Endangered Species Conservation Act contains the \nfollowing principles:\n  First, as I stated earlier, above all we must concentrate our efforts \non recovery plans. If we do so, we would focus on the least costly \nalternative and we would assess the impacts of decisions made under the \nact for State and local economics. In addition, this would force \npriorities to be set and would generate recovery plans which are \nreasonable and obtainable.\n  Second, the ESCA bill we've introduced today recognizes that a one-\nsize-fits-all recovery standard is flawed. The ESCA establishes \nstandards for prioritizing where Federal dollars should be spent and \nwhat level of conservation will be sought.\n  Finally, it also ensures decisions are based on better science. Peer \nreview procedures need to be added to improve the overall data \ncollected so that the right decisions are made. We must have three \ndecisions made outside of politics and instead done by objective \nindividuals who have a background in science. The bill establishes an \nEndangered Species Commission which will ensure sound science, not \npolitics, drives our decisions.\n  The best decisions are those made at the local level, and I believe \nwe need increased private participation in our conservation efforts. \nThe fact is, local individuals are the best people to support any \nconservation plan. They work and live in the areas affected, and they \nhave a stake in what happens in their own backyards.\n  Washington should not forget, these people want to maintain the \nquality of life they have for their families. The ESCA encourages \ncooperative management agreements for non-Federal efforts and other \nincentives for private land owners. These include deferment of estate \ntaxes where conservation easements are in place, technical assistance, \nand cost sharing.\n  Without a doubt, compensation must be given to individuals who lose \nthe use of their private property under a Federal Government \nconservation plan. Our Constitution and property rights need protection \non every front. Anything short of that is selling our constitutional \nrights down the river. I am pleased that the ESCA contains a provision \nto protect our private property rights.\n  The Endangered Species Act has a good goal. However, since it became \nlaw, it has been twisted and misused for other purposes. We need some \ncommon sense put back into recovering species. Starting from a new view \npoint, and crafting an act which truly reflects what we want to do--\nconserve and recover species--has to be the focus. We can't let the \nexisting law and regulations run multiple use off our lands.\n  Reforming the Endangered Species Act is essential to Montana's \neconomy. Our four largest industries--agriculture, timber, mining, and \noil and gas rely on the use of land. And it's these industries which \nsupply the jobs and the tax base for Montana. Changing the laws on \nconserving and recovering endangered species is important for jobs for \nMontanans, and it is important for sound land management activities.\n  The Endangered Species Conservation Act is a good bill and I hope the \nSenate will act quickly in considering this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human rights violations and atrocities continue \n     unabated in the Former Yugoslavia.\n       (2) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights \n     recently reported that starting in mid-September and \n     intensifying between October 6 and October 12, 1995 many \n     thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in Northwest Bosnia \n     were systematically forced from their homes by paramilitary \n     units, local police and in some instances, Bosnian Serb Army \n     officials and soldiers.\n       (3) Despite the October 12, 1995 cease-fire which went into \n     effect by agreement of the warring parties in the former \n     Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serbs continue to conduct a brutal \n     campaign to expel non-Serb civilians who remain in Northwest \n     Bosnia, and are subjecting non-Serbs to untold horror--\n     murder, rape, robbery and other violence.\n       (4) Horrible examples of ``ethnic cleansing'' persist in \n     Northwest Bosnia. Some six thousand refugees recently reached \n     Zenica and reported that nearly two thousand family members \n     from this group are still unaccounted for.\n       (5) The UN spokesman in Zagreb reported that many refugees \n     have been given only a few minutes to leave their homes and \n     that ``girls as young as 17 are reported to have been taken \n     into wooded areas and raped.'' Elderly, sick and very young \n     refugees have been driven to remote areas and forced to walk \n     long distances on unsafe roads and cross rivers without \n     bridges.\n       (6) The War Crime Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has \n     collected volumes of evidence of atrocities, including the \n     establishment of death camps, mass executions and systematic \n     campaigns of rape and terror. This War Crimes Tribunal has \n     already issued 43 indictments on the basis of this evidence.\n       (7) The Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights has \n     described the eye witness accounts as ``prima facie evidence \n     of war crimes which, if confirmed, could very well lead to \n     further indictments by the War Crimes Tribunal.''\n       (8) The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that \n     more than 22,000 Muslims and Croats have been forced from \n     their homes since mid-September in Bosnian Serb controlled \n     areas.\n       (9) In opening the Dodd Center Symposium on the topic of \n     ``50 Years After Nuremburg'' on October 16, 1995, President \n     Clinton cited the ``excellent progress'' of the War Crimes \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and said, ``Those accused \n     of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide must be \n     brought to justice.

Mr. President, earlier this session, I introduced \nS. 1325, the Medicare Whistleblower Act of 1995, to reduce provider \nfraud and abuse in the Medicare Program. The amendment I am submitting \ntoday improves upon that bill, and provides a strong incentive for \nbeneficiaries to identify overpayments made by Medicare. An Abraham \namendment which passed today, and which I supported, takes a similar \napproach to achieve this same objective. However, my amendment is \npreferable because it specifically delineates the whistleblower reward \nprocess and does not give the Secretary of HHS discretion not to make \nincentive payments. I hope that the conferees will adopt this \namendment.\n  At Medicare town meetings throughout Arizona, I have heard over and \nover from senior citizens that the Medicare Program is rampant with \ninaccurate billings. They have told me, based on their personal \nexperiences, that their Medicare bills frequently include services that \nthey have not received, double billings for the same service, or \ncharges that are disproportionate to the value of services received. \nOften, they have no idea what Medicare is being billed for on their \nbehalf, and they are not able to obtain explanations from providers.\n  The perceptions of Medicare beneficiaries are confirmed by more \nsystematic analyses. The General Accounting Office has estimated that \nfraud and abuse in our Nation's health care system costs taxpayers as \nmuch as $100 billion each year. Medicare fraud alone costs about $17 \nbillion per year, which is 10 percent of the program's costs. A report \nby the Republican staff of the Senate Committee on Aging has documented \na broad array of fraudulent activities, including false claims for \nservices that were supposed to have been rendered after the \nbeneficiaries had died.\n  The Medicare Program has many problems. A fundamental problem, and \nthe source of many other problems, is that too few people are \nadequately concerned about its costs because the Government is paying \nmost of the bills. One constituent informed me of a situation in which \nhis provider double-billed for the same service and told him not to \nworry about it because Medicare is paying. This is an outrage and must \nbe stopped. When Medicare overpays, we all overpay, and costs to \nbeneficiaries and other taxpayers spiral.\n  This amendment addresses this fundamental problem of the Medicare \nProgram. It gives beneficiaries an added incentive to carefully \nscrutinize their bills and to actively pursue corrections when they \nbelieve that there has been inappropriate billing of Medicare. In \nparticular, beneficiaries would be financially rewarded if they uncover \nnegligence or fraud to the benefit of us all. Although such provider \nfraud is not the entire problem, and there is other legislation that I \nsupport which also addresses beneficiary fraud, studies \n\n[[Page S15855]]\n\n\nclearly indicate that provider fraud is most prevalent and the greatest \nconcern.\n  The major problem with our current approach to detecting Medicare \nfraud is that it relies primarily upon bureaucrats who have no \nfirsthand knowledge of what services were provided to a beneficiary and \nwho have extremely limited time and resources to investigate. This \napproach can be expected to discover only the most apparent fraudulent \nactivities. To discover most fraud, we must obtain the full cooperation \nof those who know what occurred at providers' offices and who have the \ntime to pursue fraud--the beneficiaries. All they need is the ability \nand incentive to scrutinize their bills and actively correct \ninaccuracies.\n  Under this amendment, beneficiaries would have a right to receive in \nwriting from their providers, within 30 days of when their request is \nreceived, an itemized bill for Medicare services provided to them. The \nbeneficiary would then have 90 days to raise specific allegations of \ninappropriate billings to Medicare. The Medicare intermediaries and \ncarriers would then have to review the bills and determine whether an \noverpayment has been made which must be reimbursed to the Medicare \nprogram. The beneficiary would receive a reward of 1 percent of the \noverpayment reimbursed up to $10,000. Because these rewards would be \npaid directly out of the overpayments, they would not increase costs to \nthe Federal Government.\n  There are several important safeguards built into this legislation. \nThe Secretary would be required to establish appropriate procedures to \nensure that the incentive system is not abused by overzealous \nbeneficiaries. An incentive payment would be awarded only to the extent \nthat HCFA is able to recover the overpayment from the provider, and \nthere would be no incentive payment if HCFA can demonstrate that it--\nfor its Medicare intermediary or carrier--has identified the \noverpayment prior to receiving the beneficiary's complaint.\n  Some will argue that many seniors and other beneficiaries do not need \npersonal rewards for fighting fraud, and in any event, this is a matter \nof national duty. While I agree with this contention, I also recognize \nthat these individuals would not be able to identify and report fraud \nwithout having access to the itemized bills that this legislation \nprovides. Moreover, I see nothing wrong with giving beneficiaries an \nadded financial incentive. After all, we pay Federal employees for \nideas that save the taxpayers money, and we pay private citizens for \nidentifying fraud by defense contractors.\n  Mr. President, there is no inconsistency between this amendment and \nthe Abraham amendment which passed today. Their objectives are entirely \ncompatible. However, the Abraham amendment effectively delegates \nresponsibility for planning the whistleblower program to the Secretary \nof HHS. I strongly believe that we should fulfill our legislative \nresponsibility by specifying the parameters of this important antifraud \nprogram. Otherwise, we should not be surprised if we end up with \nsomething that we had not contemplated and which does not satisfy our \nobjective.\n  Mr. President, I will not request a vote on this amendment, because \nwe have already had a vote on the Abraham amendment. However, for the \nreasons that I outlined, I hope that the conferees will agree that this \nis a preferable whistleblower provision and that they will adopt it in \nthe conference report. In so doing, I believe that the conferees should \nretain the provisions of the Abraham amendment that reward individuals \nfor ideas that improve Medicare.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 BROWN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2969\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Santorum, Mr. McCain, and \nMr. Craig) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1357, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of chapter 8 of subtitle I of title XII, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC.   . $1,000,000 COMPENSATION DEDUCTION LIMIT EXTENDED TO \n                   ALL EMPLOYEES OF ALL CORPORATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(m) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``publicly held corporation'' in paragraph \n     (1) and inserting ``taxpayer (other than personal service \n     corporations)'',\n       (2) by striking ``covered employee'' each place it appears \n     in paragraphs (1) and (4) and inserting ``employee'', and\n       (3) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3) and redesignating \n     paragraph (4) as paragraph (3).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995, except that there shall not be taken into account with \n     respect to any employee to whom section 162(m) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies solely by reason of \n     such amendments remuneration payable under a written binding \n     contract which was in effect on October 25, 1995, and which \n     was not modified thereafter in any material respect before \n     such remuneration is paid.\n       (c) Use of Revenues.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, the Commissioner of Social Security shall increase \n     the earnings limit otherwise determined for each year under \n     section 203 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 403) by an \n     amount which takes into account the increase in revenues for \n     such year as estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     resulting from the amendment to section 162(m)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 made by the Balanced Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 HARKIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2970\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Biden) proposed an \namendment to the bill S. 1357, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike Chapter 6 of Title VII except for the text of \n     amendment number 2950 as passed by the Senate and insert in \n     lieu thereof, the following:\n\n           CHAPTER 6--HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE PREVENTION\n\n     SEC. 7100.

The federal minimum wage has not been \n     raised since 1991; and\n       ``(2) The value of the minimum wage, after being adjusted \n     for the bite of inflation, is at its second lowest annual \n     level since 1955, with purchasing power 26 percent below its \n     average level during the 1970s and 35 percent below its peak \n     value in 1968, and unless it is increased it will in 1996 \n     have its lowest value in over 40 years; and\n       ``(3) The value of the minimum wage as a percentage of the \n     average nonsupervisory wage averaged 52.2 percent during the \n     decade of the 1960s, 45.8 percent during the decade of the \n     1970s, 40.4 percent during the decade of the 1980s, and \n     currently is 37.7 percent; and\n       ``(4) The minimum wage earned by a full-time worker over a \n     year fails to provide sufficient income for a family of three \n     to provide that family a standard of living even reaching the \n     national poverty level, and, in fact, provides an income that \n     equals only 70 percent of the federal poverty level for a \n     family of three; and\n       ``(5) There are 4.7 million Americans who usually work \n     full-time but who are, nevertheless, in poverty, and 4.2 \n     million families live in poverty despite having one or more \n     members in the labor force for at least half the year; and\n       ``(6) Nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults, \n     and 60 percent are women; and\n       ``(7) The decline in the value of the minimum wage since \n     1979 has contributed to Americans' growing income disparity \n     and to the fact that 97 percent of the growth in household \n     income has accrued to the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans \n     during this period; and\n       ``(8) The effects of the minimum wage are not felt only \n     among the lowest income workers and families but also are \n     felt in many middle-income families; and\n       ``(9) The preponderance of evidence from economic studies \n     of the effects of increases in federal and state minimum \n     wages (including studies of state minimum wage increases in \n     California and New Jersey) at the end of the 1980s and in the \n     early 1990s suggests that the negative employment effects of \n     such increases were slight to nonexistent; and\n       ``(10) Legislation to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an \n     hour was introduced on February 14, 1995, but has not been \n     debated by the Senate--\n       ``Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Senate should debate and vote on whether to raise the minimum \n     wage before the end of the first session of the 104th \n     Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n\n              MURKOWSKI (AND JOHNSTON) AMENDMENT NO. 2980\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Murkowski, for himself and Mr. Johnston) proposed \nan amendment to the bill S. 1357, supra; as follows:\n\n       (1) On page 304, line 20, delete ``follows:'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``follows (except that all amounts in excess of \n     $20,000,000 in fiscal year 2003 and all amounts in fiscal \n     year 2004 shall not be available for obligation until fiscal \n     year 2006):''.\n       (2) On page 361, line 7, delete ``thereafter,'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``thereafter, except for fiscal years 2003 \n     and 2004,''.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                KENNEDY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2981\n Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Moynihan, \n   Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Exon, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Simon, and Mr. Graham) \n     proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1357, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike section 12807.\n                                 ______\n\n\n              WELLSTONE (AND FEINGOLD) AMENDMENT NO. 2982\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Feingold) proposed and amendment \nto the bill S. 1357, supra; as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S15869]]\n\n       At the end of chapter 1 of subtitle I of title XII, insert:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Each State \n     shall receive the value of commodities allocated under this \n     paragraph.\n       (2) 40 percent of such total value of commodities shall be \n     allocated in a manner such that the value of commodities \n     allocated to each State bears the same ratio to 40 percent of \n     such total value as the average monthly number of unemployed \n     persons within the State bears to the average monthly number \n     of unemployed persons within all States during the same \n     fiscal year. Each State shall receive the value of \n     commodities allocated to the State under this paragraph.\n       (b)(1) The Secretary shall notify each State of the amount \n     of commodities that such State is allotted to receive under \n     subsection (a) or this subsection, if applicable.

On such a notification by a \n     State, the Secretary shall reallocate and distribute such \n     commodities in a manner the Secretary deems appropriate and \n     equitable. The Secretary shall further establish procedures \n     to permit States to decline to receive portions of such \n     allocation during each fiscal year in a manner the State \n     determines \n\n[[Page S15954]]\n\n     is appropriate and the Secretary shall reallocate and \n     distribute such allocation as the Secretary deems appropriate \n     and equitable.\n       (2) In the event of any drought, flood, hurricane, or other \n     natural disaster affecting substantial numbers of persons in \n     a State, county, or parish, the Secretary may request that \n     States unaffected by such a disaster consider assisting \n     affected States by allowing the Secretary to reallocate \n     commodities from such unaffected State to States containing \n     areas adversely affected by the disaster.\n       (c) Purchases of commodities under this chapter shall be \n     made by the Secretary at such times and under such conditions \n     as the Secretary determines appropriate within each fiscal \n     year. All commodities so purchased for each such fiscal year \n     shall be delivered at reasonable intervals to States based on \n     the allocations and reallocations made under subsections (a) \n     and (b), and or carry out section 9760, not later than \n     December 31 of the following fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 9756.

If a State agency is unable to use all of the \n     funds so allocated to it, the Secretary shall reallocate such \n     unused funds among the other States in a manner the Secretary \n     deems appropriate and equitable.\n       (2)(A) A State shall make available in each fiscal year to \n     eligible recipient agencies in the State not less than 40 \n     percent of the funds received by the State under paragraph \n     (1) for such fiscal year, as necessary to pay for, or provide \n     advance payments to cover, the allowable expenses of eligible \n     recipient agencies for distributing commodities to needy \n     persons, but only to the extent such expenses are actually so \n     incurred by such recipient agencies.\n       (B) As used in this paragraph, the term ``allowable \n     expenses'' includes--\n       (i) costs of transporting, storing, handling, repackaging, \n     processing, and distributing commodities incurred after such \n     commodities are received by eligible recipient agencies;\n       (ii) costs associated with determinations of eligibility, \n     verification, and documentation;\n       (iii) costs of providing information to persons receiving \n     commodities under this chapter concerning the appropriate \n     storage and preparation of such commodities; and\n       (iv) costs of recordkeeping, auditing, and other \n     administrative procedures required for participation in the \n     program under this chapter.\n       (C) If a State makes a payment, using State funds, to cover \n     allowable expenses of eligible recipient agencies, the amount \n     of such payment shall be counted toward the amount a State \n     must make available for allowable expenses of recipient \n     agencies under this paragraph.\n       (3) States to which funds are allocated for a fiscal year \n     under this subsection shall submit financial reports to the \n     Secretary, on a regular basis, as to the use of such funds. \n     No such funds may be used by States or eligible recipient \n     agencies for costs other than those involved in covering the \n     expenses related to the distribution of commodities by \n     eligible recipient agencies.\n       (4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), to be \n     eligible to receive funds under this subsection, a State \n     shall provide in cash or in kind (according to procedures \n     approved by the Secretary for certifying these in-kind \n     contributions) from non-Federal sources a contribution equal \n     to the difference between--\n       (i) the amount of such funds so received; and\n       (ii) any part of the amount allocated to the State and paid \n     by the State--\n       (I) to eligible recipient agencies; or\n       (II) for the allowable expenses of such recipient \n     agencies;for use in carrying out this chapter.\n       (B) Funds allocated to a State under this section may, upon \n     State request, be allocated before States satisfy the \n     matching requirement specified in subparagraph (A), based on \n     the estimated contribution required. The Secretary shall \n     periodically reconcile estimated and actual contributions and \n     adjust allocations to the State to correct for overpayments \n     and underpayments.\n       (C) Any funds distributed for administrative costs under \n     section 9760(b) shall not be covered by this paragraph.\n       (5) States may not charge for commodities made available to \n     eligible recipient agencies, and may not pass on to such \n     recipient agencies the cost of any matching requirements, \n     under this chapter.\n       (c) Value of Commodities.--The value of the commodities \n     made available under subsections (c) and (d) of section 9752, \n     and the funds of the Corporation used to pay the costs of \n     initial processing, packaging (including forms suitable for \n     home use), and delivering commodities to the States shall not \n     be charged against appropriations authorized by this section.\n\n     SEC. 9760.

Administrative costs \n     for the purposes of the commodity supplemental food program \n     shall include, but not be limited to, expenses for \n     information and referral, operation, monitoring, nutrition \n     education, start-up costs, and general administration, \n     including staff, warehouse and transportation personnel, \n     insurance, and administration of the State or local office.\n       (c)(1) During each fiscal year the commodity supplemental \n     food program is in operation, the types, varieties, and \n     amounts of commodities to be purchased under this section \n     shall be determined by the Secretary, but, if the Secretary \n     proposes to make any significant changes in the types, \n     varieties, or amounts from those that were available or were \n     planned at the beginning of the fiscal year the Secretary \n     shall report such changes before implementation to the \n     Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation shall, to the extent that the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation inventory levels permit, provide \n     not less than 9,000,000 pounds of cheese and not less than \n     4,000,000 pounds of nonfat dry milk in each of the fiscal \n     years 1996 through 2000 to the Secretary. The Secretary shall \n     use such amounts of cheese and nonfat dry milk to carry out \n     the commodity supplemental food program before the end of \n     each fiscal year.\n       (d) The Secretary shall, in each fiscal year, approve \n     applications of additional sites for the program, including \n     sites that serve only elderly persons, in areas in which the \n     program currently does not operate, to the full extent that \n     applications can be approved within the appropriations \n     available for the \n\n[[Page S15955]]\n\n     program for the fiscal year and without reducing actual \n     participation levels (including participation of elderly \n     persons under subsection (e)) in areas in which the program \n     is in effect.\n       (e) If a local agency that administers the commodity \n     supplemental food program determines that the amount of funds \n     made available to the agency to carry out this section \n     exceeds the amount of funds necessary to provide assistance \n     under such program to women, infants, and children, the \n     agency, with the approval of the Secretary, may permit low-\n     income elderly persons (as defined by the Secretary) to \n     participate in and be served by such program.\n       (f)(1) If it is necessary for the Secretary to pay a \n     significantly higher than expected price for one or more \n     types of commodities purchased under this section, the \n     Secretary shall promptly determine whether the price is \n     likely to cause the number of persons that can be served in \n     the program in a fiscal year to decline.\n       (2) If the Secretary determines that such a decline would \n     occur, the Secretary shall promptly notify the State agencies \n     charged with operating the program of the decline and shall \n     ensure that a State agency notify all local agencies \n     operating the program in the State of the decline.\n       (g) Commodities distributed to States pursuant to this \n     section shall not be considered in determining the commodity \n     allocation to each State under section 9755 or priority of \n     distribution under section 9756.\n\n     SEC. 9761.

Mr. President, I would like to take this time to \nexplain my votes on various amendments to the Commerce, Justice, State \nappropriations bill which passed on September 29.\n  The Specter amendment sought to strike the language from this bill \nthat prohibited the use of Federal funds for abortions for women in \nFederal prison except where the life of the mother would be in danger \nif the fetus were carried to term or in the case of rape.\n  The House and the Senate have repeatedly upheld the position that \nwhen taxpayer funds are used for abortions, the abortions should be \nrestricted to those pregnancies which are the result of rape or incest \nor which pose a risk to the life of the mother. I do not think these \nrestrictions should be expanded for women in prison and, therefore, I \nvoted to table the Specter amendment.\n  Senator Kerrey offered an amendment to provide $19.8 million for the \nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration's \ninformation infrastructure grants by cutting a like amount from the \nJustice Department's travel account. I opposed this amendment for \nseveral reasons. First, many of the NTIA's duties are duplicative of \nthose carried out by the Federal Communications Commission. The \nunderlying bill moves us toward a unified telecommunications entity, \nand I believe it is the correct path to take. Second, the \ninfrastructure grants are an unauthorized program that have little \nrelation to the job of regulating the telecommunications industry. \nLegislation I have sponsored to terminate the Department of Commerce \nwould also eliminate the advisory and grant making functions and \ntransfer the management duties to the FCC.\n  I also opposed a Domenici amendment to eliminate provisions in the \nbill which would, in my opinion, vastly improve the Legal Services \nCorporation.\n  The Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill in the Senate \neliminated the Federal Corporation and block-granted to the States-\nFederal funds for the provision of legal services to the poor. The \nDomenici amendment to this bill would have restored the Federal \nCorporation and provides additional Federal funding for the \nCorporation.\n  I support eliminating the Federal Corporation and block-granting \nfunds \n\n[[Page S15972]]\n\nfor legal assistance for the poor to the States. The Corporation itself \nprovides no legal services to the poor, but rather grants Federal money \nto local organizations that give legal assistance to the poor. This is \na function the States can perform at least as effectively as the \nCorporation has.\n  I also opposed an amendment which was sponsored by Senators Kohl and \nCohen which took $80 million from funding for the FBI to combat violent \ncrime and terrorism and put it into $30 million for local block grants \nfor various social programs such as boys and girls club, more palatably \ndubbed by the sponsors of such measures crime prevention programs, $30 \nmillion for additional grants made by the Office of Justice Assistance, \nand $20 million for additional grants for ``Weed and Seed'' programs.\n  The initiatives the sponsors sought to fund may well be worthy. In my \njudgment, however, many of them have no proven record of helping with \nthe fight against crime, the purpose for which Federal crime money \nshould be reserved. To be sure, the sponsors designated between 2 and 3 \npercent of the money for evaluation of these programs. But in the first \nplace it is unlikely that serious evaluation can be performed with that \nbudget; and in the second place, in my view, we should evaluate the \nprograms before giving them additional funding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15971-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15972-S15973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there has been much talk recently \nabout how our Government is no longer able to solve society's problems, \nhow it is unresponsive to citizens' needs, how people feel they do not \nhave a say in how their country is run, and how it seems that when the \nGovernment makes decisions that affect industry, it does not seek their \ninput beforehand. Well, I would like to share with my Senate colleagues \na story that should help give a different perception.\n  It is a story about a mother who suffered a terrible tragedy and \nthrough it, summoned the strength and courage to help solve a serious \nproblem across the country. The story is about Thelma Sibley, a woman \nfrom Milan, MI, who experienced the worst nightmare of any parent--the \ndeath of her child Nancy. Nancy Sibley died from a hidden hazard that \nno parent could be expected to anticipate. Nancy Sibley was strangled \nto death by the drawstring of her winter coat when the drawstring \ncaught on a playground slide.\n  After her child's death, Thelma Sibley became dedicated to ensuring \nthat no other parent would have to relive her experience. Thelma Sibley \nlooked to the Government for help and answers. As it happened, Ann \nBrown had recently been appointed Chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product \nSafety Commission. Chairman Brown was well aware of the danger \ndrawstrings presented and reached out to Thelma for help in solving \nthis problem. Working together, Thelma Sibley and Ann Brown were able \nto bring together representatives from the Nation's 33 leading \nmanufacturers of children's clothing. When these industry officials \nwere presented with the evidence of what these drawstrings were capable \nof doing, there was no hesitation in their decision to remove \ndrawstrings from virtually all of the 20 million kid's garments \nmanufactured annually in this country.\n  It is indeed a remarkable story. I commend Thelma Sibley for her \ncourage, and CPSC Chairman Ann Brown for bringing a human face to \nGovernment by reaching out personally to Thelma Sibley and working \nvoluntarily with industry to solve this problem. I ask that the text of \na Los Angeles Times article detailing this story be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                            A Powerful Pair\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Mehren)\n\n       BETHESDA, Md.--This could be the story of the bureaucrat \n     and the bereaved mother. Except that neither Ann Brown nor \n     Thelma Sibley comes close to either stereotype.\n       Brown is a mother of two, grandmother of three and full-\n     time advocate for children. As vice president of the Consumer \n     Federation of America, she was such a thorn in the side of \n     the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission that many \n     staffers feared her name. Imagine their reaction in March, \n     1994, when President Clinton named her to head the agency she \n     so relentlessly watchdogged.\n       Sibley and her husband, Bob, live on a small farm in \n     Michigan, where for 20 years she has worked as a color and \n     soft-trim designer in the automotive industry. At 46, Sibley \n     is a devout Baptist and projects the kind of calm that \n     bespeaks solid, sensible values. She is probably one of a \n     handful of Americans who refer to Hillary Rodham Clinton as \n     ``the First Mom.''\n       On Jan. 4, 1994, Sibley's 5-year-old daughter, Nancy, was \n     killed when the drawstring on her winter coat snagged on a \n     spiral slide at her school playground and strangled her. The \n     paths of Brown and Sibley were tied together by that \n     drawstring. Both women see the friendship and collaboration \n     that has blossomed between them as something organic, \n     something vital and something that was probably preordained.\n       In her office here on the outskirts of Washington, Brown \n     explained, ``Were both strong women, determined women and \n     women of faith. We're also both extremely pragmatic.''\n       With a perfect poker face, Sibley--a full head taller and \n     12 years younger than the small, compact Brown--remarked, \n     ``We're twins. But we were separated at birth.''\n       In Sibley's case, ridding the children's clothing world of \n     the slender string that claimed Nancy's life became a \n     crusade. She remembers all too well how after Nancy's death, \n     her own words--the words of so many parents whose children \n     succumb to tragically preventable accidents--kept pounding in \n     her ears: ``If I'd only known.''\n       If she'd only known, she would never have bought a coat \n     with a drawstring. If she'd only known, she would have ripped \n     out the drawstrings on every item in Nancy's wardrobe. Never \n     mind that it was January in Michigan--if she'd only known, \n     she wouldn't have bundled Nancy into a hood that closed tight \n     with a string.\n       After the death of a child, two extreme reactions are \n     common. In one scenario, mothers and fathers descend into a \n     paralyzing miasma. Even the most ordinary of daily activities \n     drains them. Conversely, some parents spin into a maelstrom \n     of action. Psychologists call the latter response agitated \n     depression.\n       That description captures the flurry of energy Thelma \n     Sibley experienced after Nancy died. For a full seven months, \n     her grief manifested itself kinetically. She ran on high \n     speed but felt nothing. ``I believe God put me in a numb \n     chamber because he knew I had a job to get done,'' Sibley \n     said.\n       The job began when, reviewing a report to the school board \n     of Ann Arbor, where Nancy's accident occurred, Sibley came \n     across the name of the Consumer Production Safety Commission. \n     ``I had never heard of the agency before that,'' She said.\n       While it made sense to Sibley that the school board and \n     possibly her own state might investigate Nancy's death, she \n     had no such expectations from the federal government. She \n     viewed Washington as remote and alien, too tied up with \n     politics to care much about people. ``I was very surprised \n     there actually was a federal agency, and that they were \n     actually going to do a report,'' Sibley said.\n       She was also stunned to discover that drawstrings had been \n     removed from children's clothing in Great Britain in 1976. In \n     the same report she learned that the Canadian province of \n     Ontario, just across the border from Michigan, had taken \n     similar action in 1988, following the drawstring \n     strangulations of five children. Her research also revealed \n     that Nancy was one of a dozen American children to succumb to \n     drawstrings since 1985. The strings were associated with an \n     additional 27 nonfatal accidents.\n       ``I thought, wait a minute, I live in Ann Arbor, Mich. \n     We're not talking Upper Yukon here. How come I didn't know \n     this?'' Sibley said.\n       Sibley did what she always does in crisis. She prayed. The \n     next thing she knew, she was writing to ``the First Mom.'' \n     She and her husband were not blaming anyone for their \n     daughters death, Sibley wrote, but rather were seeking the \n     voluntary removal of accessories on children's clothing that \n     might cause harm. Since Nancy's accident occurred on an old, \n     outdated slide that was subsequently dismantled, the Sibley's \n     also wanted their child's death to help raise awareness about \n     playground safety.\n       The White House wasted no time in forwarding Sibley's \n     entreaty to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the same \n     agency to which Sibley was referred when she contacted the \n     Consumer's Union and Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's \n     organization. This is where the tale takes on a Twilight Zone \n     quality not normally found in stories concerning the federal \n     government, for Brown, newly installed as chairwoman of the \n     agency she once loved to hate, had already taken steps both \n     to ban drawstrings from kids' clothes and to contact Thelma \n     Sibley.\n       ``There was a confluence,'' Brown said. ``Both of us are \n     convinced it was meant to be.''\n       In Michigan, the inquiry into Nancy Sibley's death made \n     headlines in April, 1994, three months after the death and \n     just weeks after Brown began her government job. Although it \n     was a Sunday when Brown came across the Sibley file, she \n     instantly picked up the phone and called Nancy's parents.\n       As Brown knew from decades of activism, personal contact \n     with parents is often a first step toward enlisting them as \n     catalysts of change. Nearly 30 years ago, Brown took up her \n     mission when her daughter Laura, then 2, began chewing on \n     what looked like a piece of cherry candy--but turned out to \n     be a potentially poisonous paint pellet. Brown and \n\n[[Page S15973]]\n\n     Sibley were soon brainstorming--and later, barnstorming.\n       By then Brown was well aware of the hazards that \n     drawstrings posed for children. She knew about the steps \n     taken in Britain and thought American children were ``just as \n     valuable as British children.'' In addition, Brown said, \n     ``There was already an existing memo about drawstrings, right \n     here, but nothing had been done.''\n       She also understood the perils of bureaucratic blockage. \n     Legislating compliance was an invitation to inaction, Brown \n     maintained. In a congressional setting, a children's issue \n     was likely to be marginalized, watered-down and tacked on to \n     some unrelated measure, she thought.\n       So Sibley and Brown called upon a secret weapon known by \n     parents to be fearsome, and usually foolproof. ``Peer \n     pressure,'' Sibley said, nodding knowingly. Brown called a \n     manufacturers' summit conference. No pressure, she said to \n     representatives of the 33 leading makers of kids' clothes who \n     came to her office soon after she brought Sibley onto her \n     team. No threats, Sibley added: ``no lawyers bugging them.''\n       With no opposition, drawstrings were quietly removed from \n     virtually all of the 20 million children's garments \n     manufactured annually in this country. The low-key, \n     collaborative approach avoided legislative logjams and \n     eliminated any sense of government coercion.\n       A quick tour of kids' or discount stores shows that where \n     one year ago there were drawstrings, now there is Velcro, \n     elastic or safety flaps to secure a hood or hat.\n       Compliance was basically a ``nobrainer,'' said Deborah \n     Siegel, general counsel for Baby Guess/Guess Kids in Los \n     Angeles. ``I'm not sure how many companies were aware of what \n     had happened [to Nancy Sibley and other children],'' she \n     said. But once the problem was pointed out by Brown and \n     Sibley, ``it was fairly simple'' to make the necessary design \n     changes.\n       Sibley and Brown agree that the move toward safer \n     childern's clothing was a fitting memorial for Nancy. But it \n     was by no means the end of their teamwork--nor, they hope, \n     their triumphs. Sibley has channeled her determination into a \n     push to improve playground safety.\n       She and Brown have taped several video spots showing how \n     parents can monitor classroom and playground equipment that \n     may have been produced or installed before current standards \n     were enforced. Much of this equipment is poorly \n     maintained, and a great deal of it is too high off the \n     ground. In many areas, children still tumble onto hard \n     concrete rather than softer wood chips. Tattered old \n     swings can collapse if a child pushes the sky.\n       In the course of working together, Sibley and Brown have \n     developed a remarkable relationship. They are girlfriends, \n     and both know this form of friendship to be as mighty as any \n     corporate conglomeration. When Sibley is in Washington, she \n     stays at Brown's house. They work a full day together, then \n     go home and throw on their bathrobes. Over a glass of wine, \n     they settle the problems of the planet while Brown's husband \n     fixes dinner.\n       ``I want you to understand,'' Brown said, ``I do not invite \n     every-one I work with at this agency to come and stay at my \n     house.''\n       But here's where the girlfriend connection tugs hard, and \n     where the link of motherhood builds fierce bonds. Ann Brown \n     never met Nancy Sibley. But she knows that the brown-eyed \n     girl Bob and Thelma Sibley adopted in infancy was a long-\n     awaited gift. She has heard how Thelma Sibley did the \n     vacuuming with Nancy in a backpack. She knows how much the \n     Sibleys miss Nancy's zeal, her passion and her empathy for \n     people. She instinctively reaches over and clutches Sibley's \n     hand as Sibley recalls how Nancy used to brag that she looked \n     just like Mommy. At this disclosure, both women's eyes cloud \n     up.\n       In the pyramid of Washington, Brown's agency is nobody's \n     idea of a powerhouse. The Consumer Product Safety Commission \n     narrowly escaped extermination in recent cutbacks, and its \n     current budget remains close to what it was more than a \n     decade ago. Until Brown took over, the commission was widely \n     viewed as moribund.\n       ``Wrong,'' Sibley corrected. ``Dead.''\n       But Brown and Sibley feel certain that a heavenly \n     cheerleader is breathing life into their efforts. Their work \n     is not just in Nancy's memory, Sibley said, ``it's in her \n     honor.''\n       Parents who have not lost children often nod approvingly \n     when mothers like Sibley take up a cause. Catharsis is a word \n     you often hear. But parents of dead children know that true \n     catharsis is elusive, if it is attainable at all. The hole in \n     your heart is there forever. Still, said Sibley, who has kept \n     her day job in the auto industry while pursuing her unpaid \n     work with Brown, ``You don't cling to `if only I'd \n     known'''forever.\n       ``That's fine for a few months,' Sibley said. ``But for me, \n     that's not inner healing. Inner healing is doing something.''\n\n\n           Top Ten Giveaways In Senate Republican Budget Bill\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, from the home office in Beebe \nPlain, VT, I bring you the top 10 giveaways in the Republican budget \nbill.\n  10. ``What's white and black all over? A polar bear in an Arctic oil \nfield.'' The bill opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and \ngas drilling.\n  9. ``You don't go to jail for this?'' The bill would permit companies \nto withdraw excess assets from their pension plans.\n  8. ``One more write-off for the road.'' The bill would allow \nconvenience stores with a gas pump to depreciate their property over 15 \nyears instead of the less generous 39-year period available for other \nconvenience stores.\n  7. ``And you thought baseball owners were greedy.'' The bill would \nallow the American College Football Coaches Association to avoid tax \npenalties and stop an IRS challenge of its pension plan.\n  6. ``The oil is on the House.'' The bill eliminates the 12.5-percent \nroyalty oil companies used to pay to drill for deep-water oil.\n  5. ``You can keep the gems--but we're charging you for the dirt.'' In \nexchange for taking $2 to $3 billion of minerals each year from public \nlands, mining corporations return a measly $18 million to taxpayers \nunder this bill.\n  4. ``This should keep' em down on the farm.'' The bill would lift the \ncurrent $75,000 cap on profits per farmer under Department of \nAgriculture marketing loan programs so the sky is the limit for wealthy \nfarmers.\n  3. ``Oh, I thought nurses came with the nursing home.'' The bill \nrepeals national requirements for nursing homes to provide proper \nhealth standards--a loophole that will be seized by some to lower the \nquality of care and life for grandparents and parents.\n  2. ``Say Aaaah.'' The bill repeals patient protection against \nexcessive doctors' bills, allowing doctors to go after seniors for \ncharges not reimbursed by Medicare.\n  1. ``Rich guys finish first.'' The bill would give the top one \npercent of wealthy Americans an average tax break of $5,600 per year \nwhile raising taxes on 51 percent of American families --those who earn \nless than $30,000 a year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15972-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15973-S15974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, as Plato stated in his Republic, \nany society which would be strong and healthy, must ensure that every \ncitizen finds an occupation which best suits his or her individual \ntalents. Such a philosophy resonates through the halls of our Nation's \nvocational schools, and today I rise to honor the oldest vocational \nschool in the country, the Middlesex County Vocational and Technical \nHigh School of New Brunswick, NJ.\n  In the United States, vocational schools play a vital role in \nmaintaining a balance in occupations that are needed to make our \nsociety tick and our economy hum. Vocational schools recognize the fact \nthat young adults have talents that lie in a wide range of areas. A \nnatural bent toward mechanics or carpentry which might be left untapped \nin the normal high school environment, is brought to light, cultivated \nand celebrated in a vocational high school.\n  Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to recognize the Middlesex \nCounty Vocational and Technical High School, the Nation's oldest such \ninstitution. In 1913, the New Jersey State Legislature of Public Law \npassed chapter 294, providing for the establishment of county \nvocational schools. A year later, H. Brewster Willis approved a plan to \ncreate a vocational school system in Middlesex County. Soon after, \nschools were set up in New Brunswick, Perth Amboy and Jamesburg which \ntaught such skills as mechanical drawing, carpentry, printing, cooking, \ndressmaking and agriculture.\n  Enrollment increased steadily over the years, and the influx of \ntalented students spurred the board of education to create new schools \nand to expand existing ones. New courses were added and different age \ngroups included as the program began to grow and realize its full \npotential. In 1949, the State board of education approved the \nestablishment of the Middlesex County Adult Technical School for the \npurpose of providing full-time pre-employment training for adults in \nskilled trades and technical occupations. Today, the Middlesex County \nVocational and Technical Schools remain a thriving and essential part \nof New Jersey's economic community. Therefore, I am pleased today to \nhave the opportunity to honor the Middlesex County Vocational and \n\n[[Page S15974]]\n\nTechnical Schools on the anniversary of its establishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15973-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15974-S15975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WHAT THE '93 TAX INCREASE REALLY DID\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the former Chairman of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, Martin Feldstein, just wrote an article \nfor the Wall Street Journal about the 1993 tax increase.\n  For many of us, it confirms what we have been saying all along: that \ntax rate increases and tax cuts change people's behavior. Just because \nthe Government increases taxes doesn't mean that people will pay more \nto the Treasury. They will respond to the higher rates by earning less, \nproducing less, and investing less.\n  That is precisely what Mr. Feldstein found. He wrote:\n\n       Because taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal \n     tax rates (imposed by President Clinton in 1993) by reducing \n     their taxable incomes, the Treasury lost two-thirds of the \n     extra revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had \n     not changed their behavior. Moreover, while the Treasury \n     gained less than $6 billion in additional personal income tax \n     revenue, the distortions to taxpayers' behavior depressed \n     their real incomes by nearly $25 billion.\n\n  Mr. President, tax rate increases are counterproductive. If the goal \nis to increase revenues to the Treasury, the better alternative is to \ncut tax rates.\n  Lower tax rates stimulate the economy, resulting in more taxable \nincome and transactions, and more revenue to the Treasury. The tax cuts \nof the early 1980's are a case in point. Revenues increased from $599.3 \nbillion in fiscal year 1981 to $990.7 billion in fiscal year 1989--up \nabout 65 percent.\n  The tax bill before the Senate today begins to undo some of the \ndamage done by the 1993 tax increase that President Clinton now \ndisavows. As Martin Feldstein points out, however, it does not go far \nenough. Congress should also revisit the issue next year to consider \nrolling back the personal tax rate increases that were part of the \nClinton tax bill.\n  I ask that the entire text of Mr. Feldstein's article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     [From The Wall Street Journal]\n\n                 What the '93 Tax Increases Really Did\n\n                         (By Martin Feldstein)\n\n       President Clinton was right when he recently told business \n     groups in Virginia and Texas that he had raised taxes too \n     much in 1993, perhaps more so than he realizes. We now have \n     the first hard evidence on the effect of the Clinton tax rate \n     increases. The new data, published by the Internal Revenue \n     Service, show that the sharp jump in tax rates raised only \n     one-third as much revenue as the Clinton administration had \n     predicted.\n       Because taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal \n     tax rates by reducing their taxable incomes, the Treasury \n     lost two-thirds of the extra revenue that would have been \n     collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior. \n     Moreover, while the Treasury gained less than $6 billion in \n     additional personal income tax revenue, the distortions to \n     taxpayers' behavior depressed their real incomes by nearly \n     $25 billion.\n\n\n                             how it happens\n\n       To understand how taxpayer behavior could produce such a \n     large revenue shortfall, recall that the Clinton plan raised \n     the marginal personal income tax rate to 36% from 31% on \n     incomes between $140,000 ($115,000 for single taxpayers) and \n     $250,000, and to 39.6% on all incomes over $250,000. \n     Relatively small reductions in taxable income in response to \n     these sharply higher rates can eliminate most or all of the \n     additional tax revenue that would result with no behavioral \n     response.\n       If a couple with $200,000 of taxable income reduces its \n     income by just 5% in response to the higher tax rate, the \n     Treasury loses more from the $10,000 decline in income \n     ($3,100 less revenue at 31%) than it gains from the higher \n     tax rate on the remaining $50,000 of income above the \n     $140,000 floor ($2,500 more revenue at 5%); the net effect is \n     that the Treasury collects $600 less than it would have if \n     there had been no tax rate increase.\n       Similarly, a couple with $400,000 of taxable income would \n     pay $18,400 in extra taxes if its taxable income remained \n     unchanged. But if that couple responds to the nearly 30% \n     marginal tax rate increase by cutting its taxable income by \n     as little as 8%, the Treasury's revenue gain would fall 67% \n     to less than $6,000.\n       How can taxpayers reduce their taxable incomes in this way? \n     Self-employed taxpayers, two-earner couples, and senior \n     executives can reduce their taxable earnings by a combination \n     of working fewer hours, taking more vacations, and shifting \n     compensation from taxable cash to untaxed fringe benefits. \n     Investors can shift from taxable bonds and high yield stocks \n     to tax exempt bonds and to stocks with lower dividends. \n     Individuals can increase tax deductible mortgage borrowing \n     and raise charitable contributions. (I ignore reduced \n     realizations of capital gains because the 1993 tax rate \n     changes did not raise the top capital gains rate above its \n     previous 28% level.)\n       To evaluate the magnitude of the taxpayers' actual \n     responses, Daniel Feenberg at the National Bureau of Economic \n     Research (NBER) and I studied the published IRS estimates of \n     the 1992 and 1993 taxable incomes of high income taxpayers \n     (i.e., taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000, \n     corresponding to about $140,000 of taxable income). We \n     compared the growth of such incomes with the corresponding \n     rise in taxable incomes for taxpayers with adjusted gross \n     incomes between $50,000 and $200,000. Since the latter group \n     did not experience a 1993 tax rate change, the increase of \n     their taxable incomes provides a basis for predicting how \n     taxable incomes would have increased in the high income group \n     if its members had not changed their behavior in response to \n     the higher post-1992 tax rates. We calculated this with the \n     help of the NBER's TAXSIM model, a computer analysis of more \n     than 100,000 random, anonymous tax returns provided by the \n     IRS.\n       We concluded that the high income taxpayers reported 8.5% \n     less taxable income in 1993 than they would have if their tax \n     rates had not increased. This in turn reduced the additional \n     tax liabilities of the high income group to less than one-\n     third of what they would have been if they had not changed \n     their behavior in response to the higher tax rates.\n       This sensitivity of taxable income to marginal tax rates is \n     quantitatively similar to the magnitude of the response that \n     I found when I studied taxpayers' responses to the tax rate \n     cuts of 1986. It is noteworthy also that such a strong \n     response to the 1993 tax increases occurred within the first \n     year. It would not be surprising if the taxpayer responses \n     get larger as taxpayers have more time to adjust to the \n     higher tax rates by retiring earlier, by choosing less \n     demanding and less remunerative occupations, by buying larger \n     homes and second homes with new mortgage deductions, etc.\n       The 1993 tax law also eliminated the $135,000 ceiling on \n     the wage and salary income subject to the 2.9% payroll tax \n     for Medicare. When this took effect in January 1994, it \n     raised the tax rate on earnings to 38.9% for taxpayers with \n     incomes between $140,000 and $250,000 and to 42.5% on incomes \n     above $250,000. Although we will have to wait until data are \n     available for 1994 to see the effect of that extra tax rate \n     rise, the evidence for 1993 suggests that taxpayers' \n     responses to the higher marginal tax rates would cut personal \n     income tax revenue by so much that the net additional revenue \n     for eliminating the ceiling on the payroll tax base would be \n     less than $1 billion.\n       All of this stands in sharp contrast to the official \n     revenue estimates produced by the staffs of the Treasury and \n     of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation before the \n     1993 tax legislation was passed. Their estimates were based \n     on the self-imposed ``convention'' of ignoring the effects of \n     tax rate changes on the amount that people work and invest. \n     The combination of that obviously false assumption and a \n     gross underestimate of the other ways in which taxpayer \n     behavior reduces taxable income caused the revenue estimators \n     at the Treasury to conclude that taxpayer behavior would \n     reduce the additional tax revenue raised by the higher rates \n     by only 7%. In contrast, the actual experience shows a \n     revenue reduction that is nearly 10 times as large as the \n     Treasury staff assumed.\n       This experience is directly relevant to the debate about \n     whether Congress should use ``dynamic'' revenue estimates \n     that take into account the effect of taxpayer behavior on tax \n     revenue. The 1993 experience shows that unless such behavior \n     is taken into account, the revenue estimates presented to \n     Congress can grossly overstate the revenue gains from higher \n     tax rates (and the revenue costs of lower tax rates). \n     Although the official revenue estimating staffs claim that \n     their estimates are dynamic because they take into account \n     some taxpayer behavior, the 1993 experience shows that as a \n     practical matter the official estimates are close to being \n     ``static'' no-behavioral-response estimates because they \n     explicitly ignore the effect of taxes on work effort and \n     grossly underestimate the magnitude of other taxpayer \n     responses.\n\n\n                           current proposals\n\n       In Congress had known in 1993 that raising top marginal tax \n     rates from 31% to more than 42% would raise less than $7 \n     billion a year, including the payroll tax revenue as well as \n     the personal income tax revenue, it might not have been \n     possible for President Clinton to get the votes to pass his \n     tax increase.\n       Which brings us back to President Clinton's own statement \n     (half-recanted the next day) that he raised taxes too much in \n     1993. Congress and the president will soon be negotiating \n     about the final shape of the 1995 tax package. The current \n     congressional tax proposals do nothing to repeal the very \n     harmful rate increases of 1993. Rolling back both the \n     personal tax rates and the Medicare payroll tax base to where \n     they were before 1993 would cost less than $7 billion a year \n     in revenue and would raise real national income by more than \n     $25 billion. Now that the evidence is in, Congress and the \n     president should agree to undo a bad mistake.  \n\n[[Page S15975]]\n\n\n                      OAK PARK'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n50th anniversary of the founding of the city of Oak Park, MI. The \nFamily City is most proud of the fact that, despite its great growth \nover the past 50 years, it has remained primarily a residential \ncommunity.\n  Oak Park, MI, was established when voters approved the proposed City \nCharter on October 29, 1945, and decided that the city should remain a \ncommunity of families and homes. Over the years, Oak Park residents \nhave remained committed to keeping home as the center of their \ncommunity. The residents of Oak Park have fought several times to keep \nlarge construction projects from changing the face and the feel of \ntheir community.\n  Soon after its inception, Oak Park was dubbed ``The City with a \nFuture.'' In the 1940's, Oak Park had about a thousand residents and a \nmunicipality of just over 5 square miles, which was originally \ndeveloped in the 19th century from a swampy, densely wooded hunting \nground. Oak Park grew quickly when many World War II veterans took \nadvantage of GI loans to purchase houses and settle in the area. The \ncity was identified as one of the fastest growing municipalities in the \ncountry during the 1950's. It was during this period that the local \ngovernment structured the municipal services that so effectively serve \nits residents. During the 1960's, Oak Park had established itself as a \nmature city with a virtually unchanged population level.\n  The year 1976 was a turning point in Oak Park's history. When it was \nnamed an official Bicentennial City. It is fitting that, during this \ncelebration of the birth of our Nation and the ideals on which it was \nfounded, Oak Park started the transition to the city it is today. Oak \nPark soon began welcoming newcomers from a variety of backgrounds and \nadopted a new motto: ``The Family City.'' The city also initiated a \nprogram which was dedicated to maintaining the cohesiveness of the \ncommunity.\n  Today, Oak Park is a friendly residential community which boasts a \npopulation representing over 70 ethnic groups. It celebrated its varied \nethnic heritage this year with its 11th Annual International Ethnic \nFestival.\n  The city of Oak Park represents the best of what America has to \noffer--a safe, residential community where all people are \nwelcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15974-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15975-S15976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nWorld Population Awareness Week, which is being observed \ninternationally this week. We are all aware of the challenges we will \nface in the next century regarding the world's population. According to \nrecent projections by the United Nations, world population is expected \nto increase by close to 100 million people annually through the year \n2015. Within 20 years, the Earth's population will have sharply \nincreased to total 7.7 billion people. Nearly all of this increase will \nbe in the poorest countries in the world, causing overall increases in \npoverty, illiteracy, environmental problems, hunger, and \nmalnourishment, and a significant strain on the world's natural \nresources. If area populations continue their rapid growth, the \nresulting outcome could have a devastating effect on the United States, \nthe world economy, and our planet.\n  To avoid massive catastrophes, we must begin to reduce run-away \npopulation growth through voluntary, rational, humane means. This is \nthe message of World Population Awareness Week, recognized \ninternationally from October 22-29, 1995. I am proud to say that Rhode \nIsland's Governor Lincoln Almond is one of several State Governors to \nproclaim World Population Awareness Week. In doing so, he asked all \nRhode Islanders to join him in ``supporting the Cairo Program of \nAction,'' a 20-year strategy for stabilizing world population. He also \ncalled on ``all government and private organizations to do their part \nto implement the document.'' I support Governor Almond's proclamation \nand request that his proclamation be printed in the Record.\n  The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in \nCairo, Egypt was the first important step in the worldwide effort to \narrest the huge growth in the world's population. All Americans should \nbe proud of the integral role our delegation played in developing a set \nof recommendations to curb population growth. We must continue to \npromote international efforts to inform people about the consequences \nof dramatic population growth, and I respectfully urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting World Population Awareness Week.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n        The Governor of the State of Rhode Island--Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, world population is currently 5.7 billion, and \n     increasing by nearly 100 million per year, with virtually all \n     of this growth added to the poorest countries and regions; \n     and\n       Whereas, the annual increment to world population is \n     projected to exceed 86 million through the year 2015, with \n     three billion people, the equivalent of the entire world \n     population as recently as 1960, reaching their reproductive \n     years within the next generation; and\n       Whereas, the environmental and economic impacts of this \n     level of growth will almost certainly prevent inhabitants of \n     poorer countries from improving their quality of life, and at \n     the same time, affect the standard of living in more affluent \n     regions; and\n       Whereas, the 1994 International Conference on Population \n     and Development in Cairo, Egypt, crafted a 20-year Program of \n     Action for achieving a more equitable balance between the \n     world's population, environment, and resources, approved by \n     180 nations, including the United States:\n       Now, therefore, I, Lincoln Almond, Governor of the State of \n     Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, do hereby proclaim, \n     October 22-29, 1995 as World Population Awareness Week. In \n     the State of Rhode Island and call on all citizens to join \n     with me in recognizing this important week and supporting the \n     Cairo Program of Action and call on all governments and \n     private organizations to do their part to implement the \n     document.\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAINT FRANCIS ACADEMY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to The \nSaint Francis Academy in honor of their 50th anniversary. For 50 years \nnow, this outstanding institution has provided guidance and direction \nto troubled youths and their families through 40 different \nrehabilitation and therapeutic programs across the United States.\n  With offices in Kansas, Mississippi, New York, Massachusetts, Ohio, \nPennsylvania, and New Mexico, the Saint Francis Academy helps hundreds \nof children and teenagers develop into responsible and successful \nadults. Even more impressive is the fact that the Saint Francis Academy \nprogram has achieved a scientifically documented success rate of over \n70 percent for youth completing residential treatment. This is among \nthe highest success rate in the United States for an organization of \nthis kind.\n  Founded in 1945 by Father Bob, the academy was originally called the \nSt. Francis Boys' Home. The first residential facility was opened in \nEllsworth, KS with the philosophy of therapy in Christ. Within 3 years, \nanother treatment center in Salina, KS opened and began serving conduct \ndisordered youths age 12 through 18. The Saint Francis Academy has \ngrown progressively within the last 50 years with new programs being \ndeveloped almost every year. In 1990, the academy began an intense 10-\nday therapeutic wilderness program at Lake Placid called the Adirondack \nExperience.\n  In 1945 when Father Bob opened the first facility in Ellsworth, \nyoungsters stayed in the program for an average of 2 to 3 years. Now \nthe average length of time is only 6 to 8 months. The Saint Francis \nAcademy currently helps 150 young men and women achieve success and \nfind personal strength in the spiritual aspect of the programs. They \nare affiliated with the Episcopal Church.\n  The Saint Francis Academy staff follow up with the young men and \nwomen who graduate from the program three times over a period of 5 \nyears. This is probably one of the most fundamental reasons the academy \nis so proud of their high success rate. In fact, two graduates of the \nCamelot program in Lake Placid, NY have gone on to be doctors and \nlawyers.

Mr. President, as President Clinton prepares for \nhis meeting with President Soeharto of Indonesia tomorrow, we are \nhearing a lot about Indonesia's recent economic achievements, and its \ngreat potential for United States investment. I also salute Indonesia's \neconomic success, and believe there are many valuable lessons in \nIndonesia's experience which can be applied to other developing \ncountries throughout the world.\n  But, Mr. President, today I rise to highlight ongoing concerns about \nIndonesia's continuously dismal record on human rights. Repression, \noccupation, and brutality, such as that practiced by Indonesia, are \ningredients for instability, and undermine long-term, sustainable \neconomic growth. In fact, I would submit that unfortunately, \nIndonesia's potential will go unrealized until its human rights record \nimproves.\n  Freedom of expression is under attack by the Indonesian Government. \nIn the past year, gag orders have been placed on controversial figures, \nprominent journalists have been arrested and sentenced to prison, and \nseminars of nongovernmental organizations have been broken up. In \naddition, the country's only independent trade union, the Prosperous \nWorkers Union of Indonesia, is virtually banned, and its members are \nroutinely interrogated and harassed. The Indonesian military regularly \nintercedes in peaceful gatherings with impunity. Foreign business and \nprofessionals cannot function effectively in this kind of environment.\n  In Irian Jaya, there are numerous credible reports of torture, \ndisappearances, and the killing of 16 indigenous people by Indonesian \nforces in the last year.\n  Indonesia's stability also depends upon the military withdrawal from \nthe territory of East Timor. For that reason, it is in the interests of \nPresident Clinton, the international business community, and the donors \nto take an interest and aggressively pursue an effective human rights \nstrategy for Indonesia.\n  Last year, when Presidents Clinton and Soeharto met in Jakarta, \nPresident Clinton gave the issue of human rights attention. However, \nsince then, there has been an escalation of tensions and violence in \nEast Timor.\n  For example, reports of arbitrary detentions and incidents of torture \nby Indonesian soldiers have been continuous all year. Forms of \nIndonesian torture are reported to include electric shocks by cattle \nprod; slashings with razor blades and knives; sleep deprivation; and \nhanging people upside down by their feet.\n  On January 12 of this year, six civilians in Liquicia were reported \nsummarily executed by the Indonesian military. Even the Government-\nappointed National Commission on Human Rights found that there was ``a \nprocess of intimidation and torture by security officials'' which \nresulted in ``unlawful shootings by the military.'' For this, two \nofficers were punished not for murder, but for violating an order from \na superior.\n  There has also been an outbreak of gang violence in East Timor. \nHooded vigilantes, described by residents and human rights monitors as \nmilitary-related bands and commonly known as ``Ninjas,'' have been \nterrorizing, abducting, assaulting, intimidating, and harassing East \nTimorese civilians. Notably, the Ninjas have not been reigned in by the \nsame military that has so effectively suppressed the East Timorese \nopposition. There must be an investigation into the operations of these \ngroups, and why they are permitted to continue terrorizing the East \nTimorese.\n  These recent incidents underscore the need to accelerate the United \nNations sponsored dialog on East Timor with genuine East Timorese \nparticipation. The dialog should be the vehicle by which the numerous \nU.N. resolutions be implemented. The dialog should also be aimed at \ndemilitarizing the territory, and working toward a just resolution that \nrespects the rights of all parties to the conflict.\n  While administration rhetoric has been supportive of the East \nTimorese, United States policy has not been forceful enough. For \nexample, the administration has not applied much pressure to encourage \nthe Indonesians to participate seriously in the U.N. talks. It has \nnever devised a strategy, or requested a plan from the Indonesians, for \ntroop withdrawal from East Timor. There have been few, if any \nsuggestions, of what else the United States can do to leverage human \nrights reform beyond raising the issue.\n  In fact, I often get the feeling that the administration is trying to \nplacate the same Indonesian military that is guilty of so many \nhorrendous abuses. For example, the administration has lobbied \nfervently to get the United States taxpayer to subsidize Indonesian \nmilitary training, when Indonesia has been purchasing IMET courses out \nof its own pocket for the past four years. Now, the administration is \ntrying to sell Indonesia F-16 aircraft, despite a ban on the sale of \nsmall arms which is explicitly linked to human rights violations. \nFurthermore, I am unclear as to what the administration has actually \nexpressed to Indonesia as to what is our human rights policy regarding \nlinkage to arms sales.\n  Tiptoeing around the violence and occupation is not going to work. \nRather, I believe that publicity and international condemnation would \nbe more effective. As a tiger economy, Jakarta has much invested in its \nimage. And its international image should reflect its potential and \naccomplishments. But it should also include Indonesia's brutality and \ndisrespect for human rights.\n  President Clinton has an opportunity here not only to communicate his \nsincere commitment to human rights, but also to implement a substantive \nplan of action which can improve the lot of the East Timorese, and also \nenhance Indonesia's long-term development prospects. President \nSoeharto, who knows well his own country's battle and victory against \nDutch colonialism 50 years ago this year, should understand the \nprinciple of self-determination we are advocating for East \nTimor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15975-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15976-S15977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMEMORATING ARCHILLE LAURO'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to urge you to stand with \nme against the blight of terrorism that is growing throughout the \nworld. We need legislation to toughen our antiterrorism laws in \nresponse to the growth of this scourge. During the tenth anniversary of \nthe hijacking of the Achille Lauro and the killing of one of its \npassengers Leon Klinghoffer, I ask you to take the time to support my \nrequest for such legislation before the United States bears the brunt \nof another terrorist act.\n  Americans are the focus for many terrorist acts overseas. Now, we are \nbecoming targets at home. Americans are increasingly exposed to the \ndeadly realities of terrorism. Ten years ago Leon Klinghoffer was \nsingled out by terrorists for execution and summarily dumped over the \nside of the cruise ship Achille Lauro. The mastermind behind this act, \nAbul Abbas, continues to elude international authorities to this day. \nWe need to be able to run these criminal masterminds to ground wherever \nthey hide.\n  In 1993, terrorists bombed the World Trade Center murdering six \ninnocent people and injuring over 1,000 more. We were lucky the \nstructure withstood the blast and did not collapse. We could have faced \nthousands of murdered people. We need to be able to block the actions \nand designs of international terrorists.\n  Earlier this year, Oklahoma City was targeted by domestic terrorists. \nThis time, Americans were graphically confronted with the specter of \nhundreds of mangled bodies. Our children were viciously mauled by the \npassions of an unstable youth and his accomplices. We need to be able \nto thwart the evil ambitions of such internal fringe groups.\n  Just weeks ago, ten Islamic extremists were found guilty of \nconspiring to carry out a campaign of terrorism and assassination \nagainst New York City landmarks and officials.\n  These incidents highlight the growing threat of terrorism and the \nneed for improved United States' antiterrorism measures. Final passage \nof comprehensive antiterrorist legislation will represent a concrete \nstep toward extinguishing the threat of terrorism by increasing the \ndifficulty and cost in perpetrating heinous acts such as these. We have \nseen terrorism become a way of life for many other nations. We cannot \nallow this complacency to occur in \n\n[[Page S15977]]\n\nthe United States. If anyone such as Abul Abbas or his conspirators can \nbe discovered in our country, perhaps other destructive attacks may be \naverted.\n  Mr. President, on this, the tenth anniversary of the Achille Lauro \ntragedy, the threat of terrorism is undiminished. It is our \nresponsibility to act collectively to thwart forces pursuing these acts \nand to block the financiers condoning international terrorist activity. \nWe need action and we need it now. Our people cannot continue to endure \nthe depridations of these extremist murderers. Thank you Mr. \nPresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15976-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1357\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we have now reached the point where there \nis no further debate time allowed under the statute that governs this \nreconciliation bill, including time allotted to Senator Roth for the \nFinance Committee amendment. I am informed by the Democratic leader \nthat they will have 30 or more amendments or points of order that they \nintend to offer and get votes on prior to passage.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining votes after the \nfirst vote tomorrow be limited to 7\\1/2\\ minutes and each Senator with \nan amendment is asked to submit a one-line description of their \namendment to the chairman for him to read in explanation of the \namendment, and that Senator Mikulski be permitted to offer a motion to \ninstruct the conferees prior to the vote on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain. I am extremely \ndistressed, concerned and apprehensive about what is going to happen \ntomorrow. All night I have been asking to see the amendment that the \nFinance Committee is going to offer as its final amendment in the so-\ncalled tier two. And now at 12:17 a.m., we have yet to receive a copy \nof this amendment.\n  Under the agreement that was reached previously, we are going to be \nplaced in a situation which this amendment of undetermined length but, \nI anticipate, significant length and complexity, is going to be offered \nwith 10 minutes to debate equally divided, and then ostensibly a vote.\n  I object to that procedure, and until a satisfactory resolution can \nbe achieved, either in terms of agreeing to extend the time of debate \nso there can be reasonable opportunity to understand what is in that \nFinance Committee amendment or, if there is an unwillingness to provide \nfor that extended debate, then at a minimum, a reading of the Finance \nCommittee amendment, so that we will all have an opportunity to know \nits contents before we are called on to vote on it, will be insisted \nupon or at least will be a condition of granting consent to the request \nwhich has now been made.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Florida will not \nobject. There are three provisions in this unanimous consent request \nthat specifically assist Democratic Senators. First, we want to protect \nthe Senator from Maryland to offer her motion to instruct. Second, we \nwant to give Democratic Senators the opportunity to explain all of the \n30-plus amendments that we have available to us. And third, we are \naccommodating another Senator in starting when we are to assure that \nshe does not miss the first vote.\n  So I hope that after all the negotiations that we have made in good \nfaith on both sides that the agreement, which has nothing to do with \nthe Roth amendment, would be allowed to be accommodated, and we will, \nas I have given him my word, deal with the Roth amendment to accord \nadditional time and additional understanding tomorrow.\n  This agreement has nothing to do with tier two. It only has to do \nwith the third tier, directly affecting virtually every Democratic \namendment still pending.\n  So I hope that the Senator will not object, and we could work with \nRepublican managers tomorrow to accommodate the concerns, legitimate as \nthey are. There are concerns I share in terms of attempting to better \nunderstand what the Roth amendment would do.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am still compelled to object, unless as \npart of this unanimous-consent request some unanimous consent provision \nis inserted which will deal with the Roth amendment, either a \nunanimous-consent request to expand the time for consideration of the \nRoth amendment or a unanimous-consent request that no motion to waive \nthe reading of the Roth amendment would be in order. Either of those \ntwo would be acceptable, the first being much more preferable.\n  When we adopted this unanimous-consent agreement that set up the \nprocedure for the three-tier system of consideration, I did not \ncontemplate that at this late moment we were going to receive a major \nFinance Committee amendment with no opportunity to know its contents, \nunderstand its implications and be in a position to cast an informed \nvote as to its acceptability.\n  I am particularly concerned, Mr. President, about the provisions that \nmight relate to Medicare and Medicaid, which I understand are going to \nbe two of the areas covered by the Roth amendment.\n  These have great importance to all of the citizens of America, and \nespecially to the citizens of my State. I intend to fully understand \nwhat the implications of any changes are before the matter is brought \nbefore the Senate for a vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me reiterate, I have great sympathy \nfor the Senator from Florida. It is his right to ask for a reading, and \nit would take unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. So the \nSenator is protected under the rules, should he choose to have the \namendment read.\n  I hope that he will recognize that we will certainly work, as I have \nthroughout this process, with him and all of our Democratic colleagues, \nto protect our rights, to ensure that Senators are accommodated. I will \nwork with him in this regard as well. We just need to get on with the \nbusiness of moving this legislation, as it relates to all of our \namendments.\n  This largely is an agreement that we have requested. It would \nundermine my ability to deal with the leader as it relates to disposing \nof these amendments were we not to get this unanimous consent request \ntonight.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Shall I renew the request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will object until some provision is inserted that \neither provides for adequate time to consider the Roth amendment, or a \nstatement that no motion to waive the reading of the Roth amendment \nwould be in order.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I will tell the Senator from Florida that it will be the \nmajority leader's intention to attempt to shorten the votes from 15 \nminutes to 7\\1/2\\ minutes beginning tomorrow morning at 9:15.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It would be my intention to resist those efforts until \nsuch time as we can be assured that there is adequate opportunity to be \ninformed of and knowledgeable about the provisions in the Roth \namendment.\n  I think it is an outrage that now, at 12:22 a.m., we are yet to be \nprovided with a copy of what will probably be the most significant \nproposal on this most significant legislation.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, again, I would like to say that we will \nattempt to talk with the majority leader and Chairman Roth in the \nmorning to try and accommodate the request of the Senator from Florida. \nWe cannot do that any more this evening. Those efforts will be made in \nthe morning.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We will all gather.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/26/senate-section/article/S15977-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}]
