Mr. President, I understand that other Republican \nSenators would like to be heard this morning on the subject of the \nbalanced budget process and our effort to get a reconciliation bill \nbefore the Senate this week for action and the general policy that we \nhave embarked upon to try to do a better job of controlling the Federal \ndeficit.\n  As part of this effort, of course, we have been trying to reduce the \nlevels of funding in individual appropriations bills. We passed a \nbudget resolution earlier this year. The conference report was agreed \nto by both Houses of Congress setting specific targets for spending, \nmany of which are below last year's levels of funding for the \noperations of the Federal Government.\n  Let me give you one example of the success that we have achieved to \ndate. And I am confident that more success will be achieved as we go \nthrough the balance of this legislative session.\n  The President signed a bill on Saturday appropriating funds for the \nDepartment of Agriculture and related agencies. This is the fiscal year \n1996 appropriations bill that had previously been \n\n[[Page S 15416]]\n\npassed by the Congress. This bill represents, first of all, successful \nnegotiation with the administration over what had been some very \ncontentious issues. We were able to work with our colleagues in the \nHouse and here in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, to work out \nan agreed-upon bill which was passed here in the Senate, Senators may \nrecall, with only three dissenting votes.\n  This bill provides funding at a level over $5 billion less than the \nlevel of funding that was made available for this Department and these \nagencies for the fiscal year that ended on September 30. That shows \nremarkable restraint because many of the programs funded in that bill \nare mandatory programs, the programs that we will have to deal with \nwhen we take up the reconciliation bill later this week.\n  My recollection is that funding level for the bill was about $63 \nbillion. And of that amount, some $50 billion was required to be funded \nby law: entitlement programs, reimbursements to the Commodity Credit \nCorporation for net realized losses, food stamp benefits that are made \navailable to those who are entitled under the definition of the law of \nstatutes to certain levels of food assistance. The qualifications for \nthose benefits are set out in other laws, not the appropriations bill.\n  And so I am using this as an illustration to describe why it is so \nimportant if we are to continue to achieve reductions in spending in \nlater years for us to take up and pass the budget reconciliation bill \nwhich does make changes in the eligibility for Government resources and \nfunds under the definition of statutory law.\n  The amount of funds provided in the Agriculture appropriations bill \nfor the discretionary funding programs amounted to only about $13 \nbillion of the total $63 billion included in that bill. So even if we \ndid not appropriate any money for the discretionary programs funded in \nthat bill, next year or the next there would still be required to be \nspent by the Government way more than half, more than two-thirds of the \ntotal funds appropriated in that bill. That is true not only of that \nappropriations bill, but many others like it.\n  I am very glad the President signed the bill and that we were able to \nsuccessfully negotiate our way through the process so that we could get \na bill passed by this Congress that could be signed by the President \nand that does carry out the directive of the congressional budget \nresolution to cut spending, to try to do with less, to try to make do \nwith less money than we have in the past for many of these programs. \nBut we were restricted and restrained because of the provisions of law \nin most of the accounts that are funded in that bill.\n  So, to take care of that problem, to address that need, to deal with \nthe realities facing this Congress on how we approach the challenge of \nreductions in spending to achieve a balanced budget, we have to make \nchanges in the law which qualify individuals and other entities for \nFederal dollars every year.\n  The reconciliation bill carries out that important requirement by \nassembling a package of changes from every legislative committee in the \nCongress, which will, if passed and signed by the President, reduce the \ncosts of Federal programs over the next 7 years to the extent that by \nthe year 2002 we not only will have a balanced budget, but we will have \na surplus in the annual operating budget of the Federal Government.\n  That is the plan. That is the purpose of the passage of the \nreconciliation bill, and also the adoption of the individual \nappropriations bills as we are taking them up now in a process, as a \npart of a plan, that will meet the challenge of developing a new policy \nof fiscal responsibility at the Federal level.\n  This is the change, I am convinced, Mr. President, that the American \npeople voted for in the last election. It is the change that President \nClinton ran on when he was elected President, but he did not do \nanything after he was elected President to force the changes that we \nare now requiring under the budget reconciliation and budget process \nthat has been adopted by the Republican Congress.\n  So we are trying to deliver on the promise President Clinton made \nwhen he ran and also deliver on the promises that were made by those \nwho were candidates for Congress in the House and the Senate in the \nlast election, and we are making progress. That is the point.\n  This Agriculture appropriations conference report that we adopted and \nthe bill that was signed on Saturday by President Clinton shows that we \ncan deliver on the promise to cut spending, to be more responsible, to \nmake tough choices. We would like to be able to appropriate more money \nfor the funding of programs under the jurisdiction of that committee, \nbut we were confronted with the reality of a $200 billion operating \ndeficit in the last fiscal year and a budget that recommended the same \nthing for next year, and that was intolerable.\n  The Congress decided, when it adopted the resolution on the budget, \nthat it was intolerable, and so we changed that policy and determined \nthat we would bring the deficit down. We started doing it, and I am \nproud of the Congress for taking up the challenge and delivering on the \npromises. I hope we can continue to carry through with this kind of \nmomentum until we achieve the success that the American people deserve \nand want and achieve a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I know there are a number of Senators on our side who \nindicated an interest in speaking on this and related subjects. I am \nhappy to yield the floor so that Senators can be recognized under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15415-7", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15416-S15418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my colleague \nfrom Mississippi for the work he has done, as have many on this side of \nthe aisle, to bring about this Budget Reconciliation Act that we will \nbe debating later on this week that is so critical to the economic \nviability of our country.\n  For this Senator, it is absolutely exciting to stand on the floor and \nspeak the words ``balanced budget,'' and, for the first time in all of \nthe years that I have had the privilege of serving my State, for those \nwords to actually mean something.\n  Starting in the early eighties, I and others, when I was serving in \nthe House, began a movement that went nationwide to bring about a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. We knew that the \nCongress could not control or curb its spending appetite, and, of \ncourse, history proves that we were somewhat right. It was not until \nthe American people spoke so loudly last year on the issue of debt and \ndeficit that finally this Congress got the message, and the message \nwas: Stop spending, control the fiscal purse strings of our Government, \nand bring about a balanced budget.\n  Of course, as most of us know--and the public was watching--we missed \nby one vote in producing a balanced budget amendment for the citizens \nof this country to consider, which would really then put ourselves on a \npath toward a balanced budget.\n  Over the course of the last 6 months, all of the appropriate \ncommittees have worked hard to produce a responsible document that we \ncould honestly turn to the American people and say, ``We are speaking \nto your wishes. More importantly, we are speaking to what you told us \nto do last November, and that was to bring about a balanced budget.''\n  We will begin debate later this week on the Balanced Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1995, and it does some very, very profound and \nimportant things for this country. But more importantly, it does some \nimportant things for our Government. It puts goals in place, it puts \nparameters into a dynamic process that cause this Congress to be the \nfiscally responsible Congress that the American people have so demanded \nfor way too long.\n  My colleague from Mississippi began to outline the kinds of efforts \nthat are incorporated in this critical piece of legislation that bring \ntogether all of the efforts of this Congress over the last good many \nmonths into a final document that will submit to the President a \nprocess and a procedure that brings us to a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  The thing that I find most important about it is that while we were \ndebating the balanced budget amendment, those from the other side cried \nand pleaded with the American people that Republicans were only going \nto balance the budget on the backs of the elderly and \n\n[[Page S 15417]]\nwe would do so by using Social Security.\n  Well, I say to the folks from the other side, it just ``ain't'' so. \nIt was not then and it is not now. The Social Security trust funds are \nnot being used and will not be used and Social Security is every bit as \nstrong today and next year and the year after through the year 2002 as \nwe had promised during that historic debate of a good number of months \nago.\n  In fact, if you look at the year 2002, and if you want to take it \njust one step forward to the year 2005, when you look at the projection \nof the surpluses that begin to grow, you can argumentatively say that \nSocial Security is totally aside, totally apart from the budget \ncalculations by the year 2005 based on that surplus growth if--if--the \nCongress of the United States will be true to its commitment, and that \ncommitment will be spoken to this week in this most important and \nhistoric act.\n  I said during the balanced budget debate of a good number of months \nago, if you are worried about Social Security and its stability, then \nyou have to be worried about debt and deficit, because if you really \nwant to protect Social Security and you want to show to the American \nseniors that you mean it, then you have to control debt.\n  The solvency of our Government means its ability to pay its \nobligations. If the Congress of the United States and greedy big \nFederal spenders want to destroy Social Security, then they want to \nkeep mounting debt, because there could come a day when we could not \npay our bills, and Social Security, like everything else, is a bill or \nan obligation of the Government to pay to the recipients of the program \nthat which it was committed to. Control the debt, as we are doing now \nwith the Budget Reconciliation Act, and you will do nothing but \nstrengthen Social Security in the coming years.\n  Mr. President, there is one other item in this whole debate that is \nso critical for us here in Congress to understand but, more \nimportantly, for the American people to have a clear and unfettered \nmessage of. It was spoken well this morning in an editorial in the \nWashington Times called ``The Great Medi-Scare.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          The Great Medi-Scare\n\n       Congressional Democrats, who have been flailing about in \n     the desperate hope of bumping into an issue that will \n     leverage them back into power, think they have finally got \n     it. As Republicans in the House celebrated their party-line \n     victory on legislation to reform Medicare, Democrats \n     attempted to taunt them, childishly waving their hands and \n     mouthing ``bye, bye.''\n       This undignified spectacle came after a day chock full of \n     those impassioned, if not unhinged, speeches House Democrats \n     have been cranking out denouncing the GOP--``It's another day \n     of infamy for 40 million Americans who depend on Medicare,'' \n     railed Florida Rep. Sam Gibbons; the bill is an affront to \n     ``human decency'' cried House Minority Leader Richard \n     Gephardt. But if the Republicans' vote was indecent and \n     infamous, how do Democrats explain their expression of glee? \n     The display suggests that one of several unpleasant \n     conclusions must be drawn about the new minority party: \n     Either the Democrats are happy to see seniors suffer just so \n     long as that misery is their ticket back to power; or the \n     Democrats know full well that their apocalyptic \n     pronunciamentos are hollow, in which case they were doing \n     nothing worse than celebrating what they think was a \n     successful scare campaign.\n       Exactly how successful has the scare campaign been? There \n     is a belief among Democrats and some political analysts that \n     Republicans are making a fatal error by even attempting to \n     reform Medicare. The specter of seniors mobbing Rep. Dan \n     Rostenkowski is raised time and again, a mere prelude, we are \n     to believe, of the elderly's wrath to come. The thought gives \n     comfort to the Gibbonses and Gephardts and is supposed to put \n     fear in the hearts of Republicans. But Medicare reform and \n     Rosty's catastrophic-care legislation are by no means \n     analogous. Medicare reform merely limits the rate of growth \n     in the program, boosting seniors' costs marginally if they \n     remain in traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and saving \n     money for many of the elderly who choose one of the various \n     insurance options to be offered for the first time--such as \n     medical savings accounts. In any case, once all the hype has \n     died down, seniors will realize that their benefits are in \n     tact, and their out-of-pocket expenses have not exploded. \n     That was not the case with Rosty's catastrophic legislation.\n       The new entitlement that Mr. Rostenkowski briefly imposed \n     on the nation in 1989--before it was withdrawn in the face of \n     vociferous protest--was financed in a way that fit liberal \n     sensibilities very nicely, but enraged the segment of the \n     elderly population that got stuck with the bill. Instead of \n     spreading the costs out among all taxpayers, wealthy seniors \n     were forced to pick up the tab almost exclusively. Paying for \n     the whole program meant that there was a distinct population \n     of senior citizens who were hit with new taxes of $800 a \n     year. Is it any wonder they rioted? It is hard to imagine \n     that senior citizens whose Medicare premiums go up $4 more \n     than they would have otherwise will react with quite the same \n     fervor and gusto as those who took an $800 hit. In other \n     words, liberals who think the Republicans' Medicare reform \n     will produce a catastrophic backlash are engaged in wishful \n     thinking.\n       Once the Republican plan is up and running, the \n     scaremongering will have no more resonance. Perhaps, however, \n     House Democrats are counting on the reforms never becoming \n     law; President Clinton has, after all, promised to veto the \n     legislation. But Capitol Hill Democrats should know by now \n     that they can't rely on Mr. Clinton--a fact that was in stark \n     relief last week when the president blamed his long-suffering \n     allies on the Hill for his whopping 1993 tax hikes. There is \n     every reason to believe that when Mr. Clinton is confronted \n     with the prospect of a government shutdown, the veto pen will \n     stay in his pocket. Republican leaders no doubt will toss the \n     president a few face-saving changes on Medicare and other \n     budget items, and Mr. Clinton will acquiesce, much as he did \n     on this year's rescission bill.\n       Then where will congressional Democrats be? They may yet be \n     waving bye-bye--that is, from their seats on the Greyhound.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the great medi-scare. Oh, my goodness, I \nwatched with great interest this past week when the House voted by a \nvery large bipartisan vote to reform Medicare. The wringing of hands \nand the gnashing of teeth from the other side of the aisle, from \nliberals who wanted to argue that this would be the destruction of \nhealth care as we know it to the seniors of our society, how tragic \nthat kind of debate is in an attempt to split people, to use scare \ntactics to anger and frustrate the American people when what we are \ndoing is exactly what Congress has done ever since Medicare was created \nby this Congress: To manage it on a yearly or biyearly basis and, \nwhenever necessary, to make adjustments and changes in the program to \nmake sure it could continue to provide the kind of health care \nreimbursement that it has historically provided.\n  How many times has the Congress addressed changes in Medicare? Almost \ntoo many to count since it was created back in the seventies. Why? \nBecause we are the board of directors of Medicare. It is our job to \nmake sure it is solvent, to make sure it works, to make sure it honors \nits commitment to that portion and that share of the senior citizen \ndollar that goes in in the form of premiums, to pay that dollar that is \nmatched with the Federal dollar. And, as a result, Medicare has always \nbeen there, and it will always be there.\n\n  I am sorry, I say to those who have no better answer and are trying \nto use the emotion of senior citizens in this country as the political \ntactics of 1996, folks, it is not going to work because already the \nseniors have seen through it. They have recognized that they have been \nused over the years in the arguments of Social Security reform, and now \nthey are being used--I repeat the word ``used''--in the arguments of \nchanging Medicare when, in fact, what we are doing is creating new \ndynamics in a program that will allow seniors greater choice, greater \nopportunity, and greater independence in their health care delivery \nsystems.\n  Why should they not be allowed to choose between a provider fee \nsystem, between HMO's, between a variety of other options that are out \nthere? The important words are ``allowed to choose,'' not being forced \nor not being shoved into a new program, but being allowed to choose a \nvariety of options, including staying exactly where they are today.\n  Now, because we have never offered that choice in the past, the \ndynamics of the Medicare trust funds have not had the flexibility to \ncreate the efficiencies that we ought to have. As a result, the costs \nof those funds, based on demand, escalated at over 10.4 percent a year \nwhen private health care costs last year were 4 percent, and this year \ncould be 4 percent. Why is it that a Federal health care program is not \nat least reflecting and mirroring the cost of private health care? \nBecause it is \n\n[[Page S 15418]]\nfederally rigid; because the rules and regulations will not allow the \ndynamics in the marketplace of choice, independence, and of selection \nthat every other citizen in our country has. That is exactly what we \nare providing. Yet, the opposition is saying it is going to destroy it. \nThey are trying to use it as a political tactic.\n  Why do I talk about the Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act and \nMedicare all at the same time? Because it is all of a total budget that \nthis Congress has to look at. It is part of the kind of reform that is \ncritical when it relates to the dynamics of making the kinds of overall \nsavings that produces a balanced budget by the year 2002 and honors the \ncommitment we have had to the American people that we are going to \nstart being fiscally responsible and we are not going to be continually \nrunning up debt that is now at $4.8 or $4.9 trillion and accumulating \nfaster than the average citizen can absolutely comprehend.\n  If we will do anything this year, we will be able to turn to the \nAmerican people and say, we heard you, we listened, and we responded, \nand we have set the Government on a course of action that will cause us \nto be fiscally responsible, that will allow us to look out into the \nfuture and say, we have indebted our children less, and we will allow \nthem to have greater freedoms of opportunity in selecting their jobs \nand keeping more of their own made money for the purposes of providing \nfor themselves and their children.\n  That is what this debate is all about. We are going to look at it \nprogram by program, detail by detail, going through Wednesday, \nThursday, and into Friday of this week. I hope the American people are \nlistening because what they will hear in the end will not be \nfrightening. It will be a very loud, clear, analytical debate, program \nby program, on what this Congress is doing to control a runaway budget. \nAnd that is exactly what they expect us to do.\n  To the seniors of this country, please listen, do not be frightened \nby what is known as scare mongering. That is what this editorial was \nsaying; that the Democrats are running to the only thing that will \nresonate at this moment--scare mongering--instead of working with us in \na constructive way to maintain a dynamic and important program for this \ncountry.\n  I remember back in the early 1980's when Social Security was in \ntrouble and I was a freshman legislator on the other side. Those who \nwere in control of the Congress at that time--the Democrat Party--tried \njust that. Ronald Reagan said, ``Oh, no, you don't. I am going to bring \nyou, the Congress, and the Presidency together, in a bipartisan way, \nand we are going to fix this problem. There is not going to be any \nfear, there is not going to be any fright. We are going to create the \ndynamics that assures the stability of Social Security on into the \nfuture.''\n  He pulled their scare mongering platform out from under them. As a \nresult, we got a phenomenally dynamic, bipartisan process that \nstabilized Social Security as it is today and will into the future if \nwe balance the budget and take the debt fear away. That is the same \nresponsibility we have with Medicare. I challenge my colleagues on the \nother side--down with your bright line graphs, down with your rhetoric, \nand up with your willingness to work with us to create a bipartisan \ndynamics, both in the budget process and in the securing of a stable \nMedicare Program that we can turn to the American people and say, we \nheard you, we honored you, and we are committed to a stable Government \nin the future that lives within its means.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They rejected \nbusiness as usual; they ended the reign of spendthrifts that mortgaged \ntheir grandchildrens' future for a handful of votes on the first \nTuesday every other year.\n  Now, after a year of preparation, we are ready to put into effect the \nchanges that will protect us from bankruptcy and preserve the strength \nof our Union. During this week, we will debate our future course as a \npeople and as a government.\n  The question before us is simple: Will we follow the path of those \nwho want us to tax and spend and borrow until we are so deep in debt \nand denial that we are fiscally and morally bankrupt? Or, will we set \nthis country on the path toward freedom and prosperity for all, with \ncharity for those who cannot help themselves?\n  One of our greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln, said, ``A house divided \nagainst itself cannot stand.'' Just as our country could not live \n``half slave half free,'' it cannot live in a perpetual class war with \nthe poor incited to battle the rich, the old to fight the young, or the \nsick to fight the healthy. We cannot make the public better off by \npitting them against one another for partisan advantage. We must work \ntogether for the benefit of all of us--for our children, for our \nhandicapped, for our elderly--instead of using them as props in \npublicity stunts designed to turn people against progress without \nexamining the facts.\n  President Clinton has led the charges that Republicans seek to gut \nMedicare to give a tax break to the rich. How many times have you heard \nthat said in the last few weeks? The Speaker of the House said that the \nPresident has reduced himself to scaring old people to try to defeat \nour balanced budget. In his all-out effort to defend the status quo, \nthe President, who campaigned for change, takes advantage of his most \nvulnerable citizens and threatens the solvency of their health care \ntrust.\n  Last week, when President Clinton admitted that he and the Democrats \nin Congress had made a mistake in raising taxes, according to the \nWashington Post, reporters for the Washington Post, New York Times, \nChicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Times skipped the speech and went out \nfor Mexican food.\n  I will not argue with their choice of menus--after all, they were in \nTexas--but when they read the speech later, they still did not think it \nwas news.\n  Apparently, they are so used to the flip-flops by the President that \nhis repudiation of the largest tax increase in the history of America \ndid not sink in.\n  I am not surprised that the President chose Texas as the place to \nadmit that his tax hikes were a mistake, because in Texas most \nDemocrats believe that Government should take less, not more. That is \nwhy so many of them have either been crossing the aisle or supporting \nRepublicans.\n  Why are they doing that? Because we are protecting the elderly by \nsaving Medicare from bankruptcy. We are lowering taxes on the middle \nclass, and we are cutting spending to balance the budget.\n  In short, Mr. President, we are keeping our promises. We are not \nprotecting the status quo. We are reordering priorities and ending \nfraud, waste, and subsidies.\n  We must act now. If no changes are made to the budget, entitlement \nspending, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and Federal \nretirement plus interest on the debt will take over the entire Federal \nbudget by the year 2012.\n  Now, Mr. President, think of that. In the year 2012, entitlement \nspending which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and \nretirement plus interest on the debt will be the entire Federal budget. \nThere will be no defense spending, no spending to help crime, \neducation, or anything else.\n  Medicare will be insolvent next year according to members of the \nPresident's own Cabinet. By the year 2002, it will be bankrupt.\n  Our Medicare reform proposal slows the rate of growth but it does not \ncut spending in Medicare. It slows the rate of growth, but increased \nspending will amount to 73 percent over the next 7 years. The total \nspending will be $1.6 trillion for Medicare alone. No one will \n\n[[Page S 15419]]\nbe without health care. Seniors will have more choices. They can keep \nthe old plan or choose a new one that suits them better.\n  We do this by cutting fraud and waste and reining in the exploding \ncosts. Our tax cut reduces the tax burden on people who actually pay \ntaxes. It closes loopholes. More than three-quarters of the cuts in the \nfirst year go to the middle class--those making $75,000 or less.\n  Now, who are those people? They are mothers and fathers who will get \nhelp raising their children with a $500 per child tax credit; they are \nhomemakers who will have the opportunity for the first time to \ncontribute the maximum amount to an IRA for their retirement security; \nthey are married couples who will have the Tax Code's marriage penalty \nreduced; and they are savers who are trying to buy a first home, pay \nfor college for their kids, or retirement for themselves.\n  Our tax cut benefits all Americans. It will put more money in \npeople's pockets, and it will increase jobs. Together with a balanced \nbudget, it will lower interest rates and increase the standard of \nliving for millions of Americans.\n  The time for publicity stunts, Mr. President, for walking out, for \nshouting, for interrupting meetings with demonstrators, and for \nlabeling Republicans ``extremists'' is over.\n  The public spoke clearly last November. They saw through the antics \nand the publicity stunts and they asked for leadership. Leadership is \nnot increasing taxes on the elderly and everybody who drives a car and \nthen claim you only hit the rich, which the Democrats without one \nRepublican vote did in 1993. It is not leadership to walk away from \nthose tax increases 2 years later and to attack others who seek to \nlower the tax burden now.\n  It is not leadership to propose a budget to this Congress this year \nwith a $200 million deficit. It is not leadership to propose only 4 \nmonths later, a 10-year budget which you say balances but which does \nnot.\n  It is leadership to confront our fiscal problems head on, to show the \npeople that we must preserve Medicare--and we will--to help families, \nto create jobs, and to balance the budget.\n  The American people asked for leadership, for the Congress to \nshoulder the responsibility of showing them the way. This budget ends \nthe culture of dependence, the belief that the people cannot provide \nfor themselves. It shows the way toward hope and prosperity for all, \nwith charity for those who cannot help themselves.\n  The American people have created the greatest country on Earth with \nthe intelligence, the creativity, and the energy God gave them. It is \nour responsibility as their leaders to maintain the opportunity they \nhave created and that this great country offers. That is what we are \ntrying to do, Mr. President. We are making the tough decisions to \nassure the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15418-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15419-S15420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first let me congratulate my colleague \nfrom Texas for a very eloquent statement as well as congratulate my \ncolleague from Idaho for his statement that preceded the Senator from \nTexas.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, to discuss the reconciliation bill that \nwe will begin debating this Wednesday. It is very clear that there will \nbe nothing more important that this Congress will do than the \nparticular bill that we are going to take up on Wednesday.\n  In fact, there may not be anything more important in any of our \ncareers here in Congress, however short or long they may be, than this \nparticular bill.\n  The bill that we will begin debating on Wednesday results from a \nstatement made by the American people last November. It was a statement \nthat was very simple, very plain and very eloquent. What the American \npeople said last November was that we must make some very fundamental \nchanges in the course of the direction of this Government.\n  Mr. President, the American people had ample reason to speak so \nloudly last November. For example, if we look at the budgetary outlook \ncontained in the report of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements, \nwe will find a pretty grim picture.\n  Here is what this Bipartisan Commission said, in essence. If we do \nnot change our present course, by the year 2012 every single penny in \nthe Federal budget will be consumed by entitlements and by interest on \nthe national debt.\n  My colleague from Texas just said that a moment ago. I again want to \nrepeat it because it summarizes, I think, very well, the crisis that we \nare in. Think of it--every single penny of the entire Federal budget \nwill be consumed by entitlements and by interest on the national debt.\n  If, Mr. President, in the year 2012 we want Government to do anything \nat all--provide for our national defense, provide money to run the \nArmy, the Navy, Air Force, Marines, run a program such as the WIC \nProgram or provide any funds for higher education or primary or \nsecondary education--to do any of these things, unless we change the \ncourse of the direction of this Government of this country, we would \nhave to raise taxes because there would not be any money anywhere else \nin the budget to pay for any of these things. This, I think, gives us a \npretty good indication of what kind of problem we have in this country.\n\n  As we approach this problem, I think the American people demand from \nus honesty, demand from us that we use numbers that are real, because I \nbelieve the American people are sick and tired of phony numbers. They \nknow we cannot go on trying to hide from the facts. Unless we take \naction and take action now, our children, our grandchildren, are going \nto face an even more severe reckoning; frankly, the quality of life our \nchildren have, and our grandchildren and their children have, will be \ndifferent, will be lower than ours. So I believe the American people \nlast November were also saying that the time for the blue smoke and \nmirrors is over.\n  The reconciliation bill that we will begin to consider this Wednesday \nis an honest, forthright attempt to solve this major problem \nthreatening our children's future--the problem of America's imminent \nbankruptcy. If we listen to the debate occurring on TV, in our \nnewspapers, on the radio, one might conclude that we, on this side, \nhave been a little too honest, maybe a little too forthright. But I do \nnot think so. I do not believe that the American people expect us to do \nany less than to be forthright and to be honest.\n  And one charge that has not been made--and I do not think will be \nmade--is that we have taken a walk on this issue. We assuredly have \nnot. This reconciliation bill that, in about 48 hours, we will begin to \nconsider is a serious, detailed, fundamental attempt to change \nAmerica's fiscal course. The patience of the American people, I \nbelieve, has run out--their patience with distorted figures, their \npatience with lack of candor. That is one of the reasons why we had \nsuch a revolutionary election, such an historic election in 1994. The \nAmerican people want elected officials who are willing to break the \nsyndrome, once and for all, of distortion. That is what I believe we \nare trying to do with this reconciliation bill. The President, on the \nother hand, has not responded to this national demand for fundamental \nchange. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal does not even come \nclose to meeting this challenge. It is not detailed. It is not serious. \nAnd it does not attempt to fundamentally change the course and the \ndirection of this Government.\n  Thanks to the important work of my colleague, the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, we have details \nspelling out exactly how far short the President's plan has fallen.\n  Let us look at how the President's plan claims to get to balance. Let \nus look at it.\n  According to the President's plan, there will be $55 billion less in \nMedicare spending. No changes in benefits, no changes in law, it will \njust, somehow, magically appear. There will be $68 billion less in \nMedicaid spending, according to the President. Again, no changes in \nbenefits, no changes in law; it will just somehow magically happen. \nThere will be $85 billion less in spending on agriculture, pensions, \nand other programs. No details, no specific cuts; again, it will just \nsomehow magically happen. \n\n[[Page S 15420]]\n\n  The same goes for $22 billion in supposed savings in the \ndiscretionary account. No real changes--the cuts are just going to \nhappen somehow.\n  Then--please stay with me, follow this--the administration predicts, \nbased upon these assumptions, assumptions that really have no basis in \nfact, that as a result of these things certain other things will occur \nthat will save another $70 billion from lower interest rates; yet \nanother $175 billion thanks to economic growth--lower interest rates \nand economic growth, based upon assumptions that have no basis in fact, \nthat have no support, that have no specifics.\n  A few years ago there was a popular song that asked, ``Do You Believe \nin Magic?'' The American people no longer believe in magic when it \ncomes to the Federal budget. They believe it is time to sweep away the \nsmoke and mirrors. It is time to start buckling down and making the \ntough choices.\n  Sadly, the administration proposal is not even smoke and mirrors. \nThere are not any mirrors in that proposal. It is all smoke. When you \nsay we are going to cut $475 billion out of the budget without actually \nchanging anything, without actually paying any kind of price, that does \nnot even qualify as a trick. The time for that kind of falsehood, I \nthink, is over. It is time for truth. It is time for decisions. And \nthat is what Congress is trying to do in this historic reconciliation \nbill.\n  A vote for the reconciliation package is a vote to balance the budget \nso we can start reducing the national debt and put America on a course \ntoward a future we can be proud to leave our children. A vote against \nthe reconciliation package, I believe, is a vote to stay the course, a \nvote to take today's staggering deficits and hand them to our children \nand our grandchildren, to give our children and our grandchildren our \nbills for them to pay.\n  When the smoke clears, there is one fundamental difference between \nthe President's budget proposal and our budget proposal. Under the \nPresident's plan, we will leave our children and our grandchildren our \nbills. Under our plan, we will balance our budget so our children and \ngrandchildren will not have to pay our bills. For America, I believe it \nis a clear choice between two very distinct and different futures. That \nis why I intend to vote for this reconciliation package.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I am honored to join with my freshman \ncolleagues and others this morning as we share our thoughts on the \nimportant work that is being undertaken this Congress. We may be new to \nthe Senate, but together we carry the powerful and, in Washington, \nnovel idea that the tax dollars are not the Government's money.\n  While I was growing up on my family's dairy farm, we did not have \nmuch need back then, it seemed, for the Federal Government. As long as \nthe mail got delivered and there was something to collect when they \ncashed in their war bonds, my folks and their neighbors really did not \nhave much reason to concern themselves much with what was going on in \nCongress. They certainly did not turn to Washington when they needed a \nhelping hand. They never really thought of doing that, and I expect \nthey never thought anything would come of it if they tried.\n  They did not believe Government should have the right to take as much \nmoney as it thought was fair from some Americans and, in turn, give as \nmuch money as it thought was fair to others. If the Government can \nconfiscate the wealth of some, it can take it all from all.\n  We agree that taxes need to be collected for our national security, \nour transportation, our good sewer and water systems. But we do not \nwant our hard-earned money taken for social engineering and the \nredistribution of wealth, disregarding the people who have worked so \nvery hard to earn it, invested all they had, and took, in many cases, \nenormous risks.\n  If you had worked hard to save what you have, we have had a Congress \nover the last 30 years that believed this money actually belonged to \nWashington. The Democratic leaders have used your money to basically \ncreate not a level playing field, but a dependent class. They have used \nyour money to buy, in many cases, political support and votes.\n  There was a time in this Nation's history when neighbors counted on \ntheir neighbors for help. Whatever involvement from the Government they \nmay have needed came partly from the State, but most of their contact \nwith Government came at the local level. If there were improvements \nthat were needed for the good of the community, folks scheduled a town \nmeeting where they talked over their problems and then made those \ndecisions. It was open democracy at its most basic level. Most \nimportant, the choices were made by the community and made voluntarily, \nand the town got to see exactly where their tax dollars were going and \nthey enjoyed the direct benefits of pooling together their money.\n  They did not need a department of education or housing or \ntransportation. That is what families and the communities were for. But \nthen, beginning sometime during the 1930's, while the Nation was \nrebounding from the Great Depression, the Federal Government began \ninserting itself more directly into American life, and the idea started \nto take hold that Washington somehow had all the answers. That \nphilosophy grew even more quickly during the 1960's and into the \n1970's. Washington became the center of power by confiscating the \npeople's money and using that money to make decisions that Washington \nfelt were best for the people.\n  As that power was taken away from the American people, more and more \npeople were forced to start relying on the Government rather than \nrelying on each other. Mr. President, just ask your constituents. They \nknow how much more of their tax dollars Washington has demanded year \nafter year.\n  Back in 1948 the average family of four paid just 3 percent of its \nannual income to the Federal Government. That jumped to nearly one-\nthird of their paychecks by 1993, when President Clinton pushed a $275 \nbillion tax hike through this Congress, a record-breaking tax increase \nthat even now he admits was too much.\n  Somewhere along the line, the big spenders who used to control \nCongress forgot just who the money really belongs to. They have passed \nlaws that say you have to pay more so they can spend it where they see \nfit. When you do this for more than 30 years, they not only forget who \nthe money really belongs to, but they begin to believe that it actually \nis theirs. They did this again by passing laws one at a time that say \nyou owe Washington its due.\n  Again, I am not saying that we do not need a strong Federal \nGovernment and it will cost us money in the form of taxes to support \nthat, but not half of everything that we earn, while the appetite in \nWashington for your tax dollars continues to grow. This transfer of \ncash away from the local communities into the Federal coffers has \nstripped people of so much of their money that they have little left to \ninvest in their own communities, toward caring for the less fortunate \nand to making their neighborhoods better places to live. Government has \ntaken the place of private charity, of neighbor helping neighbor, and \nhas even usurped the role of families, in many cases, in caring for \nchildren and in caring for the elderly. In fact, a lot of things have \nbecome the problem of the Federal Government.\n  Already this year I have received 155,000 letters from my Minnesota \nconstituents. The majority of those letters express opinions on the \nissues that we are currently debating in Congress, and I need that kind \nof feedback. But an ever-increasing percentage of mail we get here in \nthe Capitol is from people looking to Washington for help.\n  Washington creates the problem. Then Washington offers to fix it. It \nis a catch-22 cycle, and it certainly is not governing. If the Federal \nGovernment reduced taxes and let the people keep the dollars they \nearned, maybe they would not need to go to the Federal Government with \nthose outstretched hands. \n\n[[Page S 15421]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Why do you \ndenounce our plans to give working-class Americans some of their own \nmoney back through a tax cut? They argue that we cannot afford to give \nanybody a tax cut. But who is we, Mr. President? Is not we supposed to \nbe the people? And how can Congress not afford to give back to the \npeople something which is actually theirs in the first place?\n  It is no wonder that some of our colleagues are fighting us every \nstep of the way on our tax-cutting plans. They see the power being \nstripped away from them, and it scares them.\n  The $500 per child tax credit is powerful relief for overtaxed \nAmerican families. Yet, compared against 1 trillion in tax dollars \nwhich the Federal Government will collect in 1996, a tax cut that \namounts to about $35 billion a year makes a pretty small dent in the \nnational tax bill. But it is a sign that Congress has heard the people, \nthat the tide which has tugged against the taxpayers for so long is \nfinally beginning to shift in another direction, that someone in \nWashington has finally remembered that it is not the Government's \nmoney.\n  For too many years, Congress has been eating the people's dessert \nwhile the people have been eating the gruel. Congress taxes away the \nworkers' college fund or vacation, or their downpayment on a home, and \nthen make the workers come to Washington looking for help. I say it is \ntime we give them a break.\n  Congress has enjoyed handing out other people's money so much that \nthey have spent all the taxes that I will pay. They have even spent \nsome of the taxes my children will pay, and they have even begun to \nspend some of the taxes that my grandchildren will pay.\n  Mr. President, the soul of any democracy is the idea that the power \nstill rests with the people. The only purpose for which power can be \nrightfully exercised over any member of civilized communities against \nhis will is to prevent harm to others. And that is something that was \nwritten by 19th century English economist, John Stewart Mill. His own \ngood, either physical or moral, is not sufficient. All that my freshmen \ncolleagues and I are trying to do is give back to the people the power \nthat rightfully rests with them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we will balance the budget. We are going to \npush ahead with our tax cuts, and at every opportunity, through our \nlegislation or statements on the floor, we will be here to remind our \nfellow Senators again and again that it is not the Government's money, \nthat it belongs to those who earn it.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I do not know if this is necessary. But I ask \nunanimous consent that the time I use be taken out of the time as \npreviously under the order allocated to the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate is in the midst of a crucial \ndebate over Medicare and Medicaid. In the midst of this controversy, \nthe fate of a single bill or amendment might be inconsequential. But \ntoday I rise to discuss a bill which speaks clearly and directly to a \nvery simple question at the heart of all of this debate, and that \nquestion is this: Can the Senate do what is best for the American \npeople?\n  My colleagues, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator Brown of \nColorado, and I have offered just such a proposal. Compared with the \nmatter that we began debate on Wednesday in the reconciliation bill, \nour proposal is simple, and it is easy to miss. But it is important. It \nis crucial. It admits a congressional mistake, and it fixes a \ncongressional mistake. It closes a glaring legislative loophole and \nsaves billions of dollars in the process.\n  But, most important, it sends a very simple message to the American \npeople: Congress makes mistakes, but Congress can fix those mistakes \nwhen the interests of the American people are at stake.\n  Mr. President, we offered this bill because the interests of the \nAmerican people--both as taxpayers and as consumers--are clearly at \nstake here. And deep down my colleagues know it, too.\n  Let me briefly describe our proposal. It enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate and in the House and has been endorsed by every \nsingle Federal agency involved with trade, patents, or drugs: the U.S. \nTrade Representative, the Patent and Trademark Office, and the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  Mr. President, here is what it does: When Congress passed the GATT \nTreaty last year, we enacted two transition provisions. First, we \ngranted a generous extension to all current patents. Second, as a \ncondition of that extension, we permitted generic competitors onto the \nmarket on the old patent expiration date if they had already made a \nsubstantial investment and were willing to pay a royalty. That was our \nagreement. That was our discussion as it related to GATT. These changes \nwere universally understood by all of the negotiators from every \ncountry, from every industry, from every economic aspect of our \neconomic life in America.\n  Let me be very clear on this point. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey \nKantor states categorically in a letter dated September 18 to me that \nthe law was meant to apply universally, that there would be no \nexceptions. The GATT negotiators themselves--the experts who physically \nsat down at the table and negotiated the GATT Treaty on behalf of the \nUnited States--have personally confirmed that the transition provisions \nwere meant to apply to every single person, product, company, and \nindustry in the country.\n  There was a loophole. And guess who came out smelling like a rose? A \nfew pharmaceutical drug companies, who now--if we do not do something \nabout it--are going to have a free ride for the next 3 years when \ngeneric competition is poised and ready to compete with them in the \nmarketplace.\n  This spring the Congress discovered this loophole. We failed to \nmodify this loophole in the Finance Committee because of a technical \nproblem. When we passed the GATT Treaty, we inadvertently gave the \nprescription drug industry a giant unintended windfall. Of all the \ncompanies, of all the products in America--from automobiles to zippers, \ncomputers and TV parts, everything--only prescription drug companies, \nonly drug companies, received a competition-free patent extension, a \nfree ride, a windfall.\n  In fact, when one of the officials of Glaxo Co., that manufactures \nZantac, heard about this loophole being discovered, his first word \nwas--and I quote--``eureka.'' They got the extension, and they were \nmistakenly shielded from the competition intended by GATT. Without that \ncompetition, today a handful of drug companies are now, beginning \ntoday, receiving a whopping multibillion-dollar windfall paid for by \nconsumers and paid for by taxpayers.\n\n  This was a simple mistake of oversight, Mr. President. I wish to \nemphasize that. We make mistakes around here every day. Sometimes we \ncorrect them and sometimes we do not. But this is an opportunity to \ncorrect that mistake. Every authority that I have spoken to, every \nMember of this body, every Senate committee, and every Government \nagency admits this was an error, and now we have a chance to change it. \nEven the companies that gained this unjustified multibillion-dollar \nwindfall admit it was a mistake.\n  This is why my colleagues, Senators Chafee and Brown and myself, will \nbe offering this amendment. This amendment does one thing and one thing \nonly. It applies GATT to those few drug companies the same way it \napplies to every other company and every other product in this country. \nUnless we correct this loophole today, enormous profits, unjustified \nand unexpected, will go to those few companies. We have already taken \nthe first steps to a solution, but 3 weeks ago we were blocked by a \nprocedural technicality in the Finance Committee. And make no mistake. \nThe only way to rectify this problem is here and it is now. The Senate \nis the court of appeals for this issue to be decided.\n  If there is any doubt whether Congress should fix its own mistakes, I \nhave some news for my distinguished colleagues. The Patent Office and \nthe FDA have tried to correct this problem on their own. They failed \nbecause of \n\n[[Page S 15422]]\ntechnicalities. The problem is, their hands are tied by the letter of \nthe law in the GATT treaty.\n  On last Thursday, despite their best efforts, a Federal court held \nthat three drug makers that had filed suits in the court had actually \nwon, which meant that they ruled against this loophole being corrected. \nThe Federal court said that their hands were tied.\n  Even worse, the court ruling now means that potentially hundreds of \nproducts could be affected. This could mean as much as $6 billion--I \nrepeat, $6 billion--in unnecessary health care costs for every \npurchaser of prescription drugs--the elderly, hospitals, clinics, \nHMO's, drugstores, insurance companies and, not the least, the \ngovernments, State and Federal governments.\n  According to securities analyists, the ruling could ``affect sales of \nbillions of dollars of brand name drugs that would otherwise be open to \ncompetition from less expensive generic versions.''\n  For the average person, this means money out of our pockets for no \ngood reason. If they are one of the millions of people who take the \nworld's best selling drug, Zantac, our legislation would cut the cost \nof Zantac by one-half. Think of it, cutting the cost of one medication \nby one-half that is the best selling drug in America.\n  Our legislation would cut the cost of Capoten for hypertension by \ntwo-thirds. By over 65 percent we would cut the cost of this drug \nsimply because there would be competition in the marketplace. That \ncompetition in the marketplace is going to be delayed unless the court \nof appeals, in this case the U.S. Senate, the last court of appeals, \nhandles this matter and corrects this very tragic mistake.\n  Let me tell you three other reasons why we should be supporting this \namendment at the proper time. Our proposal will save the Government \nhundreds of millions of dollars for the poor, the veterans, active \nmilitary personnel, pregnant women, Native Americans, and every \nAmerican served by Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \nDepartment of Defense, as well as the Public Health Service and the \nIndian Health Service clinics. All of those would be included and all \nof those would benefit with the adoption of our proposal.\n  Second, everyone wants to do what is best for older Americans, the \nsick and the poor and the consumers. How often do we hear that? Here we \nhave an opportunity to do it. It is clear. It is evident that we can \nhelp these groups by supporting this idea. Our proposal is supported by \nsenior citizens, consumers, medical practitioners. It is endorsed by \nthe National Council on the Aging, National Consumers League, the Gray \nPanthers, the National Women's Health Network, the United Homeowners \nAssociation, the National Council of Senior Citizens, and the National \nBlack Women's Health Project.\n  Finally, this issue has been the focus of intense media scrutiny for \nthe last several weeks. People are beginning to see how a big ripoff is \nabout to happen unless we correct it. Articles and stories inspired by \ndisbelief have appeared in the New York Times, NBC News, Associated \nPress, Los Angeles Times, Business Week, Reuters, Journal of Commerce, \nRoll Call, and the Orlando Sentinel, and the list goes on and on.\n  Why is there so much attention on this issue? Well, the bottom line \nis there is a lot of money at stake. There are multibillion-dollar \nhealth care cuts being debated in Congress today, and here we are about \nto give an enormous windfall to one of the most profitable segments of \nour economic activity, the pharmaceutical companies.\n  Why does anyone care about this particular legislation? I think the \nreason people care is because they know this bill is the right thing to \ndo. They are sick and tired of the excuses that are given when we fail \nto do the right thing. Please let me repeat, this is not a partisan \nissue. It never has been. It is about fixing a mistake. It is about \nsaving taxpayers' money. It is about precluding an enormous windfall in \nunjustified profit to several drug companies that have gotten, in my \nopinion, extremely greedy.\n  This morning, Mr. President, I was just handed a page from the Roll \nCall newspaper, dated Monday, October 23, 1995, page 8. Here is an \nadvertisement placed by the American pharmaceutical research \ncompanies--by the way, that is the old PMA--Pharmaceutical \nManufacturers Association. They changed their name a few months ago, \nMr. President, so they could add a little cloak of dignity emphasizing \nresearch. They take what we are trying to do apart and they try, as \nthey say, separating fact from fiction in this particular ad. But the \nbottom line is what they have said is extremely misleading. It is \nmotivated by economic gain. In addition to that, it is simply wrong. \nThe motivation for this particular advertisement, in my opinion, is the \ncontinuation of economic greed by some of the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers.\n  Just in the Wall Street Journal, I believe, on Friday, the drug \ncompanies talked about, well, they cannot sell drugs in America as \ncheaply as they can sell these same drugs in Europe or in the other \nindustrialized nations. Look at this headline: ``Strong Global Sales \nLift Drug Company Profits.'' So they are selling overseas these same \ndrugs they sell to us for 40 and 50 and 60 percent more in this \ncountry, they sell these drugs overseas at so much less and they are \nmaking such an enormous profit that they see their stock is going up in \nthese companies, and once again the drug companies find a way to take \nadvantage of the American consumer and certainly the American \ntaxpayer. If we do not correct this issue now, we are going to be \nactually a part, in my opinion, of a terrible mistake that we had a \nchance to correct.\n\n  Here is the alternative, Mr. President. We can stand here and do \nnothing, we can let these drug companies make off like bandits with \nthese unjustified profits, or we can vote for the amendment offered by \nmyself and, hopefully, some of my other colleagues. We can rob older \nAmericans, HMO's and every single taxpayer in this country if we do \nnothing. We can enrich two or three drug companies, we can keep \ncompetition out of the market, or we can make certain that they do not \nreceive money they do not deserve.\n  We can let a loophole rob American consumers of as much as $6 \nbillion. We can let the intense lobbying efforts by one or two drug \ncompanies sway us. We can ensure special treatment to a few companies \nwhile the rest of the country plays fair, following the rules and \nobeying the law.\n  Once again, Mr. President, a few pharmaceutical drug companies are \nthe only companies that are excluded under this provision. They are the \nonly ones given this mistake. They are the ones taking advantage, I \nshould say, of this mistake in the GATT treaty. Now is our opportunity \nto change it. And in my opinion, Mr. President, this is the mother of \nall special interest issues.\n  Let me read from the New York Times when they observed a few days \nago:\n\n       Some of the Nation's largest drug companies will have spent \n     and lobbied heavily against one bill that hardly amounts to \n     budget dust. While its impact on the Federal budget may be \n     minuscule, the measure means a fortune to these drug \n     companies.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nproposal. If we fail, it will allow the legal combination of a legal \nloophole, a procedural technicality, intense lobbying, big bucks, and \nour own failure of will, robbing the American consumers of billions of \ntheir taxes and their income. Every American citizen will be forced to \ncontinue subsidizing an outrageous, unintended windfall to a handful of \ndrug companies simply because we do not have the courage or the \nforesight or the will to admit and to fix our own mistakes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that documentation of savings \nfrom this proposal, letters of support, and recent media articles be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 20, 1995]\n\n       Three Drug Makers Win Suit To Extend Protection of Patents\n\n       Alexandria, Va.--Merck & Company, the Schering Plough \n     Corporation, and Roche Holding A.G., have won a lawsuit \n     against the United States Patent Office and the Food and Drug \n     Administration, in which they had sought an extension on some \n     of their patents.\n       The ruling, reached Monday by the Federal District Court \n     here, is a victory for brand-name drug makers who fought a \n     decision by the F.D.A. and the Patent Office to limit patent \n     protection.\n       Securities analysis said the ruling could affect sales of \n     billions of dollars of brand-\n\n[[Page S 15423]]\n     name drugs that would otherwise be open sooner to sharp competition \n     from less expensive generic versions.\n       Neil B. Sweig, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & \n     Company, said that based on current sales in the United \n     States, the extension could result in $3 billion in sales of \n     Zantac, the ulcer treatment made by the Glaxo Wellcome \n     Company; $1.45 billion in sales of Mevacor, a cholesterol-\n     lowering drug made by Merck, and $280 million in sales of \n     Capoten, a hypertension treatment produced by the Bristol-\n     Myers Squibb Company.\n       Mr. Sweig added that the court ruling had been anticipated \n     by investors and was already reflected in drug companies' \n     stock prices.\n       Under a Federal rule that took effect on June 8, drug \n     makers could either have patent protection under the new \n     world trade organization or the previous system.\n       The new patent protection for brand-name drugs would last \n     as long as 20 years from the date of the patent filing. Under \n     the old system, drug patents were protected in the United \n     States for 17 years after they were granted, plus some of the \n     time drugs were waiting, regulatory review by the F.D.A. In \n     some cases, protection would last longer under the old \n     system.\n       ``The courts ruled that they were wrong, and you can be \n     protected under both systems,'' said Steve Bercham of the \n     Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.\n       Mr. Bercham said, however, that the court had decided that \n     a patent could never result in exclusive marketing rights for \n     more than 14 years.\n       As a result of the decision, Merck's patent on its \n     cholesterol-lowering drug Mevacor was extended to June 15, \n     2001, from Nov. 4, 1999.\n       Gary Latchow, a Merck spokesman, said the patent for the \n     company's ulcer medication Pepcid had also been extended.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: Thank you for your recent letter \n     updating me on the ongoing concerns of the Congress, health \n     care purchasers and consumers over the exclusion of the \n     prescription drug industry from the scope of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (URAA) transitional ``grandfather'' \n     provision.\n       As you note in your letter, I wrote to Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) Commissioner Kessler earlier this year \n     to inform him that the URAA ``grandfater'' provision language \n     was intended by its drafters to be generally applicable and \n     to permit generic pharmaceutical producers to market their \n     products where they had made substantial investments in \n     anticipation of the expiration of the unextended patent \n     terms. While the FDA found that the URAA did not permit it to \n     allow the generic pharmaceutical producers on the market \n     until the expiration of the extended patent term, it stated \n     that ``the language of the URAA does not reflect the \n     legislative intent'' which Congress desired.\n       In light of these events, I applaud your effort to seek to \n     correct this situation through your introduction of the \n     Consumer Access to Prescription Drugs Act. The draft \n     legislation generally reflects the intent of the drafters of \n     the URAA.\n       With regard to the issue of whether this correction would \n     either weaken patent protection under the URAA or diminish \n     our ability to campaign for stronger patent protection \n     abroad, I believe that any concerns in this area are \n     overstated. As you know, we intended to apply this \n     ``grandfather'' provision to the pharmaceutical area, and so \n     legislation of this type should result in a level of \n     protection that is consistent with our original intent. \n     Additionally, this level of protection is consistent with the \n     obligations under the intellectual property agreement \n     negotiated as part of the Uruguay Round, called the ``TRIPs \n     Agreement.'' Just as we are permitted to make limited \n     exceptions to the grant of additional rights as the result of \n     the TRIPs Agreement, so are our trading partners. As we have \n     already made certain exceptions to the rights granted during \n     the extension period for all types of patents other than \n     pharmaceutical patents, the application of these exceptions \n     to pharmaceutical patents should not weaken our ability to \n     insist on strong patent protection in our trading partners. \n     You can be sure that if a trading partner attempts to expand \n     these exceptions beyond those permitted by the Agreement, we \n     will vigorously oppose them.\n       Consequently, I do not think that your efforts will have a \n     negative effect on our ability to ensure that the TRIPs \n     Agreement is fully implemented by our trading partners. I \n     look forward to working with you on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Kantor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \n     Property Rights (TRIPs) and the intended effect of certain \n     provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA). You \n     raise several significant issues related to the nature of the \n     United States' obligations under the TRIPs Agreement and the \n     way in which the United States implemented those obligations \n     in the URAA. In answering your questions, I would like first \n     to indicate the nature of certain of the obligations under \n     the TRIPs Agreement, and then to discuss the provisions in \n     the URAA that are intended to implement those obligations.\n\n\n        U.S. Obligations Under Article 70 of the TRIPs Agreement\n\n       Article 70 of the TRIPs Agreement generally requires World \n     Trade Organization (WTO) Members to apply the high levels of \n     protection required by the TRIPs Agreement to all existing \n     intellectual property. In other words, if a WTO Member \n     provides an additional right or benefit to the owners of a \n     particular type of intellectual property as a result of its \n     implementation of the TRIPs Agreement, it must provide that \n     additional right or benefit to intellectual property created \n     in the future and to intellectual property already created \n     but still subject to protection. Accordingly, in the URAA the \n     United States modified the term of patents from seventeen \n     years from grant to twenty years from application for all \n     future patents, and also applied the new term to existing \n     patents, thereby giving some owners of U.S. patents a longer \n     term of protection.\n       The primary provisions of Article 70 on treatment of \n     existing subject matter and ``newly infringing acts'' are \n     Articles 70:2, 70:3 and 70:4. Article 70:2 contains the \n     general requirement that TRIPs-consistent levels of \n     protection must be applied to existing intellectual property. \n     Article 70:2 also states that in the case of copyrightable \n     subject matter (e.g., books, movies, sound recordings, \n     computer software), copyright obligations, including the \n     grant of retroactive protection must be implemented solely \n     through the application of Article 18 of the Berne Convention \n     for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. This \n     provision makes clear that where copyrightable subject matter \n     must be pulled out of the public domain and granted \n     protection to comply with TRIPs, the terms of Article 18 of \n     the Berne Convention shall control.\n       Article 70:3 of the TRIPs Agreement provides that no WTO \n     Member is obligated to restore protection to subject matter \n     which has fallen into the public domain. For example, an \n     expired patent need not be granted a new term of protection, \n     even if the patent would still be in effect had it been \n     granted a TRIPs-consistent term of protection. As noted \n     above, Article 70:2 expressly carves-out copyright protection \n     from Article 70:3.\n       Article 70:4 provides that to the extent that certain \n     activities become infringing because of the higher levels of \n     protection required by TRIPs, WTO Members may allow a person \n     to engage in such infringing acts as long as they pay \n     equitable remuneration to the right holder. This provision \n     was intended to permit WTO Members to treat equitably those \n     persons who in good faith used or made a significant \n     investment in connection with the use of the intellectual \n     property right in a way that would be prohibited after a \n     TRIPs-consistent level of protection applied. For example, if \n     TRIPs requires an extension of the patent term in a WTO \n     Member, that Member may allow a person who built a factory \n     for the purpose of manufacturing a patented product when the \n     patent was previously expected to expire to make the produce \n     during the extension period, as long as that person pays \n     equitable remuneration to the right holder during the \n     extension period.\n       Consequently, while Article 70:4 could apply to treatment \n     of inventory created before the application of the Agreement, \n     it was not intended to be limited to that situation. The \n     primary intent of this provision was to treat equitably those \n     persons who had made a substantial investment in reliance on \n     the pre-TRIPs level of protection. It was not intended to \n     allow nations with weak patent laws to protect domestic \n     industries while those nations came into conformity with the \n     new TRIPs standards. Investment must be substantial and it \n     must be made by a certain date.\n\n\n        U.S. Implementation of Article 70 of the TRIPs Agreement\n\n       The United States implemented its obligations under the \n     TRIPs Agreement in Sections 501-532 of the URAA. Section \n     532(a) of the URAA amended Section 154 of the Patent Act to \n     change patent terms from a seventeen years from grant system \n     to a twenty years from application system. As noted above, in \n     accordance with our TRIPs Article 70:2 obligations, Section \n     154(c)(1) of the Patent Act was amended to grant owners of \n     patents still in force the benefit of this new system to the \n     extent it increased their term.\n       To treat equitably those persons who had made a substantial \n     investment in reliance on the old patent term, Section 154(c) \n     (1) and (2) of the Patent Act was amended to provide that \n     such persons would be able to make use of the patent during \n     the extension term as long as they paid equitable \n     remuneration to the patent owner. This provision was written \n     neutrally because it was intended to apply to all types of \n     patentable subject matter, including pharmaceutical products. \n     Conforming amendments should have been made to the Federal \n     Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and Section 271 of the Patent Act, \n     but were inadvertently overlooked.\n       Our creation of the ``transition period'' in Article 154(c) \n     of the Patent Act is consistent with our obligations under \n     the TRIPs Agreement. The extension of this transition period \n\n[[Page S 15424]]\n     to pharmaceutical products would also be consistent with these \n     obligations and the intent of the U.S. negotiators involved \n     in drafting the TRIPs Agreement.\n       Finally, the extension of the Section 154(c) to \n     pharmaceutical products would not undermine ongoing U.S. \n     efforts to seek high levels of intellectual property \n     protection around the world. We are acting wholly within our \n     rights in establishing the transition period, as other \n     countries would be if they did the same. Furthermore, we have \n     already established under our law the transition period with \n     respect to all types of patents other than pharmaceutical \n     patents; extending it to pharmaceutical patents would in no \n     way increase the ability of our trading partners to justify \n     their failure to provide TRIPs-consistent patent protection. \n     You can be sure that if one of our trading partners attempts \n     to overstep the equitable treatment permitted under TRIPs \n     Article 70:4, or otherwise fails to live up to the TRIPs \n     Agreement, we will work vigorously to bring them into \n     compliance with their international obligations.\n       I look forward to working with you further on this manner. \n     Please let me know if I can provide you with any more \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Kantor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n [From Prime Institute, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, \n       Health Sciences Unit F-7-159, Minneapolis, MN, March 1995]\n\n  Economic Impact of GATT Patent Extension on Currently Marketed Drugs\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       At least 109 currently patented and marketed drugs will \n     receive a windfall patent extension if GATT rules are \n     retrospectively applied to previously filed or issued \n     patents.\n       The average patent extension for the currently marketed \n     drugs would be more than 12 months with some drugs receiving \n     more than 28 months of added exclusivity.\n       The windfall extension of patent exclusivity for currently \n     marketed drugs will mean that the introduction of lower cost \n     generics will be delayed. Therefore, the American consumer \n     will have to pay more for prescription medications.\n       FDA approved versions of generic drug products typically \n     enter the market at a price more than 25% less than the \n     patented brand. Within one year the price of competing \n     generics will be 45% below the brand; at two years the price \n     will be 60% less and at three years it will average 75% less \n     than the brand name drug (Kidder, Peabody: Generic Drug \n     Industry Overview, October 5, 1994).\n       FDA approved versions of generic drug products typically \n     capture 45% of the units sold within one year of market \n     introduction. After two years their market penetration \n     averages more than 50% of all units sold and by the third \n     year the penetration approaches 60% (Kidder, Peabody: Generic \n     Drug Industry Overview, October 5, 1994).\n       The economic impact of extending the GATT rules to \n     currently marketed drugs can be estimated by applying the \n     recent pricing and market penetration performance of generics \n     to the actual and projected sales volume of currently \n     marketed drugs for the additional length of time that \n     American consumers will have to wait for access to lower cost \n     generics.\n       The projected cost to American consumers from the windfall \n     extension of patent exclusivity for the 109 currently \n     marketed drugs affected by this change will exceed $6 billion \n     (1996 net present value) over the next two decades.\n       Twenty of the most common prescription drugs will account \n     for an increased cost to American consumers of over $4.5 \n     billion (1996 net present value) in the next two decades.\n       There are at least 10 drugs whose patents will expire in \n     1995. The lack of generic competitors for just three of these \n     drugs will cost American consumers $1.2 billion (1996 net \n     present value) in 1996 and 1997.\n       The lower price and high market penetration of generics, \n     when available, results in substantial savings to American \n     consumers. These savings are also of benefit to Medicaid, \n     federal and state government, private insurers, managed care, \n     employers, unions, ERISA plans, and others who pay for \n     prescriptions. The cost of this windfall extension of \n     exclusivity to Medicaid alone will be about $1 billion (1996 \n     net present value) and the total cost to federal and state \n     government will exceed $1.25 billion (1996 net present \n     value).\n       The projected cost to American consumers from the extension \n     of GATT rules to currently marketed drugs has been estimated \n     in a study conducted by the PRIME Institute at the University \n     of Minnesota. The PRIME Institute specializes in research \n     involving pharmaceutical benefit management, economics, and \n     public policy issues.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Oct. 19, 1995]\n\n                      Drugs Get Extra Patent Time\n\n       Washington.--A federal court has decided nearly 100 brand-\n     name drugs may get an extra few years' monopoly in the \n     market, the pharmaceutical industry announced Thursday.\n       At issue is whether the drugs could get two patent \n     extensions--one from a 1984 law and another under a global \n     trade agreement.\n       The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which went into \n     effect in June, extends patent protection to 20 years from \n     the date drug makers file for a patent. Until now, those \n     patents have had a 17-year life from the time they were \n     granted. Current patent-holders will get whichever expiration \n     date is later.\n       A 1984 law already has offered brand-name drugs up to an \n     extra five years' patent life to help offset the time it \n     takes those medicines to get Food and Drug Administration \n     approval for sale.\n       Makers of brand-name drugs said they were entitled to both \n     extensions, which could have given some drugs patent \n     protection for a total of 25 years.\n       But the Patent and Trademark Office decided in June that \n     drugs that got the 1984 extension couldn't get one from GATT \n     too. The ruling affected 94 brand-name drugs and meant the \n     longest a medicine could monopolize the market was about 22 \n     years.\n       The drug industry went to court.

Alan Simpson (R-\n     Wyo) abstained from a Finance Committee vote Friday on an \n     amendment that could affect two major pharmaceutical \n     companies in which he owns thousands of dollars worth of \n     stock. Simpson, who chairs the Finance subcommittee on Social \n     Security and family policy, abstained from voting on an \n     amendment offered by Sens. David Pryor (D-Ark) and John \n     Chafee (R-RI), which according to Pryor would ``close a \n     multibillion-dollar loophole in the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade for the name-brand pharmaceutical \n     industry.''\n       According to his 1994 financial disclosure forms, Simpson \n     owns between $1,000 and $15,000 worth of stock in both Glaxo-\n     Wellcome PLC and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.--two pharmaceutical \n     companies that stand to lose millions of dollars if the \n     Pryor-Chafee amendment is enacted.\n       Simpson said yesterday that he ``just didn't feel \n     comfortable'' voting on the amendment.\n       ``I abstained . . . simply because I own about . . . four \n     or five thousand bucks of Glaxo stock. . . . It is a serious \n     amendment and I just chose to abstain,'' Simpson said.\n       The amendment seeks to put an end to exemptions granted to \n     name-brand pharmaceutical companies allowing them patent \n     extensions on drugs.\n       As Pryor explains it, through GATT, the US ``agreed to \n     extend patents [on all sorts of products] we grant from 17 \n     years to 20 years to conform with the rest of the world,'' \n     but the treaty also included language to allow ``generic \n     manufacturers to come on the market after the 17-year term \n     ended if they agreed to pay a sort of franchise fee to the \n     brand-name company.''\n       After heavily lobbying Congress to keep the 20-year patent \n     extensions under the treaty, the pharmaceutical industry was \n     granted ``special protection'' for some 100 specific drugs.\n       The United States Patent and Trademark Office later revoked \n     the protection of 94 of those drugs, and the Pryor-Chafee \n     amendment seeks to revoke the 20-year patents of the handful \n     of drugs that still carry such protection.\n       Citing a study by the University of Minnesota, Pryor \n     contends that Glaxo, which makes the ulcer drug Zantac \n     prescribed to some 33 million Americans and is the world's \n     largest pharmaceutical company, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, \n     maker of the blood pressure medication Capoten (prescribed to \n     some 15 million), could net a ``windfall'' of $1 billion and \n     $100 million, respectively, if generic companies are \n     prevented from manufacturing the drugs for an additional \n     three years.\n       Despite a 9-7 vote in favor of the amendment, the measure \n     failed when Finance Chairman Bill Roth (R-Del) ruled that the \n     amendment to the budget reconciliation bill was out of order. \n     Roth said the amendment was nongermane, thus requiring a two-\n     thirds majority vote for passage instead of a simple \n     majority.\n       Three other members of the 19-member Finance Committee--\n     Sens. Bob Dole (R-Kan) and Larry Pressler (R-SD) and then-\n     Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore),--also abstained from voting on the \n     amendment.\n       According to Pryor press secretary Justin Johnson, Pressler \n     and Dole had prepared ``no'' votes by proxy and only \n     abstained from voting on the amendment when it became \n     apparent the amendment would fail with or without their \n     votes.\n       And while Dole has no direct holdings in pharmaceutical \n     stock, his wife Elizabeth owns between $1,000 and $15,000 in \n     Bristol-Myers Squibb stock, and she holds between $1,000 and \n     $15,000 in Kimberly-Clark Company stock, another major \n     pharmaceutical corporation, according to 1994 financial \n     disclosure records.\n       Pryor and Chafee have not given up the fight on their \n     amendment, however, and plan to raise the issue on the Senate \n     floor in the near future. According to Johnson, there will be \n     a modification to the amendment and it will be re-offered.\n       And should the Pryor-Chafee amendment make it to the Senate \n     floor, at least five of Simpson's colleagues will face the \n     same choice the Senator did last week, on whether to vote on \n     a measure that could constitute a conflict of interest in \n     light of their private investments.\n\n[[Page S 15425]]\n\n       Among those also owning stock in the affected \n     pharmaceutical companies according to their 1994 financial \n     disclosure records are: Sens. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga), who \n     holds between $1,000 and $15,000 in Glaxo; Judd Gregg (R-NH), \n     between $100,000 and $500,000 in Bristol-Myers Squibb; James \n     Inhofe (R-Okla), between $1,000 and $15,000 in Bristol-Myers \n     Squibb; Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), between $1,000 and $15,000 in \n     Glaxo; and Claiborne Pell (D-RI), between $1,000 and $15,000 \n     in Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n       Simpson said he doesn't know if he will again abstain from \n     voting on the Pryor-Chafee amendment if it reaches the Senate \n     floor.\n       ``I'll go sort it out again and see where we are, but at \n     least everybody will know that I have that type of holding in \n     Glaxo, which is listed in my [financial disclosure] reports \n     anyway,'' Simpson said.\n       According to Rule 37 of the Senate Code of Official \n     Conduct, no Senator shall ``knowingly use his official \n     position to introduce or aid the progress or passage of \n     legislation, a principal purpose of which is to further only \n     his pecuniary interest. . . .''\n       Still, it is exceedingly rare for lawmakers to abstain \n     themselves from a vote, an ethics expert confirmed.\n       According to former House Counsel Stan Brand, ``[Conflict \n     of interest] is something that has been broadly construed in \n     the annals of ethical rule of the House and Senate, and it's \n     only in the most acute cases of a conflict that [someone] is \n     actually barred from voting.''\n       In the first half of 1995, Glaxo-Wellcome's PAC gave \n     $94,300 in political contributions to Republicans and $28,500 \n     to Democrats, while Bristol-Myers Squibb's PAC gave $22,800 \n     to Republicans and $7,300 to Democrats, according to Federal \n     Election Commission records.\n       Five members of the Senate Finance Committee--Sens. Max \n     Baucus (D-Mont), Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Charles Grassley (R-\n     Iowa), Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), Pressler, and Simpson--\n     received political contributions from Glaxo.\n       Baucus and D'Amato each also received contributions from \n     Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Reuter Business Report, Sept. 29, 1995]\n\n          Drug Company Preserves Tax Break in Senate Committee\n\n                           (By David Lawsky)\n\n       A major drug company Friday won a fight in a Senate \n     committee, holding on to a loophole that opponents said will \n     cost consumers $3.6 billion.\n       The Senate Finance Committee, which is considering an \n     omnibus budget bill, turned down an attempt to remove the \n     special treatment for Glaxo Holding PLC and other brand name \n     drug companies.\n       Those against the break promised to bring the fight up \n     again on the floor of the Senate.\n       Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., proposed ending the break for \n     Glaxo because he said it was ``unanticipated and totally \n     inadvertent.'' In fact, Chafee said, when the lawyer for \n     Glaxo discovered the loophole, he said he had a `` `Eureka!' \n     moment.''\n       ``I might say he's entitled to shout `Eureka!' when you've \n     got $3.6 billion'' at stake.\n       A study cited by Chafee showed that without cheaper \n     competition by generic drug companies 13 drug companies stood \n     to reap $4.3 billion, with Glaxo getting most of it.\n       Chairman William Roth, R-Del., ruled Chafee's motion out of \n     order. To the consternation of Chafee and his allies, Roth \n     said he was going to require a two-thirds vote to overturn \n     him, citing a rule.\n       ``Mr. Chairman I've never known us to require a two-thirds \n     vote'' in such a situation, said Sen. Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan, D-N.Y., who was chairman when Democrats held a \n     majority.\n       But Roth held firm and although the committee voted 9-7 to \n     remove the break, Chafee lost.\n       The issue arose out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade, which has a section that in many cases stretched \n     patents from 17 to 20 years.\n       But that section would put generic companies at a \n     disadvantage if they had made expensive preparations to go \n     into business against a patent-holder, anticipating the end \n     of 17-year patents.\n       So a special section was adopted that permitted companies \n     that had sunk money into competition to go ahead and market \n     their competing product, so long as they paid royalties to \n     the brand name company which won the extra patent time.\n       U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said this week in a \n     letter to Chafee the section was supposed to apply to all \n     products but that ``pharmaceutical products . . . were \n     inadvertently overlooked,'' because they needed a special \n     change in the law governing the Food and Drug Administration.\n       The measure was opposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who \n     called it ``complex,'' and by Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-\n     Ill., who said through a spokeswoman she was a friend of the \n     president of Glaxo and had traveled on the company plane to \n     speak at its headquarters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Orlando Sentinel, Sept. 30, 1995]\n\n                 Generic-Drug Talks Stall in Committee\n\n                             (By Maya Bell)\n\n       A bill that would allow generic-drug companies to begin \n     competing with brand-name rivals suffered a setback in \n     Congress on Friday.\n       The Senate Finance Committee voted 9-7 to consider \n     correcting a congressional oversight that protected the \n     makers of 13 brand-name drugs from generic competition for up \n     to three years. Among the drugs are two best-sellers, Zantac \n     for ulcers and Capoten for high blood pressure.\n       But committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., ruled that \n     two-thirds of the committee had to agree to debate the bill. \n     Lacking that majority, the amendment was tabled.\n       ``It's still a victory. The reason we couldn't get a \n     hearing was procedural,'' said Natalie Shear, a spokeswoman \n     for the Generic Drug Equity Coalition, a consortium of \n     consumer groups and generic-drug companies lobbying Congress \n     to correct its mistake. ``The bottom line was the senators \n     indicated their support.''\n       Sen. Bob Graham, the only Floridian on the committee, voted \n     to consider the bill.\n       A spokesman for one of the sponsors, Sen. Richard Pryor, D-\n     Ark., said the measure would be brought up again in another \n     forum.\n       ``It's definitely not dead yet,'' said Justin Johnson, \n     Pryor's press secretary. ``There will be a modification, and \n     it will be reoffered. We'll keep after it.''\n       The bill is intended to correct what is widely acknowledged \n     to have been a congressional oversight. The mistake was made \n     when Congress adopted the language for the global trade \n     treaty known as GATT. While extending U.S. patent terms from \n     17 years to 20 years to comply with the General Agreement on \n     Trade and Tariffs, Congress inadvertently exempted 13 brand-\n     name drugs from generic competition for up to three years.\n       The drug coalition estimates that the oversight will cost \n     consumers, who won't have generic alternatives for some \n     prescriptions as early as anticipated, nearly $2 billion.\n       Among the biggest beneficiaries are drug giants Glaxo-\n     Wellcome Inc., the makers of Zantac, and Bristol-Myers Squibb \n     Co., which produces Capoten. Last year, Glaxo sold $2.7 \n     billion worth of Zantac and Bristol-Myers $581 million of \n     Capoten in the United States.\n       Neither company could be reached for comment Friday. Glaxo \n     spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek has said the company opposes the \n     GATT fix because it would send a message to other countries \n     that they, too, can tinker with the treaty to protect a \n     favored industry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, Sept. 28, 1995]\n\n                 Drug Firms Fight To Preserve Windfall\n\n                            (By John Maggs)\n\n       Washington.--A handful of powerful drug companies are \n     waging one of the most furious and extravagant lobbying \n     campaigns seen on Capitol Hill in years, all to preserve an \n     inadvertent change to U.S. law in last fall's trade bill that \n     promises them billions of dollars in unexpected profit.\n       The drug companies are shelling out millions of dollars to \n     enlist the influence of distinguished former senators such as \n     Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Dennis DeConcini of \n     Arizona, and former U.S. Trade Representative and Senator \n     William Brock of Tennessee.\n       The prize for this largess is one of the biggest payoffs \n     for the smallest number of companies ever granted by Congress \n     without a word of debate.\n       One company alone, Britain's Glaxo Holdings PLC, will rake \n     in $3.6 billion over the next two years as a result of this \n     legal twist of fate, all of it money that it never expected \n     to earn. This windfall will come out of the pockets of ulcer \n     patients, most of them in the United States, who will pay \n     higher prices for Glaxo's revolutionary anti-ulcer drug \n     Zantac.\n       The explanation begins with last year's bill to implement \n     the Uruguay Round trade agreement, which lowered trade \n     barriers worldwide and increased protection for patented \n     drugs and copyrighted material. As part of that international \n     patent deal, the United States agreed to change the life of \n     new patents from 17 years after they are first granted to the \n     norm for the rest of the world--20 years from the date a \n     patent request is first made.\n       The trade legislation sent to Congress made the patent term \n     change effective for all patents, so that those coming due \n     less than 20 years after they were originally filed were \n     automatically granted an extension. Mindful that this would \n     have handed drug companies an unwarranted windfall, the trade \n     bill provided that generic drug firms would be allowed to \n     begin manufacturing the patented drugs after the original \n     patent date, provided they pay a licensing fee to the big \n     drug companies.\n       But unknown to the drafters of this legislation, a 1984 \n     drug law effectively freed Glaxo and other big pharmaceutical \n     companies from this obligation to license their products. In \n     a moment of insight a lawyer for Glaxo discovered this \n     overlooked statute, and set off a bitter fight with generic \n     drug companies to reverse this inadvertent stroke of good \n     luck.\n       This list of beneficiaries is a long one. Glaxo is by far \n     the biggest--it will receive nearly two years of extra \n     monopoly control over Zantac, earning $6 million a day more \n     than it would have earned if competing with generic drug \n     producers. Also benefitting are Squibb, which will get $311 \n     million of added profits for its ACE hypertension drug; \n     Organon, which gets $108 billion for its Norcoron anestesia; \n     and Searle, which gets $102 million for its Cytolec anti-\n     ulcer drug.\n       Advocates of the generics have lined up the support of U.S. \n     Trade Representative Mickey \n\n[[Page S 15426]]\n\n     Kantor in arguing that the windfall was an inadvertent one.\n       As soon as today, Sens. David Pryor, D-Ark., and John \n     Chafee, R-R.I., are expected to offer an amendment to reverse \n     this windfall profit, but they face an uphill battle. Sen. \n     Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is leading the fight for Glaxo, whose \n     U.S. subsidiary is based in North Carolina. Sen. Helms faces \n     re-election in 1996 and some of Zantac's billions of dollars \n     in earnings would be useful in financing his campaign.\n       Sen. Helms has lined up the support of majority leader Bob \n     Dole, who has in turn made preserving the windfall for the \n     drug companies a partisan issue. Few Republicans other than \n     Sen. Chafee have committed to support the Pryor amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, Oct. 2, 1995]\n\n                 Senate Panel: No Vote on Drug Loophole\n\n       Washington.--Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bill Roth, \n     R-Del., refused to allow a vote to repeal a controversial \n     loophole in U.S. patent law, despite opposition to his \n     unusual ruling from a bipartisan majority of the committee.\n       Behind the maneuvering was a huge amount of money for \n     British-owned Glaxo Holding PLC and the tight grip that \n     Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., holds over the \n     Finance Committee.\n       The issue apparently resulted from an inadvertent mistake \n     in drafting last fall's trade bill, which gave Glaxo an \n     unexpected windfall of $3.6 billion by extending for two \n     years its exclusive patent rights on the anti-ulcer medicine \n     Zantac.\n       Generic drug companies are clamoring to put out knock-off \n     versions of Zantac, but cannot because government lawyers \n     drafting the trade bill overlooked a 1984 law that \n     effectively prevented these generics from starting \n     production. Career trade negotiators who worked on the \n     legislation confirmed Friday that it was an oversight.\n       Sens. John Chafee, R-R.I., and David Pryor, D-Ark., Friday \n     sought to reverse this mistake with an amendment to the huge \n     budget reconciliation bill before the Finance Committee. \n     Although Finance was hearing other amendments on Medicaid and \n     Medicare, Mr. Roth deemed the patent measure out of order, \n     declaring that it was in the jurisdiction of the Labor \n     Committee and he refused to accept a letter from Labor \n     waiving jurisdiction.\n       Behind his resolve was Mr. Dole, who had agreed to block a \n     vote at the request of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who faces \n     re-election in 1996 and could use the financial help of the \n     U.S. subsidiary of Glaxo, located in North Carolina.\n       In a perhaps unprecedented move, Mr. Chafee forced a vote \n     on Mr. Roth's decision. Little-used rules required a two-\n     thirds majority to overrule the chair.\n       Thus a 9-7 vote to overrule failed, despite the majority.\n       Mr. Roth later declined to comment on whether the ruling \n     had been made under pressure from Mr. Dole. ``I don't discuss \n     my meetings with Sen. Dole,'' he said, ``but this was based \n     on the rules of the Finance Committee.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, Oct. 5, 1995]\n\n                        The Senator From Glaxo?\n\n       When Sen.

Roth, so the thinking went, would be beholden to Sen. \n     Majority Leader Bob Dole and not act independently on \n     committee business. That may have been an unfair rap, but so \n     far it seems to be coming true.\n       Consider a case involving patents that came before the \n     Finance panel recently. Last fall, as part of the new Uruguay \n     Round trade deal, Congress changed the term for patent \n     protection to make the U.S. standard match the norm in most \n     other countries. An oversight by government lawyers, however, \n     effectively extended the life of a handful of drug patents, \n     denying generic drug companies the right to compete with \n     these patent-holders.\n       By far the biggest beneficiary of this mistake is British-\n     owned Glaxo Pharmaceuticals, which will earn $3.6 billion by \n     gaining an extra 19 months of patent protection for a single \n     drug--its Zantac anti-ulcer medicine.\n       To preserve this windfall, Glaxo has enlisted, among \n     others, Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the state where \n     Glaxo's U.S. subsidiary is located. Facing re-election in \n     1996, Sen. Helms reportedly went to Sen. Bob Dole and got his \n     support for squelching any attempt to repeal Glaxo's bonus.\n       When Sens. John Chafee and David Pryor offered an amendment \n     to close the Glaxo loophole, Sen. Roth blocked them. Using a \n     parliamentary ruling from Sen. Dole's office, he ruled the \n     amendment out of order, even though it fell within the \n     committee's purview on health care and trade.\n       Even though most committee members favored a vote on the \n     proposal, Sen. Roth ignored their pleas. In a move the \n     committee hadn't seen in decades, a majority of members then \n     voted to overrule the chairman on a procedural point, tossing \n     out a tradition of collegiality.\n       In the end Sen. Roth prevailed, since two-thirds of \n     committee members were needed to overrule him.

Lewis)\n\n       Washington, September 27.--By the time the Senate Finance \n     Committee resumes consideration of the Federal budget's \n     multibillion dollar issues Thursday, some of the nation's \n     largest drug companies will have spent and lobbied heavily \n     against one amendment that hardly amounts to budget dust.\n       But while its impact on the Federal budget may be \n     minuscule, the measure means a fortune to the drug companies.\n       The amendment at issue would close what appears to be an \n     unintended loophole in an international trade treaty enacted \n     last year that extends the life of patents on prescription \n     drugs. A handful of drug companies are fighting to protect \n     the provision for billions of dollars in additional profits \n     they would receive by having a longer period to sell their \n     products before other companies could make low-cost generic \n     alternatives. On the other side of the issue are members of \n     the generic drug industry, which in coalition with consumer \n     groups argues that the failure to close the loophole will \n     cost patients billions of dollars.\n       While both sides have their teams of lobbyists, the major \n     drug companies have enlisted a virtual army of advocates, \n     including one former Senator and several former senior \n     Congressional aides who have been clustering outside the \n     Senate hearing room in which the committee has been meeting \n     this week. One company, Glaxo-Wellcome P.L.C. of North \n     Carolina, which probably has the most at stake, has retained \n     the most influential phalanx of lobbyists.\n       Donations from Glaxo's political action committee to \n     members of Congress have more than doubled in the most recent \n     reporting period, compared to the same period two years ago, \n     according to records of the Federal Election Commission.\n       Glaxo, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, has the \n     patent on Zantac, widely used drug to treat ulcers. The drug, \n     which retails for about $2 a tablet, accounts for about $2.1 \n     billion in annual sales for the company, said Nancy Pekarek, \n     Glaxo's manager of corporate relations. This revenue will \n     drop sharply once generic versions of Zantac are permitted.\n       That the issue of the patent extensions arises from an \n     unintended loophole is generally beyond dispute.\n       Glaxo's lawyer told Business Week magazine in May that he \n     had ``a Eureka! moment'' when he was poring over the details \n     of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade signed into law \n     last year and discovered that the language could be read to \n     extend patents on prescriptions drugs. The drug companies \n     pressed their interpretation on the Food and Drug \n     Administration, which last May reluctantly acknowledged they \n     were correct. Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade \n     Representative who negotiated the treaty has written a letter \n     to the Senate saying the negotiators did not mean to incur \n     this consequence.\n       Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, has been trying \n     to enact an amendment to the budget bill that would do just \n     that, eliminate what he said is a ``windfall'' for the drug \n     companies. His amendment would restore the 17-year limit on a \n     drug company's patent of a new medicine, the period during \n     which other companies are prohibited from making a generic \n     equivalent.\n       ``It's absolutely an unjust enrichment,'' he said. ``A \n     classic case of the law of unintended consequences.''\n       What happened to create this fortuitous situation for the \n     drug companies was that when the trade agreement was \n     negotiated, it included a provision for bringing all 123 \n     countries onto the same standard for patent protections. It \n     required the United States to switch from granting 17-year \n     patents from the time of their approval to giving 20-year \n     patents from the time of the application for a patent.\n       Depending on how long it took to gain patent approval, the \n     law gave companies up to three years of extra protection for \n     their products. About 10 drugs are affected, and Glaxo's \n     Zantac would gain 19 extra months of patent protection.\n       Ms. Pekarek of Glaxo said that her company was not fighting \n     the amendment because of its effect on Zantac, but because of \n     ``a much broader issue of worldwide patient protections.''\n       She said that it was important not to tamper with the trade \n     treaty because, ``if we do anything to undercut it that would \n     be opening the door for other countries to make special \n     provisions on patents for their products.''\n       The United States is the world's leader in producing new \n     medicines, and the pharmaceutical industry has long argued \n     that its profits during the patent protection period finance \n     research on new drugs.\n       Among those Glaxo has employed to lobby the Senate is \n     William Brock, a former Republican Senator from Tennessee. \n     Mr. Brock is also particularly suited to press the point \n     about worldwide patent consistency because he is also a \n     former United States Trade Representative.\n       He has been making that argument this week in the \n     Republican cloakroom to which he has access as a former \n     Senator. Mr. Kantor, the current trade representative, has \n     disputed that argument.\n       The amendment sponsored by Mr. Pryor as well as Senator \n     John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, may come up as \n     early as Thursday.\n       But its fate is uncertain, since it is a tenet of Capitol \n     Hill that it is more difficult to pass something than to \n     defeat it. Most of the Democrats are expected to support the \n     measure but at least one Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of \n     Illinois declared her opposition today.\n       Senator Moseley-Braun said through a spokeswoman today that \n     she was a longtime friend of Robert Ingram, president and \n     chief executive of Glaxo. She flew on the company's jet last \n     March to Glaxo's headquarters to give a speech and meet with \n     community leaders.\n       She said through her spokeswoman, Joanna Slaney, that she \n     opposed the amendment because she believed the trade \n     agreement should not be tampered with.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         [From the Food and Drug Inside Report, Sept. 29, 1995]\n\n   Glaxo Rolls Out ``Big Bucks'' Card in GATT Battle on Capitol Hill\n\n\n   republicans uneasy with heavy-hitter lobbyists and score sheet on \n              campaign contributions being touted by glaxo\n\n       When the congressional staffers working on H.R. 5121 sat \n     down last November to draft the specific language that would \n     implement the GATT in the United States, it must have been \n     very late when the final draft was completed. It would, after \n     all, be understandable that these staffers would be tired \n     after laboring for months on multiple versions of the \n     implementing statute for GATT. The complexities of the GATT \n     Agreement are legion, and even experienced international \n     trade lawyers were hard pressed to provide clear explanations \n     of a great deal of the sections of GATT. The bottom line, \n     borne no doubt from those difficult conditions, the Congress \n     made a mistake.\n       Like much of the grinding machinery of the legislative \n     process, the impact of that mistake took some time to assess. \n     In this case, the mistake was a simple oversight by the \n     drafters who failed to contemplate the importance of \n     including conforming amendments to the Federal Food and \n     Cosmetic Act and Section 271 of the Patent Act.\n       Shortly after passage of H.R. 5121, no doubt in the richly \n     paneled offices of one of Washington's expensive law firms, a \n     lawyer by the name of Marc Shapiro was laboring on the \n     language of the newly passed legislation. No doubt it was an \n     effort to advise his client, Glaxo Holding PLC, of what they \n     needed to do to comply with the various. For Marc Shapiro, \n     who is known among his colleagues as a professional with a \n     deep understanding of his craft, it was a mind numbing \n     experience when he read the plain language that set forth \n     Congress' view of how GATT would be implemented in the United \n     States.\n       In order to comply with an ``international harmonization'' \n     of patent terms with member nations of GATT, the United \n     States adopted changes to the patent term to commence at the \n     date of filing with the patent office and extend for a period \n     of 20 years. That contrasts with the previous U.S. patent law \n     that had provided for a 17-year patent term which commenced \n     from the date of approval of the patent by the Patent and \n     Trademarks Office (PTO).\n       The GATT includes a section known as Trade-Related Aspects \n     of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) which requires member \n     countries to apply high levels of protections for existing \n     patent holders. The United States fulfilled its obligations \n     under TRIPs by amending the Patent Act of grant owners of \n     patents still in force the benefits of the new terms to the \n     extent that it increased their patent protection term.\n       But TRIPs also had specific provisions to protect those \n     individuals who had made a ``substantial investment'' in \n     anticipation of the expiration of the patent under the old \n     system. To balance the interests to the existing patent \n     holders, those who had made substantial investment would be \n     required to pay ``equitable remuneration'' to the patent \n     holder.\n       Marc Shapiro, while sifting through the legislation, had \n     what he characterized to a Business Week reporter as a \n     ``eureka moment'' when he discovered that Congress had \n     extended the patents of a number of Glaxo products, and had \n     provided no protections for generic drug manufacturers even \n     if they had made the required substantial investment.\n       For generic drug manufacturers, it was a setback. For \n     senior citizens on fixed incomes who rely heavily on access \n     to generic drug products to ease the financial burden of \n     needed prescription drugs, it was a disaster. For low-income \n     families with children who are forced to rely upon generic \n     drugs in difficult economic circumstances where the choice \n     is often not to fill a needed prescription because of \n     cost, it was a horrible calamity. For the U.S. government \n     health care programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans \n     Affairs, Indian Health Service, and the Public Health \n     Service, it is an unmitigated catastrophe. \n\n[[Page S 15428]]\n\n       Glaxo executives and lobbyists, however, were whooping it \n     up like they had just won the Super Bowl. In a certain sense, \n     they had.\n       The flagship Glaxo product, Zantac, was granted an \n     additional 19 months of patent protection. It was totally \n     unanticipated by Glaxo. Indeed, they had priced their product \n     over the 17-year patent term in anticipation of the old term, \n     and the passage of the new law occurred within months of the \n     expiration of the patent. The overall revenue gain was \n     billions.\n       Glaxo lobbyists now bristle at the characterization of the \n     revenues raked in during the extended patent term as being \n     ``windfall profits.'' ``That is not fair because we all know \n     that we gave up a lot to the generic industry back in 1984. \n     We're just seeing a justified correction,'' claims one Glaxo \n     lobbyist.\n       The 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration \n     Act, commonly referred to as ``Hatch-Waxman,'' did indeed \n     involve a carefully crafted compromise between the brand \n     industry and generic drug manufacturers. The generics got \n     pre-expiration access to patented raw materials to conduct \n     testing to theoretically allow FDA to approve the ANDA on the \n     date of patent expiration. The brand industry got a guarantee \n     of 14 years of market exclusivity despite any delays in FDA \n     review.\n       Many have credited the Hatch-Waxman Act as having been the \n     catalyst for a rapid expansion of the generic drug industry. \n     Senior citizen groups and consumer advocacy groups have \n     lauded the Act as key to improving the health of financially \n     fragile purchases who often deferred purchasing needed drugs \n     simply because of the high cost of brand name drug products.\n       There has not been any serious attack on the Hatch-Waxman \n     Act as having been ``unbalanced'' to one side or the other \n     over the first ten years of its existence. But now, in 1995, \n     Glaxo points to the need for restoring some balance to the \n     brand industry for injury heaped on it by Hatch-Waxman.\n       The Generic Drug Equity Coalition, a group of consumer \n     advocate groups, senior citizen lobbying groups, and generic \n     industry supporters, sees the issue a little differently. \n     ``Glaxo has no legitimate gripe with the proposed fix. It \n     will simply mean they won't get to keep the multi-billion \n     windfall profit they received solely from a legislative \n     mistake. They didn't earn that windfall profit. They don't \n     deserve that windfall profit. But they want to take those \n     profits right out of the pockets of people who can least \n     afford their high prices,'' complained one Coalition FDA \n     Insider.\n       Capital Hill staffers are caught in a tough situation. \n     Privately, of 33 staffers contacted on this issue, none \n     disagreed with the fact the mistake needed to be corrected. \n     None disagreed that the consumers and government would have \n     to pay unjustified higher prices for products that should \n     have generic competition. All of the staffers agreed that \n     Glaxo did not deserve the billions they would receive from \n     this mistake. But only 1 staffer was absolutely confident \n     Congress would correct the mistake.\n       ``What can we do. Glaxo has made campaign contributions to \n     all of our bosses. The Chairman of the company [Glaxo] has \n     been demanding personal meetings with our bosses. Is there \n     any doubt about the subtle message being conveyed. `We are \n     here to pick up the chit.' This is going to be a case of pure \n     political conflict, with the consumers on the side of the \n     angels and Glaxo with the gold shillings. I just don't know \n     how it will come out,'' laments one Senate Finance Committee \n     staff FDA Insider.\n\n                         The battle lines drawn\n\n       The political battle lines are not clearly defined. For the \n     generic coalition, Senator John Chafee (R-Rhode Island), \n     Senator Hank Brown (R-Colorado), and Senator David Pryor (D-\n     Arkansas) have been working to correct the mistake in the \n     GATT language. For Glaxo, there is less public enthusiasm, \n     but a lot of fire-power by virtue of the campaign favors that \n     are being called in. Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-New York) has \n     obviously been pressed into service by virtue of his position \n     as Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. \n     Some other Republicans are concerned about the \n     appropriateness of the high-level of visibility that D'Amato \n     has taken on the issue, but sources at the Campaign Committee \n     bluntly told FDIR that ``Glaxo was taking no prisoners'' on \n     this issue.\n       Senator Jesse Helms (R-North Carolina) has dutifully \n     stepped to the plate to help his home state Glaxo workers \n     (the U.S. Glaxo operations are in the Research Triangle in \n     Raleigh, North Carolina). Beyond that, there are only a group \n     of stealth Glaxo supporters who are desperately hoping that \n     something will happen to allow them to get off the end of the \n     Glaxo spear. For most it is a horrible political position to \n     be in to appear to oppose access to lower cost generic drugs \n     for senior citizens and low-income families.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored the 5-year \n     savings to Medicaid at $150 million. That is no small \n     potatoes to Republicans seeking savings. But that amount is \n     minuscule compared to the $2 billion cost to consumers \n     identified in a Muse & Associates economic impact analysis. \n     At that number the political pain becomes much deeper and the \n     potential for future constituent problems becomes very real.\n       The strategy for correcting the GATT legislation mistake is \n     to include a provision in the Budget Reconciliation Act as an \n     amendment in the Senate Finance Committee markup. Glaxo \n     supporters are trying to argue the amendment is not germane \n     under the ``Byrd Rule'' since the savings flow to the \n     Medicaid block grants and not to the Federal deficit. But \n     Glaxo critics argue the block grants are unique to the \n     Finance Committee review cycle this time around, and \n     virtually all of the provisions technically trample on the \n     Byrd rule in order to facilitate the block grants being \n     transferred from the Federal Government to the states.\n       The central substantive argument Glaxo has relied upon has \n     been that any change now would upset the delicate balance \n     with World Trade Organization (WTO) members who have a \n     history of poor enforcement of patent infringements in their \n     countries. Glaxo points to certain language in the GATT and \n     TRIPs they claim was in fact incorporated in the strategy of \n     the H.R. 5121 drafters. The thesis, then, is that there was \n     no error or mistake, but the language was clearly set forth \n     to express the specific intent of the U.S. Congress.\n       ``They must have their fingers crossed behind their backs \n     when they sling that BS up here,'' commented on House Ways \n     and Means Committee staffer. ``It was a mistake, we know it, \n     and they know it.\n       Senator Chafee wanted to know the truth of the matter, so \n     he sought the advice of USTR Ambassador Micky Kantor. Kantor \n     was succinct in his view: ``This provision [Section 154(c) \n     (1) and (2) of the Patent Act] was intended to apply to all \n     types of patentable subject matter, including pharmaceutical \n     products. Conforming amendments should have been made to the \n     Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and Section 271 of the \n     Patent Act, but were inadvertently overlooked.''\n       The key part of the Glaxo argument is directed at the \n     problems encountered around the world with poor enforcement \n     of patents, particularly with some members of WTO. They \n     advance the argument that any tinkering with the present \n     language would send a strong message to our trading partners \n     that they need not aggressively enforce patent rights. It is \n     an argument that seemingly was sufficient for Glaxo \n     supporters to hang their hats on.\n       But Ambassador Kantor punched big holes in that argument, \n     and has left Glaxo very vulnerable to the charge that they \n     are just trying to keep an unjustified windfall profit. It is \n     a message that Glaxo has tried to gussy up with an elite \n     lobbying corps. Former Senator Warren Rudman and former \n     Senator Bill Brock were both brought in to shore up an \n     eroding Glaxo position. That augments a term of virtually \n     every high-powered lobbyist in Washington available to work. \n     ``The `alligator shoe' crowd is apparently out in force,'' \n     commented one House Commerce Committee staff FDA Insider.\n       The generic drug industry, on the other hand, seems to have \n     placed its fate in the hands of a rag-tag band of consumer \n     advocates and senior citizen advocacy groups. It seems to be \n     working. Congressional staffers report a substantial interest \n     in the issue among talk show hosts around the country.\n       ``Our phone lines are burning up with senior citizens who \n     are just hopping mad over the prospect we may add costs to \n     drugs. I don't think we want to be in that position,'' \n     observed a Senate staff FDA Insider.\n       Whatever the Senate Finance Committee does on this issue in \n     the Budget Reconciliation markup, it promises to be a hot \n     issue over the next several weeks. For Marc Shapiro, he is \n     surely hoping his ``eureka moment'' doesn't turn into a \n     ``Maalox minute.'' Certainly it is a comment he wished he \n     could take back and recast it in less flammatory language.\n       ``This battle boils down to a simple issue. Is there any \n     justification for allowing Glaxo to keep the billions of \n     dollars they will get simply from an error in drafting a \n     piece of legislation.\n       ``Did Glaxo earn these windfall profits? No.\n       ``Did Glaxo expect or need these windfall profits to fund \n     R for the product? No.\n       ``Did Glaxo project these windfall revenues into pricing to \n     recover a fair return on their investment? No.\n       ``I have not yet heard one compelling argument to justify a \n     vote to let them keep money Glaxo will get on the backs of \n     senior citizens and poor families. Glaxo is getting access to \n     various members because they have been strong campaign \n     contributors.

That's because the patent for Zantac, \n     slated to expire this December, had been extended until July \n     1997, preventing the release of a generic equivalent until \n     then.\n       The retired Dade County school principal was even more \n     surprised to learn the convoluted reason for the delay, which \n     could cost her roughly $430 over the life of the extended \n     patent. In implementing the worldwide trade agreement known \n     as GATT, the U.S. Congress inadvertently exempted at least 13 \n     brand-name drugs from generic competition for up to three \n     years.\n       Among them: Zantac and the high blood-pressure medicine \n     Capoten, among the best-selling drugs in the world.\n       The oversight may have been unintentional but, outraged \n     consumer groups say, its impact is enormous: Brand-name drug \n     companies, primarily Glaxo Wellcome Inc. and Bristol-Myers \n     Squibb Co., the makers of Zantac and Capoten, will reap \n     nearly a $2 billion windfall at the expense of the public.\n       Last year, Glaxo sold $2.7 billion worth of Zantac and \n     Bristol-Myers $581 million of Capoten in the United States \n     alone. Together, they accounted for nearly 48 million \n     prescriptions.\n       Paying most for the delayed availability of the generic \n     drugs, advocates say, will be the elderly, who consume a \n     third of the $64 billion worth of prescriptions sold \n     annually. Because Medicare does not cover the cost of \n     prescriptions, seniors such as Tannen often pay for them out \n     of their own pockets.\n       ``It was an unintended mistake by Congress, but the public \n     will pay dearly for it,'' said Dixie Horning, executive \n     director of the Gray Panthers, a lobbying group for the \n     elderly. ``Not only are the people who can least afford it--\n     senior citizens on fixed incomes--paying more for their drugs \n     than they ought to be, but taxpayers are too. The government, \n     and that means you, is a big buyer of these drugs.''\n       A study conducted for the Generic Drug Equity Coalition, a \n     consortium of 26 consumer groups and generic-drug companies \n     urging Congress to correct its mistake, estimated the cost of \n     delaying the 13 generic substitutes of $1.9 billion. Sen. \n     David Pryor, D-Ark., the ranking minority member and former \n     chairman of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, \n     introduced a bill to clarify Congress' intent earlier this \n     month. The bill would not alter the GATT treaty, nor require \n     ratification from other countries.\n       Florida's U.S. senators, Republican Connie Mack and \n     Democrat Bob Graham, are not involved in the issue yet, but \n     their staffs said they will take a close look at the \n     legislation when they return from summer recess. In the \n     meantime, at least one generic-drug company is taking its \n     fight to enter the market to court.\n       Should the bill pass, senior citizens and the federal \n     Medicaid program stand to gain some of the biggest savings, \n     said Don Muse, a former analyst for the Congressional Budget \n     Office and author of the coalition study. He projected \n     seniors would save $517 million; the Medicaid program, which \n     covers prescriptions, would save another $205 million, and \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs $21 million. Other big \n     savers would include insurance companies, whose medical plans \n     often require members to elect generic drugs.\n       The estimated savings are very conservative, the coalition \n     says, because the study assumes the generic products would be \n     only 10 percent cheaper than their brand name equivalents. \n     However, generic drugs have historically debuted at a price \n     about one-fourth less than the brand, quickly falling to 75 \n     percent of the brand cost.\n       How the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wound up \n     hurting consumers such as Tannen while helping companies such \n     as Glaxo is as complicated as the 8,000-page treaty itself. \n     The trouble began when Congress changed U.S. patent law to \n     match the global standard set by GATT. The change extended \n     the life of U.S. patents from 17 years to 20 years, \n     benefiting current patent-holders by up to three years.\n       But Congress recognized that the change would, as one \n     congressional staffer put it, ``move the goal posts back'' \n     for companies that anticipated a patent expiring and already \n     had a generic product in the pipeline. So Congress devised a \n     mechanism allowing those companies to enter the market on the \n     day the original patent would have expired. The compromise: \n     The generic company would pay the brand-name company a \n     royalty until the extended patent expired.\n       Everything was fine until the generic-drug companies \n     realized that Congress overlooked the very law that launched \n     their industry in 1984. The law plainly states that a generic \n     drug cannot come to market before the brand's patent expires. \n     Hamstrung by the conflict, the Food and Drug Administration \n     forbade generic-drug companies from selling their products \n     until the extended patents expire.\n       As a rsult, the prescription drug industry is the only \n     industry in the nation that will benefit from longer patent \n     terms but be exempted from generic competition during the \n     compromise period.\n       The ruling felt like a kick in the teeth to Patrick \n     McEnany, president of Royce Laboratories Inc., a small but \n     rapidly growing generic drug company in Miami that nearly \n     doubled its sales last year to $6.6 million.\n       Soon after McEnany joined Royce in 1991, the company set \n     out to develop a generic form for Capoten, which was supposed \n     to lose its patent on Aug. 8. Spending more than $1 million \n     to develop a bio-equivalent, Royce hoped to put the first \n     Capoten substitute on the shelf, a key to capturing the \n     generic market.\n       ``In this business, timing is everything,'' said Robert \n     Band, Royce's chief financial officer. ``Once the shelf space \n     is taken up, it's hard to wrestile it away.''\n       The FDA ruling, however, extended Capoten's patent for six \n     months, keeping Royce and five other companies from competing \n     with Bristol-Myers until February.\n       The company counted on attracting an enviable share of the \n     nearly 15 million Capoten prescriptions sold annually during \n     the next six months. Instead it was left with the prospect of \n     having even more generic competitors come February.\n       Not content to let that happen, Royce picked a fight with \n     Bristol-Myers in U.S. District Court in Miami, winning the \n     first round nine days ago when a judge ruled that the FDA was \n     free to approve Royce's Capoten product.\n       Bristol-Myers appealed, and the FDA said it would not act \n     on the court action until that appeal was exhausted.\n       ``When we enbarked on this product, we relied on a set of \n     rules and the rules changed--not in the middle of the game, \n     but at the end of the game,'' McEnany said. ``It is an \n     injustice to us and to the consumer.''\n       Royce is not alone. Novopharm USA Inc., an Illinois-based \n     pharmaceutical company, has millions of dollars worth of its \n     generic form of Capoten sitting in inventory. Worse, \n     Novopharm has a $38-million plant under construction in North \n     Carolina, company president Bill Gunter said. It was where \n     Novopharm planned to begin manufacturing its generic \n     alternative for Zantac this December.\n       ``Now we're scrambling to figure out what we can do to \n     justify that huge, white building,'' Gunter said. ``It's not \n     a simple thing.''\n       Royce and Novopharm are members of the coalition pushing \n     Congress to correct its oversight. They aren't, however, \n     getting much sympathy from brand-name manufacturers, who \n     argue that it is the generic competitors reaping the \n     windfall. After all, generic manufacturers capitalize on the \n     millions of dollars brand-name companies spend on research \n     and development, coming to market without doing the same \n     science.\n       Bristol-Myers spokesman Bob Laverty points out that, since \n     Capoten was first approved in 1981 to combat high blood \n     pressure, the company has discovered three other life-saving \n     uses for the drug. In his view, Bristol-Myers has more than \n     earned its patent extension.\n       ``We don't feel this is a windfall because the company has \n     continued to invest in this product over the years,'' Laverty \n     said. ``We've continued to pour research dollars into the \n     product and it has helped consumers tremendously.''\n       Glaxo paints the GATT flap as a trade issue, not a consumer \n     issue. Company spokeswoman Nancy Pekarek warns that if \n     Congress amends the GATT law to appease the genertic drug \n     industry, it will send a message to other countries that \n     they, too, can tinker with their patent laws to protect a \n     favored industry.\n       ``The law is clear and it should be followed,'' Pekarek \n     said ``Generic companies already have a shortcut and for that \n     shortcut they promised to honor the patent expiration date. \n     Yes, the rules changed, but everybody has to abide by the \n     rules.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From USA Today, Aug. 8, 1995]\n\n                     GATT Delayed New Generic Drugs\n\n                           (By Anita Manning)\n\n       The world trade agreement GATT extended patents on a dozen \n     drugs--including popular blood pressure and ulcer \n     medications--delaying generic manufacturing and costing \n     consumers millions of dollars, consumer advocates say.\n       The patents were to expire today on Capoten and Capozide \n     and on Zantac in December, but the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade extends them into 1996 and 1997.\n       Patents had run 17 years; GATT extended it to 20 years.\n       ``GATT created a windfall for drug companies,'' says Jim \n     Firman of the National Council on the Aging.\n       In 1994, nearly 15 million prescriptions were written for \n     blood pressure medicine Capoten/Capozide, at $56.29 each \n     wholesale, and more than 33.4 million for the ulcer drug \n     Zantac, at $81.47, says the Generic Drug Equity Coalition.\n       Steve Berchem, of the trade group Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of \n\n[[Page S 15430]]\n     America, says patents are the industry's ``lifeblood.'' ``Patents help \n     companies generate revenue to do further research.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, June 8, 1995]\n\n                Ruling Shortens Branded Drugs' Monopoly\n\n       Nearly 100 brand-name drugs lost their chance at an extra \n     few years' monopoly in the market Wednesday under a ruling by \n     the U.S. Patent and Trade Office.\n       At issue is whether the drugs could get two patent \n     extensions, one from a 1984 law and another under a global \n     trade agreement provision that takes effect today.\n       The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade extends patent \n     protection to 20 years from the date drug makers file for a \n     patent. Until now, those patents have had a 17-year life from \n     the time they were granted. Current patent holders will get \n     whichever expiration date is later.\n       A 1984 law has already offered brand-name drugs up to an \n     extra five years' patent life to help offset the time it \n     takes those medicines to get Food and Drug Administration \n     approval for sale.\n       Makers of brand-name drugs said they were entitled to both \n     extensions, and in March the patent office tentatively \n     agreed. The proposal theoretically could have given some \n     drugs patent protection for a total of 25 years, although the \n     Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Assn. insisted that \n     was highly unlikely.\n       But the patent office reversed itself Wednesday, ruling \n     that companies that took the 1984 extension can't also get \n     one from GATT. The ruling affects 94 brand-name drugs and \n     means that the longest a medicine will be able to monopolize \n     the market because of the extension is slightly under 22 \n     years.\n       ``American consumers should get a price break on many drugs \n     as a result of the patent office's reversal'' because it \n     opens the market to quicker generic competition, said Sen. \n     David Pryor (D-Ark.).\n       The brand-name industry was disappointed by the ruling.\n       ``Their March tentative ruling was the correct one from a \n     legal standpoint,'' said Neil Mulcahy, an attorney for the \n     pharmaceutical association.\n       Another 15 drugs, including the billion-dollar ulcer drug, \n     Zantac, will get the GATT extension.\n       But Pryor renewed his pledge to fight those drugs' market \n     exclusivity. GATT had included a provision saying cheaper \n     generic versions of these drugs could proceed to the market \n     on the brand name's original expiration date if they paid the \n     competitor compensation. But the FDA last month said prior \n     law invalidated that provision, meaning GATT will postpone \n     generic competition for these 15 drugs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Generic Drug Equity Coalition,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1995.\n     Hon.

It also includes transition rules for generic \n     products that were ready to go to market based on the old 17-\n     year patent term. When Congress approved the treaty, however, \n     it failed to change U.S. law to allow the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to certify generic drugs for marketing \n     during the transition period.\n       Correcting this oversight will save American consumers \n     almost $2 billion, including $150 million for Medicaid.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     James Firman, Ed.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Citizen Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers \n           Union,\n                                               September 26, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, 219 Senate Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: We urge you to include provisions in the \n     budget reconciliation bill that would close the current \n     loophole in FDA law that is delaying American consumers' \n     access to low-cost generic drugs. The Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has estimated that by closing this loophole, you \n     would save the Medicaid system $150 million over the next \n     five years, while consumers would save up to $2 billion.\n       The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), passed \n     by Congress in 1994, requires the United States to switch \n     from its present system of 17-year patents to 20-year \n     patents. Congress tried to balance the detrimental impact of \n     this provision on competitors by including a clause \n     permitting companies to introduce competing products at the \n     17-year patent expiration point if the company made \n     significant prior investments and if it paid a royalty to the \n     patent holder. When asked to interpret this clause in the \n     light of the 1984 generic drug law, the FDA found that a \n     loophole exists in the GATT that precludes the agency from \n     certifying generic versions of drugs for marketing until the \n     GATT-extended patents expire.\n       The extension of patents from 17 to 20 years to currently \n     marketed prescription drugs delays the introduction of low-\n     cost generic drugs into the marketplace. Generic drugs \n     typically enter the market at a much lower cost than the \n     patented brand, and the brand-name drugs which would benefit \n     from this extended patent are among the top-selling drugs \n     used. The result of the FDA's ruling could potentially cost \n     American consumers billions of dollars. The detrimental \n     effects of this patent extension go beyond the individual \n     health care consumer. Taxpayers will be forced to absorb the \n     additional costs for more expensive drugs under the Medicaid \n     program.\n       The FDA's interpretation of the GATT transition rules does \n     not appear to reflect the intent of Congress when it approved \n     the GATT, nor does it reflect the views of Ambassador Michael \n     Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative who negotiated the \n     agreement. Mr. Kantor recently wrote to Congress that the \n     transition rule was ``intended by its drafters to be \n     generally applicable and to permit generic pharmaceutical \n     producers to market their products where they had made \n     substantial investments in anticipation of the expiration \n     of the unextended patent terms.'' The unintended effects \n     of the patent extension include diminished market \n     competition, an undeserved windfall to pre-GATT patent \n     holders, and further inflated costs to millions of \n     Americans.\n       At a time of federal, state and local budget-cutting, \n     health care savings are more important than ever for American \n     consumers. Therefore, we strongly urge you to use the budget \n     reconciliation process to redress this unintended, and \n     potentially costly, effect of the GATT.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mern Horan,\n                                   Consumer Federation of America.\n     Gene Kimmelman,\n                                                  Consumers Union.\n     Cathy Hurwit,\n     Citizen Action.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              The National Council\n\n\n                                           on the Aging, Inc.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1995.\n     Hon.

This language will \n     be introduced by Senator Chafee.\n       The GATT treaty extends patents on U.S. products from 17 to \n     20 years. It also includes transition rules for generic \n     products that were ready to go to market based on the old 17-\n     year patent term. When Congress approved the treaty, however, \n     it failed to change U.S. law to allow the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to certify generic drugs for marketing \n     during the transition period.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has determined that this \n     correction will result in $150 million in Medicaid savings \n     over five years. The correction will save American consumers \n     almost $2 billion.\n       Lowering the cost of prescription drugs is particularly \n     important for older consumers. Older Americans spend more \n     than any other group on prescriptions. Over one third of the \n     $64 billion spent on prescription drugs come from seniors. \n     This correction will result in over $500 million in savings \n     to older Americans.\n       We strongly urge you to support the Chafee language in the \n     reconciliation bill allowing consumers faster access to many \n     generic drugs and creating savings for the U.S. budget and \n     for older Americans.

The NWHN is the only national public interest \n     membership organization devoted solely to women and health.\n       The availability of low-cost generic drugs saves American \n     consumers billions of dollars every year. Under a recent \n     ruling by the FDA, the patent terms of over a dozen brand \n     name drugs will be extended, costing consumers and taxpayers \n     billions of dollars over the next few years. With the costs \n     of health care continuing to skyrocket while the numbers of \n     uninsured keep going up, consumers cannot afford to pay \n     unnecessarily high prices for medicine. Closing this loophole \n     will save the Medicaid system $150 million over the next five \n     years while it saves consumers close to $2 billion.\n       Women live longer than men, use more health care services \n     than men, and pay more for drugs out of their pockets than do \n     men. If important generic drugs are delayed, women will \n     suffer most.\n\n[[Page S 15431]]\n\n       The generic drug loophole gives pharmaceutical companies a \n     windfall and hurts American health care consumers. This could \n     not have been what Congress intended when it passed the GATT \n     implementing legislation. Congress should fix the law so that \n     drug companies are not given special treatment while \n     consumers are left holding the bag.

William V. Roth, Jr.,\n      Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: The National Black Women's Health \n     Project (NBWHP), a national self-help and health advocacy \n     organization, would urge you to include a provision in the \n     budget reconciliation bill to close the generic drug loophole \n     in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). By \n     closing this loophole, you would help to insure that low-\n     income women and their families have access to safe, \n     affordable prescription and over-the-counter medication.\n       GATT extends patent terms for U.S. products from 17 years \n     to a worldwide term of 20 years. Because many manufacturers \n     had already invested millions of dollars in competing \n     products in anticipation of patent expiration under the \n     original 17-year limit, Congress adopted rules that allow \n     those companies to introduce generic alternatives on the date \n     a 17-year patent would expire, provided they pay reasonable \n     royalties to the patent holder.\n       Through an error of omission, though, the pharmaceutical \n     industry wasn't included in these transition rules. As a \n     result, makers of lower-cost generic drugs are prohibited \n     from bringing their result to the market until the full 20-\n     year term of patent protection incorporated in the GATT \n     treaty is expired. This loophole will extend the patent terms \n     on more than a dozen drugs--including big-sellers Zantac and \n     Capoten--with a combined $5 billion share of the market.\n       As an organization dedicated to ensuring the health needs \n     of low-income women, who are disproportionately Black, we \n     believe that access to low-cost generic drugs is crucial. \n     Low-income women and children are more likely to be uninsured \n     and therefore the least likely to afford the high costs of \n     brand name drugs. In addition, low-income families often have \n     limited resources and are forced to delay treatment because \n     of high drug costs. Increasing access to generic drugs will \n     help to improve the quality of health care received by many \n     low-income families.\n       By closing the generic drug loophole, health care consumers \n     would save approximately $2 billion. Congress would save $150 \n     million in Medicaid costs over the next five years. We urge \n     you to vote in favor of consumers by removing the loophole \n     afforded the pharmaceutical industry in the budget \n     reconciliation bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kim Youngblood.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: The National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare urges you to support language to \n     correct an oversight in the GATT Treaty implementing \n     legislation that affects the availability of generic drugs. \n     This language will be sponsored by Senators Chafee and Pryor \n     as an amendment to the Medicaid reconciliation legislation \n     this week. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \n     determined that this correction will result in $150 million \n     in Medicaid savings over five years, and some $2 billion in \n     savings to all consumers.\n       The GATT treaty extends patents on U.S. products from 17 to \n     20 years. It also includes transition rules for generic \n     products that were ready to go to market based on the old 17-\n     year patent term. When Congress approved the treaty, however, \n     it failed to change U.S. law to allow the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) to certify generic drugs for marketing \n     during the transition period.\n       In addition to savings for consumers of all ages, lowering \n     the cost of prescription drugs is particularly important for \n     older Americans. Older persons consume about one-third of the \n     $64 billion spent on prescription drugs in the United States.\n       On behalf of the nearly six million members and supporters \n     of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare, we urge you to support the Chafee/Pryor amendment \n     to the reconciliation bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A.

William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: Public Citizen, a national consumer \n     advocacy organization with over 120,000 members, urges you to \n     support efforts to fix the generic drug loophole in the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with an amendment to \n     the budget reconciliation bill. This amendment will save the \n     Medicaid system $150 million over the next five years. \n     Consumers will save as much as $2 billion.\n       For nearly 25 years, Public Citizen and its Health Research \n     Group have been at the forefront of efforts to ensure that \n     safe, effective and affordable drugs are available to \n     American consumers. We were part of the citizens' coalition \n     that supported the Waxman-Hatch Act of 1984 to help consumers \n     save billions of dollars by making more low-cost generic \n     drugs available to the public.\n       Because of the recently-enacted GATT, which calls for \n     longer durations for monopoly drug patents worldwide, \n     consumers will be forced to pay billions of dollars more \n     instead of less. We urge Congress to restore the law to its \n     original intent so that drug firms do not receive a windfall \n     at the expense of health care consumers.\n       In this time of massive government budget-cutting and \n     soaring medical costs, health care savings are critically \n     important to the American public. The availability of low-\n     cost generic drugs is one way the marketplace can help bring \n     down the high cost of health care. By extending the duration \n     of monopoly patents on more than a dozen drugs, the GATT will \n     add billions of dollars to consumers' medical costs at a time \n     when they can least afford it.\n       We urge you to support efforts to protect consumers' health \n     and taxpayers' pocketbooks by fixing the generic drug \n     loophole in the budget reconciliation bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Michael Calabrese,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Congress Watch.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Public Interest Research Group, National Association \n           of State PIRGs,\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1995.\n     Hon.

U.S. PIRG is the \n     national lobbying office for state Public Interest Research \n     Groups. PIRGs are non-profit, nonpartisan consumer and \n     environmental advocacy groups with members around the \n     country.\n       Because of a loophole in the GATT that is being eagerly \n     exploited by profiteering drug companies, American consumers \n     face unnecessary higher costs for prescription drugs at the \n     same time as overall health care costs are skyrocketing. \n     Hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and billions of \n     consumer dollars are at stake in this critical fight; the \n     health of millions of Americans absolutely depends on \n     affordable access to low-cost generic drugs.\n       I urge you to restore the original intent of the GATT's \n     implementing language by closing the generic drug loophole in \n     the budget reconciliation bill. Now is the time to stop \n     rapacious drug companies from misusing GATT to gouge the sick \n     and elderly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Edmund Mierzwinski,\n     Consumer Program Director, U.S. PIRG.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            United Seniors Health Cooperative,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1995.\n     Hon.

This language will be \n     introduced by Senator Chafee as part of action on the \n     Medicaid reconciliation bill this week. The Congressional \n     Budget Office has determined that this correction will result \n     in $150 million in Medicaid savings over five years.\n       The GATT treaty extends patents on U.S. products from 17 to \n     20 years.

Older Americans spend more \n     than any other group on prescriptions. Over one third of the \n     $64 billion spent on prescription drugs come from seniors. \n     This correction will result in $2 billion in savings to all \n     consumers and over $500 million in savings to older \n     Americans.\n       We strongly urge you to support the Chafee language in the \n     reconciliation bill allowing consumers faster access to many \n     generic drugs and creating savings for the U.S. budget and \n     for older Americans.

The savings can be realized if a prior \n     oversight by Congress is corrected. The oversight by Congress \n     occurred when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     (GATT) implementing legislation was adopted,\n       GATT extends U.S. patents from 17 to 20 years. It also \n     includes ``grandfather'' rules for generic products, \n     including drugs, that were ready to go to market based on \n     pre-GATT patent expiration dates. Congress, however, failed \n     to change the law to allow the Food and Drug Administration \n     to apply to grandfather rules to generic drugs.\n       As a result, consumers will spend almost $2 billion more \n     for a dozen popular medications, such as Capoten and Zantac, \n     for which 63 million prescriptions were written in 1994.\n       Senators Chafee and Pryor will offer an amendment to the \n     reconciliation bill to close the GATT loophole.\n       Congress can save consumers almost $2 billion, including \n     $150 million in Medicaid savings (according to the CBO), by \n     allowing the FDA to apply the grandfather rules to generic \n     drugs.\n       Such a change would, according to U.S. Trade Representative \n     Mickey Kantor, be wholly consistent with the intent of the \n     drafters of the GATT Treaty.\n       The United Homeowners Association urges you to support the \n     Chafee/Pryor amendment to the reconciliation bill.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jordan Clark,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Coalition for\n\n\n                                            Homeless Veterans,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1995.\n     Hon. William Roth,\n     Senate Finance Committee, Senate Dirksen Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: On behalf of the more than 200 \n     community-based non-profit programs around the country who \n     provide services for homeless veterans, I am writing to urge \n     you to support the Chafee generic drug amendment to the \n     Medicaid reconciliation bill. The amendment will correct an \n     oversight in the GATT treaty implementing legislation thereby \n     saving consumers $2 billion, including $21 million in direct \n     savings for the Department of Veterans Affairs which could be \n     better used to provide support for local programs who assist \n     needy veterans--instead of being spent on high cost \n     pharmaceuticals.\n       The Food and Drug Administration has determined that it \n     cannot certify generic versions of popular drugs such as \n     Capoten and Zantac for marketing until the GATT-extended \n     patents expire, thereby delaying the availability of lower \n     priced generics. We do not believe that this is what Congress \n     intended when it approved the GATT treaty in 1994. Specific \n     transition rules were included in GATT implementing \n     legislation to allow generic products to be marketed based on \n     pre-GATT patent expiration dates. Congress, however, \n     inadvertently failed to include conforming amendments to the \n     Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act to allow the FDA to \n     certify the generic drugs for marketing.\n       It is essential to bring generic drugs to the marketplace \n     as soon as possible to meet the medical needs of veterans and \n     to help the Veterans Health Administration save money. \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown estimates that \n     failure to pass this amendment could cost the VA's health \n     budget a significant amount of money. In these times of \n     continuing budget cuts, it is vital that the VA be able to \n     target its limited resources where the need is the greatest.\n       We urge you to support the Chaffee amendment which will \n     allow the FDA to use pre-GATT patent expiration dates to \n     determine when generic drugs can be certified for marketing \n     and made available to the Department of Veterans Affairs in a \n     manner consistent with the GATT transition rules.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard Fitzpatrick,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                Paraquad Inc.,\n\n                                St. Louis, MO, September 22, 1995.\n     Memo to: Members of the Senate Finance Committee.\n     Re: Medicaid Bill.\n       I write on behalf of members of the Paraquad community--\n     many of whom are users of prescription medication--to urge \n     you to support the Chafee amendment.\n       Senator Chafee is proposing a change to U.S. drug \n     legislation that would accelerate the development of generic \n     drugs that now are kept off the market by the GATT agreement.\n       We believe Congress never intended for the GATT to block \n     generic drugs from being made available quickly to American \n     consumers.\n       Accordingly, the Chafee amendment merely restores the \n     original intent of Congress.\n       For example, a generic substitute for the popular anti-\n     ulcer drug ``Zantac'' won't be available to American \n     consumers until July 1997--despite the fact that it \n     originally was to be available in December of this year.\n       Senator Chafee is asking the Finance Committee to make the \n     necessary change as part of the pending Medicaid savings \n     bill. That is because the American taxpayer will have to pay \n     an additional $150 million for Zantac and other drugs for \n     Medicaid recipients that would be required if the generic \n     substitutes were available.\n       Many members of the Paraquad community are persons of \n     limited income. Many depend on Medicaid. With cost pressures \n     rising, we join with responsible elected officials like \n     Senator Chafee in urging that where cost savings may be \n     realized at no less of quality, the should be.\n       Please vote ``Yea'' for the Chafee amendment.\n       Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Max Starkloff,\n     President, Paraquad Inc.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Project on Technology,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1995.\n     Hon. William Roth,\n     Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: I am writing to express the Consumer \n     Project on Technology's support for the Chafee generic drug \n     amendment to the Medicaid reconciliation bill. This amendment \n     seeks to correct an error by the previous Congress, which \n     extended the patent terms for several widely used drugs. As \n     you know, investment incentives are forward looking, and \n     actions which award post hoc monopolies on pharmaceutical \n     drugs which are already on the market are economically \n     inefficient. This retroactive extension of monopoly marketing \n     rights is costing American consumers billions of dollars, and \n     should be immediately corrected.\n       The U.S. Congress and the Clinton Administration have \n     already given the pharmaceutical industry extremely favorable \n     treatment in a wide range of areas, such as the complete lack \n     of price controls on drugs, favorable tax treatment, billions \n     of dollars in direct research subsidies from the National \n     Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies, and \n     the recent decision by NIH to abandon the reasonable pricing \n     clause for drugs invented by government scientists. We hope \n     that on this issue Congress will demonstrate concern for the \n     problems faced by consumers in obtaining health care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James P.

Mr. President, I was interested in the comments by the \nSenator from Arkansas. He is correct about this and so many other \nthings. It is interesting to me that there are so many special deals \ngoing on these days for special interests, especially in the \nreconciliation bill and, also, in some of these recent appropriations \nbills.\n  It makes me think of going into a shopping center. There you see the \nsign that says, ``Food Court.'' You look around at the food court, and \nthe entire thing is full of all these little places where you get food. \nWell, we \n\n[[Page S 15433]]\n\nought to mark off a little place somewhere here in the Capitol and call \nit the Favor Court, special interests looking for favors line up here. \nAnd by the way, it does not matter how long the line is, you are going \nto be sure to get them in with this new majority because they happen to \nagree with virtually all the things special interests want.\n  This is the Baskin-Robbins of special interest. Do not try one, try \nall the flavors. This reconciliation bill and the appropriations bills \nthat come to the floor of the Senate now are loaded, loaded with \nspecial deals. Do you think it is special deals for mom and pop? No. \nNo, it is not special deals for mom and pop or mom and pop businesses. \nIt is special deals for the biggest special interests, the most \npowerful special interests, and the wealthiest special interests in \nthis country. And that is a fact.\n  I want to talk a little today about the reconciliation bill and the \nplan, where we are headed, where we are going. Last week I read to some \ncolleagues on the floor of the Senate a letter of October 18 from the \nCongressional Budget Office, from the Director of the CBO, June \nO'Neill, who wrote to Senator Domenici. They proudly brought it to the \nfloor of the Senate and proudly held it up and trumpeted this letter \nsaying, ``This letter from the Director of CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office, shows that our reconciliation bill will now result in a \nsmall budget surplus in the year 2002.'' That was on October 18. And \nboy, you know, you almost saw them busting their buttons on their \ndouble-breasted blazers here on the floor of the Senate. ``We have \nproduced something that will produce a small surplus.'' October 18.\n  Now, the next day, October 19, I actually wrote to the CBO and said, \n``Well, I saw that letter you sent over here. I am wondering if you \ncomputed this the way the law requires you to compute it, in other \nwords, if you do not misuse or loot the Social Security trust funds for \nthe operating budget revenue, then what would you have in the year \n2002?'' Same person, same agency, different letter, one day later says, \n``Excluding an estimated off-budget surplus of $108 billion''--and what \nthat means in English is that if you do not use essentially the Social \nSecurity trust fund surplus and a couple others--CBO would project an \n``on-budget deficit of $98 billion in 2002.''\n  Let me say that again. The next day the agency said, if you do not \ncount the Social Security trust fund, then you have $98 billion deficit \nin the year 2002. Same person, different letter.\n  Now, the next day, the day after, October 20, a third letter. The \nsame agency said they made a mistake in the second letter. They now say \nthat the estimated off-budget surplus of $115 billion, from the \ncalculation, would result in an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in \n2002.\n  So here is what we have: Three days, three letters, three different \nestimates. Presumably the last is the right one, saying that if you \nmisuse the Social Security trust funds in the first letter, you \nactually get a budget surplus, but if you do not loot the Social \nSecurity trust funds you have a $105 billion budget deficit in the year \n2002.\n  So the next time someone comes to the floor and says, ``Boy, haven't \nwe done a good job? We have been patting ourselves so hard on the back \nwe have a wrenched elbow here,'' just ask about the letter of October \n20. Do you have more than a wrenched elbow? Do you have a $105 billion \ndeficit in the year 2002? The answer is clearly yes.\n  Now, the reconciliation bill will come to the floor of the Senate, \nand I intend to offer a couple of amendments. I would like to discuss \njust briefly what those amendments are.\n  We have not had the opportunity to address tax legislation on the \nfloor of the Senate this year except in this reconciliation bill, and \nthen only for the members of the Finance Committee, apparently, \nbecause, you know, the rules prohibit certain amendments--so I am going \nto offer an amendment on the issue of so-called runaway plants or the \ntax break we now give to companies that move their plants overseas.\n  I want all Members of the Senate to express themselves on it. Should \nwe close the tax break or should we not? If you have a company in this \ncountry and you decide on Wednesday, let's shut the doors, let's close \nthis company up in the United States and move it overseas to a tax \nhaven country, make the same product hiring foreign workers and ship \nthe product back to the United States, we save money, guess what? We'll \ngive you a special deal if you do that, if you close your company in \nthe United States and move it overseas, make the same product and ship \nit back here. We'll give you a tax break. We'll give you a special tax \nbreak.\n  I think we ought to take that tax break out of the Internal Revenue \nService Code and be done with it. And I am going to give every Member \nof this Senate the chance to decide, do they want to end the tax break \nfor people who move their plants outside this country to use foreign \nlabor to ship it back in? I hope Members will think it is not good for \nthis country.\n  Second. There are two amendments I will offer on capital gains. I say \nto the Senator from Arkansas, the capital gains issue is an issue that \nis very controversial, and I recognize that. Sometimes inflation plays \non the value of an asset such that you are now paying, not so much for \nthe increased value of the asset, you are paying taxes on the increase \nbuilt up. I understand that. I would like to do something to deal with \nit.\n  But I am not interested in doing something that substantially \nimproves the well-being of people who already have millions of dollars \nat this point. They have done very well. They have done better than \nalmost all other Americans recently.\n  Take the last 10 years. The rich have gotten much richer. That is \nfine. I am just saying we do not need to give them a big tax cut now.\n  Capital gains, shall we do something on capital gains? Yes, I think \nfor small business owners, family farmers, people who invest in stocks \nand buy something for kids to go to college in assets and sell it. \nShould we do something on capital gains? Yes. The capital gains \nproposal in the bill contains a 50-percent exclusion benefit. That is \nin the bill coming to the Senate floor. That is not surprising. They \nalways provide big benefits to the biggest interests.\n  So, I will have two alternative proposals. One is, no capital gains \ntax, no tax at all, zero, no 50 percent exclusion, a zero tax rate on \n$250,000 of capital gains income on assets you have held for 10 years \nduring a taxpayer's lifetime, during your lifetime; if you have held \nthe assets for 10 years, $250,000 in capital gains, you can pass those \nthrough with zero tax rate, provided you held it for 10 years. That is \na much better capital gains tax proposal for most Americans than the \none that will come to the floor. It is twice as generous. But it does \nnot give away the farm to the wealthiest Americans.\n  Second, if you do not like that, then take the capital gains proposal \nthat is in the bill and say, ``All right, let's do that, 50 percent \nexclusion, but let's limit it to $1 million of capital gains income \nduring a taxpayer's lifetime.'' Is $1 million not enough? Would that \nnot be sufficient, $1 million of income in capital gains during your \nlifetime at a preferential tax rate of 50 percent?\n  Or are you saying, ``No, that's not enough. I stand here representing \nthe interests of the little millionaires or the little billionaires'' \nthese days. We have billionaires in this country, which is fine, too. \nMuch of that is a sign of success, but we do not have to, at a time \nwhen we are up to our neck in debt, decide to give very significant tax \ncuts to people whose incomes yearly in capital gains is in the \nmillions, tens of million and hundreds of million.\n  The question is going to be, no capital gains at all, no tax on \ncapital gains up to $250,000 during your lifetime, or limit the \ntaxpayers to $1 million of capital gains at the preferential rate \nduring their lifetime?\n  Those are three of the amendments that I intend to offer on this \nlegislation. I hope that my colleagues will listen and evaluate and \ncome to a judgment that makes some sense. I think all of these make \ngreat sense.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the Senator from North Dakota will yield just for a \nmoment, I want to compliment him for his statement. I sat through 2 \ndays last week of pretty excruciating--and I see my colleague, Senator \nConrad of North Dakota, here now. We joined in that effort of seeing if \nwe could not return some degree of fairness to the proposal \n\n[[Page S 15434]]\nas sent from the Finance Committee that would be embodied in \nreconciliation.\n  I have another idea that I proposed and it failed on a party-line \nsplit. I think that the small business owner, the self-employed, should \nhave a greater deduction in trying to buy insurance for himself and his \nemployees.\n  Simply put, our colleagues on the other side are now trying to bring \ncapital gains for corporations, the biggest corporations in America, \nfrom 35 percent down to 28 percent. My amendment was simple. I said, \n``If you want to give a capital gains tax to corporations, let's go not \nfrom 35 to 28 percent, let's go from 35 to 32 percent, still give them \na little break but list also in that, not a 30-percent deduction for \nhealth insurance premium, but a 50-percent deduction.''\n  I would like to do 100 percent, and I think we should do 100 percent, \nbut the dollars are not there. We could, by shaving this little benefit \noff the major corporations, give 10 million self-employed individuals a \n50-percent tax deduction when they pay for insurance for themselves and \ntheir employees.\n  I think it would be one of the best things that we could do. I think \nwe would find a lot of people agree that it makes sense and certainly \nit represents fairness.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I certainly support that. I think it makes a lot of \nsense. They ought to have 100 percent deduction on health insurance \ncosts. I know the Senator has been working on that. So have I and \nothers. It makes a lot of sense.\n  I would like to summarize a couple of points, because the Senator \nfrom New Mexico wants to speak and the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, does as well.\n  I want to make a couple of points about the reconciliation bill more \ngenerally. I listened with interest for an hour this morning to people \nwho came to the floor and said what this is about is demagoguery. \nAnyone who comes to the floor and disagrees with them somehow is trying \nto scare somebody.\n  Well, this is not about demagoguery, it is about choices. We can, \nshould and will balance the budget. The question is how do you balance \nthe budget? What choices do you make to balance the budget? I will show \nyou the choices this Congress is making. Not pretty choices, in my \njudgment, but they are making the choices nonetheless.\n  They are saying we cannot afford Head Start; 50,000 kids in Head \nStart, all of whom have a name, will be kicked out of the program. All \nof them have a name and all of them in their hearts hope they get a \nchance, a better start in life because they come from a home of low \nincome or troubled circumstances. Fifty thousand kids, we cannot afford \nthem. B-2 bombers, we can afford that, 20 more for $35 billion.\n  Five hundred million dollars for displaced workers at a time we are \nsaying to displaced workers, ``Get a job.'' What about the training? We \ncannot afford that, but we can afford the star wars program.\n  Let us go down to veterans' health care, $989 million cut. Congress \nhad to make a decision about two amphibious ships, which to buy, which \nto build, one $900 million, the other $1.3 billion. Do you know what \nthe Congress said? Build them both, the sky's the limit. Let us stuff \nboth pockets with money. So we can afford the two amphibious assault \nships the Pentagon did not order, but we have a little trouble with \nveterans' health care.\n  Low-income home energy assistance, we cannot afford that, but more \nmoney for fighters the Defense Department did not order.\n  I do not have blimps on here, but they did give $60 million for \nblimps. Low-income home energy, that is a fancy way of saying that this \nis providing some heat for a house on a cold winter night in North \nDakota, some low-income person who needs a little help to get some heat \nin their house, that is what this is about.\n  These are choices. The other side says this is all scare tactics. It \nis not scare tactics, it is about the choices we have made.\n  Let me tell you about another choice. This is a Wall Street Journal \npiece yesterday: ``Tax Analysis Now Shows GOP Package Would Mean \nIncrease for Half the Payers.''\n  Which half? Can anybody guess, with a Republican-controlled Congress, \nwhich half of the American taxpayers will be paying more in taxes?\n  There are only two choices, but can anyone guess which half the \nmajority party would choose to ask to pay more? That is right, the \nbottom half. Why would that be the case? Because they need to find ways \nto finance a self-help program for the top half. Actually not the top \nhalf, really the top 5, 6, 7 percent.\n  These are choices. This is not demagoguery. It is choice, and all \nchoices come down to an impact on people.\n  I want to read to you a couple of letters. These happen to come from \nsome young Indian children who I talked with the other day. I visited \nthese children. They are at a boarding school. They come from \ndysfunctional backgrounds, backgrounds of significant poverty and \ntrouble. I want to read to you what some of these kids say, because \nthey are the victims of bad choices.\n  Here is a 14-year-old. They were asked, ``If I had one wish for my \nfamily'': ``I wish my grandmother would be alive so I don't have to \nlive in a foster home anymore.''\n  Wishing for a grandmother.\n  A 13-year-old: ``If I had one wish for my family, I wish we were all \na family again.''\n  ``If I had one wish for my family,'' this 12-year-old says, ``for my \nmother and brother to be happy together. He lives in Oregon someplace \nand I haven't seen my father since birth.''\n  A 14-year-old says, ``My wish for my family would be for my mother \nand my father and for my brother and sisters to be together on \nChristmas Day.''\n  And a 13-year-old says, ``My wish is for my real father to quit \ndrinking and my grandmother, too.'' Think about what people wish for--\namphibious ships, bombers, star wars--and then a 13-year-old wishes \nthat her mother, brother, father, and sister could be together on \nChristmas Day. That is something most of us take for granted.\n\n  A lot of people in this country live in a fair amount of poverty and \ntrouble. We ought not turn our backs on them. We ought to make the \nright choices for them.\n  Last week, I told of a woman who met me at the Minot Airport about a \nweek or two ago. She asked to speak to me and took me to one side. She \nwas in her late seventies. Her chin began to quiver and her eyes teared \nup as she spoke in a low voice, because others were around, and she \nsaid her husband has been in a nursing home for 3 years. They had a \nsmall farm that they lived on for half a century. She sold most of the \nfarm to pay for the nursing home care. She wants to continue to try to \nlive in the house. This woman is in her late seventies. She had tears \nin her eyes because she is worried she may not be able to stay in her \nhome because her husband is in a nursing home.\n  These are real problems faced by people who are not the caricature of \nwhat we hear about welfare. Sometimes the debate rises above the \ncaricature, but sometimes not. The caricature is some slothful \nindolent, overweight, lazy, shiftless, no-good bum sitting in a La-Z-\nBoy, legs up, watching a 32-inch television, watching Oprah and Montel, \ndrinking two quarts of beer and munching on nachos, refusing to go to \nwork.\n  Well, here is welfare, really: Two-thirds of welfare recipients are \nchildren under 16 years of age.\n  Do you know where the need is in this country? It is 75-year-olds or \n80-year-olds who are no longer working and who wonder whether they are \ngoing to have enough money to keep their home or pay the nursing home \nfor their spouse. That is where the low-income problems are in this \ncountry.\n  These choices that are made time after time in this Chamber by the \nmajority party, regrettably, have been choices that say to those \npeople: We are sorry. What you have is something we call ``tough \nluck.'' The majority's response to that is ``tough luck.''\n  But to the other bigger interests, the response has always been to \ntry to see if we can give you benefits. Do you want a capital gains tax \ncut, 75 percent of which goes to people with $100,000 or more income? \nDo you want to build more bombers? How about some F-15's or F-l6's? \nWhat about amphibious ships?\n  Those choices are not the right choices for this country. We can, \nshould, and will balance the budget, \n\n[[Page S 15435]]\nbut we have to make the right choices to do that. I regret to say that \nthis reconciliation bill that comes to the floor of the Senate is \nfilled with special interest deals--the flavor of the month for all of \nthe special interests. Regrettably, it does not make the right choices.\n  I would like to leave you with one question that I think we need to \nanswer during the next hour or so. It is interesting to me that the \nanalysis of the House bill provides that the $270 billion cut in \nMedicare extends the solvency of the Medicare Program for the same \nlength of time that the $89 billion cut in Medicare does. Question: Why \nwould that be the case? Answer: Because at least part of the money is \nused to provide a tax cut. That is a simple answer--the only answer.\n  The Senate does it differently. They cut Medicare $270 billion and \nthen use the money twice in a lockbox, and they do exactly to Medicare \nwhat they do to Social Security--that is, misuse the trust funds so \nthey can use the money twice. Double-entry bookkeeping is one where you \ncan use the money twice. That is for not only restoring solvency of the \nSocial Security trust fund, but for triggering a device that says you \nhave reached a balanced budget and, therefore, you can proceed with a \ntax cut.\n  I will finish with this observation, which is the one I started with. \nI have three letters in my hand, one dated October 18, one dated \nOctober 19, one is October 20, all written by the same person, signed \nby the same person, all addressed to me. In the October 18 letter it \nsays this reconciliation bill reaches a slight budget surplus in the \nyear 2002. The next letter says that if you do not take the Social \nSecurity trust funds, if you are prevented from using Social Security \ntrust funds as revenue for operating budget deficits, then the CBO \nwould project an on-budget deficit of $98 billion in 2002. The next \nday, in the October 20 letter, it said we were wrong about that as \nwell. Actually, the budget deficit in 2002 would be $105 billion.\n  Mr. President, this, I think, describes what is happening with the \nreconciliation bill. I hope that we will have a significant debate in \nthe coming days about these issues. It is not fear mongering. It is not \ntrying to scare anybody. It is talking about priorities. What are the \npriorities for this country? What advances this country's interests? \nWhat moves us ahead? Who should pay and who benefits? Those are \nquestions all of us should ask in the coming days.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15432-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15435-S15436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EDUCATION IS A PRIORITY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the excellent comments by \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I want to speak about one portion of the \npriorities that he discussed there with his chart. I want to talk about \neducation--and education is a priority for this country--and what is \nreflected in the budget that is about to be passed here in the Senate \nand, in the next few weeks, sent to the President.\n  This week, the Senate is getting ready to take up a reconciliation \nbill which contains a $10.8 billion cut in financial support for \nFederal student loans. I share my colleagues' distress that at the \nmoment tuition costs are rising, the Senate is asking to save billions \nof dollars on the system that helps students and their families pay \ntheir tuition.\n  If such a change in the student loan program was the only cut being \nmade in education, obviously, we would be concerned. And if there were \nno other way to balance the Federal budget, we would be concerned and \nperhaps be able to see our way clear. But neither is the case. Cuts in \nstudent loans are, unfortunately, the tip of an education-cutting \niceberg. The debate on the reconciliation bill will be in the spotlight \non these cuts in higher education. The Labor-HHS appropriations bill \ncuts billions more in elementary and secondary education.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned at the magnitude of the cuts. I am \nconcerned at the erosion of the bipartisan commitment that we have had \nto support education here in the Congress. Most of all, I am concerned \nwith the abandonment of a clear vision and a sense of urgency regarding \nthe need to raise the performance of our educational system.\n  The magnitude of these cuts, Mr. President, is enormous. Let me show \na chart here that indicates some of the problems as I see it. This \nchart shows the last 7 years--1996 being the seventh year, so it is the \nlast 6 years, I guess, of support for education. It is easy to see from \nthis chart that, in each year, from fiscal year 1990 to fiscal year \n1995, there has been some increase in funds for education voted by the \nCongress. That was, in some years, not as much of an increase as I \nwould have liked and, in some cases, it was not as much of an increase \nas an increase in inflation, but there was some increase. I should make \nclear, this is not a chart that shows increases in growth; this is a \nchart that shows absolute increases and absolute cuts.\n  In 1996, according to the budget resolution which we are about ready \nto have a final vote on, there is a proposal for a $3.7 billion cut in \nthe educational funds. This reverses a bipartisan agreement over the \nlast three administrations that improving education is a top priority \nin this country. That priority has been expressed each year in annual \nincreases in total educational funding that varied from $2.6 billion in \n1991 to $0.6 billion in 1993. Compare this to the House proposal to cut \n$3.7 in fiscal year 1996. We are making a very dramatic reversal in our \npriorities this year for the first time in many years.\n  Twelve years ago, the Reagan administration appointed a blue ribbon \ngroup called the National Commission on Excellence in Education. In \n1983, they issued a report, which many of us have heard about now for \nover a decade, called ``A Nation At Risk.''\n  That commission concluded in that report in 1983:\n\n       * * * the educational foundations of our society are \n     presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that \n     threatens our very future as a Nation and a people. What was \n     unimaginable a generation ago has begun to occur--others are \n     matching and surpassing our educational attainments.\n       If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on \n     America the mediocre educational performance that exists \n     today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. As it \n     stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves. * * * We \n     have dismantled essential support programs which helped make \n     [prior] gains possible. We have, in effect, been committing \n     an act of unthinking unilateral educational disarmament.\n\n  That report ``A Nation at Risk,'' called on the public to rally to \ndeal with the situation. It challenges Americans to undertake a long-\nterm effort to achieve excellence in education and the public did \nrespond. States raised their high school graduation requirements. \nToday, States require more years of study in the basic subjects of the \ncurriculum that were recommended by that commission--subjects of \nEnglish and mathematics and science and social studies and computer \nscience.\n  In 1982, the year before the ``A Nation at Risk'' study came out, \nonly 13 percent of all high school students graduated with 4 years of \nEnglish, 3 years of math, 3 years of science, and 3 years of social \nstudies. Those are the amounts recommended in that report.\n  By 1987, that percentage had gone from 13 percent up to 29 percent. \nBy 1990 it was at 40 percent. In 1992 when this administration took \noffice, it was 47 percent.\n  At the same time, student achievement--this is not just the number of \ncourses taken, but this is actual achievement--as measured by the \nNational Assessment of Educational Progress made only modest \nimprovements.\n  These achievements resulted from a broadly based bipartisan effort \ninvolving educators, public policymakers and the public itself focusing \non how to achieve excellence. These efforts received an additional \nboost in 1989 when President Bush invited State Governors to an \neducation summit in Charlottesville. In fact, then-Governor Clinton was \none of those who attended that Charlottesville summit.\n  The purpose of that summit was to focus on a list of specific \nnational education goals for the country. The goals were to be \nmeasurable and to be attainable by the year 2000.\n  The Bush administration developed an America 2000 strategy, lending \nthe authority and the bully pulpit of national leadership to a program \nto focus schools on how to improve performance \n\n[[Page S 15436]]\nand how to achieve better educational results.\n  The business community has embraced these goals and become the most \narticulate spokespersons for this national need to raise education \nstandards. When the Goals 2000 legislation was passed into law in the \nlast Congress it was endorsed by the National Alliance of Business, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, as well as by the National Parent Teacher Association, and a \nlong list of other educational associations.\n  Why has business taken such an interest? Because business leaders are \nacutely aware that modest improvements in student achievement cited \nabove are just not adequate to prepare young people to succeed in the \nwork force. Competition in the global economy would demand higher \nlevels of reading and writing and problem solving than we have ever \nneeded before.\n  Schools need to help graduates meet the real world standards that \nwill be applied when graduates are hired and retained and promoted in \njobs. Business leaders recognize the urgency of the need for schools to \nrealign their academic standards which the higher standards at the \nworkplace will demand of them as graduates.\n  Lou Gerstner, who is the chairman and CEO of IBM Corp., addressed the \nNation's Governors at one point earlier this summer. He pointed out to \nthe Governors that it has been 12 years since ``A Nation at Risk'' was \npublished and U.S. students still finish at or near the bottom on \ninternational tests of math and science.\n  He said the first priority for public education should be ``setting \nabsolutely the highest academic standards and holding all of us \naccountable for results. Now. Immediately. This school year. Now if we \ndon't do that, we won't need any more goals, because we are going \nnowhere. Without standards and accountability, we have nothing.''\n  Now, how does the budget that we are going to vote on this week match \nup to Lou Gerstner's sense of urgency and the need to improve \neducation? He talks about how we have to do it ``now, this school \nyear.''\n  I submit that this budget does not measure up at all. This budget is \nan abdication of our responsibility to deal effectively with this \nproblem. The budget cuts in education are too much and they are in the \nwrong places.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation bill proposes $10.8 billion be \nsaved from student loans in postsecondary education over the next 7 \nyears. The appropriations bill which eventually will have to be passed \nin some form magnifies this very unfortunate trend.\n  In fiscal year 1996, the House appropriations bill cuts overall \nspending for elementary and secondary education in the Department of \nEducation by $5.9 billion--from $32.9 to $27 billion.\n  Cuts are made in Head Start programs, safe and drug-free schools, and \nbilingual education, Indian education, and the list goes on. These are \nthe wrong priorities. Let me show one other chart here, Mr. President, \njust to make the point about priorities.\n  This is a chart that summarizes the various discretionary spending \naccounts in this year's budget proposal. Starting on the left, we have \nagriculture, where there is a slight cut in discretionary spending, \ngoing on across. There are additional cuts in entitlement programs that \nare not reflected on this, but these are the additions and the cuts in \ndiscretionary spending where we get to make a decision every year \nwithout question.\n  When we look at where the largest single area of cut in discretionary \nspending is, it is in education and training. Obviously, the largest \narea of increase is defense, and the only other area of increase is in \ncrime. But the largest single area of cuts in discretionary spending is \nin education and training.\n  Mr. President, these are the wrong priorities. These do not reflect \nthe priorities of the American people.\n  One particular program I want to talk about which concerns me greatly \nin this budget bill is the Goals 2000 Program. In the House \nappropriations bill dealing with education they cut the funding in that \nprogram from $361 million in 1995 to zero dollars in 1996.\n  Yet the purposes for which Goals 2000 makes Federal funds available \nto States and local school districts are exactly the purposes that as a \nNation we most need to pursue.\n  This Goals 2000 Program is a flexible program. It makes block grants \nto States for their own school improvements. Next year, 90 percent of \nthe funds that will be used in that program will go to local districts. \nIn 48 States, these grants are being used as the States decide to use \nthem.\n  In Washington State, for example, for 30 districts in which mentor \nteachers train other teachers. In Kentucky, for homework hotlines and \nother efforts to enhance parental participation. In Massachusetts, for \n14 charter schools. In other States, for other efforts at achieving \nhigh educational standards.\n  This program will not tell States what higher standards have to be. \nThe States decide that for themselves.\n  In my own home State of New Mexico, our State has developed the \neducational plan for student success. Like other States, we use our \nGoals 2000 money to bring together the citizens and the educators and \nthe business leaders to look at existing State policies, compare them \nwith where we want to go. They--this group in New Mexico--will use the \nGoals 2000 funds to pursue strategic planning, to improve student \nlearning and success and New Mexico's own standards of excellence.\n\n  We are not a rich State in New Mexico. Without Goals 2000 funds, New \nMexico's efforts to reach the vision that Louis Gerstner talks about \nwill be significantly slowed down.\n  Worse, without support from Goals 2000 and other important Federal \nprograms, we signal to New Mexico and to other States that Louis \nGerstner's sense of urgency is misplaced. We signal that it is enough, \nin our view, to allow States to progress at whatever pace they would \nlike, without any help from the Federal Government. That simply is not \ntrue.\n  This year, the year 2000, is fast coming on us. How we balance the \nbudget today is going to shape how we enter this new century. The \nbudget needs to reflect our priorities. Improving education needs to be \nhigh on that list of priorities. And while some progress has been made, \nour Nation is still at risk.\n  Presidents Reagan and Bush and Clinton have joined with the public to \nimprove the education offered to the next generation. The budget that \nis going to be on this Senate floor for a vote later this week is a \nretreat from that commitment. We know better. And we owe much better to \nthe next generation.\n  I hope we can find ways to do better before we adjourn this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15435-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15436-S15441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the budget \nreconciliation process that is underway. I think this is most important \nbecause we have been told now that the Budget Committee is only going \nto spend an hour and a half on the debate on the budget reconciliation \npackage that is going to affect every American, that is going to set \nthe spending priorities for this country for the next 7 years, a budget \nreconciliation package that many of us believe, while it moves toward \nbalancing the budget, does not actually balance the budget. And, also, \nit is done in a way that is unfair--fundamentally unfair in terms of \nwho is asked to fight this budget battle.\n  After being deeply involved in the budget reconciliation process, \nboth in the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee and the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, as well, I believe very strongly that while it \nis critically important that we balance the budget and that we do it as \nrapidly as possible, the choices that have been made in the proposal \nthat is before us do it in a way that asks the middle class and working \nfamilies in this country to be in the front lines in the battle to \nbalance the budget but says to the wealthiest among us, ``You are \nushered to the sidelines.''\n  Even worse than that, it says to the wealthiest among us, ``You are \nfirst in line for additional tax preferences, tax loopholes, and tax \nbenefits because we are going to let the rest of America fight this \nfight, not the wealthiest among us. The wealthiest among us, \n\n[[Page S 15437]]\nyou can just stand by. You can be observers. You can be on the \nsidelines. And while you are on the sidelines, we are going to actually \ndirect some of the resources that we are saving from this budget plan \ntoward you.''\n  Mr. President, I do not think that is what the American people have \nin mind in terms of balancing the budget. I think they want this job \ndone. They want the job done fairly. Most of all, they want the job \ndone.\n  Unfortunately, the reconciliation package that is on its way to the \nfloor does not even balance the budget. That is not just my opinion, \nthat is the answer from the Congressional Budget Office in a letter \nthat was sent to Senator Dorgan and myself on October 20, by June \nO'Neill, the Director, in which she says in the last line in the first \nparagraph, ``Excluding an estimated off-budget surplus of $115 billion \nin 2002 from the calculation, CBO would project an on-budget deficit of \n$105 billion in 2002.''\n  What is June O'Neill talking about when she talks about an off-budget \nsurplus of $115 billion in 2002? She is talking about the Social \nSecurity surplus in that year--the Social Security surplus. And the \nonly way you can call this budget that is coming toward the Senate \nfloor balanced is to use every penny of Social Security surpluses, \nevery penny, over the next 7 years.\n  The law does not permit that. If one looks at the Budget Enforcement \nAct--and I have a copy of it right here--on page 745 it says:\n\n     EXCLUSION OF SOCIAL SECURITY FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET\n\n       Section 301(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       The concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the Old Age Survivors and Disability \n     Insurance program established under Title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection, or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.\n\n  That is the law. Mr. President, 98 Senators voted for it; 98 Senators \nsaid we should not count Social Security surpluses in determining \nwhether the budget of the United States is in surplus or deficit.\n  Those Senators were right. They were right to cast that vote. They \nwere right because it is absolutely wrong to count Social Security \nsurpluses toward balancing the budget. That is just fundamental. You do \nnot take trust funds and throw those into the pot to balance an \noperating budget. There is no accountant or accounting firm in America \nthat would tell one of its clients to follow that policy. It is wrong.\n  Some will say, ``But it is the practice we are following now.'' \nAbsolutely, it is what we are doing now. That does not make it right. \nThere are a lot of things being done now that are not right. It is not \nright to balance the budget using the Social Security surpluses. That \nis precisely the point. That is why 98 Senators voted to change it.\n  Mr. President, 98 Senators said we ought not to continue this \npractice, we ought to make a change; we ought not to be raiding Social \nSecurity trust funds; we ought not to be looting in order to make the \ndeficit look smaller.\n  Mr. President, this has a very critical, practical impact, because it \nis true we have been doing it, but the consequences for keeping this \npractice in place are much more severe in the years ahead. Let me \nindicate why. These Social Security surpluses that we are running now \nare about to explode. They are going to explode because we have more \nand more baby-boom generation people paying payroll taxes. We are \npaying those taxes at a higher rate on a larger share of our wages and \nso the surpluses are going to build. They were designed to increase, \nand the reason they are exploding is because we are supposed to be \ngetting ready for the time the baby-boom generation retires.\n  But, instead of doing that, instead of saving these funds or paying \ndown the rest of the debt with these funds--which would be a good \nstrategy, a sound strategy for the future--instead, the Republican plan \nis to loot every penny of Social Security surplus over the next 7 years \nto call their budget balanced.\n  This next chart shows that the conference report on the budget \ndemonstrates this point very clearly. It shows deficits over the years \ncovered by the budget resolution. And while our friends on the \nRepublican side say over and over they have offered a balanced budget, \ntheir own conference report on the budget shows something quite \ndifferent. This shows the deficits for the fiscal years 1996 through \n2002. If they were telling the American people the truth when they say \nthey have balanced the budget in fiscal year 2002, their budget \ndocument would show no deficit. It would show a zero. That would be a \nbalanced budget. But their own budget document does not show a zero.\n  It shows a deficit in fiscal year 2002 of $108.4 billion. Boy, this \nis going to come as a big surprise to a lot of the media who keep \nreporting it is a balanced budget. And it is going to come as an even \nbigger surprise to the American people who have been told every day \nthat they are getting a balanced budget. It is not a balanced budget. \nIt is $108.4 billion in deficit. That is very close, by the way, to the \nnumber that the head of the Congressional Budget Office told us in her \nletter--that the deficit in the year 2002 would be $105 billion.\n  Mr. President, how is this occurring? Well, very simply. This is the \nlooting of the Social Security trust funds from the year 1996 to 2002. \nOne can see the total Social Security surpluses, that are being raided \nor being looted, which are $636 billion. That is what is being thrown \ninto the pot to call this a balanced budget. Do not anybody be misled. \nThis is not a balanced budget. It is not a balanced budget in law. It \nis not a balanced budget in fact. Any accounting firm in America would \ntell you do not count the trust fund surpluses. You do not count the \nretirement funds in balancing a budget. That is precisely what is wrong \naround this town.\n  That is why we are in so much trouble now because we keep saying \nthings that are not true. It is not truthful to tell people you are \nbalancing the budget when you are raiding the trust funds because those \nfunds are going to have to be replaced. And the reason we are running \nsurpluses now is to get ready for the time the baby-boom generation \nretires. Why is that so important? Because it is going to double the \nnumber of people eligible for Social Security. We are going to go from \n24 million people eligible for Social Security to 48 million people \neligible for Social Security. That is why we are running surpluses now. \nAnd the thing we ought to be doing is either stockpiling that money or \npaying down the national debt so that we are better prepared to deal \nwith the demographic time bomb represented by the baby-boom generation.\n  I guess the thing that I have found most frustrating about Washington \nin the 9 years I have been in the U.S. Senate is that we say things \nthat confuse people. We use words in a way that are not accurate, that \ndo not really reveal what is actually happening. And to call it a \nbalanced budget when you are taking every penny of Social Security \nsurplus is not accurate. It is not honest. It misleads people.\n  That is not the only problem with the reconciliation plan that is \nheaded for this Senate floor. I think another fatal flaw is that we are \nincreasing the debt under the Republican plan by $1.3 trillion--\nincreasing the debt over the next 7 years under the Republican plan by \n$1.3 trillion. The chart here shows that from 1996 to 2002 the national \ndebt is actually increasing by $1.3 trillion. About half of that is the \nraiding of the Social Security trust funds that I have talked about. \nThat is increasing the national debt. Yet, we are talking about \nproviding a massive tax cut.\n  I think if the American people were aware that the debt of America is \nincreasing by $1.3 trillion over the next 7 years they would not be \nvery interested in a tax cut. I just did a survey of the people in my \nState. Overwhelmingly they have said to me--I have asked them the \nquestion directly--get the budget balanced before any tax cut. Then we \ncan have a tax cut after we get our problems taken care of.\n  We are adding $1.3 trillion to the national debt, and a big chunk of \nthat is a tax reduction. It reminds me a lot of kids eating their \ndessert before dinner. We have played this game before in this town. We \nalways say, ``Gee. We are going to cut spending so we can have a tax \ncut now.''\n  We did that before. Do you remember what happened? The debt exploded \nin \n\n[[Page S 15438]]\nthe 1980's when we played this game with the American people and told \nthem we are going to cut spending. We promised. We really are so we can \nhave a tax cut now. We did that in 1981. What happened? The deficits \nwent from $50 billion a year to $200 billion a year because guess what \nhappened? We took the tax cuts but we never did the spending cuts, or \ncertainly not of the magnitude necessary to keep the deficit from \nexploding. The result is we went from being less than $1 trillion in \ndebt to being $5 trillion in debt in the space of 12 years. This is not \nsmart. This is not responsible fiscal policy.\n  This chart shows the debt increases under the Republican balanced \nbudget plan year by year, the amounts that are contributed by the \nbudget deficits--that is, the spending over what we take in--and the \namounts that come from the tax cuts that are added to the debt. You can \nsee for every year here we are adding money to the debt of the country. \nAnd there are large sums added, $240 billion, $125 billion, $220 \nbillion.\n  You can see the light orange part of each of these bars shows how \nmuch of that is being contributed by a tax cut. I just say to my \ncolleagues, and I say to the American people. This is not wise--to be \nadding to the national debt in order to take a tax cut at this time. It \nespecially is unwise given who benefits and who loses under this \nRepublican tax plan.\n  We have now a series of estimates that were done by the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation--this is a bipartisan group--and an analysis done \nby the U.S. Treasury Department. That shows who benefits, and who loses \nunder the Republican tax plan. It is very interesting.\n  What we find, as this chart shows, is how the Senate GOP tax plan \naffects America's families. Half get hit with a tax increase. It is not \na tax cut. Half the people in this country are going to get a tax \nincrease. That is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the \nU.S. Treasury Department.\n  I ask unanimous consent that each of these charts be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection,

Mr. President, how can it be? We heard all of this talk \nabout a tax cut. Yes; in overall terms, in dollar terms, there is a tax \ncut; about $245 billion. But not everybody gets a tax cut. Half the \npeople in the country are going to get a tax increase. That is what \nthese charts show from the Joint Committee on Taxation and from the \nU.S. Treasury Department. Fifty-one percent of Americans, those earning \nup to $30,000 a year, 44 million American families, are going to get a \ntax increase. On the other side of the ledger, higher income people are \ngoing to get a tax reduction. Forty-nine percent of the American people \nare going to get a tax reduction. But 48 percent of the benefit is \ngoing to go to those earning over $100,000 a year.\n  Let us just see. This is the top 5 percent. What do they get? The top \n5 percent. The 2.8 million families making over $200,000 a year get a \n$3,400 tax break. The top 5 percent get a $3,400 tax break.\n  How about the top 1 percent? Those are the 1.1 million American \nfamilies that earn over $350,000 a year. They get a $5,600 tax break. \nGee. You might wonder. How about my family? How about my family? We are \nearning $25,000 a year, a family of four. Do you know what is going to \nhappen to you? You are going to get a tax increase. How about a family \nof four earning from $30,000 to $50,000 a year? What happens to them? \nThey are going to get a slight tax cut of $249.\n  Compare that to the people getting over $350,000 a year. They are \ngoing to get $5,600--20 times as much, 20 times as much if you are \nearning over $350,000 than if you are earning between $30,000 and \n$50,000. And, of course, the dirty little secret of this tax plan is \nthat Americans earning less than $30,000 a year--51 percent of the \nAmerican people, 44 million American families--are going to have a tax \nincrease. And then you look at the spread among those who are going to \nget a tax reduction, and it is unfair. A family earning between $30,000 \nand $50,000. They get only $250.\n  This small tax cut is going to be completely overwhelmed by the other \neffects of this overall package because those folks are going to find \nthings that help them being cut, and they are going to wind up in a \nnegative. If you look at how spending programs are being reduced and \nhow the tax cuts affect them, you are going to find that people in the \n$30,000 to $50,000 category lose under this plan. The same will be true \nof $50,000 to $75,000. While they get a $565 tax cut, when you take \ninto account the Medicare-Medicaid changes, the college loan changes \nand all the other Government programs that affect them, you find out \ntheir tax cut is going to be completely overwhelmed by the spending \ncuts that affect them.\n  So what you have here is an overall program that is an enormous \ntransfer of wealth program. It transfers wealth from those who are on \nthe low end of the totem pole and the middle of the totem pole to those \nwho are on top. That is what the overall effect of this Republican plan \nis. And you know, that is what has been going on in this country for a \nlong time.\n  This chart shows the share of wealth held by the top 10 percent of \nhouseholds in America. It shows in 1969, the top 1 percent had 20 \npercent of the wealth in this country. By 1979, the top 1 percent held \n30 percent of the wealth in this country. And by 1989, they were up to \n39 percent of the wealth. The top 1 percent, in 1989, held 39 percent \nof the wealth in this country.\n  I just say to my Republican colleagues, they accuse the Democrats of \nbeing for redistributing the wealth of America. Let me just say they \nhave been the champions of redistribution of wealth, but instead of \nredistributing wealth from the wealthy down to those who are middle \nincome and lower income, the Republicans have transferred wealth up to \nthe top 1 percent, from the top 1 percent holding 20 percent of the \nwealth to the top 1 percent now holding 39 percent of the wealth of the \nNation.\n  If anything is clear from history, it is that if wealth is \nconcentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people, that leads to \npolitical instability and that leads to deep trouble in the future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I noticed a comment the Senator made about the fact that \nthis reconciliation proposal will increase taxes for nearly 50 percent \nof the American families. Some say that is not a tax increase. If you \nlimit or scale back the earned income tax credit, that is not a tax \nincrease. And I was noticing that Jack Kemp, noted national Republican \nfigure, former Congressman, former Cabinet official, said last week \nwhen he testified before the Senate Small Business Committee:\n\n       I hope you guys do not go too far on removing the earned-\n     income tax credit because that is a tax increase on low-\n     income workers and the poor which is unconscionable.\n\n  So at least Jack Kemp thinks that when you scale back the earned \nincome tax credit, what you have is a tax increase on low income and \npoor people. Is the Senator saying that the combination of those \nchanges means that 50 percent of the working families in this country \nwill have a tax increase?\n  Mr. CONRAD. These are not my estimates, I might add. These are the \nestimates of the Joint Committee on Taxation, these are the estimates \nof the U.S. Treasury Department, that do, as the Senator from North \nDakota knows, distribution tables. And the distribution tables they \nprovided the Finance Committee show that everybody earning up to \n$30,000 a year is going to get a tax increase. That is 51 percent of \nAmerican families. Of the others who are going to get a tax reduction, \ninterestingly enough, 48 percent of the benefit goes to those earning \nover $100,000 a year.\n  Let me just make one other point on the question the Senator asks \nwith respect to the notion that the earned income tax credit is a \nwelfare program. We heard that in the Finance Committee, that the \nearned income tax credit is really a transfer payment to people, at \nleast in part. It is interesting because President Ronald Reagan said \nthe earned income tax credit is the best profamily, prowork, \nantiwelfare measure ever to come out of Congress. \n\n[[Page S 15440]]\nThat is what Ronald Reagan thought about the earned income tax credit.\n  What these folks want people to believe is that the earned income tax \ncredit only relates to the income tax, because it is true; some of the \nfolks who get the benefit of the earned income tax credit do not have \nan income-tax liability, but guess what. They have a payroll tax \nliability that is huge. In fact, 73 percent of the American people pay \nmore in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes, and the earned \nincome tax credit was devised not only to provide relief on income tax \nbut also on payroll taxes for working families. These are not people on \nwelfare. These are people who are working, working families who get a \nbreak on their taxes, on their payroll taxes and their income taxes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for another question.\n  I am interested in this proposition of the three letters from the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Senator and I jointly wrote a letter \nto the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  It is not a secret; I have said on the floor of the Senate here when \nthe Director of the Congressional Budget Office was appointed, the \nchairman of the House Budget Committee said, ``I want to appoint this \nperson because I think we will get the answers that we want from this \nperson.'' This is a person who believes in the kind of an estimating \nprocess that is going to make them comfortable.\n  So I came to the floor and said I was pretty concerned about that. I \nwant the CBO to be the referee, the one that is wearing the striped \nshirt, that is unbiased at the signal calling, or at least calling the \nissues as they see them.\n  And June O'Neill, the Director of CBO, in scoring this proposal, \nprovided a letter on October 18, and the majority party brought it to \nthe floor and they held it up and they were proud as new parents, \nblushing and showing all of us, gushing with pride, gee, we have now \nreached with this plan of ours a budget surplus in the year 2002. They \ndid not claim that everyone would bear the same burden of lifting in \norder to reach the surplus, but nonetheless we have now reached a \nbudget surplus in the year 2002.\n  Then the Senator and I wrote a letter to the Director of the CBO and \nsaid, well, that would be using the Social Security trust funds as \noperating revenues, would it not? The law will not allow us to do that, \nso will you provide us with a letter telling us what the year 2002 \nwould look like if you cannot do what the law says you cannot do, that \nis, misuse the Social Security trust funds? Then what would the answer \nbe?\n  The next day, October 19, we received a letter. And I noticed nobody \nfrom the other side has come and talked about this letter. But this \nletter says if you are going to count it that way, then in the year \n2002 the budget deficit is $98 billion.\n  Then my understanding is they made a mistake in the computation of \nthis. So the next day we got a third letter. And the third letter says, \nwell, if you are going to count it that way with Social Security, we \nhave made another adjustment and the deficit in the year 2002 is $105 \nbillion.\n  So we went from a small surplus to a $98 billion deficit, now to a \n$105 billion deficit in 2002.\n  I raised the question last week about using the Social Security trust \nfunds, and someone from the other side stood up and huffed and puffed \nand then gave me the answer kind of mumbled, like their mouth was full \nof tobacco or something. I could not quite hear what they said, but I \ngot the gist of it. And the gist of it was that this is income.\n  You know, you do this like a business. You count all your income. I \nam thinking to myself, I wonder what they would say if the business \ncounted as their operating income the pension money? I suspect the \nbusiness man or woman would be somewhere on the road to 2 years of hard \ntennis in some Pennsylvania facility. Right.\n  You cannot do that. It does not work. It is dishonest. You cannot \ntake Social Security trust funds that are dedicated to taxes, only to \nbe used for that purpose, bring them to the operating budget, and say, \n``By the way, we have taken all this money out of the Social Security \ntrust funds. We now have a budget surplus.''\n  And because you cannot do that, cannot do it honestly, we asked the \nCongressional Budget Office Director to tell us, what is the deficit, \nif you are prevented from doing what is dishonest? The answer--$105 \nbillion in 2002.\n  Can the Senator comment on these three letters?\n  Mr. CONRAD. First of all, when we talk about how it is counted, what \nthe Senator and I asked for is, how about if you do it according to \nwhat the law is? The law is very clear. I read the law.\n  The law says you cannot count Social Security surpluses in \ndetermining whether the budget is in surplus or deficit. That is what \nthe law says. Ninety-eight Senators voted for that law. They thought it \nwas a good idea to protect Social Security then. They thought it was a \ngood idea not to count surpluses, Social Security surpluses, in \nestablishing whether the budget is in deficit or surplus then. They \nrecognized when they cast that vote that it is absolutely wrong to take \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses and use those to make the deficit \nlook smaller.\n  Now, obviously I think that is right. And then when we asked the \nquestion of CBO, here is the final answer we got. There were three \nanswers. The first answer, as the Senator noted, said we are going to \nhave a slight surplus. When we said, ``Yeah. But follow the law, obey \nthe law. What happens when you exclude Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses that are off-budget by law?'' Then she came back and said--\nher final answer was, you have a $105 billion deficit in the year 2002, \nif you obey the law and you do not take Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses.\n  Obviously, that is what we must do. That is what the law requires us \nto do. And what is the reason for that? The reason is, no place in \nAmerica would any institution take the retirement funds of its \nemployees, throw those into the pot and say they balanced the budget. \nObviously you have got to run surpluses in your retirement accounts if \nyou are going to have money for when your folks retire. It does not \ntake any rocket science to figure that out.\n  If you spend all of the money, what happens when the folks retire? \nTheir retirement funds are gone. That is what is at the heart of this \nissue.\n  I asked my accountant back in North Dakota, called him up one day, \nand I said, ``Larry, what would you say to a client, business client, \nwho came to you, and said, you know, he was having some rough economic \ntimes, and his company was running in the red. And if this business \nowner figured out a way to balance was to take the retirement funds of \nhis employees and throw those into the pot and call the budget \nbalanced,'' what would his advice be to a client who came to him with \nthat question?\n  My accountant said, ``I would tell him, `You are on your way to \nFederal jail because that is a violation of Federal law.' ''\n  And that is precisely what this Republican budget plan contemplates.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for one additional \nquestion.\n  The reason this is an important issue is either there is a surplus \nwith this plan--despite the fact that you might or might not think this \nplan is well done; you might think the plan takes from the poor and the \nmiddle-income families and gives to the wealthy--that is neither here \nnor there; we will have that debate, and have had that debate--but \neither it produces a surplus or it does not.\n  Some came to the floor of the Senate boasting. They had this new \nletter. They said, ``Look. We did all the heavy lifting, and we have a \nsurplus in 2002.'' The reason they say that is germane is that it \nallows us to proceed with a tax cut. That triggers the ability to do \ntax cuts.\n  Well, if part of the triggering of the tax cuts is to use the Social \nSecurity trust funds, then what you have is a circumstance where, in my \nState, at least two-thirds of the senior citizens are living on $15,000 \na year or less. You are saying to those people, ``Your trust funds in \nSocial Security, we're going to use those to provide a tax break to \nsome Wall Street bankers or some others in this country who don't need \na tax break.''\n  So there is this tremendous transfer going on. That is why this \nquestion is important. And, again, I would say, Director O'Neill is, by \nall accounts, smart, capable. I have no reason to be \n\n[[Page S 15441]]\ncritical of CBO, except we now have three different answers, the last \nof which is apparently correct.\n  And my sense is that it tells us what you and I have been talking \nabout for some long while. The only way this adds up is if you add it \nwrong. It is the only way this adds up. Add it wrong, you get the right \nanswer. Add it right, you get the wrong answer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. This is a fundamental \nquestion. And let me just say those who defend it by saying it is what \nwe have been doing, that is no defense at all. That is just no defense \nat all.\n  What we have been doing is wrong. We have been doing it since 1983. \nFor most of the time it has not made that much difference because the \nSocial Security surpluses have been very small. But now the Social \nSecurity surpluses are growing dramatically. And they are going to \ncontinue to grow dramatically. There is a reason for it. The reason was \nto get ready for the time the baby-boom generation retires. That is why \nCongress acted in the early 1980's to change the Social Security fund, \nto design it to run surpluses. And what have we done? We have raided \nthem. We have looted them. And now we will continue that practice to \nthe tune of $636 billion over the next 7 years and call it a balanced \nbudget. That is a fraud. That is an absolute fraud.\n  There is no one who would consider taking trust funds, throwing those \ninto the pot to balance an operating budget as the correct way to do \nbusiness. It is maybe the Washington way to do business; it is not the \nright way to do business. And we should stop it. We should stop it now.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, we are going to be taking up later on this \nweek what we call in the Senate the reconciliation bill. Some of the \nMembers from the other side have been talking about that bill this \nmorning as it pertains to balancing the Federal budget. I would like to \nspeak to some of the things that Senators addressed this morning, and \nalso to the President's plans for dealing with our budget deficit over \nthe course of the next 7 years.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad were just on the \nfloor, and I think Senator Hollings spoke earlier to this problem of \nthe Federal budget deficit as it pertains to the Social Security \nsurplus. They objected to the fact that the Republican balanced budget \ndid not account for the fact that the Federal Government is spending \nthat Social Security surplus and, therefore, makes it more like we are \nin balance when, in fact, we are spending money that does not really \nbelong to the general Government; it belongs to the Social Security \nsurplus. If you exclude that surplus, then, in fact, they charge that \nwe would be running a deficit of about $100 billion in the year 2002.\n  Of course, it is true, that if the U.S. Government were not spending \nthe Social Security surplus funds, then those funds would not be \nreflected in the budget and, obviously, there would be a deficit beyond \nthat which has been calculated by the CBO.\n  But, Mr. President, the Senators that I just mentioned, the Senators \nfrom North Dakota and the Senator from South Carolina, while they have \nbeen consistent in speaking out in support of segregating those Social \nSecurity trust funds, I note have, with most of the other Members of \nboth Houses of the legislative branch of Government, failed to refrain \nfrom voting for budgets that use those Social Security funds. My point \nis that everybody likes to talk about not spending those Social \nSecurity funds, but the fact is they vote for budgets that use the \nSocial Security funds.\n  In 1993, all three of the Senators aforementioned voted for the \nbudget resolution and, by the way, the reference is rollcall vote 94, \nApril 1, 1993. Senator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, and Senator Hollings--\nall three--voted for the budget resolution that spent every dime of the \nSocial Security surplus and, by its own admission, left a projected \ndeficit of about $200 billion, even taking into account the Social \nSecurity surplus at the end of its 5 year period.\n  They all voted for the 1993 budget reconciliation bill, on August 6, \n1993, that relied on the use of the Social Security surplus. Senator \nDorgan, speaking on behalf of the budget reconciliation bill, said on \nthe floor on August 6:\n\n       The fact is, we are going to decide today whether we do \n     something about this crippling deficit or whether we continue \n     to do nothing.\n\n  And then he voted for the budget resolution that spent every dime of \nthe Social Security surplus. They all voted for the budget resolution \nin 1994, that is May 12, 1994, that spent every dime of the Social \nSecurity surplus and, again, by its own admission, left a projected \ndeficit of about $200 billion, even taking into account the Social \nSecurity surplus at the end of its 5 year period.\n  Excluding the Social Security surplus, the budget resolution in 1994 \nprovided for deficits of $239 billion in 1995, rising to $300 billion \nin 1999. Yet, Senators Dorgan, Conrad, and Hollings all voted for it, \nand I note, by the way, Mr. President, that that compares with our \nbudget which, excluding Social Security, would go from $245 billion in \n1996 to about a $100 billion deficit in the year 2002 and, of course, \nif you do not count Social Security, according to CBO we would be in \nbalance by then with a zero deficit.\n  These three Senators are claiming that the Republican budget is a \nphony budget because it counts Social Security, the same as it has \nalways done. But our budget, as I said, leaves a deficit of zero at the \nend of the 5-year period--zero--and that is certified by the bipartisan \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  If you excluded the surplus, the question is, what would you do with \nit? And I ask the question of those three Senators, because I think it \nis odd, it is strange that they come here today criticizing the \nRepublican budget because it allows the expenditure of those funds \nwhen, in fact, all three of them have supported the same practice over \nand over and over again. So what would they do with those funds?\n  The surplus, of course, is invested in U.S. Government securities. By \ndefinition, it is borrowed by the Treasury. We do not put our money \nunder a mattress any more than anybody else does. So do these three \nSenators all contend that we should borrow the money, pay interest to \nthe trust funds, and then let the money sit idle, not do anything? That \nis a poor use of the funds.\n  Perhaps they would be willing to join us in finding a way to allow \npeople to invest that in the private sector as a way of creating a \nsurplus to Social Security earnings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will conclude by making this point. If we \ncan invest that money in the private sector, it would both return a \nsupplement to the people who are receiving Social Security in the \nfuture and prevent the general Government from expending the funds so \nthat it would truly be used for Social Security purposes.\n  I hope that our colleagues' ultimate purpose is not to support what \nPresident Clinton has suggested, using pension funds for ``economically \ntargeted investments.'' In other words, pension funds would not be \ninvested soundly for the benefit of retirees or, in this case, Social \nSecurity recipients, but used to advance social programs that benefit \nthird parties.\n  I hope that is not what they are talking about. I hope it is more a \npolitical point they are making. Again, Mr. President, I point out that \nwe would all like not to use those funds for general expenditure \npurposes, and we will be talking in the future about how we can assure \nthose funds are used strictly for the benefit of Social Security \nretirees. I believe we should be supporting the Republican budget which \nthe CBO confirms gets us to a zero deficit by the year 2002.\n\n[[Page S 15442]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope my friend from Arizona, if he is \nnot terribly busy, can be with me on the floor for a moment.\n  I have three issues to address. Let me take the first one. I regret \nover the weekend in talking about the President's statement that he \nmade in Houston that he thought he raised the taxes too much and that \nit was because of Congress, in particular I assume his party and our \nparty, the Republican Party, that he raised taxes this much, implying \nthat if somehow or another there would have been more help up here, he \nwould have raised less taxes.\n  Let me make it absolutely clear, the President of the United States \nasked for more taxes than he got. Let me state that again. He sent us a \nbudget and he ultimately got a tax increase and not a single Republican \nvoted for that tax increase. But let me review what the President had \ndone prior to that. He sent a budget to the Congress stating his master \nplan. What was in the master plan in terms of tax increases?\n  I have the number now. It is $360 billion. Remember, he had a Btu tax \nin it, an energy tax. Some of his own Members, such as then Senator \nBoren and others, said that will never fly. The ultimate tax increase \nwas $270 billion. Over the weekend, the numbers were bantered around, \nbut this is the right number. So essentially he asked us, if my \narithmetic is right, for $90 billion more than he got.\n  What does that mean? That means that it was not Congress that forced \nhim to get these big tax increases, it was the President's own plan. So \nwhat really happened was that he was asking for more tax increases than \nhis Democratic supporters ended up giving him.\n  Is that not a shame that he would imply that it was the Democratic \nSenators and Congressmen who forced him to raise taxes so much? I will \nget this together in a memo with all of the number spread and put it \ninto the Record. I trust my staff implicitly, and I now recall the Btu \ntax. So I say to my friend, Senator Kyl from Arizona, over the weekend \nwe heard an incredible change of mind by the President--a flip-flop or \nwhatever you want to call it. The President was up here asking, in \n1993, for $360 billion in tax increases. He gets only $270 billion from \nthe Congress, and he suggests if he would have had more cooperation \nfrom the Congress, he would not have raised taxes so much.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was in the House of Representatives when \nthis was proposed. I remember a lot of my Democratic colleagues who \nwere not happy about supporting a Btu tax. The Senator from New Mexico \nwill recall that the House Members ended up supporting that budget with \nthe request for tax increases, including the Btu tax increase. Of \ncourse, the Senator from Arizona, then a Member of the House, and most \nof the other Republicans voted against the Btu tax increase, but most \nof the Democrats voted for it. I know they were greatly distressed when \nthe Senate then turned it down and, in effect, were critical of the \nPresident for making them walk the plank when there was never really a \nchance that that tax would be imposed at the end of the day.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Mexico that it is unfortunate to \ncast the blame on the Congress, including a lot of good Democrat \nMembers of Congress, who did not want to increase taxes as much as the \nPresident, and certainly the Republican Members of the Congress. The \nPresident, therefore, was pointing the finger in the wrong direction \nwhen he alleged that it was the Congress that made him do it. It is \nlike that old comedian that said, ``The devil made me do it.'' It was \nreally the President himself who offered the tax increase to the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator, in rebuttal of statements by Senators Kent \nConrad and Byron Dorgan, referred to whether we have a balanced budget \nor not. Let me make sure the American people understand. See this nice \ncertificate with the red ribbons? It says, ``certified balanced \nbudget.'' What is that about? What is this? This is the budget for \nfiscal year 1996, the concurrent resolution that was passed and now \nimplemented by the bill we are talking about, called reconciliation.\n  What is this ``certified balanced budget''? The Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, Dr. June O'Neill, who is charged by almost \neveryone that knows anything about our fiscal problems with being in \ncharge of an agency that we ought to believe because they are neutral, \nthey belong to no one, they are funded by us, and they work \nindependently for both the President and the Congress.\n  Why do I know that? Well, I know it because I have been working with \nthem for 20 years. But the President told us that. He told us 2 years \nago in his State of the Union Address, and I paraphrase: If you do not \nwant to be accused of smoke and mirrors and if you want to be \nconservative so you are more apt to come out right, in terms of \nassumptions, let us all agree to use the Congressional Budget Office.\n  That is how important they are. They wrote us an analysis of the \nSenate's reconciliation bill--the one coming up soon--along with the \nbudget resolution. What did they tell us? They said, ``We certify that \nyou have a balanced budget.''\n  How could it be that the Congressional Budget Office is telling \nAmerica the Republicans' 7-year plan gets to balance, and we have the \nSenators coming to the floor saying it is not in balance? It is \ninteresting. If it is not in balance and we ought to do it another way, \nmaybe we ought to hear their plan for cutting even more, which is \napparently the proposal. If you do not want ours, you ought to cut \nmore, so you get the proposal they are advocating.\n  I will tell you why they are doing it. I am not going to say this \nmyself. I am going to read from a column by Charles Krauthammer from \nabout 3 months ago. I will read one paragraph:\n\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I don't mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington and a judgment \n     call anyway. I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare even in Washington and not a \n     judgment call at all.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                  Social Security `Trust Fund' Whopper\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Last week, Sens. Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan managed to \n     (1) kill the balanced budget amendment, (2) deal Republicans \n     their first big defeat since November and (3) make Democrats \n     the heroes of Social Security. A hat trick. How did they do \n     it? By demanding that any balanced budget amendment ``take \n     Social Security off the table''--i.e., not count the current \n     Social Security surplus in calculating the deficit--and thus \n     stop ``looting'' the Social Security trust fund.\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I don't mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington and a judgment \n     call anyway. I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare even in Washington and not a \n     judgment call at all. Consider:\n       In 1994 Smith runs up a credit card bill of $100,000. \n     Worried about his retirement, however, he puts his $25,000 \n     salary into a retirement account.\n       Come Dec. 31, Smith has two choices: (a) He can borrow \n     $75,000 from the bank and ``loot'' his retirement account to \n     pay off the rest--which Conrad-Dorgan say is unconscionable. \n     Or (b) he can borrow the full $100,000 to pay off his credit \n     card bill and keep the $25,000 retirement account \n     sacrosanct--which Conrad-Dorgan say is just swell and \n     maintains a sacred trust and staves off the wolves and would \n     have let them vote for the balanced budget amendment if only \n     those senior-bashing Republicans had just done it their way.\n       But a child can see that courses (a) and (b) are identical. \n     Either way, Smith is net $75,000 in debt. The trust money in \n     (b) is a fiction: It consists of 25,000 additionally borrowed \n     dollars. His retirement is exactly as insecure one way or the \n     other. Either way, if he wants to pay himself a pension when \n     he \n\n[[Page S 15443]]\n     retires, he is going to have to borrow the money.\n       According to Conrad-Dorgan, however, unless he declares his \n     debt to be $100,000 rather than $75,000, he has looted his \n     retirement account. But it matters not a whit what Smith \n     declares his debt to be. It is not his declaration that is \n     looting his retirement. It is his borrowing (and over-\n     spending).\n       Similarly for the federal government. In fiscal 1994, \n     President Clinton crowed that he had reduced the federal \n     deficit to $200 billion. In fact, what Conrad calls the \n     ``operating budget'' was about $250 billion in deficit, but \n     the Treasury counted the year's roughly $50 billion Social \n     Security surplus to make its books read $200 billion. \n     According to Conrad-Dorgan logic, President Clinton \n     ``looted'' the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $50 \n     billion.\n       Did he? Of course not. If Clinton had declared the deficit \n     to be $250 billion and not ``borrowed'' $50 billion Social \n     Security surplus--which is nothing more than the federal \n     government moving money from its left pocket to its right--\n     would that have made an iota of difference to the status of \n     our debt or of Social Security?\n       Whether or not you figure Social Security in calculating \n     the federal deficit is merely an accounting device. \n     Government cannot stash the Social Security surplus in a \n     sock. As long as the federal deficit exceeds the Social \n     Security surplus--that is, for the foreseeable forever--we \n     are increasing our net debt and making it harder to pay out \n     Social Security (and everything else government does) in the \n     future.\n       Why? Because the Social Security trust fund--like Smith's \n     retirement account--is a fiction. The Social Security system \n     is pay-as-you-go. The benefits going to old folks today do \n     not come out of a huge vault stuffed with dollar bills on \n     some South Pacific island. Current retirees get paid from the \n     payroll taxes of current workers.\n       With so many boomers working today, pay-as-you-go produces \n     a cash surplus. That cash does not go into a Pacific island \n     vault either. In a government that runs a deficit, it cannot \n     be saved at all--any more than Smith can really ``save'' his \n     $25,000 when he is running a $100,000 deficit. The surplus \n     necessarily is used to help pay for current government \n     operations.\n       And pay-as-you-go will be true around the year 2015, when \n     we boomers begin to retire. The chances of our Social \n     Security benefits being paid out then will depend on the \n     productivity of the economy at the time, which in turn will \n     depend heavily on the drag on the economy exerted by the net \n     debt that we will have accumulated by then.\n       The best guarantee, in other words, that there will be \n     Social Security benefits available then is to reduce the \n     deficit now. Yet by killing the balanced budget amendment, \n     Conrad-Dorgan destroyed the very mechanism that would force \n     that to happen. The one real effect, therefore, that Conrad-\n     Dorgan will have on Social Security is to jeopardize the \n     government's capacity to keep paying it.\n       Having done that, Conrad-Dorgan are now posing as the \n     saviors of Social Security from Republican looters. A neat \n     trick. A complete fraud.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we all understand that the unified \nbalanced budget is what has been used ever since Arthur Burns was \nchairman of the Federal Reserve Board. It is still used today. It is \nused by the President, it is used by the Federal Reserve Board, it is \nused by the Congressional Budget Office. What it essentially says is, \nif you put everything on budget, including not just the Social Security \ntrust fund, but the myriad trust funds, that is the unified budget. Do \nnot take some off and put some on; put it all on. With it all on, we \nare in balance.\n  I suggest--and it may come as a surprise--that we might even be able \nto show you, before the debate is finished, that in the 10th year we \nmay be balanced--let us take Social Security balances off budget. We \nmay be very close to getting there, under the projections of the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Having said that, let me talk about just two other things. My \ncolleague from New Mexico took to the floor and spoke about education, \nrelating with some specificity to my State and his, New Mexico. Let me \nmake sure that we all understand what we are talking about. Let me try \nmy best to make sure everybody understands about education. First of \nall, we appropriate 1 year at a time. There are no binding caps on \nappropriations for 1997, 1998 or 1999. Congress will do that each year, \nunless and until we set some legislative targets.\n  So let me talk for a minute about where we are in 1996, if everything \nworks out the Republican way. Can we do that? In the year 1992, for the \nlatest official data, total public spending on education programs in \nthe country was $292.2 billion. So on top of that figure, you add \n$100.5 billion for the private education.\n  Get this: The Federal education budget, the U.S. Government helping \nor hindering education--whichever the case may be, but it is money \nspent--we spent, in 1992, $28 billion on the national Government's \neducation participation. That is 7.2 percent of what is spent in the \ncountry on education--7.2 percent. So let us remember when the Federal \nGovernment says we are not going to spend quite that much, we are \nreducing 7.2 percent of the education budget of our schools, not the \n100 percent, because the 100 percent is paid by local governments, by \nthe State; 7.2 percent is paid by us.\n  Today, 3 years later, the percentage has declined to about 6.2 \npercent. The Federal Government's education component is 6.2 percent of \nwhat we spend as a nation. Here are the facts about the year 1996. The \nSenate-reported education and labor bill provides $22.3 billion for \neducation programs in 1996--nearly $1.5 billion higher than the House-\npassed bill. The Senate-reported education appropriations bill is a \ngrand sum of less than $400 million below the Federal contribution in \nthe year 1995--$400 million less. Guess what that is in the percent \nreduction, Mr. President, of education in America? While we are trying \nto balance the budget, everybody takes a little bit of a cut, it is \none-tenth, Mr. President, it is one-tenth of a percent; one-tenth of a \npercent of all of the expenditures on education is what the Senate did \nin the Labor education bill. It reduced it by $400 million--one-tenth \nof 1 percent.\n  As the President speaks of education, as Senators speak of education, \nwould anyone believe we are talking about, in the Senate-passed \neducation bill, reducing the level of expenditures on education into \nwhich we now, as a nation, spend $400 billion, roughly?\n  We have reduced it $400 million--one-tenth of 1 percent--1996 or \n1995. That is not what anyone would understand from the statements that \nare made. We will wait until 1997 and 1998 and 1999 and see how those \ncounts come out.\n  For the year 1996, that is it--one-tenth of 1 percent reduction under \nthe Senate's proposal in education funding.\n  Mr. President, I have a number of other things I will save for later \ndiscussions. There is a huge misunderstanding around about the earned \nincome tax credit and how it relates to the $500 per child tax credit. \nWe have now figured it out and we will put it out for everybody to \nunderstand.\n  The one big thing right off for those wondering what we will show you \nwhen we put it all together, the President's child care tax credit goes \nup to 13 years of age and was $300. You had to take the earned income \ntax credit first and then apply the $500 after--very big difference \nthan ours.\n  We take the $500 credit before the earned income tax credit and it \nturns out very, very few people get less than they did in 1995. The \noverwhelming percentage of Americans with children get a very \nsignificant tax cut, EITC changes or not.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15442-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15443-S15444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I was listening to the debate by all of our \nSenators and how well words are used and how well numbers are used.\n  We see this big board that is here--you may take it down; it should \nnot be on the floor after the Senator has left, anyhow--that the budget \nis balanced. The budget is balanced under the proposal. That is the \nreason we can give a $245 billion tax cut; the budget is balanced. If \nyou take $245 billion out of it, it is unbalanced. Figure it any way \nyou want to. I have a balanced budget, but all of a sudden I have an \nexpenditure that I did not account for, so my budget is out of balance.\n  Anybody sitting around the kitchen table at night trying to figure up \ntheir bills, has a balanced budget, then all of a sudden they have a \ndoctor bill, have a car that breaks down, whatever it might be; \ntherefore, their budget is out of balance.\n  Instead of a medical bill or car breaking down, they want to give a \n$245 billion tax cut.\n  We hear about cutting education, only just a minimal amount--$400 \nmillion is $400 million. The distinguished occupant of the chair and \nother Senators here know States that put up anywhere from 60 to 70 \npercent of their general fund in that State to education. Every little \nbit of help makes \n\n[[Page S 15444]]\neducation better, gives the States an opportunity.\n  Talk about private education--sure, the big companies, corporations \ngive to their private institution of higher learning. What about the \nState institutions? We have 55,000-plus students in Kentucky that get \nsome kind of grant or loan to go to school. Now we will reduce those or \neliminate them or make them higher at the end, and we will lose \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 600,000 Pell grants in my State.\n  They say, well, we will increase Pell grants by $100. That is true. \nBut you will knock out from 600,000 down, so eliminate my students that \nhave an opportunity to have a little bit to get over the hump.\n  It is the same way with the earned income tax credit. We have a poor \nfamily out here struggling to get into the middle class at $27,000 \nannual income, a family of four. You tell him you cannot have any \ncredit for working, you cannot have any help for working, you cannot \nhave any help to get over the poverty line. So we will cut that out.\n  They say, CBO said we would balance the budget. That is true, but \nthen you will take $245 billion out of it. I hear a lot about what the \nPresident said about taxes; he may have taken too much or gone too far. \nLet me say this, Mr. President. In my State, after I voted for that \npackage in 1993, those who paid taxes in 1992, 12,500 of my \nconstituents, according to the information I have, paid increased \ntaxes--12,500 filers in 1992 paid more for 1993. Mr. President, 315,000 \nof my constituents paid less. Everybody else paid the same. We reduced \nthe budget by $500 billion, and by that we reduced interest rates, and \nthat made a $600 billion reduction.\n  We eliminated or reduced over 300 programs in the Federal Government; \ngoing to remove 272,000 Federal bureaucrats, and we are on the way--\nclose to 200,000 less than in 1993.\n  I thought that was a pretty good vote and I thought the path had been \ndrawn pretty clear. I do not believe the Republicans would be here \ntoday with their deficit reduction tax cuts--all these things--if we \nhad not cast that vote in 1993 to make this country better.\n  We hear a lot about Social Security and Medicare and the commission \nthat reports it. The commission reported a year ago that we would have \nsolvency problems in Medicare a year earlier. Now it is a year later. \nWe are in better shape.\n  For a small amount we can take care of Medicare as it is for a \ndecade. We have always taken care of the problems in Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  So now we hear they will cut Medicaid. Medicaid is what the middle-\nincome, if you want to call it that, $35,000 to $75,000 income--most of \nthem, after they spend everything they have, they are on Medicaid in a \nnursing home.\n  About August they will pick up the phone and say, ``Wendell, come get \nDad. We have run out of money.'' ``Wendell, come and get Ma. We have \nrun out of money.'' Do not worry about that; that will never happen, \nthey say.\n  They have reduced the regulations on the nursing homes, and the \nstatement was that you can sedate these old folks in nursing homes. \nThey will be easier to handle and you can have fewer employees. That is \nexactly what got the Federal Government in the nursing home regulation \nbusiness in the first place--the damage that was being done to our \nelderly that we were trying to help.\n  When you begin to look at the morass of what we are getting ready to \nvote on and shove down our throats, you will find in the days to come \nthat there will be a lot of words that were said on the other side, how \ngreat it will be, take our money, put it in stocks and bonds. You get \non the stock market one of these days and you will have problems. \nPension funds; use them. Do all these things. This is one Senator that \nis not going to vote for it.\n  I hope that the question that the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota asked the chairman of the Finance Committee or the Budget \nCommittee the other day, where is the meat? Where are the hearings? We \ndo not have any hearings. Are you afraid to debate it? I am not afraid \nto debate it. But you come here on the floor with public relations \nhouse statements, statements that are written--I have the book sent to \nall the Republicans. Everyone has one. Here is what you say when asked \nthis question. Here is what you say when asked that question. If they \ndo not ask this question, you raise this. All from the public relations \nhouse.\n  Mr. President, I know my time is up, and I wish that we would have \nmore time when reconciliation comes up so we could really look at it in \ndepth, but we are going to be limited, we are going to be limited.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15443-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15444-S15445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAMBASSADOR REED DELIVERS U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL'S MESSAGE IN HIROSHIMA \n                                  CITY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, on August 6, 1995, U.N. Under Secretary-\nGeneral Joseph Verner Reed attended the Hiroshima City Peace Memorial \nCeremony in Hiroshima, Japan, where he delivered a message on behalf of \nU.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.\n  As many of my colleagues will recall, Ambassador Reed has an \naccomplished, remarkable record of service in the United States \nGovernment, including serving ably and with distinction as the United \nStates Ambassador to Morocco and as Chief of Protocol. Ambassador Reed \nis now dedicating his talents to the United Nations, where he serves as \nUnder Secretary General and Special Representative of the Secretary \nGeneral for Public Affairs.\n  In his introductory remarks to the Secretary-General's message, \nAmbassador Reed asked that we remember and praise the determination of \nthe Hiroshima community to rebuild in the destructive aftermath of the \nwar, and to work for nuclear disarmament and a nuclear test ban.\n  As a longtime advocate, friend, and supporter of the United Nations, \nand as one who has tried to work for a world free from the threat of \nnuclear weapons, I believe the ceremony in Hiroshima was a particularly \nimportant and compelling event.\n  In my view, the remarks by Ambassador Reed, and the message he \ndelivered on behalf of Secretary-General Boutros Ghali, help to set \nprecisely the right tone for the event. Mr. President, I commend those \nremarks to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent that they be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Remarks by Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed\n\n       Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor of Hiroshima, Excellencies, \n     ladies and gentlemen, friends, 50 years ago today life on our \n     planet Earth was changed forever.\n       The Hiroshima City Peace Memorial Ceremony is a highly \n     symbolic and extraordinary event. For me, both as an \n     international civil servant at the United Nations and as an \n     American, today is a very emotional and significant day. I am \n     very proud to represent the United Nations and Secretary-\n     General Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at this 50th Peace Memorial \n     Ceremony in the year of the 50th anniversary of the United \n     Nations. On this day, let us remember the first words of the \n     Charter of the United Nations: ``We the peoples of the United \n     Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the \n     scourge of war . . .''\n       On this day, let us remember the determination of the \n     citizens of Hiroshima to rebuild their lives and to overcome \n     war. Let us praise their determination to work for nuclear \n     disarmament and nuclear test ban.\n       On this solemn day, let us take to heart that there is a \n     time to remember, a time to heal and a time to look forward. \n     Hiroshima is living proof of man's ability to recover from \n     the most horrible destruction and that gives hope to our \n     planet.\n       The crushing coda to the most violent war in history \n     altered global politics and war. The bomb introduced a new \n     age of terror--the Atomic Age; a whirlwind was sowed.\n       The international community has to make sure that there is \n     no reason ever again to employ destructive nuclear force. The \n     United Nations, your United Nations, needs you, the citizens \n     of Hiroshima, the people of Japan.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, let me now bring you a message from \n     the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dr. Boutros \n     Boutros-Ghali:\n       ``Today's is a poignant anniversary. Fifty years ago the \n     infinite capacity of the human mind was given proof. And we \n     saw how the skills and talents of man could harness the \n     mysteries of science itself, to purpose that could be \n     ennobling or to purpose that could simply destroy.\n       In that sense, this is an anniversary to remind us of what \n     we can do and just how far it is possible for us to go. We \n     saw that on the sixth of August, 1945. But in the sunlight of \n     the awakened day, new realisations emerged, new resolves were \n     fashioned. And this is also a commemoration of the will not \n     necessarily \n\n[[Page S 15445]]\n     to do what is within our means to do. It is a commemoration of the \n     conciliation of capacity and conscience, of power with \n     prudence. It is a commemoration of our awareness of the \n     terrifying levels to which conflict, once begun, can \n     escalate. It is a commemoration of the resolve, enshrined in \n     the Charter of the United Nations barely 6 weeks earlier, to \n     reaffirm faith in the dignity and worth of the human person.\n       You have dedicated this ceremony to peace. And, without \n     doubt, the introspection the horror of Hiroshima compelled \n     has made our world a safer place. Machinery has been put in \n     place to support nuclear controls and safeguards, to carry \n     out the destruction of nuclear weapons, to ban nuclear \n     testing. The nuclear nonproliferation treaty has been \n     validated in perpetuity. It has signatories whose number \n     falls only a few short of the membership of the United \n     Nations itself. Given tact, reason, and understanding it \n     should be possible to aspire to a truly universally regime. \n     Such a regime becomes all the more necessary and compelling \n     given the clear and unambiguous assertion by the Security \n     Council at the highest political level in January 1992 that \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction constitutes \n     a threat to international peace and security.\n       In 2 years we shall commemorate the 40th anniversary of an \n     unfulfilled mission: The question of a comprehensive nuclear \n     test ban, which first appeared on the agenda of the General \n     Assembly in 1957. It would be an achievement well worth \n     striving for. The progress being made towards a comprehensive \n     test ban treaty must be enhanced and build upon. The vast \n     potential for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy must be \n     addressed and given realisation unhindered by its diversion \n     for essentially combative ends. And it is clear that non \n     nuclear-weapon states must be provided international security \n     assurances that are legally binding.\n       These are some thoughts that come to mind on an occasion \n     such as this. In Hiroshima hope has succeeded hate, \n     determination despair. For a half a century you have lived \n     with an awareness at first hand of what the phrases the world \n     uses can really mean. Please share that awareness, that sense \n     of the possibilities that we can and we must realise. The \n     world owes you no less, nor you the world.\\1\\\n       This is the message from the Secretary-General of the \n     United Nations.\n       Excellencies, citizens of Hiroshima, this expression of the \n     Secretary-General is what we at the United Nations want to do \n     together with you, the citizens of Hiroshima and the people \n     of Japan.\n       I thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15444-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROCLAMATION HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF KICKAPOO HIGH SCHOOL OF \n                            SPRINGFIELD, MO\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I would like to salute a high \nschool from my hometown of Springfield, MO, that defines excellence in \nsecondary education. Kickapoo High School has been recognized by the \nU.S. Department of Education as one of the excellent secondary schools \nin America. Opened in 1971, Kickapoo will celebrate its 25th \nanniversary on October 25 after a rich history of academic achievement. \nOver 8,000 Missourians have graduated from the halls of Kickapoo High \nSchool. These students have attended some of America's finest \nuniversities including: Yale, Northwestern, University of Chicago, \nDuke, and Washington University.\n  Kickapoo High School continues to be a leader in educational \ndiversity, serving as a model, not just for southwest Missouri, but for \nthe Nation as a whole. The needs of physically and academically \nchallenged students have been served by the opening of a learning \nresource center and by establishing an orthopaedically handicapped \nprogram. In an era when test scores are emphasized for college \nadmissions, Kickapoo High School's students exceed the national average \non the ACT by two points on each of the three sections. Students' \neducations are supplemented by advanced placement courses, where 80 \npercent of Kickapoo students earned scores, qualifying them for college \ncredits upon enrollment.\n  A defining characteristic of a school is the honors bestowed upon it. \nKickapoo High School had seven National Merit Scholar finalists and \nnine National Merit Commended Scholars in 1994 alone. For these \nachievements listed and many others not, I am pleased to honor Kickapoo \nHigh School on the 25th anniversary of its charter.\n  The teachers, students, administrators, and community of Kickapoo \nHigh School should be commended for their achievements and service to \nour Nation. All of those who have been affiliated with Kickapoo High \nSchool are charged with a duty to leave America as a better place. \nKickapoo serves as an emblematic secondary educational institution and \nprime example of academic excellence in the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15445-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15445-S15463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some 32 years ago, in the administration \nof John F. Kennedy, I became Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy \nPlanning and Research. This was a new position. In this new position, I \nwas nominally responsible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I say \nnominally out of respect for the independence of that venerable \ninstitution which long predated the Department of Labor itself. The \nthen-commissioner, Ewan Clague, could not have been more friendly and \nsupportive and in time I grew to know more of the field. At that time \nthe monthly report of the unemployment rate was closely watched by \ncapital and labor, as we would have said, and was frequently \nchallenged. Committees regularly assembled to examine and debate the \ndata. Published unemployment rates, based on current monthly survey \nmethodology appeared, if memory serves, in 1948 and so the series was \nat most 14 years in place at this time. By contrast, the Consumer Price \nIndex dated back to 1919. And yet, while the statisticians were \nincreasingly confident of the accuracy by which they measured \nunemployment, they were never entirely happy about the CPI. Its \ncomputation was, and remains, a difficult and ever-changing effort. In \nparticular, the statisticians worried that the Consumer Price Index was \nincreasingly used as a surrogate for the cost-of-living index. They \nfelt this would lead to great troubles as surely the CPI overstated \ninflation. I think they would have been even more alarmed to know that \nin the two decades that followed we would use the CPI to index some 30 \npercent of Government outlays and 45 percent of Government revenues.\n  This problem inevitably grew more salient at times of true inflation. \nThus, on October 26, 1980, an article in the Business and Finance \nsection of the Washington Post described the election difficulties \nPresident Carter was facing owing to double-digit inflation. The story \nnoted ``The consumer price index overstates the impact of inflation, \nthe White House contends.'' As we know, it contended to no avail, but \nthe difficulties with the CPI as a proxy for the cost of living \ncontinued.\n  In the spring 1981 issue of the Public Interest, Dr. Robert J. \nGordon, now chairman of the department of economics at Northwestern \nUniversity, wrote:\n\n       . . . the [United States] CPI is probably the single most \n     quoted economic statistic in the world.\n\n  We are now slowly waking up to the further fact, well known in the \neconomics and statistics communities, that the Consumer Price Index is \nnot a measure of the change in the cost of living. It is so stated in a \npamphlet published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics entitled \n``Understanding the Consumer Price Index: Answers to Some Questions'':\n\n       Is the CPI a cost-of-living index?\n       No, although it frequently and mistakenly is called a cost-\n     of-living index. The CPI is an index of price change only. It \n     does not reflect the changes in buying or consumption \n     patterns that consumers probably would make to adjust to \n     relative price changes. For example, if the price of beef \n     increases more rapidly than other meats, shoppers may shift \n     their purchases away from beef to pork, poultry, or fish. If \n     the charges for household energy increase more rapidly than \n     for other items, households may buy more insulation and \n     consume less fuel. The CPI does not reflect this substitution \n     among items as cost-of-living index would. Rather, the CPI \n     assumes the purchase of the same market basket, in the same \n     fixed proportion (or weight) month after month.\n\n  Despite this caution from the agency that compiles the CPI, the index \nis used as a yardstick for adjusting Government benefits, including \nSocial Security, and provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  And yet, it is now well recognized that changes in the CPI overstate \nthe change in the cost of living.\n  The administration recognizes this fact.\n  Congress recognizes this fact.\n  And a Commission of eminent economists appointed by the Senate \nFinance Committee recognizes this fact.\n  In an October 3, 1994, memorandum entitled ``Big Choices,'' Dr. Alice \n\n\n[[Page S 15446]]\nRivlin, then Acting Director of OMB and now Director--and a \ndistinguished economist who has served as the president of the American \nEconomic Association--noted that among the options available to reduce \nthe budget deficit were several COLA proposals including, and I quote:\n\n       CPI minus 0.5 ``technical'' reform (CPI may be overstated \n     by 0.4% to 1.5%).\n       CPI minus 2 for five years.\n\n  The budget resolutions passed by the Senate and House built into \ntheir baseline lower CPI assumptions than were projected by CBO in \nJanuary. The lower assumptions reflect the expectation that scheduled \nBLS revisions of the CPI will lower the reported CPI. The Senate \nassumed a two-tenths of a percentage point adjustment; the House \nassumed a six-tenths of a percentage point adjustment. The conference \nreport adopted the Senate version.\n  In their report--Senate Report 104-82--the Senate Budget Committee \nnoted:\n\n       In January, CBO projected CPI inflation would remain at 3.4 \n     percent for 1998 and thereafter. The downward revision \n     reported here relative to the January figures reflects CBO's \n     new appraisal that the 1998 benchmark revision to the CPI \n     planned by the Bureau of Labor Statistics will likely reduce \n     the rise in the computed measure of the CPI by 0.2 percentage \n     points a year. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan and CPI \n     experts have recently testified before the Senate that \n     incomplete evidence suggests CPI inflation may be overstated \n     by as much as 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points a year. However, \n     in advance of further, more conclusive analysis, CPI biases \n     remain speculative and have not been incorporated into the \n     Committee assumptions.\n\n  And the budget resolution, adopted by the Senate on May 25, 1995, \ncontained this language:\n\n     SEC. 304. NONPARTISAN ADVISORY COMMISSION ON THE CPI.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Congress intended to insulate certain government \n     beneficiaries and taxpayers from the effects of inflation by \n     indexing payments and tax brackets to the Consumer Price \n     Index (CPI);\n       (2) approximately 30 percent of total Federal outlays and \n     45 percent of Federal revenues are indexed to reflect changes \n     in the CPI; and\n       (3) the overwhelming consensus among experts is that the \n     method used to construct the CPI and the current calculation \n     of the CPI both overstate the estimate of the true cost of \n     living.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a temporary advisory commission should be established \n     to make objective and nonpartisan recommendations concerning \n     the appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology and \n     calculations that determine the CPI;\n       (2) the Commission should be appointed on a nonpartisan \n     basis, and should be composed of experts in the fields of \n     economics, statistics, or other related professions; and\n       (3) the Commission should report its recommendations to the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics and to Congress at the earliest \n     possible date.\n\n  The conference agreement on the concurrent budget resolution for \nfiscal year 1996 passed the Senate on June 29, 1995. The conference \nreport included the following:\n\n     SEC. 309. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE ASSUMPTIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the aggregates and \n     functional levels included in this budget resolution assume \n     that--\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       . . . (6) a temporary nonpartisan commission should be \n     established to make recommendations concerning the \n     appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology and \n     calculations that determine the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \n     and those recommendations should be submitted to the Bureau \n     of Labor Statistics at the earliest possible date.\n\n  Earlier, on March 13, April 6, and June 6, the Finance Committee held \nhearings on this subject. Testimony was received from 13 established \neconomists who collectively represented virtually all the expertise \nthat exists on this issue.\n  A remarkable consensus emerged at those hearings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the witnesses, along with \ntheir affiliations, and their estimates of the degree to which changes \nin the CPI overstate changes in the cost of living be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     Estimates of CPI Overstatement\n\n                 (In order of appearance of witnesses)\n\n       March 13, 1995 Hearing:\n       Chairman Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve: 0.5 to 1.5 \n     percentage points.\n       Cmsr.

Mr. President, again: Dr. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board--0.5 to 1.5 percentage points.\n  Dr. Dale Jorgenson, chairman of the department of economics at \nHarvard University--around 1 percentage point.\n  Dr. Robert Gordon, chairman of the economics department at \nNorthwestern University--at least 1.7 percentage points. Note that in \n1981 Professor Gordon wrote the Public Interest article, cited earlier, \nin which he laid out many of the issues related to the accurate \nmeasurement of changes in the cost of living.\n  Dr. Michael Boskin, professor of economics at Stanford University and \nChairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Bush \nadministration--at least 1 percentage point, maybe 2 percentage points.\n  In all, 9 of the 13 witnesses provided numerical estimates of the \noverstatement. The average of the estimates: about 1.1 percentage \npoints. The calculation is based on a minimum estimate for some \nwitnesses. Even if we assume a zero estimate of the overstatement for \nthose who provided no estimate--and few, if any, would so contend--the \naverage for all the witnesses would be 0.8 of a percentage point.\n  Not too different from the 0.4 to 1.5 percentage points noted by OMB \nDirector Rivlin in her memo last October.\n  The complete record of these hearings is printed as Senate Hearing \n104-69--Consumer Price Index. I hope Senators will obtain copies and \nreview the hearing record.\n  Following the hearings, then Finance Committee Chairman Packwood and \nI, as ranking member, announced on June 26, 1995, the appointment of a \nnonpartisan Commission to:\n\n       . . . study the methodology used to calculate the Consumer \n     Price Index (CPI) and to advise Congress on whether this \n     methodology provides an accurate measure of the cost of \n     living.\n\n  At that time I stated:\n\n       . . . Current law makes it clear that certain federal \n     programs should be adjusted for changes in the cost of \n     living. What is not clear is whether changes in the CPI, \n     which is used as a proxy for changes in the cost of living, \n     accurately measures these changes. A study by a non-partisan \n     commission will provide invaluable advice to Congress on this \n     important issue.\n\n  The Commission, chaired by Dr. Michael Boskin, issued its interim \nreport on September 15, 1995.\n  The report, ``Toward a More Accurate Measure of the Cost of Living,'' \nincluded the following observations and conclusions in the executive \nsummary:\n\n       . . . While the CPI is the best measure currently \n     available, it is not a true cost of living index (this has \n     been recognized by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for many \n     years). Despite important BLS updates and improvements in the \n     CPI, changes in the CPI have substantially overstated the \n     actual rate of price inflation, by about 1.5% per annual \n     recently. It is likely that a large bias also occurred \n     looking back over at least the last couple of decades, \n     perhaps longer, but we make no attempt to estimate its size.\n     \n[[Page S 15447]]\n\n       . . . Changes in the CPI will overstate changes in the true \n     cost of living for the next few years. The Commission's \n     interim best estimate of the size of the upward bias looking \n     forward is 1.0% per year. The range of plausible values is \n     0.7% to 2.0%. The range of uncertainty is not symmetric. It \n     is more likely that changes in the CPI have a larger than a \n     smaller bias.\n       . . . The upward bias programs into the federal budget an \n     annual automatic real increase in indexed benefits and real \n     tax cut.\n\n  Let me now elaborate on the implications of these points made by the \nCommission.\n  Current law requires the Government to adjust some benefits and tax \nprovisions for changes in the cost of living.\n  The 1972 Amendments to the Social Security Act included this \nlanguage:\n\n       Section 202. (a) 1 Section 215 of the Social Security Act \n     is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new \n     subsection: Cost-of-Living Increases in Benefits.\n\n  Similarly, section 104(f)(3) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 \nstates:\n\n       . . . the cost of living adjustment for any calendar year \n     is the percentage . . .\n\n  The objective of these statutes is clear: Benefits and Tax Code \nprovisions should be adjusted for changes in the cost of living. \nHowever, the law stipulates that the adjustments should be based on \nchanges in the CPI as a proxy for changes in the cost of living. But \nwith mounting evidence that changes in the CPI overstate changes in the \ncost of living, implementation of the policy is thwarted. The law is \nbeing thwarted.\n  What can be done to ensure that the policies Congress has adopted are \nfaithfully executed? That is, how can we ensure that adjustments in \nbenefits and Tax Code provisions more accurately reflect changes in the \ncost of living? Two things.\n  First, continue to support ongoing efforts by the BLS in its routine \nupdating and rebenchmarking of consumer expenditure patterns, and in \nits research activities. Talented and dedicated BLS researchers have \nidentified many of the complex measurement issues that must be \naddressed when compiling a CPI in a world in which the quality of \nproducts changes and new goods are introduced with resolute regularity.\n  Second, Congress must recognize that, despite the best intentions of \nthe BLS as it continues with its updates and research, the CPI is not, \nas the BLS readily acknowledges, a cost-of-living index. To achieve its \npolicy objectives--so clearly stated in the law--Congress must \nimplement legislative corrections that, when combined with the most \naccurate CPI that the BLS can produce, will result in changes in \nbenefits and Tax Code provisions that accurately reflect changes in the \ncost of living.\n  As noted earlier, the Boskin commission on the CPI suggests that for \nnow, the correction Congress should adopt is 1 percentage point.\n  The Commission's report also highlights the budget implications of \nfailing to correctly implement policies designed to adjust for changes \nin the cost of living. We should not harbor any misgivings merely \nbecause these changes will dramatically improve the budget outlook. The \nerror is there and should be corrected without regard to budget \nimplications.\n  Even so, it must be acknowledged that the budget implications are \nenormous. One could say awesome.\n  CBO estimates a cumulative 10-year reduction in the deficit of $634 \nbillion from a 1 percentage point downward adjustment in automatic \nchanges of benefits and tax provisions. By the 10th year the annual \nreduction in the deficit is almost $140 billion. Extrapolating from \nthese CBO projections, my staff estimates the 12-year cumulative \nreduction in the deficit at almost $1 trillion.\n  And the corrections affect both sides of the budget ledger. About \none-half of the cumulative reduction in the deficit is due to lower \noutlays; one-third due to higher revenues, and the remainder results \nfrom reductions in interest payments.\n  And while we are thinking about saving the Social Security trust \nfund, consider this fact. Harry Ballantyne, Chief Actuary of the Social \nSecurity Administration, estimates that the date of exhaustion of the \nOASDI fund is extended by 19 years from 2030 to 2049 by a 1 percentage \npoint downward adjustment in the CPI.\n  Exhaustion is defined as the year in which the trust fund has used up \nall its reserves of Treasury securities with the expectation that \nannual outlays will continue to exceed annual income.\n  This is a real fiscal dividend. We can get things right and save the \ntrust fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following reports and \ndocuments cited in my remarks be printed in the Record after my \nstatement.\n  First, ``The Consumer Price Index: Measuring Inflation and Causing \nIt'' by R.J. Gordon, 1981, in the Public Interest 63: Spring.\n  Second, ``Understanding the Consumer Price Index: Answers to Some \nQuestions'' by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, May 1994.\n  Third, ``Toward a More Accurate Measure of the Cost of Living'' by \nthe Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index, September \n15, 1995.\n  Fourth, table on the change in deficit from a downward adjustment in \nthe CPI of 1 percentage point by the Congressional Budget Office, March \n15, 1995.\n  Fifth, memorandum prepared by Harry C. Ballantyne, September 28, \n1995, on: Estimated Long-Range Effects of Alternative Reductions in \nAutomatic Benefit Increases.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Public Interest, Spring 1981]\n\n      The Consumer Price Index: Measuring Inflation and Causing it\n\n                         (By Robert J. Gordon)\n\n       Inflation is widely believed to be the most important \n     economic problem facing the United States and most other \n     countries in the world. Thus it is not surprising that the \n     monthly publication of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is \n     so closely watched both inside and outside of government. \n     Large increases in the CPI are bad news for Administration \n     officials, particularly in election years, and may lead to \n     sudden policy reversals such as the introduction of the \n     Carter Administration's ill-fated credit controls in March \n     1980. Large increases in the CPI, however, are good news for \n     millions of recipients of social security benefits, \n     government retirement pay, and other payments that by law or \n     contract must be escalated in step with the CPI. Also, since \n     foreigners watch the CPI closely for clues to the future \n     course of U.S. interest rates and the exchange value of the \n     dollar, the CPI is probably the single most quoted economic \n     statistic in the world.\n       Imagine that someone pushes the wrong button on a computer \n     at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the division of the \n     Department of Labor that is responsible for the CPI, and \n     records that the increase in the CPI over a particular year \n     is 15 percent instead of the true rate of 10 percent. \n     Government officials would probably react with restrictive \n     policy measures--some combination of expenditure reductions, \n     tax increases, and higher interest rates. Thousands, \n     perhaps millions, of Americans might be thrown out of \n     work. Millions of others receiving social security \n     benefits or union wages escalated by the CPI would enjoy a \n     windfall gain, since their payments would go up by more \n     than the true inflation rate. The unnecessary extra \n     benefit payments would cause the government deficit to \n     balloon, putting extra pressure on the Federal Reserve to \n     print more money and finance still more inflation, while \n     the higher union wage payments would put pressure on firms \n     to raise prices faster than otherwise.\n       Exactly this chain of events occurred in the United States \n     in 1979 and 1980, but not because of an easily correctable \n     slip by BLS. Instead, a serious overstatement of inflation by \n     the CPI was caused by built-in design flaws. These defects \n     have come to light not through the snooping of some \n     measurement-minded Woodward or Bernstein, but rather as a \n     result of a growing discrepancy between the CPI and a \n     competing government measure of consumer prices called the \n     ``Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator,'' published by \n     a division of the Department of Commerce, and usually called \n     the ``PCE deflator'' for short. Table I shows that after \n     registering only a small difference in early 1978 and most \n     earlier years, the inflation rate recorded by the two indexes \n     grew apart by an amount that reached an annual rate of 5 \n     percent in the first half of 1980.\n\n   TABLE I.--INFLATION RATES AS ESTIMATED BY THE CPI AND PCE DEFLATOR   \n                [Percentage changes at annual rates] \\1\\                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       PCE              \n                                            CPI     Deflator  Difference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1947-77........................     3.4        3.3       0.1            \n1978-80 by half year...........  ......  .........  ........            \n1978, first half...............     8.9        8.3       0.6            \n1978, last half................     9.0        6.8       2.2            \n1979, first half...............    12.6       10.0       2.6            \n1979, first half...............    13.0        9.8       3.2            \n\n[[Page S 15448]]\n                                                                        \n1980, first half...............    16.2       11.2       5.0            \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Source: CPI from Bureau of Labor Statistics, PCE Deflator from      \n  Survey of Current Business, various issues. These figures do not      \n  reflect the data revisions announced in December 1980 for the PCE     \n  deflator. A preliminary inspection suggests that the inflation rate of\n  the PCE deflator in the new data is between 0.5 and 1.0 percentage    \n  points lower for each period shown since 1977. Because the CPI has not\n  been revised, the difference between the two indexes has been further \n  enlarged by the revisions.                                            \n\n\n       The story of the two inflation indexes is a fascinating \n     one, even for those whose eyes glaze over at talk of \n     measurement procedures and who prefer to treat government \n     economic data as unchallenged gospel. Since the CPI and PCE \n     deflator are compiled from a common set of underlying price \n     data by two different sets of rules, part of the tale \n     involves the rules themselves, why the lead to \n     different results, and why the CPI rules are widely \n     believed to be inferior to those used in the PCE deflator. \n     Another aspect involves the internal workings of the BLS, \n     where staff bureaucrats have long urged the replacement of \n     obsolete rules for the measurement of housing prices but \n     were forced by political pressure to retain the old rules \n     in the new version of the CPI introduced in 1978. A final \n     and less-reported chapter involves the adequacy of the \n     underlying price data that both the CPI and PCE deflator \n     share in common. These form the basis for all economic \n     measures of real economic progress, or the lack of it, \n     including those that show a drastic slowdown in the growth \n     of U.S. productivity in the last decade. Howe effectively \n     do official procedures handle innumerable situations when \n     a new model or product costs more than the item it \n     replaces, but differs in quality as well? New radial tires \n     last longer than the old bias-ply type, and recent-vintage \n     television sets both perform better and need fewer repairs \n     than their predecessors. But if price indexes are not \n     adjusted adequately for these quality improvements, \n     inflation is overstated and the improvement in our \n     productivity and standard of living is understated.\n\n\n                          a two-class society?\n\n       The CPI was first published by the BLS in 1919 to help set \n     wage levels for workers in shipbuilding yards, and its use as \n     a standard for wage increases has always been one of its main \n     purposes. Currently about 8 million workers are covered by \n     collective bargaining contracts that provide for increases in \n     wage rates based on increases in the CPI, and these wages set \n     a pattern that millions of other workers try to emulate. More \n     recently, many types of government payments have been linked \n     to the CPI. Among those who reap a windfall if the annual CPI \n     increase is overstated are 31 million social security \n     beneficiaries and 2.5 million retired military and Federal \n     Civil Service employees and survivors. Others receive \n     payments geared to a particular component of the CPI, \n     especially 20 million food stamp recipients and 25 million \n     children who eat federally subsidized school lunches. In all \n     about half the population, including dependents is affected \n     by changes in the CPI.\n       The use of escalator clauses has created a two-class \n     society, separating those who are protected against \n     inflation, legally or by contract, from those who are not. \n     Steelworkers, Chicago bus drivers, and other union members \n     enjoying generous escalator clauses have moved several steps \n     up the relative income ladder at the expense of white-collar \n     workers and others whose wages are not escalated. Social \n     security recipients enjoyed a 14.4 percent boost in benefits \n     in July 1980, as compared to an increase in the government's \n     average hourly earnings index of only 9.2 percent in the year \n     ending that month. Use of that earnings index rather than the \n     CPI for escalation in 1980 would have reduced the federal \n     deficit by about 8 billion. Use of the PCE deflator would \n     have been almost as desirable, saving about $6 billion.\\1\\ \n     Thus some of the much-discussed financial crisis of the \n     Social Security System results from the use of the CPI for \n     escalation purposes.\n     \\1\\ The actual social security increase was based on the CPI \n     change in the twelve months ending in March, 1980.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       While adjustment of payments is the most tangible function \n     of the CPI, there are two other uses which figure prominently \n     in discussions of economic performance and policy. The first \n     and most obvious is that the CPI itself is a readily \n     available measure of inflation and serves as a widely-quoted \n     verdict on the success or failure of economic policy. The \n     second is that the individual CPI item indexes for pork \n     gasoline, and other products are the sources of other price \n     indexes. The CPI and PCE deflator displayed in Table I are \n     both based on the same price-change data for pork and \n     gasoline, but they combined these individual item indexes \n     with different weights. Because the Commerce Department \n     procedures put less weight on energy prices, which rose \n     rapidly during the 1978-80 period (as well as no weight at \n     all on mortgage interest rates), they yield a slower overall \n     increase when the PCE deflator is added up. It is the PCE \n     deflator, and the broader ``GNP deflator'' of which it is a \n     major component, that allow the Commerce Department to \n     translate data a current-dollar sales and personal income \n     into quarterly estimates of real Gross National Product. The \n     basic measure of the economy's productive performance.\\2\\ \n     Real GNP, in turn, is divided by BLS data on hours spent at \n     work to yield data on the nation's hourly productivity.\n     \\2\\ About two-thirds of Gross National Product consists of \n     Personal Consumption Expenditures deflated by the PCE \n     deflator. The other third consists of construction spending, \n     business equipment purchases, government wages and purchases \n     of goods, and the excess of exports over imports. Each of \n     these other components has its own deflator based on a wide \n     variety of data sources.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                    the ever-changing market-basket\n\n       The CPI reports the price in any given month of a so-called \n     ``fixed market-basket'' of commonly purchased items. Today's \n     price of the market-basket is expressed relative to what the \n     same items would have cost in 1967, the arbitrary ``base \n     year'' of the index. As shown on the top line of Table II, \n     the CPI was at a level of 251.7 in September 1980, \n     indicating that items costing $10,000 in 1967 would have \n     cost $25,170 if purchased in September 1980. Public \n     attention tends to focus on recent changes in the CPI \n     rather than on the cumulative change since 1967. Thus, \n     newspaper reports do not highlight the index level of \n     251.7, but rather the change over the past year and month. \n     In September 1980, the change in the CPI over the previous \n     year registered 12.7 percent, and the change from August \n     to September was 1.0 percent, usually expressed at an \n     annual rate. The sense of panic that surrounded the Carter \n     Administration's economic policy in March and April of \n     1980 was directly set off by three consecutive monthly CPI \n     increases of 1.4 percent, or 18.2 percent when expressed \n     as an annual rate.\n\n       TABLE II.--A SAMPLE OF CPI ITEM INDEXES, SEPTEMBER 1980.\\1\\      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Percent  \n                                               Index Level   change from\n                                               (1967=100)     September \n                                                                1979    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll items...................................         251.7          12.7\nWhite bread.................................         219.6           9.4\nSirloin Steak...............................         280.9          11.9\nEggs........................................         179.9           5.4\nPotatoes....................................         313.2          57.2\nRoasted coffee..............................         426.1           0.0\nWhiskey.....................................         137.6           6.7\nResidential rent............................         195.1           9.0\nContracted mortgage interest................         500.9          26.3\nFuel oil....................................         585.4          21.3\nTelephone services..........................         137.0           3.5\nTelevision..................................         105.0           2.0\nWomen's dresses.............................         168.5          -1.5\nNew cars....................................         181.7           9.4\nAirline fares...............................         310.3          44.9\nHospital room...............................         428.4          13.8\nSchool books and supplies...................         221.0           9.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Source: Consumer Price Index Detailed Report, September 1980.       \n\n       The task of constructing the CPI involves (1) determining \n     what people buy, (2) determining where they buy, and (3) \n     determining what they pay for what they buy. The first task \n     was carried out by the BLS and Census Bureau in 1972-74 and \n     involved quarterly interviews with about 20,000 families and \n     a survey of another 20,000 families who were asked to keep \n     diaries of small, frequent purchases for two weeks. Because \n     this effort of carrying out the Consumer Expenditure Survey \n     is so complex and expensive, Congress is only willing to \n     allocate funds for such a survey every decade. The \n     previous Consumer Expenditure Survey had been carried out \n     in 1960-61 and was the basis of the CPI until 1977. Thus \n     in late 1977 the ``old CPI'' was based on expenditure data \n     that were sixteen years out of date, and the ``new CPI'' \n     introduced in 1978 was based on an expenditure survey that \n     was already five years out of date.\n       Determining where people buy, so that the right amount of \n     information might be collected from particular retail \n     outlets, discount stores, and mail-order houses, was \n     accomplished by a ``point-of-purchase'' survey of another \n     23,000 families in the early 1970s. This scientific basis for \n     the collection of price data represents a substantial \n     improvement on the arbitrary choices of outlets in the CPI \n     for earlier years. With the allocation of individual items \n     and retail outlets established by these various surveys, the \n     month-to-month job of collecting the actual price quotations \n     is carried out by BLS data collectors who have considerable \n     latitude to choose the specific brands and types of goods to \n     be priced each month within the general item definitions laid \n     down by the central BLS office. An incredible total of one \n     and a half million individual price quotations are obtained \n     each year, of which 700,000 are for food, 100,000 are for \n     rent and property taxes, and the remainder are for other \n     items. Data sources, called ``reporters,'' include about \n     2,300 food store outlets, 18,000 rental units, 18,000 housing \n     units, and 22,300 other sources.\n\n\n                 the importance of weighting procedures\n\n       Every month the CPI publishes an overall index, summary \n     indexes for major groups of items like food and apparel, and \n     about 250 item indexes, a few of which are shown as examples \n     in Table II. What is striking here is the wide variety of \n     price increases registered by different items since 1967, \n     ranging from 5 percent for television sets to 485 percent for \n     fuel oil. Clearly the overall inflation rate registered by \n     the CPI depends on how much weight is attached to each item. \n     Someone who spends equal shares of his income on rent, TV \n     sets, telephone calls, eggs, and whiskey, would have \n     experienced a price increase since 1967 of only 51 percent, \n     or a compounded rate of only 3.2 percent per \n\n[[Page S 15449]]\n     year. Someone else who spends equal shares on steak, potatoes, coffee, \n     fuel oil, and mortgage interest, would have experienced an \n     increase since 1967 of 321.3 percent, or a compounded rate of \n     11.7 percent per year. Since average hourly earnings \n     increased by 7.5 percent over the same period, the first \n     spending pattern would have allowed a substantial increase in \n     real income, whereas the second pattern would have resulted \n     in a drastic drop in real income.\n       Consumers are under constant pressure to shift their \n     spending patterns to avoid goods that have unusually high \n     price increases--for example, to reduce fuel usage in favor \n     of wool sweaters, or to shift from coffee to whiskey. Any \n     index like the CPI that uses fixed expenditure weights must \n     exaggerate the inflation rate as compared to an index like \n     the PCE deflator that uses current weights, since the CPI \n     assigns relatively large weights to high-inflation items like \n     fuel oil and coffee based on their shares in consumer \n     expenditure in the ``good old days'' of 1972-73, before the \n     consumer reaction against their increase in price. The fixed \n     weights used in the CPI would not be an important defect if \n     all products changed in price by roughly the same amount over \n     long periods of time. But the large variety of price changes \n     between 1967 and 1980 displayed by the index numbers for \n     individual items in Table II has made the fixed-weight \n     problem a source of upward bias in the CPI during the past \n     three years, as obsolete weights magnify the high inflation \n     rates of products like fuel oil.\n       How much of an exaggeration in the CPI's measured inflation \n     rate is caused by this so-called ``substitution bias''? We do \n     not learn the answer to this question by examining the \n     massive differences between the CPI and PCE deflator \n     displayed in Table I, since these are largely caused by other \n     factors besides substitution. Instead, we can determine the \n     contribution of consumer substitution away from high-\n     inflation items by examining the effect of three different \n     weighting schemes for the data used in the PCE deflator. The \n     first is the scheme used in the published ``implicit PCE \n     deflator'' itself. Table III shows an example of how the \n     implicit PCE deflator would be calculated for a simple \n     economy consisting only of spending on coffee and whiskey. \n     Sections 1 and 2 exhibit prices and quantities in three \n     different periods: the 1972 base period and two successive \n     quarters in 1980. Section 3 multiplies price times quantity \n     in each period to obtain actual expenditures. Section 4 then \n     computes ``real'' expenditures in constant 1972 prices by \n     multiplying the actual quantities purchased in each period by \n     the constant prices of 1972.\n\n\n                 the consumer price index and inflation\n\n  Table III.--METHODS OF CALCULATING PRICE INDEXES (FOR A HYPOTHETICAL  \n                              ECONOMY) \\1\\                              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             1980       \n                                                     -------------------\n                                              1972      First    Second \n                                                       quarter   quarter\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        THE HYPOTHETICAL ECONOMY                        \n1.

The alteration in \n     weights in successive periods causes the deflator to mix up \n     the measurement of price changes with the effect of shifting \n     weights. Thus, in the second quarter of 1980 the price of \n     coffee increases by 25 percent, and the price of whiskey \n     stays constant, but the PCE deflator registers a 13 percent \n     decline in spite of the fact that no single price has \n     dropped! Why? Expenditures in that quarter have shifted \n     toward whiskey, which has had no price increase at all since \n     the base year of 1972; thus the higher weight increases the \n     influence of whiskey's cumulative absence of price change \n     since 1972, which has nothing to do with actual inflation in \n     1980.\\3\\\n     \\3\\ If the same example were recalculated for a deflator \n     using a base of 1980, second quarter (rather than 1972), the \n     result would be an increase in the deflator of 14 percent \n     rather than a decline of 13 percent.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n\n       How can we obtain the advantage of the up-to-date weights \n     used in the PCE deflator without the deflator's disadvantage \n     of mixing together price changes and weight changes? This is \n     accomplished by the ``chain index,'' which is calculated by \n     averaging together the changes in individual prices between \n     and periods rather than by computing an index level as in the \n     case of the implicit deflator. These individual changes are \n     weighted by the average share of expenditures of each \n     category in the two adjacent quarters taken together. In our \n     example the increase in the chain index is 11.7 percent \n     (shown in section 6), which makes intuitive sense as an \n     average of the 25 percent increase in the price of coffee and \n     the zero percent increase in the price of whiskey. (Since the \n     share of expenditures on constant-price whiskey is a bit more \n     than half in the two quarters, $25/$47, the chain index comes \n     out showing a bit less of an increase than a simple \n     unweighted average of 25 and zero).\n       Finally, the third alternatives is to combine the coffee \n     and whiskey prices with fixed 1972 expenditure weights. This \n     creates an index analogous to the CPI. As shown in section 7, \n     the fixed-weight index yields a 20 percent price increase for \n     the second quarter of 1980, reflecting the higher weight of \n     coffee in 1972 spending patterns. In this extreme case the \n     bias in the fixed-weight index stemming from consumer \n     substitution is represented by the difference between the 20 \n     percent increase in the index compared to the 11.7 percent \n     increase in the chain index.\n       While real-world price changes vary all over the map, the \n     relatively large share in spending of items experiencing \n     roughly average price increases makes the problem of consumer \n     substitution in the actual CPI less important than in our \n     extreme example. This is shown in Table IV, which displays an \n     array of price change indexes, ranging in order from the \n     implicit PCE deflator in section 1 to the CPI itself in \n     section 5. The five indexes here allow us to decompose the \n     difference between the implicit PCE deflator and the CPI into \n     three main factors. The chain index in section 2 differs from \n     the implicit deflator in section 1 by eliminating the \n     undesirable impact of changing weights, thus the difference \n     between section 2 and section 1 shows the modest quantitative \n     impact of shifting weights. Next, section 3 lists the PCE \n     deflator recalculated with fixed 1972 weights. The difference \n     between this fixed-weight version of the PCE deflator and the \n     chain index in the section above shows the effect of consumer \n     substitution away from items with rapidly rising prices. The \n     difference is negligible in 1977 and 1978 but became \n     magnified in 1979 and 1980, largely due to the over-weighting \n     of energy prices in the fixed-weight index. Nevertheless, in \n     the first half of 1980 shifting weights and the substitution \n     effect together contributed only 0.8 out of the 4.4 \n     percentage point difference between the Consumer Price Index \n     and the implicit PCE deflator.\n\n           Table IV.--FIVE MEASURES OF INFLATION, 1977-80 \\1\\           \n                              [In percent]                              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Late 1979-\n                                 Late       Late       Late        mid  \n                               1976-77    1977-78    1978-79      1980  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Section 4 displays a special version of the CPI \n     that replaces the actual home ownership component by the PCE \n     measure and weighting of home ownership cost. The difference \n     between the actual CPI in section 5 and the special version \n     in section 4 shows that the choice of home ownership \n     treatment makes an enormous difference, a full 3.8 percentage \n     points in the first half of 1980.\n       Far from being a source of higher prices, squeezed budgets, \n     and falling living standards, most Americans have found home \n     ownership to be a source of wealth creation and one of the \n     few spots in the family budget that is largely insulated from \n     inflation. The treatment of homeownership in the CPI makes \n     the fatal error of treating the whole population as if it \n     were in the predicament of a newlywed couple buying its first \n     house. This unlucky pair, late arrivals on the housing \n     inflation merry-go-round, over the past several years has \n     indeed faced a substantial increase in the monthly payment \n     required to own its first house. But the vast majority of \n     home owners has been protected from these higher costs. \n     Increases in home purchase prices for existing home owners \n     are a source of higher wealth, and ``leverage'' (the small \n     initial share of their down-payment equity) makes the value \n     of their equity increase by a multiple of the percentage \n     annual increase in house prices. Because income is \n     properly defined as consumption plus the change in \n\n[[Page S 15450]]\n     one's wealth, higher home prices by this definition also raise \n     individual incomes. Increases in mortgage interest rates \n     do not represent a higher cost for holders of existing \n     mortgages, since most of these were negotiated at fixed \n     interest rates. The monthly payment to the local savings \n     bank is the same today as it was in the month of the first \n     payment when the house was purchased two or five or \n     fifteen years ago, and thus is a steadily falling \n     proportion of annual earnings that allows the paycheck to \n     be diverted to other needs. Home ownership has been a \n     blessing--a source of wealth and six-figure balance sheets \n     for many Americans--rather than the curse that the CPI's \n     treatment would imply.\n       In Table V the housing component of the PCE deflator is \n     compared with the various parts of the rent and home \n     ownership component of the CPI. It is evident that the \n     difference between the PCE and CPI treatments involves both \n     the weights and the actual price increases registered by the \n     individual components. The housing component represents 17.4 \n     percent of the weight in the PCE deflator, as contrasted with \n     the 30.2 percent weight for rent and home ownership together \n     in the CPI. The increase in the PCE component in the year to \n     September 1980 was only 9.0 percent, as compared to a \n     weighted average of 15.4 percent for rent and home ownership \n     together in the CPI. There are numerous weak points, both \n     major and minor, in the CPI treatment of housing. The most \n     important are (1) the overweighting of the home-purchase and \n     mortgage-interest-rate components, (2) the treatment of \n     existing mortgage contracts as involving variable rather than \n     fixed rates, and (3) the failure to subtract from the higher \n     home prices and mortgage rate the benefits that consumers \n     receive from interest tax deductions and from the capital \n     gains due to higher house prices.\n\nTable V.--RENT AND HOME OWNERSHIP COSTS: CPI WEIGHTS AND PRICE INCREASES\n                                   \\1\\                                  \n                              [In percent]                              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Weight in   Annual rate of\n                                                total         change    \n                    Item                        index,    September 1979-\n                                               December   September 1980\n                                                 1979                   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA.

PCE Deflator: Survey of Current     \n  Business, October 1980. PCE data refer to the quarter in which        \n  indicated month occurred.                                             \n\n       1. Overweighting of home purchase prices and mortgage \n     interest rates. Table V shows that the weight attached to \n     mortgage interest is almost as large as that attached to home \n     purchase. The CPI makes the incredible error of treating home \n     purchase and mortgage interest payments as separate unrelated \n     transactions; it counts the house price once as the weight \n     for home price changes and then counts most of it again as \n     the weight for changes in mortgage interest rates. This \n     double-counting can be appreciated in an example involving a \n     new home purchased for $40,000 in 1972, financed by a 20 \n     percent down payment ($8,000) and a twenty-five-year $32,000 \n     mortgage taken out at a typical 1972 interest rate of 7.5 \n     percent.\\4\\ The BLS procedure computes the weight for the \n     purchase price component from the 1972-73 consumer \n     expenditure survey based on purchases of newly constructed \n     houses; if every survey respondent had annual consumption \n     expenditures of $20,000, and 5 percent of them purchased a \n     new $40,000 house, this would yield a weight for a home \n     purchase of 10 percent. But that is not all. Fully half of \n     the mortgage payments over the 25 year term ($26,429, in this \n     case) is included as an additional expenditure, so that \n     mortgage interest costs receive a weight of 6.6 percent in \n     this example. A minimum requirement for consistency in the \n     CPI should be that the weight on housing reflects the amount \n     actually spent--$40,000 in this case. People do not buy \n     houses and mortgages separately; they obtain mortgages so \n     that they do not actually have to lay down $40,000 in cash!\n     \\4\\ This example is taken from the article by Alan Blinder \n     cited in the note to Table IV.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       2. Assumption of variable rates on all existing contracts. \n     The CPI does not describe the housing-cost experience of \n     actual U.S. homeowners but rather of a fictitious society in \n     which the interest rate on all outstanding mortgages is \n     renegotiated every month. Imagine that the average mortgage \n     lasts 10 years, and that the mortgage rate has risen in the \n     past decade from 5 to 15 percent at a pace of exactly one-\n     twelfth of a percentage point every month. Then the average \n     rate paid on outstanding contracts would be 10 percent. Now \n     imagine that on January 1, 1981, the rate on mortgage \n     closings suddenly jumps from 15 to 17 percent. The CPI uses \n     the mortgage closing rate for the first five days of the \n     previous month, and so in this example the mortgage \n     component of the February 1981 CPI would show an increase \n     of 13.3 percent. If all other items were increasing at an \n     average of 1 percent per month, or 12.7 percent per year, \n     this treatment of the mortgage interest rate would be \n     enough to cause scare headlines, since the annual rate of \n     increase of the all-items CPI in February would be 27.9 \n     percent. But in truth, since a single month is initially \n     involved and the average mortgage lasts for ten years, \n     less than one percent of total mortgage payments are \n     affected by the new rate. The average mortgage interest \n     rate paid would change from 10.0 to 10.1 percent, for an \n     increase of just one percent, exactly the same as the \n     assumed increase in all other items. Scare headlines would \n     be avoided, and the February announcement of the CPI would \n     report an annual rate of increase of 12.7 rather than 27.9 \n     percent.\n       3. Use of actual rather than real after-tax interest rate. \n     Does a higher mortgage interest rate actually raise the true \n     cost of borrowing, as assumed by the CPI? Not necessarily, \n     because borrowing cost consists of the actual interest rate \n     paid, less the percentage increase in the price of the item \n     purchased with the borrowed funds, less any tax deductions \n     for interest paid. Sensible home owners and business \n     borrowers know that a 15 percent interest rate is not a \n     suffocating burden if borrowing allows them to buy cheap now \n     and sell dear later. In fact it is easy to show how an \n     increase over a decade from a 5 to 15 percent mortgage rate \n     actually could have reduced real borrowing costs. Imagine \n     that over the same period the inflation increased from zero \n     to 10 percent, and that the income tax rate remained fixed at \n     20 percent. Since all interest paid (not just the net-of-\n     inflation part) is deductible, the real cost of borrowing can \n     decline if inflation is high enough.\n\n\n            The home-ownership blunder, and how to right it\n\n       There are no defenders of the present treatment of home \n     ownership costs in the CPI, which has remained essentially \n     unchanged since 1953.\\5\\ Yet year after year between 1977 and \n     1980 its damage grew as escalated union wages, government \n     transfer payments, and the government deficit were pushed up. \n     During the deliberations that led to the 1978 CPI revision, \n     there was unanimous staff support in BLS for killing the \n     present procedure. Yet the staff was overruled by the late \n     Julius Shiskin, then Commissioner, who wrote that ``I have \n     decided that the present treatment will be continued . . . \n     This decision is based on the fact that there is widespread \n     disagreement among the business, labor, and Government \n     advisers to the Bureau of Labor Statistics concerning the \n     approaches to the cost of shelter proposal by the Office of \n     Prices and Living Conditions.'' \\6\\ One interpretation of \n     this remark is that the last refuge of a bureaucrat faced \n     with controversy is to retain the status quo. Another \n     possibility is that the key word in Shiskin's letter is \n     ``labor,'' and that labor unions were unwilling to accept any \n     tampering with the CPI that might jeopardize the privileged \n     position that they had enjoyed during the 1973-74 high-\n     inflation period thanks to their CPI-escalated contracts. In \n     light of the fact that the Carter Administration bowed to \n     union pressure on the issue of the minimum wage, it is not \n     implausible that union pressure was behind Shiskin's \n     decision. In any case there is no doubt that labor unions \n     have been among the main beneficiaries of his vote for the \n     status quo.\n     \\5\\ In January 1981 the BLS announced that ``the much-\n     criticized home-purchase component of the consumer price \n     index will be deleted and will probably be replaced with an \n     estimate for rents'' (New York Times, January 29, 1981, p. \n     1). This announcement thus endorses the conclusion of this \n     section (written before the announcement) that the ``rental \n     equivalence'' method should have been used all along. \n     Unfortunately, the change will not be made until 1985, so \n     this section of the text remains relevant for the first half \n     of this decade.\n     \\6\\ Letter from Julius Shiskin to Lyle Gramley of the Council \n     of Economic Advisers, April 15, 1977.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The two main candidates suggested by economists to replace \n     the present treatment are the same as those proposed by the \n     BLS staff during the 1972-77 deliberations on the CPI \n     revision--the ``user cost'' and ``rental equivalence'' \n     approaches. In fact, in an end run around its own index, the \n     BLS now publishes five alternative versions of the CPI using \n     different measures of home ownership cost. Of the five \n     alternatives, four represent different ways of treating user-\n     cost, and the fifth is based on the rental equivalence \n     method. (It is the fifth alternative that is displayed on \n     line 4 of Table IV.)\n       1. The user-cost of housing. Economists love to dazzle \n     their students with ``user cost'' formulas of the type \n     developed in the early 1960's by Harvard's Dale Jorgenson for \n     the purpose of explaining business investment behavior. The \n     aim is to come up with a figure to represent the amount for \n     which a capital good could be rented. Unlike the present CPI \n     approach, which is based on the current price paid for new \n     houses by the small fraction of people who actually purchase \n     them in a given year, the user-cost approach measures the \n     current annual capital and operating cost of home ownership \n     for everyone. User-cost formulas typically sum up the annual \n     mortgage interest costs, plus the interest that would have \n     been earned on the down payment if it had been invested in \n     a financial asset, plus operating costs like taxes, \n     insurance, and repairs, minus capital gains due to higher \n     house prices, and minus tax deductions made possible by \n     the payment of mortgage interest.\n       The basic problem with the user-cost approach is that there \n     are several alternative ways of measuring the ingredients in \n     the formula, especially interest rates, tax rates, and \n     capital gains. Are capital gains to be \n\n[[Page S 15451]]\n     counted as those expected when the mortgage was taken out or those \n     actually realized? Is the mortgage interest rate to be the \n     current rate or an average of past rates? How is the personal \n     tax rate relevant for mortgage interest deductions to be \n     determined? The BLS provides four different measures of user \n     cost to provide a menu of outcomes, and all of them display \n     much more volatility than actual rent. If an economist's \n     approximation of how much a house should rent for does not \n     behave at all like actual observed rents, then that ought to \n     be telling him something.\n       2. Rental equivalence. The idea of rental equivalence is \n     simple and in fact is already used in the PCE deflator: \n     Simply assume that the costs of home ownership moves in \n     proportion to actual rents as measured by the CPI rent index, \n     and apply a weight based on the estimated rental value of \n     owner-occupied homes. Residential rent has increased more \n     slowly than the average for other CPI items, and much more \n     slowly than the present CPI home ownership component. \n     Objections to the rental equivalence approach center around \n     the fact that most single-family homes are not rented, and so \n     the rental information collected by the CPI may not reflect \n     hypothetical rents of single-family homes. Nevertheless \n     landlords face the same interest costs as home owners and \n     enjoy roughly the same tax deductions and capital gains. The \n     fact that actual rents exhibit more gradual changes than \n     hypothetical user-cost measures does not necessarily imply an \n     error but rather reflects the tendency for prices of physical \n     goods and services to adjust more slowly to changing \n     conditions than prices of financial assets. Just as a \n     company's stock price typically jumps around much more than \n     the prices of the things it sells, so housing prices and \n     interest rates jump around more than the rental value of \n     houses. This makes sense in the case of rent, since changes \n     in current mortgage interest rates do not actually affect \n     landlords who have long-term fixed-rate mortgages, and \n     changes in current capital gains have no impact (except on \n     paper wealth) if the building is going to be held over a long \n     period rather than sold at today's price.\n       Since the rental equivalence method is appealing, why not \n     just adopt it? Use of rent data for the CPI home ownership \n     component would justify expanding the sample of rent \n     information to include more single-family houses. I suspect \n     that much of the resistance to the rent approach stems from a \n     belief that rent data are tainted, since rents have been \n     rising so much less rapidly than the cost of construction (95 \n     percent vs. 192 percent, respectively, between 1967 and \n     1980). But there is an economic reason for this divergence. \n     My parents recall renting a house in Berkeley, California, in \n     1938 for $65 per month that was also for sale at the same \n     time for $7,500. The house now would sell for $250,000 but \n     could not rent for $2,167 a month (an equivalent percentage \n     of sale price). In fact, a rent below $1,000 would be typical \n     for the kind of house in the current Berkeley rental market. \n     Why? Landlords and home owners renting out their homes no \n     longer have to recoup all of their cash mortgage interest and \n     operating expenses from rent, since likely taxed capital \n     gains and tax deductions on mortgage interest now pay part of \n     the bill. Thus the slow increase in rents is not a fiction, \n     but reflects economic reality.\n\n\n                    Accounting for changing quality\n\n       Up to this point all of the issues have involved \n     differences between the CPI and PCE deflator. But now we turn \n     to the question of the changing quality of products, where \n     both indexes are on the same footing because they use the \n     same underlying price figures obtained by the BLS data \n     collectors. When a new model of a product is introduced that \n     contains one or more extra features, part of its higher price \n     may be explained by its higher quality. The gradual \n     acquisition of higher quality goods has been an important \n     source of a rising standard of living for Americans, and so \n     we must make sure that adequate adjustments are made for the \n     fraction of price increases that actually represent higher \n     quality.\n       Quality change poses a problem for the CPI, which attempts \n     to measure changes in the price of goods and services in a \n     fixed market basket. The apparently straightforward task of \n     collecting information on the price of a fixed set of goods \n     is continually complicated by the fact that some goods go out \n     of existence to be replaced by new models or new products. \n     The issue of quality adjustments involves precisely how and \n     when the new models are introduced into the overall index.\n       Over its history the CPI market basket has continually \n     changed, providing an interesting--though usually out-of-\n     date--commentary on social history. From 1918 to 1940, the \n     CPI index that covered shaving was the price of a barber \n     shave, and then switched in 1940 to the safety-razor \n     blade, despite the fact that safety razors had largely \n     replaced other barber shaves in the 1920's. From 1940 to \n     1952 the index item was the blade, joined from 1952 to \n     1964 by shaving cream, followed from 1964 to 1977 by the \n     shaving cream alone, followed since 1977 by a combination \n     of dental and shaving toiletry products. Since 1964 there \n     has been no blade in the CPI, and thus no consideration of \n     the new world opened up for most men by the invention of \n     the double-edged blade in the early 1970's.\n       Other products have come and gone as well. In 1940 the \n     index dropped not only barbershop shaves, but also high \n     button shoes, men's nightshirts, and girls' cotton bloomers. \n     The 1953 revision eliminated salt pork and laundry bar soap \n     but added televisions, frozen foods, Coca-Cola, and whiskey. \n     Pajamas, which had replaced nightshirts in 1940, themselves \n     disappeared in 1964, leaving only sheets and blankets to \n     cover the sleeping American male. Appendectomies also \n     disappeared in 1964, the year funeral services were added. \n     Among the new product categories introduced in the 1978 \n     revision were pet supplies and expenses, indoor sports \n     equipment, tranquilizers, and electronic pocket calculators.\n       How are new models and products introduced into the CPI? \n     There are three main methods.\n       1. Direct comparison. When a quality change is considered \n     to be ``small,'' in the judgment of BLS staff members, it is \n     neglected. All of the observed price change would be recorded \n     as a change in the CPI item index, with no adjustment for \n     quality change. If we assume that most model change-overs \n     involve quality improvements, the direct comparison method \n     imparts an upward bias to the CPI--that is, causes it to \n     register too much inflation.\n       2. Linking. When the BLS staff members assess the quality \n     change as too important to be ignored, then they introduce a \n     linking procedure. This effectively imputes to the product \n     whose quality changed the price movement of similar goods \n     whose quality did not change. Let us imagine that an old-\n     fashioned cotton sheet selling for $5.00 is replaced by a \n     polyester permanent press sheet selling for $8.00 which lasts \n     twice as long. The CPI linking procedure pays no attention to \n     increased durability, but simply replaces the observed price \n     increase by the actual price increase of other unchanged \n     items in the same ``household linens category.''\n       3. Cost data. In some cases the BLS obtains the cost of the \n     quality change directly from the manufacturer. First, staff \n     members must determine whether a change claimed by the \n     manufacturer to improve quality actually does so. The \n     criterion for the judgment is whether the change improves the \n     value of the product for the user. (Several years ago the BLS \n     would not include a change by an auto manufacturer from a \n     dial to digital clock on the grounds that this change did not \n     increase the ``user value'' of the automobile.) The value of \n     those quality changes that are not disallowed is based on the \n     manufacturer's estimate of the extra cost involved in making \n     the higher-quality item. This procedure is obviously subject \n     to the flaw that the manufacturer may overstate the cost of \n     the quality improvement in order to disguise a portion of \n     actual price increases, particularly in a period in which \n     government price controls or guidelines are attempting to \n     hold a lid on prices. This source of error would tend to bias \n     the CPI downward and cause it to register too little \n     inflation.\n       The automobile is the only product which is given the full-\n     blown cost-adjustment treatment. Every September several BLS \n     officials travel to Detroit to consult with the major \n     manufacturers in order to identify those specification \n     changes on new models for which adjustments must be made. If \n     a producer has introduced a new, heavier bumper, whether on \n     its own initiative or to comply with federal safety \n     regulations, the firm is asked to supply an estimate of the \n     difference in the cost of producing the new bumper as \n     compared to the old bumper. This difference in cost is then \n     subtracted from the reported price increase of the new model \n     automobile.\n       Because the BLS devotes so much more attention to \n     automobiles than to other products, there is a chance that \n     the recorded differences between the inflation rates \n     registered by autos and other products may reflect differing \n     quality-adjustment procedures rather than a true difference \n     in price behavior. For instance, between 1972 and 1978 the \n     measured price of automobiles went up 27 percent, but the \n     price indexes for other types of moving mechanical equipment \n     like tractors and construction machinery (part of the \n     Producers' Price Index compiled by the BLS) increased by \n     about 80 percent.\n\n\n             product price cycles and increased performance\n\n       The typical product, whether automobiles in the 1920's, TV \n     sets in the 1950's, or electronic calculators in the 1970's, \n     experiences after its invention an initial period of \n     declining price, as its manufacturers spread the fixed cost \n     of its development over more and more units sold. Then, as \n     a product becomes ``mature,'' there is less opportunity \n     for efficiency gains to cancel out increased wages and \n     other costs, so prices begin to rise. Three aspects of CPI \n     procedures cause it to understate quality improvements and \n     to overstate price change. First, the use of obsolete \n     weights from decade-old expenditure surveys tends to place \n     too little weight on modern products where price increases \n     are relatively slow--this ``consumer substitution'' \n     problem was examined above. Second, new models and \n     products are typically introduced into the index much \n     later than the date when their sales volume becomes \n     important. And finally, the linking procedure, by far the \n     most common quality-adjustment technique used by the BLS, \n     tends both to treat new products as if they were mature \n     products and to ignore performance improvements.\n       The long intervals between CPI revisions, and the \n     officially sanctioned tendency for data collectors to cling \n     to existing models \n\n[[Page S 15452]]\n     until they disappear from the marketplace, imply that items with \n     declining prices are typically absent from the index. Albert \n     Rees, who in 1960 performed a fascinating comparison of BLS \n     item indexes with price data for the same products from mail-\n     order catalogues, recalls with amusement a visit with a store \n     owner to identify the particular model cooking pot that was \n     then being priced by a BLS field representative. ``Oh, you \n     mean this old model up here on the top shelf. We never sell \n     these any more,'' answered the store owner, ``but that BLS \n     field representative keeps asking us for its price.''\n       More important are the new products that enter the CPI late \n     in the product price cycle. The United States became a \n     motorized society in the 1920's and 1930's, when there was an \n     enormous improvement in the performance of automobiles along \n     with a decline in their price--but the automobile was not \n     included in the CPI until 1940. Penicillin entered the CPI in \n     1951, after it had already experienced a 99 percent decline \n     from its initial price. The pocket calculator entered the CPI \n     in 1978, after it had declined in price about 90 percent from \n     early 1970-71 models and about 98 percent from the price of a \n     comparable electromechanical desk calculator of the 1960's.\n       The linking procedure misses quality improvements for two \n     reasons. First, as in the cotton sheet example, the price \n     change is taken to be identical to other items in the sample \n     product group that remain unchanged in quality. But these are \n     likely to be mature products experiencing price increases, \n     whereas the item that is improved in quality is more likely \n     to be in the early stage of its product cycle. Perhaps more \n     important, the CPI ignores changes in performance that \n     tend to accompany model changes. In the cotton sheet \n     example, the new sheet lasts twice as long. Since \n     consumers presumably are buying years of service from \n     long-lasting items like sheets, the CPI treatment ignores \n     the lower price of a ``sheet-year,'' since the service \n     life in the example is assumed to double while the price \n     only increases by 60 percent. (It is a sign of the times \n     that many goods like sheets and draperies are officially \n     classified as ``nondurable'' yet actually last longer than \n     many ``durable'' goods.)\n       The most striking fact about the treatment of quality \n     change in the CPI is that it is inconsistent with its own \n     stated objective, which is to adjust for changes in quality \n     when they improve the value of a product to the user. In the \n     sheet example and in many others there is no attempt to \n     measure the change in product performance. Consumers value \n     sheet-years, motor-oil-miles, and tire-miles, rather than \n     sheets, quarts of motor oil, and tires independent of their \n     durability. F. Lee Moore has calculated that between 1935 and \n     1978 the price of tires per mile of tire-life declined by 9 \n     percent, in contrast to an increase in the CPI tire index of \n     140 percent. Over the same period, the price of motor oil per \n     mile declined by 52 percent as compared to an increase in the \n     CPI of 234 percent.\\7\\ There are other examples of improved \n     performance that are missed by the CPI's attention to ``price \n     per item'' instead of ``price per service desired by the \n     user.'' Among these are the increased service life of light \n     bulbs, spark plugs, and appliances.\n     \\7\\ F. Lee Moore, ``Index Mischief: Price versus Cost,'' \n     Electric Perspectives, 1978, no. 5, pp. 8-27.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Our previous discussion of the user cost of housing can be \n     applied more broadly to any good which lasts a significant \n     length of time. Consumers care about the total annual \n     operating costs of automobiles and appliances having a given \n     level of performance, not purchase price alone. Auto \n     manufacturers have diverted development efforts from the old \n     concentration on styling and tailfins to a new obsession with \n     increased fuel efficiency. Yet there is no procedure in the \n     CPI to adjust for improvements in automobile fuel \n     efficiency.\\8\\ A lab at M.I.T. several years ago studied the \n     repair records of appliances and found that the frequency of \n     refrigerator repairs had dropped by a factor of two, and TV \n     repairs by a factor of four, between the mid 1950's and early \n     1970's.\n     \\8\\ In the case of automobiles the BLS has measured the price \n     change on new downsized models as equal to models that are \n     unchanged in size. This is the correct procedure if the fuel \n     savings on the new models just balance the consumer value of \n     the loss in comfort and performance, but not otherwise.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In a study that makes al lowances for improved electricity \n     efficiency and other characteristics, I have estimated \n     that the quality-adjusted prices of refrigerators, washing \n     machines, and air conditioners declined at about twice the \n     rate registered by the CPI between 1950 and the mid \n     1960's.\n       Performance improvements are not just limited to goods, but \n     also extend to services. That vanishing breed, the domestic \n     household worker, now accomplishes more per hour with modern \n     appliances and fabrics than her 1925 counterpart, yet her \n     ``price'' is a straight hourly wage. The apparently \n     outrageous increases in hospital room charges exhibited in \n     Table II disguise improvements in the quality of medical care \n     provided to the typical patient, and today's guest at a \n     Holiday Inn or other medium-priced hotel enjoys telephone and \n     television service that was unavailable to his luxury-hotel \n     counterpart of 50 years ago. An airline passenger mile is a \n     more comfortable, faster, and safer, commodity than it was in \n     1955, and yet the CPI prices a homogeneous passenger mile. \n     There is no doubt that train service has deteriorated, but \n     this is of minor importance in an index that keeps its weight \n     up to date.\n       Of all products in the U.S. economy, the one displaying the \n     faster rate of price decline throughout the entire postwar \n     era has been the electronic computer. Yet the U.S. government \n     does not compile a price index for computers, so that the \n     output and productivity gains achieved by companies like IBM \n     and the office machinery industry as a whole are not captured \n     by aggregate indexes of output and productivity. This does \n     not involve the CPI directly, because until recently few \n     computers were sold directly to consumers. Government \n     officials are quick to admit that IBM's output and \n     productivity achievements are missed in official data in the \n     year the computers are manufactured, but they claim that the \n     higher efficiency made possible by computers is accurately \n     captured when they are used in subsequent years in the \n     production of consumer goods. This position is partly true, \n     since the use of computers to replace workers in consumer-\n     goods factories has contributed to measured productivity \n     advances.\n       Yet for a wide variety of consumer services the CPI is not \n     capturing the improvements that the computer has provided. On \n     many airlines computers make possible pre-reserved seats and \n     one-stop check-in, and airline managements were willing to \n     invest in computerized equipment in the belief that consumers \n     should value the extra services provided. Yet the CPI does \n     not value the extra services, treats an airline passenger-\n     mile as an unchanged commodity, and leaves the impression in \n     our national data that the investment in the extra computer \n     has produced nothing. The same point applies to 24-hour \n     money machines provided on street corners by banks, and \n     other financial services. It is doubtful that the world-\n     wide convenience made possible by major credit cards would \n     have occurred without the computer, yet the CPI ignores \n     the saving of time and fees by consumers who no longer \n     have to purchase so many travelers checks and letters of \n     credit.\n       Even the much-criticized U.S. government has been a source \n     of an unmeasured improvement in our standard of living. For \n     25 years we paid an increased gasoline excise tax, treated by \n     the CPI as an increase in the price of gasoline, in order to \n     finance construction of the interstate highway system. \n     Automobile travel is now faster and safer, but this \n     government activity is treated as having only costs, with no \n     benefits.\n       The interstate highway example is interesting because it \n     conflicts with a controversial decision that treats anti-\n     pollution and safety devices on automobiles in the CPI as an \n     increase in quality rather than an increase in price. \n     Government environmental and safety legislation is treated as \n     having wisely balanced the cost of the devices against the \n     benefits received by the nation as a whole in reduced \n     pollution and greater safety, in contrast to the interstate \n     highway case where benefits are ignored. If government \n     regulatory efforts, like most economic activities, are \n     subject to increasing costs and diminishing benefits as more \n     and more of the pollution is eliminated, then the CPI \n     treatment may have been conservative a decade ago, in the \n     early stages of regulation, but overly generous recently. The \n     growing consensus that many recent government regulations do \n     not provide benefits to balance their costs would imply that, \n     at least for this one reason, the Consumer Price Index \n     understates inflation.\n       As we plunge further into the murky depths of index-making, \n     at some point we leave the realm of the statistician and \n     enter the realm of the philosopher. Where do we draw the line \n     between a new model of an old product and an entirely new \n     product? The CPI states that the price of admission to movies \n     increased 330 percent between 1948 and 1978. Yet the \n     invention of television allowed the price of two hours of \n     movie-like entertainment to decline substantially, even if we \n     cancel out the agony of commercials against the saving in \n     baby sitters, parking fees, and transportation expenses. A \n     long list of such broadly conceived substitutions could be \n     complied--permanent press clothing for commercial laundries, \n     phone for mail, appliance for domestic servants.\n\n\n                             A better index\n\n       The CPI is a severely flawed index, as shown both by our \n     comparison with the PCE deflator and our examination of the \n     pervasive nature of unmeasured quality change. Yet it is \n     striking that the BLS spent $50 million during 1972-77 to \n     revise the CPI without curing any of its major defects. In a \n     six-month overlap period in early 1978, the expensively \n     revised ``new CPI'' registered an increase that differed from \n     the ``old CPI'' by only 0.1 percentage point.\n       It seems clear in retrospect that the BLS spent its \n     revision money on the wrong things, improving the number of \n     outlets covered or the number of consumers surveyed rather \n     than investing money in more rent data on single-family homes \n     or on performance data for newly introduced models and \n     products. What the CPI needs, in addition to the use of more \n     up-to-date weights and a rental equivalence approach to the \n     measurement of home ownership costs, is a vastly improved \n     effort to measure the improved performance and efficiency of \n     consumer goods and services, as well as the occasional \n     decline in product quality. Much can be done with existing \n     performance and efficiency data available from the published \n     test reports of Consumers Union and other organizations, and \n     in selective cases the BLS could \n\n[[Page S 15453]]\n     institute its own testing program or contract for tests from private \n     organizations.\n       It is now 20 years since a committee headed by George \n     Stigler recommended many of the same improvements in the CPI. \n     It is discouraging that so little has been done by so many \n     for so long. BLS officials tend to reject suggestions for a \n     more imaginative approach to quality measurement as too \n     ``subjective,'' when what is needed is a more frequent \n     application of simple common sense. In the now-classic words \n     of Martin Bronfenbrenner, addressed to the Stigler Committee \n     in 1960, ``it is better to be imprecisely right than \n     precisely wrong.'' And in an era in which each change in the \n     CPI sets off a wave of redistributional adjustments, that \n     observation is precisely right.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Understanding the Consumer Price Index: Answers to Some Questions\n\n\n                                preface\n\n       The continually growing uses and users of the Consumer \n     Price Index (CPI) have generated an increasing number of \n     questions about the CPI. Although the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics (BLS) has provided extensive material to the \n     public describing the CPI since its 1987 revision, much of \n     this material has been quite technical. BLS has developed \n     this pamphlet, therefore, to (1) answer frequently asked \n     questions about the CPI, (2) familiarize users of the CPI \n     with some of the most important of the new procedures \n     introduced with the 1987 CPI Revision, and (3) help users of \n     the CPI better understand and use it.\n       Material in this publication is in the public domain and, \n     with the appropriate credit, may be reproduced without \n     permission.\n       Information in this publication will be made available to \n     sensory impaired individuals upon request.

The CPI provides a way for consumers to compare what the \n     market basket of goods and services costs this month with \n     what the same market basket cost a month or a year ago.\n\n\n                          how is the cpi used?\n\n       The Consumer Price Index affects nearly all Americans \n     because of the many ways it is used. Three major uses are:\n       As an economic indicator: The CPI is the most widely used \n     measure of inflation and is sometimes viewed as an indicator \n     of the effectiveness of government economic policy. It \n     provides information about price changes in the Nation's \n     economy to government, business, labor, and other private \n     citizens and is used by them as a guide to making economic \n     decisions. In addition, the President, Congress, and the \n     Federal Reserve Board use trends in the CPI to aid in \n     formulating fiscal and monetary policies.\n       As a deflator of other economic series: The CPI and its \n     components are used to adjust other economic series for price \n     changes and to translate these series into inflation-free \n     dollars. Examples of series adjusted by the CPI include \n     retail sales, hourly and weekly earnings, and components of \n     the national income and product accounts.\n       An interesting example of this is the use of the CPI as a \n     deflator of the value of the consumer's dollar to find its \n     purchasing power. The purchasing power of the consumer's \n     dollar measures the change in the quantity of goods and \n     services a dollar will buy at different dates. In other \n     words, as prices increase, the purchasing power of the \n     consumer's dollar declines.\n       As a means of adjusting dollar values: As inflation erodes \n     consumers' purchasing power, the CPI is often used to adjust \n     consumers' income payments, for example, Social Security; to \n     adjust income eligibility levels for government assistance; \n     and to automatically provide cost-off-living wage adjustments \n     to millions of American workers.\n       The CPI affects the income of almost 70 million persons as \n     a result of statutory action: 43.1 million Social Security \n     beneficiaries, about 22.6 million food stamp recipients, and \n     about 3.9 million military and Federal Civil Service retirees \n     and survivors. Changes in the CPI also affect the cost of \n     lunches for 24.2 million children who eat lunch at school, \n     while collective bargaining agreements that tie wages to the \n     CPI cover about 2.8 million workers.\n       Another example of how dollar values may be adjusted is the \n     use of the CPI to adjust the Federal income tax structure. \n     These adjustments prevent inflation-induced increases in tax \n     rates, an effect called ``bracket creep.''\n\n\n                   is the cpi a cost-of-living index?\n\n       No, although it frequently and mistakenly is called a cost-\n     of-living index. The CPI is an index of price change only. It \n     does not reflect the changes in buying or consumption \n     patterns that consumers probably would make to adjust to \n     relative price changes. For example, if the price of beef \n     increases more rapidly than other meats, shoppers may \n     shift their purchases away from beef to pork, poultry, or \n     fish. If the charges for household energy increase more \n     rapidly than for other items, households may buy more \n     insulation and consume less fuel. The CPI does not reflect \n     this substitution among items as a cost-of-living index \n     would. Rather, the CPI assumes the purchase of the same \n     market basket, in the same fixed proportion (or weight) \n     month after month. About every 10 years the market basket \n     is thoroughly updated to allow for the introduction of new \n     products and services and to reflect more current spending \n     patterns. (See question 6.) In addition, the CPI does not \n     reflect taxes that are not directly associated with the \n     purchase of specific goods and services. In other words, \n     the CPI excludes taxes such as income and Social Security \n     taxes.\n       It is important to note that local area CPI's cannot be \n     used to compare levels of living costs or prices between \n     areas. (See answer to question 17: ``Can the CPI's for \n     individual areas be used to compare living costs among the \n     areas?'')\n\n\n               Whose buying habits does the CPI reflect?\n\n       The CPI reflects spending patterns for each of two \n     population groups: All urban Consumers (CPI-U) and Urban Wage \n     Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-U represents \n     about 80 percent of the total U.S. population. It is based on \n     the expenditures reported by almost all urban residents, \n     including professional employees, the self-employed, the \n     poor, the unemployed, and retired persons as well as urban \n     wage earners and clerical workers. Not included in the index \n     are the spending patterns of persons living outside urban \n     areas, farm families, persons in the Armed Forces, and those \n     in institutions (such as prisons and mental hospitals).\n       The CPI-W is based on the expenditures of urban households \n     that meet additional requirements: More than one-half of the \n     household's income must come from clerical or wage \n     occupations and at least one of the household's earners must \n     have been employed for at least 37 weeks during the previous \n     12 months. The CPI-W's population represents about 32 percent \n     of the total U.S. population and is a subset, or part, of the \n     CPI-U's populations.\n\n\n         Does the CPI measure my experience with price change?\n\n       Not necessarily. It is important to understand that BLS \n     bases the market baskets and pricing procedures for the CPI-U \n     and CPI-W on the experience of the relevant average \n     household, not on any specific family or individual. It is \n     unlikely that your experience will correspond precisely with \n     either the national indexes or those for specific cities or \n     regions.\n       For example, if you or your family spend a larger than \n     average share of your budget on medical expenses, and medical \n     care costs are increasing more rapidly than other items in \n     the CPI market basket, your personal rate of inflation (or \n     experience with price change) may exceed the CPI. Conversely, \n     if you heat your home with solar energy, and fuel prices are \n     rising more rapidly than other items, you may experience less \n     inflation than the general population.\n       This phenomenon explains why people sometimes question the \n     accuracy of the published indexes. A national average \n     reflects all the ups and downs of millions of individual \n     price experiences. It seldom mirrors a particular consumer's \n     experience.\n\n\n                  How is the CPI market basket chosen?\n\n       The CPI market basket is developed from detailed \n     expenditure information provided by families and \n     individuals on what they actually bought. For the current \n     CPI, this information was collected from the Consumer \n     Expenditure Survey over the 3 years 1982, 1983, and 1984. \n     In each of the 3 years, about 4,800 families, from around \n     the country, provided information on their spending habits \n     in a series of quarterly interviews. To collect \n     information on frequently purchased items, such as food \n     and personal care products, another 4,800 families in each \n     of the 3 years kept diaries listing everything they bought \n     during a 2-week period.\n       Altogether, about 29,000 individuals and families provided \n     expenditure information for use in determining the \n     importance, or weight, of each item in the index structure.\n       Due to time constraints, we used data from only the first 2 \n     years of the Consumer Expenditure Survey to select the items \n     to be priced. In addition, we update the sample of stores and \n     service outlets in roughly 20 percent of the urban areas \n     priced for the CPI each year. New items are introduced with \n     these new samples.\n\n\n              what goods and services does the cpi cover?\n\n       The CPI represents all goods and services purchased for \n     consumption by urban households. We have classified all \n     expenditure items into over 200 categories, arranged into 7 \n     major groups. Major groups and examples of categories in each \n     are as follows:\n       Food and beverages (cookies, cereals, cheese, coffee, \n     chicken, beer and ale, restaurant meals); housing \n     (residential rent, homeowners' costs, fuel oil, soaps and \n     detergents, televisions, local telephone service); apparel \n     and its upkeep (men's shirts, women's dresses, jewelry); \n     transportation (airline fares, new and used cars, gasoline, \n     car insurance); medical care (prescription drugs, eye care, \n     physicians' services, hospital rooms); entertainment \n     (newspapers, toys, musical instruments, admissions); and \n     other goods and services (haircuts, college tuition, bank \n     fees).\n       In addition, the CPI includes various user fees such as \n     water and sewerage charges, auto registration fees, vehicle \n     tolls, and so forth. Taxes that are directly associated with \n     the prices or specific goods and services (such as sales and \n     excise taxes) are also included. But, the CPI excludes taxes \n     not directly associated with the purchase of \n\n[[Page S 15454]]\n     consumer goods and services (such as income and Social Security taxes).\n       The CPI does not include investment items (such as stocks, \n     bonds, real estate, and life insurance). These items relate \n     to savings and not day-to-day living expenses.\n       For each of the over 200 item categories, the Bureau has \n     chosen samples of several hundred specific items within \n     selected business establishments, using scientific \n     statistical procedures, to represent the thousands of \n     varieties available in the marketplace. For example, in a \n     given supermarket, the Bureau may choose a plastic bag of \n     golden delicious apples, U.S. extra fancy grade, weighing 4.4 \n     pounds to represent the ``Apples'' category.\n\n\n               how are cpi prices collected and reviewed?\n\n       Each month, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) field \n     representatives visit or call thousands of retail stores, \n     service establishments, rental units, and doctors' offices, \n     all over the United States to obtain price information on \n     thousands of items in the CPI market basket. For the entire \n     month they record the prices of about 90,000 items. These \n     90,000 prices represent a scientifically-selected sample of \n     the prices of goods and services sold to urban consumers \n     throughout the country.\n       During each call or visit, the field representative \n     collects price data on a specific good or service that was \n     precisely defined during an earlier visit. If the selected \n     item is available, the field representative records its \n     price. If the selected item is no longer available or if \n     there have been changes in the quality or quantity (for \n     example, eggs sold in packages of 8 when previously they had \n     been sold by the dozen) of the good or service since the last \n     time prices had been collected, the field representative \n     selects a new item or records the quality change in the \n     current item.\n       The recorded information is sent to the national office of \n     BLS where commodity specialists who have detailed knowledge \n     about the particular goods or services priced, review the \n     data. The specialists check the data for accuracy and \n     consistency and make any necessary corrections or \n     adjustments. These can range from an adjustment for a change \n     in the size or quantity of a packaged item to more complex \n     adjustments based upon statistical analysis of the value of \n     an item's features or quality. Thus, the commodity \n     specialists strive to keep changes in the quality of items \n     from affecting the CPI's measurement of price change.\n\n\n                       how is the cpi calculated?\n\n       The CPI is a product of a series of interrelated samples. \n     First, using data from the 1980 Census of Population, BLS \n     selects the urban areas from which prices are to be collected \n     and chooses the housing units within each area that are \n     eligible for use in the shelter component of the CPI. The \n     Census of Population also provides the data which allows the \n     assigning of the number of consumers represented by each area \n     priced for the CPI. Next, another sample of about 24,000 \n     families serves as the basis for a Point-of-Purchase survey \n     that identifies the places where households purchase various \n     types of goods and services.\n       Data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted from \n     1982 through 1984, involving a national sample of almost \n     29,000 families, provided detailed information on their \n     spending habits. This enabled BLS to construct the CPI market \n     basket of goods and services and to assign each item in the \n     market basket a weight or importance based on total family \n     expenditures. The final stage in the sampling process is the \n     selection of the specific detailed item to be priced in each \n     outlet. This is done using a method called \n     ``disaggregation.'' For example, BLS field representatives \n     may be directed to price ``fresh whole milk.'' Through the \n     disaggregation process, the field representative selects the \n     specific kind of fresh whole milk that will be priced over \n     time in the outlet. By this process, each kind of whole milk \n     is assigned a probability, or weight, based on the quantity \n     of it the store sells. If, for example, Vitamin D, \n     homogenized milk in half-gallon containers makes up 70 \n     percent of the sales of fresh whole milk, and the same milk \n     in quart containers accounts for 10 percent of all whole milk \n     sales, then the half-gallon container will be seven times \n     more likely to be chosen than the quart container. After \n     probabilities are assigned, one kind of milk is chosen by \n     an objective selection process based on the theory of \n     random sampling. The particular kind of milk that is \n     selected by disaggregation will continue to be priced each \n     month in the outlet.\n       To sum up, the price movement measurement (see question 8) \n     is weighted by the importance of the item in the spending \n     patterns of the appropriate population group. The combination \n     of all these factors gives a weighted measurement of price \n     change for all the items in all the outlets, in all the areas \n     priced for the CPI.\n\n\n                  how do i read or interpret an index?\n\n       An index is a tool that simplifies the measurement of \n     movements in a numerical series. Most of the specific CPI \n     indexes have a 1982-84 reference base. That is, we set the \n     average index level (representing the average price level)--\n     for the 36-month period covering the years 1982, 1983, and \n     1984--equal to 100. We measure changes in relation to that \n     figure. An index of 110, for example, means there has been a \n     10-percent increase in price since the base period; similarly \n     an index of 90 means a 10-percent decrease. Movements of the \n     index from one date to another can be expressed as changes in \n     index points (simply, the difference between index levels), \n     but it is more useful to express the movements as percent \n     changes. This is because index points are affected by the \n     level of the index in relation to its base period, while \n     percent changes are not.\n       In the following table, item A increased by half as many \n     index points as item B. Yet, because of the different \n     starting figures, both had the same percent change; that is, \n     prices advanced at the same rate. On the other hand, items B \n     and C show the same change in index points, but the percent \n     change is much greater for item C because of its lower \n     starting value.\n       We usually update reference base periods every 10 years or \n     so to make it easier for people to relate changes in the CPI \n     to other economic and cultural changes. We chose the 1982-84 \n     period because it coincided with the time period of the CPI's \n     expenditure weights.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Item A    Item B    Item C \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYear I....................................     112.5     225.0     110.0\nYear II...................................     121.5     243.0     128.0\nChange in index points....................       9.0      18.0      18.0\nPercent change............................

The CPI measures inflation as \n     experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses; \n     the Producer Price Index (PPI) captures it at earlier stages \n     of the production and marketing process; the Employment Cost \n     Index (ECI) measures it in the labor market; the BLS' \n     International Price Program measures it for imports and \n     exports; and the Gross Domestic Product Deflator (GDP-\n     Deflator) measures combine the experience with inflation of \n     governments (Federal, State and local), businesses, and \n     consumers. Finally, there are more specialized measures, such \n     as measures of interest rates and measures of consumers' \n     and business executives' expectations.\n       The ``best'' measure of inflation for a given application \n     depends on the intended use of the data. The CPI is generally \n     the best measure for adjusting payments to consumers when the \n     intent is to allow them to purchase, at today's prices, the \n     same market basket of consumer goods and services that they \n     could purchase in an earlier reference period. It is also the \n     best measure to use to translate retail sales and hourly or \n     weekly earnings into real or inflation-free dollars.\n\n\n       which index is the ``official cpi'' reported in the media?\n\n       Each month, BLS releases thousands of detailed CPI numbers \n     to the press. However the press generally focuses on the \n     broadest, most comprehensive CPI. This is known as ``the \n     Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the \n     U.S. City Average for all Items, 1982-84 = 100.'' Often, the \n     media will report some or all of the following:\n       a. the index level (for example, July 1992 = 140.5)\n       b. the 12-month percent change (for example, July 1991 to \n     July 1992 = 3.2 percent).\n       c. the 1-month percent change on a seasonally adjusted \n     basis (for example, from June 1992 to July 1992 = 0.1 \n     percent).\n       d. the annual rate of percent change so far this year (for \n     example, from December 1991 to July 1992 if the rate of \n     increase over the first 7 months of the year continued for \n     the full year, after the removal of seasonal influences, the \n     rise would be 2.9 percent).\n       e. the annual rate based on the latest seasonally adjusted \n     1-month change. For example, if the June 1992 to July 1992 \n     rate continued for a full 12 months, the rise, compounded, \n     would be 1.7 percent.\n\n\n                what index should i use for escalation?\n\n       The decision to employ an escalation mechanism, as well as \n     the choice of the most suitable index, is up to the user. \n     When drafting the terms of an escalation provision for use in \n     a contract to adjust future payments, both legal and \n     statistical questions can arise. While BLS cannot help in any \n     matters relating to legal questions, it does provide basic \n     technical and statistical assistance to users who are \n     developing indexing procedures.\n       Some examples of technical or statistical guidelines from \n     BLS follow:\n       BLS strongly recommends using indexes unadjusted for \n     seasonal variation (i.e., not seasonally adjusted indexes) \n     for escalation. (See answer to question 14 for a further \n     explanation of seasonally adjusted indexes and why we do not \n     recommend seasonally adjusted indexes for use in escalation.)\n       BLS recommends using national or regional indexes for \n     escalation due to the volatility of the local indexes. (See \n     answer to question 15 for an explanation of this point).\n       If you have further questions, the Bureau has prepared a \n     detailed report, Using the Consumer Price Index for \n     Escalation. For copies write or call the nearest BLS regional \n     office listed at the end of this report, or call (202)--606-\n     7000.\n\n\n              When should I use seasonally adjusted data?\n\n       By using seasonally adjusted data, economic analysts and \n     the media find it easier \n\n[[Page S 15455]]\n     to see the underlying trend in short-term price change. It is often \n     difficult to tell from raw (unadjusted) statistics whether \n     developments between any 2 months reflect changing economic \n     conditions or only normal seasonal patterns. Therefore, many \n     economic series, including the CPI, are seasonally adjusted \n     to remove the effect of seasonal influences on the changes, \n     thereby revealing the underlying trend. Seasonal influences \n     are those that normally occur at the same time and in about \n     the same magnitude every year. They include price movements \n     resulting from changing climatic conditions, production \n     cycles, model changeovers, and holidays. We re-estimate or \n     revise seasonally adjusted indexes annually.\n       The unadjusted data reflect the actual prices consumers \n     pay. Therefore, unadjusted data are appropriate for \n     escalation purposes.\n\n\n            What area indexes are published, and how often?\n\n       Besides monthly publication of the national (or U.S. City \n     Average) CPI-U and CPI-W, monthly indexes are also published \n     for the four regions--Northeast, North Central, South, and \n     West. Monthly indexes are also published for urban areas \n     classified by population size--all metropolitan areas over \n     1.2 million, mid-sized metropolitan areas, small metropolitan \n     areas, and all nonmetropolitan urban areas. Indexes also are \n     available within each region cross-classified by area size. \n     For the Northeast and West, however, some of the population-\n     size classes are not available. BLS also publishes indexes \n     for 29 local areas. These local area indexes are byproducts \n     of the national CPI program. Each local index has a much \n     smaller sample size than the national or regional indexes and \n     is, therefore, subject to substantially more sampling and \n     other measurement error. As a result, local area indexes are \n     more volatile than the national or regional indexes, even \n     though their long-term trends are similar. Therefore, BLS \n     strongly urges users to consider adopting the national \n     average (or regional) CPI's for use in their escalator \n     clauses. If used with caution, local area CPI data can be \n     used to illustrate and explain the impact of local economic \n     conditions on consumers' experience with price change. Local \n     area data are available on the following schedule:\n       We publsh five major metropolitan areas monthly: Chicago-\n     Gary-Lake County. IL-IN-WI; Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside, \n     CA; New York-Northern NJ-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT; Philadelphia-\n     Wilmington-Trenton, PA-NJ-DE-MD; San Francisco-Oakland-San \n     Jose. CA.\n       Data for an addition 10 metropolitan areas are published \n     every other month [on an odd (January, March, etc.) or even \n     (February, April, etc.) month schedule] for the following \n     areas:\n       Baltimore, MD--odd.\n       Houston, TX--even.\n       Boston-Lawrence-Salem, MA-NH--odd.\n       Miami-Fort Lauderdale, FL--odd.\n       Cleveland-Akron-Lorain, OH--odd.\n       Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, PA--even.\n       Dallas-Fort Worth, TX--even.\n       St. Louis-East St. Louis, MO-IL--odd.\n       Detroit-Ann Arbor, MI--even.\n       Washington, DC-MD-VA--odd.\n       (Note: The designation even or odd refers to the month \n     during which the area's price change is measured. Due to the \n     time needed for processing, data are released 2 to 3 weeks \n     into the following month.)\n       Data are published for another group of 12 metropolitan \n     areas on a semiannual basis. These indexes, which refer to \n     the arithmetic average for the 6-month periods from January \n     through June and July through December, are published with \n     release of the CPI for July and January, respectively, in \n     August and February for: Anchorage, AK, Kansas City, MO-\n     KS, Atlanta, GA, Milwaukee, WI, Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY, \n     Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN-WI, Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH-KY-\n     IN, Portland-Vancouver, OR-WA, Denver-Boulder, CO, San \n     Diego, CA, Honolulu, HI, Seattle-Tacoma, WA.\n       Finally, BLS recently began publication of CPI's for two \n     metropolitan areas on an annual basis. These indexes \n     represent the arithmetic averages for the 12-month period \n     from January through December of each year. They are \n     published with the release of the CPI for January, i.e., in \n     February. These areas are: New Orleans, LA; Tampa-St. \n     Petersburg-Clearwater, FL.\n\n\n what area cpi should i use if there is no cpi for the area i live in?\n\n       Although the BLS can provide some guidance on this \n     question, users must make the final decision.\n       As noted in the answers to Questions 13 and 15, BLS \n     strongly urges the use of national or at least regional CPI's \n     for use in escalator clauses. These indexes are more stable \n     and subject to less sampling and other measurement error than \n     local area indexes. They are, therefore, more statistically \n     reliable.\n\n\n  can the cpi's for individual areas be used to compare living costs \n                            among the areas?\n\n       No, an individual area index measures how much prices have \n     changed in that particular area over a specific time period. \n     It does not show whether prices or living costs are higher or \n     lower in that area relative to another. In general, both the \n     market basket and relative prices of goods and services in \n     the base period vary substantially across areas.\n       The following illustration shows that while Area B has \n     higher prices than Area A, the price change in Area A has \n     been greater than in Area B. The CPI measures the rates of \n     change in prices rather than the level of prices.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Base period     Current period \n                                     -----------------------------------\n                                       Price    Index    Price    Index \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArea A..............................    $0.30      100    $0.55      183\nArea B..............................     0.60      100     0.90      150\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                   what types of data are published?\n\n       These are many types of data published as outputs from the \n     CPI program. The most popular are indexes and percent \n     changes. Requested less often are relative importance data \n     (or relative expenditure weights), base conversion factors \n     (to convert from one CPI reference base to another), seasonal \n     factors (the monthly factors used to convert unadjusted \n     indexes into seasonally adjusted indexes), and average food \n     and energy prices. Index and price change data are available \n     for the U.S. City Average (or national average), for various \n     geographic areas (regions and metropolitan areas), for size \n     classes of urban areas, and for cross-classifications of \n     regions and size classes. Indexes for various groupings of \n     items are available for all geographic areas and size \n     classes.\n       There are individual indexes available for over 200 items \n     (e.g., apples, men's shirts, airline fares), and over 120 \n     different combinations of items (e.g., fruits and vegetables, \n     food at home, food and beverages, and All items), at the \n     national or U.S. City Average level. BLS classifies consumer \n     items into seven major groups: food and beverages, housing, \n     apparel and upkeep, transportation, medical care, \n     entertainment, and other goods and services. Some indexes \n     are available as far back as 1913.\n       Each month, indexes are published along with short-term \n     percent changes, the latest 12-month change and, at the \n     national item and group level, unadjusted and (where \n     appropriate) seasonally adjusted percent changes (and \n     seasonal factors), together with annualized rates of change. \n     These annualized rates indicate what the rate of change would \n     be for a 12-month period, if a price change measured for a \n     shorter period continued for a full 12-months.\n       The answer to question 15 provides information about the \n     areas and size classes for which indexes are published. For \n     areas, we publish less detailed groupings of items than we do \n     for the national level. The following table illustrates this \n     point:\n\n                                ALL ITEMS                               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Baltimore, MD                      U.S. city average     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood and beverages........................

For \n     example, it is designed to measure the experience with \n     average price change of the U.S. urban population and, thus, \n     may not accurately reflect the experience of rural residents. \n     Also, the CPI does not provide data separately for the rate \n     of inflation experienced by subgroups of the population, such \n     as the elderly or the poor.\n       As noted in the answer to question 17, the CPI cannot be \n     used to measure differences in price levels or living costs \n     between one place and another; it measures only time-to-time \n     changes in each place. A higher index for one area does not \n     necessarily mean that prices are higher there than in another \n     area with a lower index, it merely means that they have risen \n     faster since their common base period.\n       The CPI cannot be used as a measure of total change in \n     living costs, because changes in these costs are affected by \n     such factors as changes in consumers' market baskets, social \n     and environmental changes, and changes in income taxes, which \n     the CPI does not include.\n\n                       Limitations in measurement\n\n       Limitations in measurement can be grouped into two basic \n     types, sampling errors and non-sampling errors.\n       Sampling errors: Since the CPI measures price change based \n     on only a sample of items, the published indexes differ \n     somewhat from what the results would be if actual records of \n     all retail purchases by everyone in the index population \n     could be used to compile the index. These estimating or \n     sampling errors are limitations on the precise accuracy of \n     the index, not mistakes in index calculation. The accuracy \n     could be increased by using much larger samples, but the cost \n\n\n[[Page S 15456]]\n     would be multiplied. Most of those who have examined the index have \n     found it to be sufficiently accurate for most of the \n     practical uses made of it. The CPI program has developed \n     measurements of sampling error.\n       Nonsampling errors: These errors occur from a variety of \n     sources. Unlike sampling errors, they can cause persistent \n     bias in the index measurement. They are caused by problems of \n     price data collection, logistical lags in conducting surveys, \n     difficulties in defining basic concepts and their operational \n     implementation, and difficulties in handling the problems of \n     quality change. Nonsampling errors can be far more hazardous \n     to the accuracy of a price index than sampling error, per se. \n     BLS expands much effort to minimize these errors. Highly \n     trained personnel are relied on to insure comparability of \n     quality of items compared from period to period (see answer \n     to question 8.); collection procedures are extensively \n     documented and recurring audits are conducted. The CPI \n     program has started a program of continuous evaluation to \n     identify needed improvements and has introduced improvements \n     as their benefits were proven and as our budget permitted.\n\n\n           will the cpi be updated or revised in the future?\n\n       Yes. The CPI will need revisions as long as there are \n     significant changes in consumer buying habits or shifts in \n     population distribution or demographics. The Bureau, by \n     developing annual Consumer Expenditure Surveys and Point-of-\n     Purchase Surveys, has the flexibility to monitor changing \n     buying habits in a timely and cost-efficient manner. In \n     addition, the censuses conducted by the Department of \n     Commerce provide information that permits us to adapt to \n     shifts in the population distribution and other demographic \n     factors at 10-year intervals.\n       As a matter of policy, BLS is continually researching \n     improved statistical methods. Thus, even between major \n     revisions, we are making further improvements to the CPI. For \n     example, changes in children's day care and nursery school \n     expenses, until recently, had been represented by changes in \n     State and local minimum wages. The development of an adequate \n     sample of day care providers and nursery school reporters \n     enabled us to obtain prices for day care and nursery school \n     services directly.\n\n\n                     how can i get cpi information?\n\n       BLS furnishes CPI data to the public in a variety of \n     methods and formats.\n       The Electronic News Release: This is the quickest.

New \n     products are being introduced all the time and existing ones \n     improved, while others leave the market. The relative prices \n     of different goods and services changes frequently, in \n     response to change in consumer tastes and income, and \n     technological and other factors affecting cost. This makes \n     constructing an accurate cost of living index more difficult \n     than in a static economy.\n       2. Estimating a cost of living index requires assumptions, \n     methodology, data gathering and index number construction. \n     Biases can come from any of these areas.\n       3. The strength of the CPI is in the underlying simplicity \n     of its concept: pricing a fixed (but representative) market \n     basket of goods and services over time. Its weakness follows \n     from the same conception: the ``fixed basket'' becomes less \n     and less representative over time as consumers respond to \n     price changes and new choices.\n       4. There are five categories of potential bias in using \n     changes in the CPI as a measure of the change in the cost of \n     living. 1) Substitution bias occurs because a fixed market \n     basket fails to reflect the fact that consumers substitute \n     relatively less for more expensive goods when relative prices \n     change. 2) Outlet substitution bias occurs when shifts to \n     lower price outlets are not properly handled. 3) Quality \n     change bias occurs when improvements in the quality of \n     products, such as greater energy efficiency or less need for \n     repair, are measured inaccurately or not at all. 4) New \n     product bias occurs when new products are not included in the \n     market basket, or included only with a long lag. 5) Formula \n     bias occurs when the method of aggregating from the many \n     thousands of elementary products for which price quotations \n     are obtained to a modest number of groups of goods is \n     inappropriate. The report discusses and estimates the size of \n     each of the potential sources of bias.\n       5. While the CPI is the best measure currently available, \n     it is not a true cost of living index (this has been \n     recognized by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for many years). \n     Despite important BLS updates and improvements in the CPI, \n     changes in the CPI have substantially overstated the actual \n     rate of price inflation, by about 1.5% per annum recently. It \n     is likely that a large bias also occurred looking back over \n     at least the last couple of decades, perhaps longer, but we \n     make no attempt to estimate its size.\n       6. Changes in the CPI will overstate changes in the true \n     cost of living for the next few years. The Commission's \n     interim best estimate of the size of the upward bias looking \n     forward is 1.0% per year. The range of plausible values is \n     0.7% to 2.0%. The range of uncertainty is not symmetric. It \n     is more likely that changes in the CPI have a larger than a \n     smaller bias.\n       7. The upward bias programs into the federal budget an \n     annual automatic real increase in indexed benefits and real \n     tax cut.\n       8. CBO estimates that if the change in the CPI overstated \n     the change in the cost of living by an average of 1% per year \n     over the \n\n[[Page S 15457]]\n     next decade, this bias would contribute almost $140 billion to the \n     deficit in 2005 and $634 billion to the national debt by \n     then. The bias alone would be the fourth largest federal \n     program, after social security, health care and defense.\n       9. Some have suggested that different groups in the \n     population are likely to have faster or slower growth in \n     their cost of living than recorded by changes in the CPI. We \n     find no compelling evidence of this to date, in fact just the \n     opposite, but further exploration of this issue is desirable.\n       10. In our final report we expect to have a more complete \n     analysis and evaluation together with specific \n     recommendations for procedures to improve and/or complement \n     the CPI.\n\n\n                          i. introduction \\1\\\n\n       Accurate measures of changes in the cost of living are \n     among the most useful and important data necessary to \n     evaluate economic performance. The change in the cost of \n     living between two periods, for example 1975 and 1995, tells \n     us how much income people would have needed in 1975, given \n     the prices of goods and services available in that year, to \n     be at least as well off as they are in 1995 given their \n     income and the prices of goods and services available then. \n     For example, if a family with a $45,000 income in 1995 would \n     have needed $15,000 in 1975, the cost of living has tripled \n     in the interim.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       If the American economy was quite static, with very few new \n     products introduced, very little quality improvement in \n     existing products, little change in consumers' tastes, and \n     very small and infrequent change in the relative prices of \n     goods and services, measuring changes in the cost of living \n     would be conceptually quite easy and its implementation a \n     matter of technical detail and appropriate execution. \n     Fortunately for the overwhelming majority of Americans, our \n     economy is far more dynamic and flexible than that. New \n     products are being introduced all the time and existing ones \n     improved, while others leave the market. The relative prices \n     of different goods and services change frequently, in \n     response to changes in consumer taste and income, and \n     technological and other factors affecting costs. Consumers in \n     America have the benefit of a vast and growing array of goods \n     and services from which to choose, unlike consumers in some \n     other countries.\n       But because the economy is complex and dynamic is no reason \n     to bemoan the greater difficulty in constructing an accurate \n     cost of living index. Major improvements can and should be \n     made to the various official statistics that are currently \n     used as proxies for changes in the cost of living, such as \n     the well-known Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n       The Consumer Price Index measures the cost of purchasing a \n     fixed market basket of goods and services. Based on surveys \n     of households from some base period, the index sets weights \n     (expenditure shares) for different goods and services. The \n     weights reflect average or representative shares for the \n     groups surveyed.\\2\\ Keeping these weights fixed through time, \n     the CPI is then calculated by attempting to measure changes \n     from one month to the next in prices of the same, or quite \n     closely related, goods and services.\n       But through time consumption baskets change, in part \n     because of changes in the relative prices of goods and \n     services, and therefore the weights from the base period no \n     longer reflect what consumers are actually purchasing. This \n     failure to adjust for the changes in consumer behavior in \n     response to relative price changes is called substitution \n     bias. It is a necessary result of keeping the market basket \n     fixed. Because the market basket is updated only every decade \n     or so, as we get further away from the base period, there is \n     more opportunity for relative prices to diverge from what \n     they were in the base period, and for consumption baskets to \n     change substantially.\n       Just as there are changes in what consumers purchase, there \n     are also trends and changes in where purchases are made. In \n     recent years, there has been a transformation of retailing. \n     Superstores, discount stores, and the like now comprise a \n     large and growing fraction of sales relative to a decade or \n     two ago. As important as keeping up with the basket of goods \n     that consumers actually purchase is keeping up with the \n     outlets where they actually purchase them, so that the prices \n     paid are accurately recorded. The current methodology suffers \n     from an outlet substitution bias, which insufficiently takes \n     into account the shift to discount outlets.\n       Many of the products sold today are dramatic improvements \n     over their counterparts from years ago. They may be more \n     durable and subject to less need for repair, more energy \n     efficient; lighter; safer; etc. Sometimes, at least \n     initially, a better quality product replacing its counterpart \n     may cost more. Separating out how much of the price increase \n     is due to quality change rather than actual inflation in the \n     price of a standardized product is far from simple, but is \n     necessary to obtain an accurate measure of the true increase \n     in the cost of living. To the extent quality change is \n     measured inaccurately or not at all, there is a quality \n     change bias in the CPI.\n       The same is true with the introduction of new products, \n     which have substantial value in and of themselves--not many \n     of us would like to surrender our microwave ovens, radial \n     tires, and VCR's--as well as the value of greater choice and \n     opportunities opened up by the new products. To the extent \n     new products are not included in the market basket, or \n     included only with a long lag, there is a new product bias in \n     the CPI.\n       Finally, in a dynamic, complex economy like the \n     contemporary United States, there are literally many \n     thousands of goods and services consumed. Price data are \n     collected at a considerable level of disaggregation and how \n     the price changes are aggregated into an overall index \n     involves quite technical issues that can lead to a formula \n     bias in the CPI.\n       Even if not federal program on either the outlay or revenue \n     side of the budget was indexed, it would still be desirable \n     to improve the quality of measures of the cost of living from \n     the standpoint of providing citizens a better and more \n     accurate estimate of what was actually going on in the \n     economy, a way to compare current performance to our \n     historical performance or to that of other countries. For \n     example, the most commonly used measure of the standard of \n     living is real income or output per person. To measure \n     changes in real income requires the separation of nominal \n     income changes from price changes. Obviously, that requires \n     an accurate measure of price changes.\n       But numerous federal, state and local government programs \n     and tax features are ``indexed'' for changes in the cost of \n     living by the changes in the Consumer Price Index. The CPI is \n     also used to index a large number of private sector \n     contracts, including wages in collective bargaining \n     agreements and rents, to name obvious examples that affect \n     millions of Americans. Currently, slightly under one-third of \n     total federal outlays, mostly in retirement programs, are \n     directly indexed to changes in consumer prices. Several \n     features of the individual income tax, including the tax \n     brackets, are indexed; the individual income tax accounts for \n     a little under half of federal revenues.\n       Congress indexed these outlay programs and tax rules in \n     order to help insulate or protect the affected individuals \n     from bearing the brunt of increases in the cost of living. \n     Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency responsible \n     for compiling and presenting the Consumer Price Index, has \n     explicitly stated for years that the CPI is not a cost of \n     living index, presumably for some of the reasons mentioned \n     above. If the Consumer Price Index as currently produced, and \n     as likely to be produced over the next few years, is not an \n     appropriate cost of living index for the task Congress had in \n     mind, then it is desirable to consider alternative measures.\n       The consequences of changes in the Consumer Price Index \n     overstating changes in the cost of living can be dramatic. \n     For example, if use of the CPI is expected to overstate the \n     increase in the cost of living by one percentage point per \n     year over the next seven years, the national debt would be \n     almost $300 billion greater in 2002 than if a corresponding \n     correction were made in the indexing of outlays and revenues.\n       This interim report proceeds as follows: Section II \n     discusses the historical and prospective budgetary \n     implications of changes in the CPI overstating changes in the \n     cost of living. Section III details why the CPI is not a true \n     cost of living. Section III details why the CPI is not a true \n     cost of living index and discusses several sources of bias. \n     Section IV describes in greater detail the bias from quality \n     change and new products. Section V introduces the issue of \n     separate price indexes for different groups. The Conclusion \n     summarizes the interim findings of the Commission.\n\n\n                    II. Indexing the Federal Budget\n\n       The issue proposed for fiscal policy makers by an upward \n     bias in the CPI has been stated with admirable clarity by the \n     Congressional Budget Office (1994): The budgetary effect of \n     any overestimate of changes in the cost of living highlights \n     the possibility of a shift in the distribution of wealth. If \n     the CPI has an upward bias, some federal programs would \n     overcompensate for the effect of price changes on living \n     standards, and wealth would be transferred from younger and \n     future generations to current recipients of indexed federal \n     programs--an effect that legislators may not have \n     intended.\\3\\\n       Social Security is by far the most important of the federal \n     outlays that are indexed to the CPI. However, Supplemental \n     Security Income, Military Retirement, and Civil Service \n     Retirement are significant programs that are similarly \n     indexed. Other federal retirement programs, Railroad \n     Retirement, veterans' compensation and pensions, and the \n     Federal Employees' Compensation Act also contain provisions \n     for indexing. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 indexed \n     individual income tax brackets and the personal exemption to \n     the CPI.\n       How important have the budgetary consequences of upward \n     bias in the CPI been historically? Obviously, a precise \n     answer to this question would require extended study, taking \n     into account the timing of the bias, the parallel development \n     of indexing provisions in specific federal outlays and \n     revenues, and interest on the accumulation of debt that has \n     resulted. An indication of the potential size of these \n     effects can be inferred from one important historical example \n     of one clearly identified source of bias. A careful study of \n     this type, which focuses on the most important federal \n     program affected by indexing, namely, social security \n     benefits, has been conducted by the Office of Economic Policy \n     (OEP) of the Department of the Treasury.\n       On February 25, 1983, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) \n     introduced an important technical modification in the \n     Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-\n\n[[Page S 15458]]\n     U). This altered the treatment of housing costs by shifting the costs \n     for homeowners to a rental equivalent basis. The new \n     treatment of housing costs was incorporated into the Consumer \n     Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-\n     W), used to index social security benefits, in 1985.\n       The rental equivalent measure of housing costs was a \n     conceptual improvement and has been retained in subsequent \n     official publications. However, housing costs in preceding \n     years employed a ``homeownership'' measure ``. . . based on \n     house prices, mortgage interest rates, property taxes and \n     insurance, and maintenance costs.'' \\4\\ The treatment of \n     housing costs prior to 1983 was not modified in publishing \n     the revised CPI-U, so that the new treatment of housing \n     introduced a discrepancy in the conceptual basis for the CPI-\n     U before and after 1983. Similarly, housing cots in the CPI-W \n     prior to 1985 have not been modified.\n       BLS developed an ``experimental'' price index, CPI-U X1, \n     based on a rental equivalent treatment of housing extending \n     back to 1967. This provides the basis for the OEP assessment \n     of bias in the CPI-W. The bias for 1975, the first year that \n     social security was indexed to the CPI-W, was 1.1 percent. \n     This bias mounted over subsequent years, reaching 6.5 percent \n     by 1982 and then declining to 4.7 percent in 1984.\\5\\\n       Overpayments of social security benefits resulting from the \n     bias in the CPI-W mounted through 1983, reaching a total of \n     $7.1 billion or 7.1 percent of benefits paid in that year. \n     These overpayments have resulted in a lower balance in the \n     OASI trust fund and a larger federal deficit and debt. OEP \n     estimates interest costs associated with these deficits at \n     the rate of interest paid or projected to be paid on the OASI \n     trust fund. Beginning in 1985 interest costs predominate in \n     the total. In the current fiscal year the total cost is $16.7 \n     billion, of which $12.6 billion is interest. The cumulative \n     effect of just this one source of bias in the CPI-W via this \n     one program on the federal debt amounts to $213.2 billion, as \n     of 1995.\n       In summary, the BLS made two decisions in revising the \n     treatment of housing costs in the CPI-W in 1985. The first \n     decision was to change the treatment of housing costs to a \n     rental equivalent basis beginning in January 1985. The second \n     was not to revise the treatment of housing costs for 1984 and \n     earlier years. As a consequence of these two decisions the \n     level of the CPI-W is 4.7 percent above the CPI-U X1, a \n     measure of the cost of living based on the same primary data \n     sources and similar methodology, but with a consistent \n     treatment of housing costs.\n       The increases in federal outlays resulting from the bias in \n     the CPI-W cannot be justified as cost of living adjustments. \n     These increases are the consequence of an inappropriate \n     treatment of housing costs before 1985 and have resulted in \n     large transfers to beneficiaries of the OASI program that are \n     devoid of any economic rationale. The overpayments have \n     continued up to the present, but are declining in importance. \n     However, the resulting decline in the OASI trust fund \n     continues to mount due to rising interest costs and now \n     contributes more than two hundred billion dollars to the \n     federal debt!\n       Of course, nobody would suggest retroactively undoing the \n     overindexing due to this or any other source of bias. The \n     point of this discussion is to demonstrate how important it \n     is to correct biases in the CPI (in either direction) as \n     quickly and fully as possible before their consequences \n     mount, indeed compound.\n       What would be the effect of an upward bias in the CPI on \n     future deficits? More than half of federal spending of $1.5 \n     trillion is now attributable to entitlements and mandatory \n     spending programs. In January 1995 the annual Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) outlook for the economy and the federal \n     budget showed that this proportion is projected to rise to \n     almost two-thirds of federal spending during fiscal year \n     1998. Cost-of-living adjustments at a projected rate of 3.0 \n     percent will contribute $43 billion to total spending on \n     mandatory programs in that year and $80 billion in fiscal \n     year 2000.\\6\\ This is 6.8 percent of projected spending on \n     mandatory programs in fiscal year 2000.\n       Testimony presented by the CBO to the Committee on Finance \n     shows the impact of a hypothetical correction (reduction) of \n     0.5 percent in cost of living adjustments for fiscal years \n     1996-2000.\\7\\ Federal outlays would decline by $13.3 billion \n     in fiscal year 2000, while revenues would rise by $9.6 \n     billion. The decline in debt service resulting from reduced \n     deficits in fiscal years 1996-2000 would be $3.3 billion, \n     yielding a total contribution to deficit reduction of $26.2 \n     billion in fiscal year 2000.\\8\\ This is more than ten percent \n     of the deficit projected by CBO in that year.\n       The CBO has provided the Commission with projections of the \n     impact of hypothetical corrections (reductions) of 0.5 and \n     1.0 percent in cost of living adjustments for fiscal years \n     1996-2005. With a reduction of 0.5 percent the total \n     contribution to deficit reduction rises to $71.9 billion in \n     2005. Of this amount, an increase in revenue accounts for \n     $21.9 billion and reductions in outlays, including debt \n     service, amounts to $32.7 billion (of which debt service is \n     $17.3 billion). The total reduction is almost seventeen \n     percent of the projected deficit in 2005. The cumulative \n     reduction in debt held by the public in 2005 is $319.6 \n     billion or about 2.7 percent of the GDP projected for that \n     year.\n       CBO projections for the impact of a hypothetical correction \n     (reduction) in cost of living adjustments of 1.0 percent are, \n     of course, even more dramatic. The total change in the \n     deficit in the year 2005 is $139.1 billion. Federal revenues \n     would be increased by $40.8 billion and federal outlays \n     reduced by $98.3 billion, of the reduction in outlays $34.4 \n     billion can be attributed to lower debt service and $63.9 \n     billion to lower outlays on indexed programs. (See Appendix \n     Figure A-1 for detail not reproducible in Record). The \n     cumulative reduction in outstanding federal debt by 2005 is \n     $634.3 billion. (See Appendix Figure A-2 for detail not \n     reproducible in Record). This is almost 9.4 percent of the \n     debt projected for that year and almost 5.5 percent of the \n     GDP!\n       Stated differently, if the change in the CPI overstated the \n     change in the cost of living by an average of 1% per year \n     over this period, this bias alone would contribute almost \n     $140 billion to the deficit in the year 2005. That is one-\n     third the projected baseline deficit (which assumes no policy \n     changes such as the current balanced budget proposals). More \n     remarkably, the upward bias by itself would constitute the \n     fourth largest federal outlay program, behind only social \n     security, health care and defense!\n       In summary, an upward bias in the CPI would result in \n     substantial overpayments to the beneficiaries of federal \n     entitlements and mandatory spending programs. In addition, \n     such a bias would reduce federal revenues by overindexing the \n     individual income tax. In short, the upward bias programs \n     into the federal budget every year an automatic, real \n     increase in indexed benefits and a real tax cut. Correction \n     of biases in the CPI, while designed to more accurately \n     adjust benefits and taxes for true changes in the cost of \n     living, would also contribute importantly to reductions in \n     future federal budget deficits and the national debt. These \n     reductions can be attributed to higher revenues, lower \n     outlays, and less debt service. Lower outlays-cuts in indexed \n     federal spending programs and reduced interest payments-\n     account for over two-thirds of the long-run deficit \n     reduction, while higher revenues account for the rest.\n\n\n iii. the consumer price index and a cost of living index: measurement \n                                 issues\n\n       A cost of living index is a comparison of the minimum \n     expenditure required to achieve the same level of well-being \n     (also known as welfare, utility, standard-of-living) across \n     two different sets of prices. Most often it is thought of as \n     a comparison between two points of time. As with any \n     practical application of theory to index number production, \n     estimating a cost of living index requires assumptions, a \n     methodology, data gathering processes and index number \n     construction.\n       There are two sets of potential biases in the CPI: biases \n     relative to an ``ideal'' cost of living index and biases \n     which arise within its own terms of reference. The strength \n     of the CPI is in the underlying simplicity of its concept: \n     pricing a fixed (but representative) market basket of goods \n     and services over time. Its weakness follows from the same \n     conception: the ``fixed basket'' becomes less and less \n     representative over time as consumers respond to price \n     changes and new choices.\n       Consumers respond to price changes by substituting away \n     from products that have become more expensive and toward \n     goods whose prices have declined relatively. As the world \n     changes, they are faced with new choices in shopping outlets, \n     varieties, and entirely new goods and services, and respond \n     to these as well. These changes make the previous ``fixed \n     basket'' increasingly irrelevant.\n       In trying to keep true to its concept in a rapidly changing \n     world, the current CPI procedures encounter difficulties. \n     Biases result when they ignore some of these changes such as \n     the appearance of discounters, and also when they try to do \n     something about them such as when items are rotated out of \n     the sample and replaced with new items. Attempting to capture \n     the changes in a way that tries to mimic the pricing of a \n     ``fixed basket'' within a rather patchwork framework just \n     cannot be done without introducing other problems into the \n     resulting index. These different biases overlap and have been \n     discussed under a number of headings: substitution bias; \n     formula bias; outlet substitution bias; quality change; and \n     new product bias.\n       The ``pure'' substitution bias is the easiest to \n     illustrate. Consider a very stylized example, where we would \n     like to compare an initial ``base'' period 1 and a subsequent \n     period 2. For simplicity, consider a hypothetical situation \n     where there are only two commodities: beef and chicken. In \n     period 1, the prices per pound of beef and chicken are equal, \n     at $1, and so are the quantities consumed, at 1 lb. Total \n     expenditure is therefore $2. In period 2, beef is twice as \n     expensive as chicken ($1.60 vs. $0.80 per pound), and much \n     more chicken (2 lb.) than beef (0.8 lb.) is consumed, as the \n     consumer substitutes the relatively less expensive chicken \n     for beef. Total expenditure in period 2 is $2.88. The \n     relevant data are presented in Table 1. How can we compare \n     the two situations? Actually, there are several methods, each \n     asking slightly different questions and therefore, not \n     surprisingly, giving different answers.\\9\\\n\n                                                                        \n\n[[Page S 15459]]\n                                                                       TABLE 1.--HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF SUBSTITUTION BIAS                                                                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                       Price relatives                  Relative weights        \n                                                          Price in period    Quantity in    Price in period    Quantity in   -------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 1             period 1            2             period 2          P2/P1            P1/P2              1                2       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeef....................................................               1                1              1.6              0.8              1.6             0.63              0.5             0.43 \nChicken.................................................               1                1              0.8              2.0              0.8             1.25              0.5             0.57 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n       The simplest comparison is to ask ``How much more must I \n     spend in my current situation (period 2) to purchase the same \n     quantities that I purchased initially (in period 1)?'' \\10\\ \n     This is the question asked by the CPI. The price index for \n     period 2 relative to period 1 uses the initial period 1 \n     basket of consumption as the weights in the computation. To \n     buy 1 lb. of beef and 1 lb. of chicken in period 2 costs \n     $2.40. The price index for period 2 relative to period 1 is \n     1.20 (2.40/2.00), that is a 20% increase.\n       Intuitively, it is easy to understand why such a \n     computation imparts an upward (substitution) bias to the \n     measure of the change in the true cost of living. It assumes \n     the consumer does not substitute (cheaper) chicken for beef. \n     In the real world, as in the hypothetical example, consumers \n     change their spending patterns in response to changes in \n     relative prices and, hence, partially insulate themselves \n     from price movements.\n       An alternative approach would be to ask the question ``How \n     much more am I spending in my current situation (period 2) \n     than I would have spent for the same goods and services at \n     the prices that prevailed initially (in period 1)?'' \\11\\ \n     This price index compares expenditures in period 2 ($2.88) \n     with what it would cost to buy the current (period 2) market \n     basket at the initial prices ($0.80 for the beef plus $2.00 \n     for the chicken equals $2.80). This price index is 1.03, that \n     is only a 3% increase. This approach understates the rise in \n     the true cost of living as it overstates substitution.\n       The idea of a cost of living index is not to keep the \n     consumption basket fixed, but to allow for the substitution \n     that follows relative price changes. The question answered by \n     a true cost of living index is instead ``How much would we \n     need to increase (or decrease) the initial (period 1) \n     expenditure in order to keep the consumer just as well off in \n     period 2?'' Such a question cannot be answered without \n     knowing the consumer's preferences in more detail, but a very \n     good approximation may be obtained by interpolating between \n     the two answers (that arise from the different base periods). \n     There are alternative ways of doing so, each involving a \n     different mathematical formula. A commonly accepted approach \n     is to use the geometric mean (the square root of the product) \n     of the two answers.\\12\\ In our example, this comes to 1.11, \n     an 11% increase. By comparison, the CPI-type fixed base index \n     contains an upward bias of 0.09 (1.20-1.11); thus, almost \n     half of the increase in the CPI-type calculation is \n     substitution bias.\n       How large are such substitution biases in the real world? \n     That depends on how out of date the base period weights used \n     in constructing the index are and on how much relative prices \n     have changed in a consistent and permanent direction. If \n     relative prices diverge over time and do not just fluctuate, \n     there is a permanent bias in the standard fixed base formula. \n     Since we have been experiencing various consistent price \n     trends, the further one gets away from the base period (for \n     which the weights are approximately correct), the larger the \n     bias.\n       Most of the computations done for large groupings of \n     commodities (relatively aggregated commodity levels) show \n     small biases in the growth rates of the CPI, rising from \n     about 0.15 percent per year in the first five years after new \n     expenditure weights are introduced, to about 0.30 percent per \n     year in the subsequent five years. These estimates are based \n     on research covering the period 1982-91 and updated to \n     1993.13 14 The bias increases as average consumption \n     patterns drift further away from what they were in the base \n     period. Therefore, this bias may be expected to increase \n     further in the next few years, perhaps to 0.40 percent per \n     year, until the newly revised CPI is released in 1998. At \n     that point, the weights will be shifted to reflect average \n     consumer expenditures in 1993-5, (and will already be four \n     years out of date!). Although the substitution bias will \n     then decline for awhile, it will grow subsequently as \n     prices and consumptions patterns drift away again from \n     those in the new base period unless the BLS changes its \n     procedures and moves toward some different index number \n     formula with shifting weights.\n       These estimates may be low. They are based on computations \n     using rather high level groupings (200 commodity subindexes) \n     of the many underlying varieties and models of specific \n     products and services and may miss some of the large \n     substitutions that occur at the more detailed level. Indeed, \n     one may interpret as additional evidence on this point, the \n     results of a simulation experiment by BLS researchers which \n     applied different index number formulae at the item, or \n     ``elemental,'' level, for price changes in 1991-2 and yielded \n     an estimate of the bias equal to 0.50 percent.\\15\\\n       Recognizing the continuously changing assortment of \n     commodities in the market, the BLS improved its price \n     measurement procedures in 1978. The improved procedure \n     chooses items to be priced based on a probability sample and \n     rotates these items on a staggered, five year cycle. The idea \n     was laudable, but embedding it in a conceptually ``fixed-\n     weight,'' ``fixed-basket'' index created unanticipated \n     problems which have become known as ``formula'' bias.\n       In essence, the problem arises as the procedure exaggerates \n     (gives too much importance to) the effect of short run \n     variability of prices (such as items on sale). This bias was \n     discovered and evaluated by BLS researchers and appears to be \n     most important in seasonal items such as fruit and \n     vegetables, but has apparently also affected the residential \n     housing component of the index.\\16\\ \\17\\ The overall bias \n     from this source has been estimated to be on the order of \n     0.50 percent per year. However, now that this formula bias is \n     understood, procedures are being developed which will largely \n     eliminate it when implemented.\n       While the formula bias in the CPI can, should and hopefully \n     will be eliminated in the future, the problems of outlet and \n     variety substitution are unlikely to diminish soon. Just as \n     consumers change the goods they purchase in response to \n     changes in relative prices as in the beef and chicken \n     example, so do they change the location of where they make \n     their purchases. The opening of a new discount store outlet \n     may give consumers the opportunity to purchase a given good \n     at a lower price than before. At present, the CPI procedures \n     ignore such reductions that occur when consumers change \n     outlets. However, if consumers cared only about obtaining \n     goods at the lowest price, then we would observe all goods \n     sold at the same price at all outlets. Instead, we observe \n     low prices at discount stores and warehouse clubs at the same \n     time as medium prices at supermarkets and higher prices at \n     convenience stores. Evidently, consumers care not only about \n     prices, but the level of services such as availability of \n     clerks, wrapping services, and the distance between home and \n     alternative outlets.\n       Current procedures in the CPI ignore price changes when \n     consumers switch outlets. This incorporates into the CPI the \n     implicit assumption that price differentials among outlets \n     entirely reflect the differences in service quality. This \n     approach would be legitimate if the economy stood still with \n     a stable set of outlets providing alternative levels of \n     service quality. However, there has been a continuous \n     increase in the market share of discount stores as more \n     efficient technologies of distribution allow low price \n     outlets to expand while older, higher priced outlets have \n     contracted and in some cases gone out of business. This \n     shift in market share indicated that many consumers \n     respond to price differentials and do not consider them to \n     be fully offset by difference in service quality. \n     Completely ignoring all differences in service quality by \n     incorporating all such price reductions into the CPI would \n     err in the opposite direction. Further research is \n     required to disentangle true changes in prices from \n     changes in service quality. This problem is analogous to \n     the need to disentangle the changes in prices from changes \n     in product quality.\n       Quality change and new goods present the most difficult \n     problems for measurement. They include capturing the \n     introduction of new products in a timely manner; making \n     direct quality comparisons of new products with existing \n     ones; making direct quality comparisons of new products with \n     other products against which they compete (in other \n     classification groupings such as a new drug and the surgical \n     treatment it replaces); and capturing the combined impact of \n     quality and substitution as these new products displace \n     others within and across their classification grouping.\n       A full treatment of these issues reinforces the problem of \n     focusing on the ``average'' or ``representative'' consumer. \n     Different consumers have different tastes and time costs, and \n     hence value the appearance of new outlets and new products \n     differentially, with some (the majority) becoming better off \n     with supermarkets and others losing out as the corner grocery \n     store disappears. The CPI is not equipped to account for \n     special characteristics of different consumers or groups of \n     consumers.\\18\\ \\19\\ The following sections explore some of \n     these problems.\n       There are still other issues that would in principle apply \n     to obtaining a true cost of living index (COLI). Consider two \n     examples: the negative effects of higher crime rates and the \n     concommitant purchases of security devices and higher \n     insurance premiums and the positive effects of improvements \n     in information technology that permit a parent to work at \n     home when a child is ill. Surely these would enter a \n     calculation of ``the minimum expenditure necessary to be at \n     least as well off.'' The Commission notes these \n     considerations but is not prepared to quantify them at this \n     time.\n\n\n                           IV. QUALITY CHANGE\n\n       The difficulty created by quality change in existing \n     products, and by the introduction of \n\n[[Page S 15460]]\n     new products, is highlighted by returning to the definition of a cost \n     of living index--a comparison between two time periods of the \n     minimum expenditure required to achieve the same level of \n     well-being. What does the ``same level'' mean when entirely \n     new products are introduced that were unavailable in the \n     first time period?\n       A pervasive phenomenon called the ``product cycle'' is \n     critical in assessing the issue of new product bias in the \n     CPI and applies as well to new models of existing products. A \n     typical new product is introduced at a relatively high price \n     with sales at a low volume. Soon improvements in \n     manufacturing techniques and increasing sales allow prices to \n     be reduced and quality to be improved. For instance, the VCR \n     was introduced in the late 1970s at a price of $1,000 and \n     with clumsy electromechanical controls; by the mid 1980s the \n     price had fallen to $200 and the controls were electronic, \n     with extensive preprogramming capabilities. Later on in the \n     product cycle, the product will mature and eventually will \n     increase in price more rapidly than the average product of \n     its class. The sequence is easily visualized as a ``U''-\n     shaped curve--the price of any given product relative to \n     the consumer market basket starts high, then goes down, is \n     flat for a while, and then goes back up. To the extent \n     that the CPI over-weights mature products and underweights \n     new products, it will tend to have an upward bias.\n       Our discussion of quality change and new product bias \n     begins with a review of the methods used by the CPI to handle \n     quality changes in existing products and then turns to \n     problems posed by new products. The BLS has four different \n     methods to cope with a model change for an existing product.\n       The ``direct comparison'' method treats all of the observed \n     price change between the old model and the new model as a \n     change in price and none as a change in quality. There is no \n     necessary bias, because quality can decrease as well as \n     increase. But in practice goods tend to undergo steady \n     improvement, and often a better model is introduced with no \n     change in price, causing the quality change to be missed \n     entirely.\n       The ``deletion'' method makes no comparison at all between \n     the prices of the old and new model. Instead, the weight \n     attributable to this product is applied to the average price \n     change of other products in the same commodity \n     classification. To the extent that the deletion method is \n     used, the CPI consists disproportionately of commodities of \n     constant quality which may be further along in the product \n     cycle.\n       The ``linking'' method can be used if the new and old model \n     are sold simultaneously. In this case the price differential \n     between the two models at the time of introduction of the new \n     model can be used as an estimate of the value of the quality \n     differential between the two models. Unfortunately, new \n     models usually replace old models entirely, and the link \n     prices are not observed. Also, a quality improvement in the \n     new model can occur even if it costs less or the same as the \n     old model, as in the case of the VCR where the price fell \n     continuously while programming capability and reproduction \n     quality improved.\n       The ``cost estimation'' method attempts to establish the \n     cost of the extra attributes of the new model. Problems in \n     practice with the costing method have been its infrequency of \n     use, and the fact that it has been applied disproportionately \n     in the case of automobiles relative to other products. This \n     raises the possibility that there is a spurious upward \n     ``drift'' in the price of other products relative to \n     automobiles due to an uneven application of the costing \n     method.\n       This list of method reveals at least two potential sources \n     of upward bias, the use of the direct comparison method that \n     does not address the quality issue at all, and the use of the \n     deletion method that bases price change on models that are \n     unchanged in quality and may be further along in the product \n     cycle. A greater difficulty is that the CPI makes no attempt \n     to create systematic estimates of the value of quality \n     improvements which increase consumer welfare without raising \n     the price of products. For instance, many consumer electronic \n     products and household appliances have experienced a \n     reduction in the incidence of repairs and in electricity use, \n     and few if any of these improvements have been taken into \n     account by the CPI.\n       The CPI uses only rarely an alternative methodology called \n     the ``hedonic regression method'' for estimating the value of \n     quality change. The hedonic approach can be viewed as an \n     alternative method to manufacturers' cost estimates in making \n     quality change adjustments. It assumes that the price of a \n     product observed at a given time is a function of its quality \n     characteristics, and it estimates the imputed prices of such \n     characteristics by regressing the prices of different models \n     of the product on their differing embodied quantities of \n     characteristics. Thus the hedonic approach is less a new \n     method than an alternative to cost estimates to be used \n     when practical factors make it more suitable than the \n     conventional method.\n       By their very nature hedonic indexes require large amounts \n     of data. Given the thousands of separate products that are \n     produced in any modern industrial society, the need to \n     collect a full cross-section of data on each product presents \n     an insurmountable obstacle to the full-blown adoption of the \n     hedonic technique. Further, it is impossible to construct a \n     hedonic index in the timely fashion required by the CPI, with \n     its orientation to producing within a few weeks an estimate \n     of month-to-month price changes that can never be revised. \n     Accordingly, most hedonic studies have been retrospective and \n     can be used to gauge the accuracy of individual components of \n     the CPI rather than being used in the actual month-to-month \n     construction of the CPI. This is one important reason to \n     consider broadening the concept of the CPI to include both \n     the current index dedicated to timely measures of month-to-\n     month price changes, and a second supplementary index \n     produced with a greater time lag, and subject to periodic \n     revision, dedicated to accurate measurement of price changes \n     over years and decades.\n       We turn now to the issue of new product bias. There is no \n     debate regarding the reality of the product cycle, and nobody \n     debates the fact that the CPI introduces products late, thus \n     missing much of the price decline that typically happens in \n     the first phase of the product cycle. For example, the \n     microwave oven was introduced into the CPI in 1978 and the \n     VCR and personal computer in 1987, years after they were \n     first sold in the marketplace.\n       A second aspect of new product bias results from a narrow \n     definition of a commodity. When a new product is finally \n     introduced into the CPI, no comparison is made of the price \n     and quality of the new product with the price and quality of \n     an old product that performed the same function. For \n     instance, people flock to rent videos, but the declining \n     price of seeing a movie at home, as compared to going out to \n     a theater, is not taken into account in the CPI. Similarly, \n     the CPI missed the replacement of electric typewriters by \n     electronic typewriters and then PCs with word-processing and \n     spell-checking capability, or CD-ROM encyclopedias that cost \n     far less than old-fashioned bound-book versions and eliminate \n     many trips to the library. Inevitably, however, many new \n     products embody genuinely new characteristics that have no \n     previous counterpart. How does one value electronic mail that \n     provides a new set of bonds and communication between parents \n     and their children who are off at college?\n       This discussion of new products leads inevitably to deeper \n     questions about changes in the standard of living of the \n     average American. Positive changes made possible by consumer \n     electronics need to be weighed against increasing crime rates \n     that have forced some families to divert expenditures to \n     burglar systems and security guards. The industrial \n     revolution caused widespread air and water pollution, while \n     numerous factors since the mid-1960s have caused a major \n     decline in the presence of many types of contaminants in the \n     air and water.\\20\\\n       How large is the bias in the CPI introduced by inadequate \n     treatment of quality change, and by the problems created by \n     new products? Estimates of bias vary widely by product, and \n     there are examples of both positive and negative bias. For \n     instance, one study found an upward bias in the CPI index of \n     TV sets of six percent per year, of which almost half was due \n     to the failure of the CPI to place a value on reduced repair \n     incidence and electricity use. Most other studies of consumer \n     durable have found an upward bias in the CPI, except in \n     the case of new automobiles for the period since the late \n     1960s. As stated above, the automobile is a complex \n     product in which many small improvements have been made \n     over the years. Evaluating the negative quality change in \n     the shift to smaller cars as against the substantial \n     improvements in fuel economy (which are worth different \n     amounts in different periods, depending on gasoline \n     prices) is a complex task. However, there seems to be \n     little doubt that the CPI index for used autos has been \n     upward biased, as few if any adjustments for quality \n     change were made to this index during much of the postwar \n     period, and the price index for used autos drifts upward \n     relative to new autos by an implausible amount.\n       Studies have found a downward bias in the CPI in two \n     important areas. Prior to 1988, the CPI index for rental \n     housing (which since 1983 has also been used for owner-\n     occupied housing) did not take into account the deterioration \n     in housing stock quality as a result of aging and \n     depreciation. Clothing is another problematic area, where the \n     difficult task of separating taste or fashion changes from \n     quality changes, as well as a strong seasonal pattern in \n     clothing prices, may have created a substantial downward bias \n     in apparel prices.\n       Thus we find that studies point to substantial upward bias \n     for some products, mainly consumer durables, but \n     countervailing downward bias for several important \n     categories, namely home rent and apparel. Further, the \n     sources of bias shift over time. Since 1987 the BLS has made \n     an attempt to adjust the prices of used cars for quality \n     change, reducing or eliminating that previous source of \n     upward bias. Going in the opposite direction, since 1988 the \n     BLS has eliminated the downward bias due to the failure to \n     take account of aging and depreciation in rental housing.\n       Nevertheless, it is likely that there is a substantial \n     upward bias in the CPI, however hard it may be to measure, \n     and much of this is likely to come from new products. \n     Whatever invention we take--whether the automobile that \n     allowed limitless flexibility in the time and destination of \n     rapid transportation, or the jet plane and communications \n     satellite that tied together people in far-flung nations, or \n     the television and VCR that allowed almost any motion picture \n     to enter the home, or the PC with CD-ROM that \n\n[[Page S 15461]]\n     promises ultimately to bring the Library of Congress into every home--\n     these new developments have made human life better on a large \n     scale.\n       In the concluding section of the interim report, we put \n     forth estimates for the main categories of CPI bias, stated \n     in the form of a ``point estimate'' and a range of \n     uncertainty. In the category of quality change bias \n     (excluding new product bias), we have chosen a relatively \n     conservative point estimate of 0.2 percent per year. Existing \n     studies of consumer durables, weighted by the share of \n     consumer durables in total consumption, point to a bias of at \n     least 0.3 percent per year. Our choice of 0.3 balances the \n     effect of a possible downward bias in apparel against the \n     likelihood that substantial quality change is missed in many \n     areas of nondurable goods and services. Because we are more \n     uncertain in the direction of a higher upward bias, our range \n     of uncertainty for quality change is asymmetric, going from \n     0.2 to 0.6.\n       The most difficult question of all is to place a point \n     estimate on new product bias. We have approached this \n     question by carrying out the following thought experiment. \n     Take the market basket of goods and services available in \n     1970 and labeled with 1970 prices. Take the market basket \n     available in 1995 and labeled with today's prices. Ask the \n     consumer, how much more income would you require to be as \n     satisfied with the 1995 basket and prices as with the 1970 \n     basket and prices? The CPI says 4 times as much income would \n     be necessary, because the CPI has quadrupled since 1970. But \n     that 1970 market basket has no VCRs, microwave ovens, or \n     modern anti-ulcer drugs; its color TV sets break down all \n     the time; and it refrigerators use a lot of electricity. \n     Consumers forced to answer this question are going to miss \n     many benefits of modern life and are not going to say that \n     four times as much income would be necessary--maybe 3 \n     times, maybe 3.5 times, but not 4 times. That is the \n     ultimate test of new product bias in the CPI.\n       To translate this approach into an annual rate of change, \n     an answer of ``3.5 times'' would imply an upward bias of 0.54 \n     percent a year.\\21\\ The commission has chosen to take a \n     lower, more conservative point estimate of a new product bias \n     of 0.3 percent per year, but to extend the range of \n     uncertainly from 0.2 to 0.7 percent per year. We will attempt \n     in our final report to assemble new evidence on this issue \n     and to narrow the range of uncertainty.\n\n\n                       v. separate price indexes?\n\n       In principle, if not practice, a separate cost of living \n     index could be developed for each and every household based \n     upon their actual consumption basket and prices paid. As \n     noted above, the aggregate indexes use data reflecting \n     representative consumers. Some have suggested that different \n     groups in the population are likely to have faster or slower \n     growth in their cost of living than recorded by changes in \n     the CPI. We find no compelling evidence of this to date, and \n     in fact two studies suggest that disaggregating by population \n     group, for example by region or by age, would have little \n     effect on measured changes in the cost of living.\\22\\ \n     Further, work on this subject remains to be done.\n       Beyond the different consumption baskets, it is important \n     to understand our analysis of the sources of bias are applied \n     to representative or average consumers. Some consumers will \n     substitute more than others, and the substitution bias may be \n     larger for some, smaller for others. Likewise, some are more \n     likely to take advantage of discount outlets; others less so. \n     Perhaps more importantly, the benefits of quality change and \n     the introduction of new products may diffuse unevenly \n     throughout the population. Some will quickly gain the \n     benefits of cellular telephones, for example, while others \n     may wait many years or decades or never use them. This is yet \n     another reason why we have been very cautious in our point \n     estimates for these particular sources of bias.\n\n\n                             vi. conclusion\n\n       While the CPI is the best measure currently available, it \n     is not a true cost of living index. It suffers, as do all \n     price indices, from a variety of conceptual and practical \n     problems as the vehicle for measuring changes in the cost of \n     living. Despite important BLS updates and improvements in the \n     Consumer Price Index, it is likely that changes in the CPI \n     have substantially overstated the actual rate of price \n     inflation. Moreover, revisions have not been carried out in a \n     way that can provide an internally consistent series on the \n     cost of living over an extended span of time. More \n     importantly, changes in the Consumer Price Index are likely \n     to continue to overstate the change in the true cost of \n     living for the next few years. This overstatement will \n     have important unintended consequences, including \n     overindexing government outlays and tax rules and \n     increasing the federal deficit and debt. If the intent of \n     such indexing is to insulate recipients and taxpayers from \n     changes in the cost of living, use of the Consumer Price \n     Index has in the past, and will in the future, \n     overcompensate (on average) for changes in the true cost \n     of living.\n       Table 2 presents the Commission's evaluation of the biases \n     in using changes in the Consumer Price Index as a measure of \n     changes in the cost of living for the recent historical past \n     (the last few years). It presents point estimates, and \n     plausible ranges of values, for each of the five sources of \n     potential bias as well as the overall bias. Our best judgment \n     of the overstatement of the change in the cost of living \n     embedded in changes in the CPI for this historical period is \n     1.5% per annum. It is likely that a large bias also occurred \n     looking back over at least the last couple of decades, \n     perhaps longer, but we make no attempt to estimate its size.\n\n       TABLE 2.--ESTIMATES OF RECENT HISTORICAL BIASES IN THE CPI       \n                           [Percent per annum]                          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Source of bias                     Estimate    Range  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubstitution bias.................................        0.3    0.2-0.4\nOutlet bias.......................................        0.2    0.1-0.3\nFormula bias......................................        0.5    0.3-0.7\nQuality change....................................        0.2    0.2-0.6\nNew products......................................        0.3    0.2-0.7\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total.......................................        1.5    1.0-2.7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNB: Total bias assumed to be additive across types and independent of   \n  the level of inflation. See text.                                     \n\n       A plausible range of values is 1.0% to 2.7% per annum. The \n     point estimate of 1.5% includes 0.5% for formula bias, which \n     is the technical problem in using methods that impart an \n     upward bias in the movement from elementary or extremely \n     disaggregated price quotations to broader commodity groups. \n     The BLS is aware of this problem, and is moving to correct \n     it. Hopefully, it will be eliminated quickly.\n       Excluding formula bias, the point estimate is 1.0% per \n     annum, and the range is 0.7% to 2.0% per annum. Note that the \n     range of uncertainty is not symmetric around our point \n     estimate. It is far more likely that changes in the CPI have \n     embedded a larger than a smaller bias. The range of potential \n     upward bias is significantly larger because we have been \n     conservative in our point estimates of the biases from the \n     sources of quality change and new products. The conceptual \n     issues involved in measuring these two sources of bias are \n     even more difficult than the other sources, and the range of \n     studies upon which to base such conclusions at this point is \n     insufficient to support our ``best judgment'' as strongly as \n     those for the other sources of bias. Hence, we have been \n     especially cautious in these two areas.\n       Past is not necessarily prologue. What can we say about the \n     likely sources of bias moving forward, as opposed to \n     estimates of the biases looking back at recent history? We \n     believe the substitution bias is likely to be as large or \n     larger as in the recent past. It is likely that the \n     substitution bias will drift up a little bit, perhaps to 0.4 \n     %, until 1998 when the CPI will incorporate the new \n     expenditure weights from the 1993-95 expenditure survey. Note \n     that at that time the expenditure weights will still be four \n     years out of date and thus much substitution may have already \n     occurred. However, at that time it is likely that the \n     substitution bias will decrease considerably, to no more than \n     0.2%. As time moves on, it will likely drift up again. So, \n     even though the base year will be updated in 1998, it is \n     likely that for several years the substitution bias will \n     continue to be large then shrink for a short period before \n     gradually drifting back up again by the turn of the century. \n     Thus, a substitution bias on the order of 0.3% is likely to \n     be a good approximation on average for the next decade, \n     although not year by year.\n       Until and if procedures are changed, we expect the outlet \n     substitution bias to be approximately 0.2% per year. As noted \n     above, we believe the BLS has discovered, and is developing \n     procedures to eliminate, the formula bias. Our estimate for \n     the future of 0.0% assumes that the BLS will quickly and \n     completely remove the formula bias. To the extent that \n     methods are changed slowly or incompletely, a sizable formula \n     bias will remain. Thus, again, the 0.0% is perhaps \n     conservative, especially for the very short-run. Finally, our \n     estimates for quality change and new products of 0.2% and \n     0.3%, which, as discussed above, we believe to be quite \n     conservative, are likely to apply in the future as well.\n\n          TABLE 3.--ESTIMATES OF LIKELY FUTURE BIAS IN THE CPI          \n                           [Percent per annum]                          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Source of bias                     Estimate    Range  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubstitution bias.................................        0.3    0.2-0.4\nOutlet bias.......................................        0.2    0.1-0.3\nFormula bias......................................        0.0  .........\nQuality change....................................        0.2    0.2-0.6\nNew products......................................        0.3    0.2-0.7\n                                                   ---------------------\n      Total.......................................        1.0    0.7-2.0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAssumes BLS quickly and completely fixes the problem. Will continue to  \n  be substantial until this occurs.                                     \n\n       This brings our estimate of the upward bias of changes in \n     the CPI as a measure of the change in the cost of living to \n     1.0% per year. However, the certainty that the Commission \n     ascribes to alternative estimates clearly is greater the \n     lower the estimate within the plausible range. For example, \n     while 1.0% is our interim best estimate and likely to be \n     conservative, we are even more certain that the lower end of \n     our plausible range does not overstate the upward bias in the \n     CPI.\n       These separate biases are approximately additive and likely \n     to be independent of modest swings in the true inflation \n     rate. Thus, a bias of 1% implies that when changes in the CPI \n     show inflation rising from 3% to 5%, it is likely actually to \n     be rising from 2% to 4%. Note the bias primarily affects the \n     level, not the change, in the inflation rate. At very high \n     rates of inflation, the bias may increase (one might assume \n     greater outlet \n\n[[Page S 15462]]\n     and commodity substitution), but we currently have no evidence \n     regarding this issue.\n       Figure 2 shows the compounding effect over time of such a \n     bias on the index. While 1.0% may seem to be a small amount \n     in any given year, cumulatively year after year it adds up to \n     a sizable difference. [Figure 2 not reproducible in Record]\n       An additional word of caution is in order. This Commission \n     has thus far relied primarily on studies already produced \n     prior to the convening of the Commission, with a small amount \n     of additional work that we have been able to commission in \n     the two months since our inception. Thus, our judgments \n     reported above are not much advanced beyond what was \n     available in the three rounds of Senate Finance Committee \n     Hearings earlier this year. Given the short time available to \n     this Commission, there are many issues which we have not yet \n     been able to explore adequately. While we expect the interim \n     conclusions to hold up under further examination, they will \n     also be subject to amendment as we proceed with our \n     investigation.\n       In our final report we expect to have a more complete \n     analysis and evaluation and will certainly have specific \n     recommendations for procedures to improve and/or complement \n     the CPI. It may be possible to implement some of these \n     suggestions quickly, others may take considerable time and \n     additional resources.\n\n\n  members of the advisory commission to study the consumer price index\n\n       Michael J.

The estimates \n     are based on the assumption that the reduction would first be \n     reflected in the next automatic benefit increase, for \n     December 1995, or, alternatively, that the reduction would \n     first be reflected in the automatic benefit increase for \n     December 1996. The estimates are based on the intermediate \n     assumptions in the 1995 Trustees Report and are shown for the \n     combined OASI and DI Trust Funds.\n\n                                                                                                                                                        \n\n[[Page S 15463]]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               Reduction of 1%    Reduction of  \n                                                                                  effective      0.5% effective \n                                                                     Present     December--        December--   \n                                                                       law   -----------------------------------\n                                                                                1995     1996     1995     1996 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in actuarial balance over next 75 years (percent)...........  .......     1.44     1.41     0.74     0.73\nActuarial balance (percent)........................................    -2.17    -0.74    -0.76    -1.43    -1.44\nYear of exhaustion.................................................     2030     2049     2048     2036     2036\nFirst year in which outgo exceeds tax income.......................     2013     2018     2018     2015     2015\nMaximum trust fund ratio (percent).................................      269      408      397      332      327\nYear Maximum ratio is reached......................................     2011     2015     2015     2014     2014\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n                                              Harry C.

Mr. President, earlier today Senator Domenici inserted in \nthe Record a column by Charles Krauthammer that displays a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the operation of the Social Security trust funds \nand attacks my position on this issue. I ask unanimous consent that the \nresponse written by Senator Dorgan and me, which ran in the Washington \nPost on March 16, 1995, to correct the many factual and logical errors \nin Mr. Krauthammer's argument, also be published at an appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 1995]\n\n                             Unfair Looting\n\n                  (By Byron L. Dorgan and Kent Conrad)\n\n       Charles Krauthammer's uninformed defense of an indefensible \n     practice [``Social Security Trust Fund Whopper,'' oped, March \n     10] demonstrates that it is possible to be a celebrated \n     pundit yet know nothing of the subject about which one is \n     writing.\n       In attacking us for our position on the balanced-budget \n     amendment, Krauthammer misses the mark by a country mile on \n     two very important points. First, he insists incorrectly that \n     ``Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system'' that ``produces \n     a cash surplus'' because ``so many boomers are working \n     today.'' Second, he ignores the fact that Social Security \n     revenues were never meant to pay for expenses incurred in the \n     federal operating budget. Missing both fundamental points \n     undermines the credibility of Krauthammer's conclusions.\n       Here are the facts:\n       First, Social Security is not a pay-as-you-go system. If it \n     were, Social Security benefits would exactly equal taxes, and \n     there would be no surpluses. But there are. This year alone \n     Social Security is running a $69 billion surplus.\n       Apparently, Krauthammer completely missed the 1983 Social \n     Security Reform Act, which removed the system from a pay-as-\n     you-go basis. In 1983 Congress recognized that in order to \n     prepare for the future retirement needs of the baby boom \n     generation, we should raise more money from payroll taxes now \n     than is needed for current Social Security benefits. We did \n     that because when the baby boomers retire, there will not be \n     enough working Americans to cover Social Security benefits on \n     a pay-as-you-go basis. We will need accumulated surpluses to \n     pay these benefits.\n       Second, Social Security revenue is collected from the \n     paychecks of working men and women in the form of a dedicated \n     Social Security tax, deposited in a trust fund and invested \n     in government securities. This regressive, burdensome tax \n     (almost 73 percent of Americans who pay taxes pay more in \n     social insurance taxes than in income taxes) isn't like other \n     taxes. It has a specific use--retirement--as part of the \n     contract this nation made 60 years ago with working \n     Americans.\n       Because this tax is dedicated solely for working Americans' \n     future retirement, it shouldn't be used either for balancing \n     the operating budget or masking the size of the budget \n     deficit. Krauthammer not only irresponsibly condones the use \n     of the Social Security surpluses to do these things, he \n     thinks we should enshrine this procedure in our Constitution.\n       He apparently does so because he doesn't understand the \n     difference between balancing an operating budget and using \n     dishonest accounting gimmicks to hide operating losses. To \n     illustrate the difference and how it works to loot the Social \n     Security trust funds, let's use an example a little closer to \n     home for Krauthammer.\n       Assume that Krauthammer is paid a lucrative salary by The \n     Washington Post, which puts part of the salary into a company \n     retirement plan. Then let's assume The Washington Post comes \n     upon hard times and starts losing money each year.\n       Here's where honesty matters. The Post has two choices. It \n     could face up to its problems and move to balance its budget. \n     Or it could follow Krauthammer's prescription and disguise \n     its shortfall by raiding the employees' retirement fund to \n     make it appear that the operating budget is balanced. Of \n     course, the retirement fund would have nothing but IOUs in it \n     when it comes time for Krauthammer to retire. At that point, \n     even Krauthammer might recognize the fallacy of looting trust \n     funds to pay operating expenses.\n       Absurd? Sure. But the flawed Republican balanced-budget \n     amendment plan would in the same way keep on looting Social \n     Security trust funds to balance the federal operating budget. \n     Instead, we should take the honest course and begin the work \n     now to bring our federal operating budget into balance \n     without raiding the Social Security trust funds.\n       Contrary to Krauthammer's assertion, the only fraudulent \n     point about this issue was his uninformed column.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15463-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of Senate bill 1322, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1322) to provide for the relocation of the \n     United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am one of the original cosponsors of this \nlegislation and would like to begin the discussion of the legislation \nuntil the majority leader and the chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee have an opportunity to come to the floor and make \ntheir opening statements in support of S. 1322.\n  This is historic legislation. It is important legislation, for a \nvariety of reasons that affect everyone in this body and, frankly, most \nof the people in this country. It is a strong statement of foreign \npolicy implications. It is a strong statement in support of our \nlongstanding relationship with the State of Israel.\n  I want to begin by describing briefly what the legislation would do \nand what the rationale for the legislation is. The bill begins by \nmaking a series of findings which report on the history of the status \nof Jerusalem, leading up to some conclusions of policy by the U.S. \nGovernment. Let me state those conclusions of policy first.\n  The bill provides that:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that--\n       Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the \n     rights of every ethnic religious group are protected;\n       Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State \n     of Israel; and\n       the United States Embassy in Israel should be relocated to \n     Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n\n  The bill then goes on to provide a mechanism for the President to \nestablish, to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, and that that \nprocess would be completed by May 31, 1999. The bill originally \nprovided for a beginning date in 1996, but out of deference to concerns \nexpressed by the State Department and the President and others, that \nparticular provision was taken out of the bill, primarily because, of \ncourse, the key is the date that the Embassy is opened, not the date \nthat we begin construction on a new Embassy or the conversion of the \nexisting consulate into a new Embassy.\n  Let me now turn to the findings that are stated in this legislation \nand then discuss a little bit of the history of this particular matter:\n\n       Each sovereign nation, under international law and custom, \n     may designate its own capital.\n\n  And that is the first finding that we make.\n\n       Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of \n     the State of Israel.\n\n  The second finding.\n\n       [It is] the seat of Israel's President, Parliament, and \n     Supreme Court, and the site of numerous government ministries \n     and social and cultural institutions.\n\n  That is our third finding.\n  In No. 4 we make the point that:\n\n       The city of Jerusalem is the spiritual center of Judaism, \n     and is also considered a holy city by the members of other \n     religious faiths.\n       (5) From 1948-1967, Jerusalem was a divided city and \n     Israeli citizens of all faiths as well as Jewish citizens of \n     all states were denied access to holy sites in the area \n     controlled [then] by Jordan.\n\n  The sixth finding of this legislation is that:\n\n\n[[Page S 15464]]\n\n       In 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the \n     conflict known as the Six Day War.\n       Since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city administered \n     by Israel, and persons of all religious faiths have been \n     guaranteed full access to holy sites within the city.\n\n  We make a point in finding No. 8 that:\n\n       This year marks the 28th consecutive year that Jerusalem \n     has been administered as a unified city in which the rights \n     of all faiths have been respected and protected.\n\n  We further find:\n\n       In 1990 the Congress unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 106, which declares that the Congress, [and I am \n     quoting from the resolution now] ``strongly believes that \n     Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights \n     of every ethnic religious group are protected.''\n\n  In finding No. 10 we make the point that:\n\n       In 1992, the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 113 of the One Hundred Second Congress to \n     commemorate the 25th anniversary of the reunification of \n     Jerusalem, and reaffirming congressional sentiment that \n     Jerusalem must remain an undivided city.\n\n  Finding No. 11 is that:\n\n       The September 13, 1993, Declaration of Principles on \n     Interim Self-Government Arrangements lays out a timetable for \n     the resolution of ``final status'' issues, including \n     Jerusalem.\n\n  No. 12 is that:\n\n       The agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area was \n     signed May 4, 1994, beginning the five-year transitional \n     period laid out in the Declaration of Principles.\n\n  And further, in point No. 13, that:\n\n       In March of 1995, 93 members of the United States Senate \n     signed a letter to the Secretary of State Warren Christopher \n     encouraging ``planning to begin now'' for relocation of the \n     United States Embassy to the city of Jerusalem.\n       The United States maintains its embassy in the functioning \n     capital of every country in the world except in the case of \n     our democratic friend and strategic ally, the State of \n     Israel.\n\n  That is the 14th finding of this legislation.\n  The 15th finding is to note that:\n\n       The United States conducts official meetings and other \n     business in the city of Jerusalem in de facto recognition of \n     its status as the capital of Israel.\n\n  Finally and importantly we note that:\n\n       In 1996, the State of Israel will celebrate the 3,000th \n     anniversary of the Jewish presence in Jerusalem since King \n     David's entry.\n\n  And, therefore, as a result of these findings, as I say, we declare \nit to be the policy of the United States that:\n\n       Jerusalem should remain an undivided city,\n       [2] Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the \n     State of Israel; and\n       [3] the United States Embassy in Israel should be relocated \n     to Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n\n  As the mechanism for ensuring that this policy is adhered to, and \nthat the Embassy is in fact opened on that date or before then, the \nCongress ensures that:\n\n       Not more than 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the \n     Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for ``Acquisition \n     and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad'' may be obligated until \n     the Secretary of State determines and reports to the Congress \n     that the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has officially \n     opened.\n\n  So, Mr. President, that is the essence of this legislation. As I \nsaid, I think it represents an important milestone in the relationship \nbetween the United States and Israel, one of the strongest friends of \nthe United States, but a State which has its capital in the city of \nJerusalem and the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv. This legislation \nremedies that and ensures that the new Embassy will open by May 31, \n1999, in Jerusalem.\n  Let me go into a little bit more of the history of this, in order to, \nI think, assure everyone of the reasons why this is so important and \nwhy we need to do it now. The United States Government has refused \nofficial recognition of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem for various \nreasons since Israel's inception, at first in line with the never \nimplemented 1947 U.N. General Assembly partition recommendation for \nwestern Palestine. U.S. policy supported a special international \nstatus, corpus separatum, as it was called, for the city of Jerusalem. \nThe impractical notion actually appealed to neither the Jews nor the \nArabs, and in 1948, the Arab Legion conquered east Jerusalem, including \nthe old city, as part of the general Arab military offensive to prevent \nIsrael from coming into being. Israel retained control over west \nJerusalem.\n  When east Jerusalem was under Arab rule, many Jews were prohibited \nfrom visiting their holy places and the synagogues in the old city were \nrazed and Jewish burial places were desecrated.\n  In 1967, as Egypt and Syria moved again toward war with Israel, the \nIsrael Government urged King Hussein of Jordan to sit out the fighting \nand promised the territories he controlled would be left alone if he \ndid so. The King failed to heed the warning. He attacked Israel and, as \nwe all know, in the ensuing fighting he lost east Jerusalem and the \nWest Bank.\n  Israel, under the Labor Party leadership at the time, declared that \nJerusalem will remain undivided forever, as Israel's capital, and all \npeople will have free access to their holy places.\n  Since 1967, the policy and practice of the U.S. Government regarding \nJerusalem has, unfortunately, been somewhat inconsistent.\n  United States officials have often explained our Government's \nunwillingness to recognize Israeli sovereignty over any of Jerusalem on \nthe grounds that the city status should be resolved through Arab-\nIsraeli negotiations, or at that particular moment in time it was \ndifficult, if not a good thing to do, in view of the relationships \nexisting between the parties at those times.\n  On the other hand, our Government has repeatedly said that we do not \nfavor redivision of the city. Yet, the State Department makes a point \nof prohibiting United States officials from visiting east Jerusalem \nunder Israeli auspices. In other words, for purposes of official visits \nof Jerusalem, the United States Government distinguishes between east \nand west Jerusalem. But as proposals have been made over the years to \nmove the United States Embassy to west Jersualem--I note west Jerusalem \nand not east Jerusalem--the State Department refused on the grounds \nthat we do not distinguish between east and west Jerusalem, and do not \nrecognize anyone's sovereign claims to any of Jerusalem.\n  The only thing consistent about United States policy on Jerusalem, \nunfortunately, is its antagonism to Israel's claim there. In my view, \nthis policy is unprincipled, notwithstanding the fact that on many \noccasions it was urged in support of positions on which we were \nsupporting the Government of Israel. But I still believe, and I think \none of the reasons for this legislation is, that the policy has not \nbeen viewed as principled, but rather entirely too pragmatic depending \nupon the circumstances of the time, and that view, in my personal \nopinion, is unworthy of the United States, and, frankly, as I will \nexplain later, I believe unhelpful to the cause of peace.\n  Notwithstanding the several peace agreements that Israel has signed \nwith its neighbors, Arab enemies of the Jewish state continue to insist \nthat Israel is not legitimate, that it has no right to exist on what \nthey deem to be Arab land. The international community, acting through \nthe League of Nations and in the United Nations, based its \nacknowledgement of Jewish people's national rights in Palestine on the \nhistorical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine.\n  Though the long war against Zionism and Israel is now checked on the \nmilitary level, it continues on the battlefield of ideas. That is why \nthe actions of the United States with regard to a very tangible matter, \nthe location of our Embassy, is so very, very important. It matters \nwhat position the United States takes in this battleground of ideas. \nAnd in this particular war, Israel's enemies have worked to not \nlegitimize Israel, to deny the significance of the historical \nconnection that I referred to before between the Jews and Zion, and to \nfoster hope that someday Israel, perhaps then abandoned by its friends \nand exhausted by the unremitting hostility and violence of its foes, \ncan be made to disappear, first as the Christian Crusaders of the \nMiddle Ages wore worn down and ultimately expelled from the Holy Land.\n  The belief that Israel's friends are unreliable and Israel's resolve \nis weak is a major impediment to true Arab-Israeli peace. Unrealistic \nexpectations on the part of Arab parties about Jerusalem make peace \nharder to achieve.\n\n[[Page S 15465]]\n\n  The Jerusalem Embassy relocation bill aims to close the question of \nUnited States support for Israel's rights in its own capital. I want to \nrestate the point, Mr. President, because it is the critical reason why \nthis legislation is brought before the U.S. Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives at this time. This bill, the Jerusalem Embassy \nrelocation bill, aims to close the question of United States support \nfor Israel's rights in its own capital. It aims at the heart of the \nlegitimacy issue, for Jerusalem is the essence of the historical \nconnection of the Jewish people with Palestine. The interest of peace, \nin my view, is not served by anyone thinking that Israel can be divided \nfrom the United States over the Jerusalem issue. It is an error to \nsuppose the United States is more effective diplomatically when we pose \nas a neutral, honest broker between the Israelis and the Arabs seeking \npeace in the region.\n  U.S. influence does not derive from any claim of neutrality on our \npart in this particular conflict, although it is important that Arabs \ninterested in peace understand the important bona fides of the United \nStates in this question of peace. Rather, U.S. influence, I submit, \nderives from our status as a great power, the intensity of our worthy \nconvictions, and our loyalty to our friends. And, if all three of those \ncircumstances are well understood by all of the parties, it will be \nmuch easier for a true and lasting peace to be achieved, a peace which \nis so fragile that it can be jeopardized by the question of whether the \nUnited States should relocate its Embassy to west Jerusalem, a peace \nwhich is bound to fail on other grounds and, therefore, a peace not \nworth having. We want a lasting peace. The Israelis want a lasting \npeace. And I know that Arabs of good will want a lasting peace. And a \nlasting peace is based upon a bedrock of good faith and principles that \nare not inconsistent between the peacemaking parties.\n  If there are fundamental--fundamental--differences between the \npeacemaking parties, then the peace becomes too fragile to be \nsustained. And after thousands of years of conflict in this region, Mr. \nPresident, the people of this region deserve to have the opportunity to \nlive in peace with each other as friends and under circumstances in \nwhich there is not always the cloud of uncertainty and even war and \nwhen there is not the cloud of danger in the streets which exists as it \ndoes today.\n  The many, many people of this body and the House of Representatives \nwhich support this legislation do so because we believe it will send a \nprincipled and constructive signal to all of the parties in the Arab-\nIsraeli negotiations and establish the United States position in \nsupport of the State of Israel in clear and unmistakable terms.\n  Mr. President, before I turn the podium over, I want to acknowledge a \ncouple of other points of view and some people who have been very \ninstrumental in bringing this legislation forward.\n  The majority leader, Senator Dole, has made stirring speeches in \nsupport of this legislation and believes in his heart that it is the \nbest way to proceed in order to make the kind of statement that I spoke \nof a moment ago. And he is joined by all of the original cosponsors \nwith that idea in mind.\n  There are other Members of this body who have worked very hard to \ndevelop the language that would be most satisfactory to the Members of \nthis body as well as to the President and to his Cabinet. Senator \nLieberman from Connecticut is one of the people who has worked very \nlong and hard to bring these ideas together and to try to achieve a \nvery broad consensus so that when this legislation passes, it is with a \nbroad bipartisan degree of support and, hopefully, the support of the \nadministration as well.\n  Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is here, the Senator from California, \nand Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey have been engaged in meetings. \nThey have to some degree a somewhat different point of view as to how \nthis legislation will work out in terms of the negotiations that are \ncurrently pending between the Israelis and the Arabs in the region. But \nit is their desire, no less than mine and the other cosponsors, that we \nwork toward the day when we can achieve the situation that this bill \nwould achieve--namely, the relocation of the Embassy in Jerusalem.\n  So let there be no doubt that, though some Members of this body may \nhave somewhat different views as to how best to achieve this objective, \nwe are united in the objective, and we are determined to reach a point \nwhere the legislation can move forward with a strong bipartisan degree \nof consensus and eventually the support of the administration.\n  Mr. President, with that opening statement and with the desire that \nwhen Senator Dole or Senator Helms are able to come to the floor to \nmake their opening statements in support of the bill, I would be happy \nto relinquish the floor at this time to someone on the other side who \nwould wish to make a statement.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, let me stand and say that I support \nthis legislation and intend to vote for it. I think it is very worthy \nlegislation. I recognize the role that has been played by the Senator \nfrom Arizona, by Senator Dole, by Senator Feinstein, by Senator \nLieberman, by Senator Lautenberg, and some others. I think this is the \nright thing to do, and I will be voting for it.\n  Mr. President, two additional items. The comments made previously by \nthe Senator from Arizona discussed votes that had been cast by Senator \nConrad any myself in previous budget issues. I shall not respond to \nthem in this discussion. I will at some point later. But they are not \nat all related to the issue which we are discussing on the floor of the \nSenate. To change the subject of the debate, when it is the equivalent \nof getting lost and then claiming where you ended up was where you \nintended to be, is interesting but not, in my judgment, very useful.\n  So I will discuss that at some later point this afternoon when I take \nthe floor.\n  I would want to say this, however. I intend to submit an amendment to \nthe desk in a moment. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on a \nsubject unrelated to the central part of this bill, and I do it because \nit is the only opportunity I have to offer it prior to the \nreconciliation bill coming to the floor. I will agree to a very short \ntime limit, 10 minutes, 5 on each side, or 10 on each side. I do want \nto get a vote. But it is my intention to offer it. It can be set aside \nas far as I am concerned and I will agree to a very brief time limit.\n  So, Mr. President, again, because circumstances prevented me in \nrecent days from offering this sense-of-the-Senate amendment and \nbecause this is the only circumstance in which one can be offered, I \nwould say to those who are worried about this holding up the bill, I do \nnot intend to do that at all. I will agree to 5 minutes on each side, \nand we will no doubt have some votes at some point and I hope the \nSenate would express itself on this.\n  As the Presiding Officer and other Members know, we are very limited \nin our ability to address a number of issues that are very important in \nthis Chamber. Often we are required to do so in this manner, a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution on a piece of legislation that is unrelated. \nBut I do not intend in any way to hold this piece of legislation up. I \nwill agree to the shortest of all time agreements if the majority \nwishes, 5 or 10 minutes on each side.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2940\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on tax cuts and Medicare)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nit be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2940.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BUDGET PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     1996 (H. Con. Res. 67) calls for $245 billion in tax \n     reductions and $270 billion in rejected spending reductions \n     from Medicare;\n\n[[Page S 15466]]\n\n       (2) reducing projected Medicare spending by $270 billion \n     could substantially increase out-of-pocket health care costs \n     for senior citizens, reduce the quality of care available to \n     Medicare beneficiaries and threaten the financial health of \n     some health care providers, especially in rural areas;\n       (3) seventy-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries have \n     annual incomes of less than $25,000;\n       (4) most of the tax cuts in the tax bill passed by the \n     House of Representatives (H.R. 1215) go to families making \n     over $100,000 per year, according to the Office of Tax \n     Analysis of the United States Department of the Treasury.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should approve no tax legislation which \n     reduces taxes for those making over $250,000 per year; and\n       (2) the savings from limiting any tax reductions in this \n     way should be used to reduce any cuts in projected Medicare \n     spending.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nonly on S. 1322.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Excuse me, Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nunder the terms the Senator from California has outlined, namely that \nshe will speak only on the Jerusalem resolution, after which another \nquorum call would be called for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the legislation before the \nSenate, S. 1322, a bill that essentially expresses the sense-of-\nCongress that Jerusalem should remain undivided and be the capital of \nIsrael, and that it should be the site of the location of the United \nStates Embassy at a date certain, namely May 1999.\n  Mr. President, many people have participated in this discussion. And \nI know Senator Lautenberg, with whom I have been working, wishes to \nspeak. I want to thank the majority leader for working with those of us \nthat have concerns on this legislation. I know that there are \ndiscussions ongoing.\n  Senators Lautenberg, Lieberman, Levin, and I just had a discussion. \nAnd I believe Senator Lieberman is going to talk with Senator Kyl and \nSenator Dole on what our conclusions are.\n  For the purposes of these comments, I would like to make some general \ncomments about the intentions of this legislation. Let me state what I \nbelieve some basic truths to be.\n  The first basic truth is that the United States of America has an \nabsolute right to place its Embassy in a capital city, any capital \ncity. Clearly, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. We need no one's \npermission to do so, and we need no piece of legislation to do so. This \nissue has been one that has percolated for a long, long time with a \ngreat deal of impatience on the part of many people who say, ``Why \nhasn't the Embassy been relocated to Jerusalem prior to this time?''\n  Having said that, we have another basic truth, and that is that \nIsrael can survive long-term as a Jewish democratic state only if there \nis peace, if that peace is recognized and bought into by Israel's \nneighbors, and that there are safe and secure borders. Therefore, the \npeace process now ongoing is key and critical to the long-term survival \nof the State of Israel.\n  Jerusalem is many things to many people. All one has to do is spend \nsome time there to see the Mount of Olives, the concept of the promised \nland, the Garden of Gethsemane, the home of more than 40 Christian \ndenominations, the home of the Moslem religion, the home of the \nArmenian Patriarch, the Western Wall, a magical and mystical place, a \nsource of religion throughout the world.\n  The only democracy in the Middle East rests within the State of \nIsrael; and yet it has been the site of hatred, war, and conflict \ndating from the Crusades and even back before that time. So it is a \ndifficult and complicated subject. However, I want to say this, that I, \nlike most Americans, believe that the U.S. Embassy should be located in \nJerusalem. But as this bill was originally presented, there were \nconcerns about the bill.\n  Originally, the bill that was introduced had 62 Senators on it. This \nbill has 69 Senators. So there is a very strong bulwark of support for \nthe bill.\n  Some concerns remain even about the new text of the bill. Chief among \nthese concerns for all of us is what the Chief Executive of this Nation \nwill do. Many of us believe that whatever the politics surrounding this \nbill, we can all agree that to have a divisive vote on an issue around \nwhich there has always been consensus and to go through the \nunpleasantness of a veto confrontation, even with a successful override \nvote, would not be to anyone's benefit. Most of all, going through that \nprocess would be to the detriment of Jerusalem and Israel, as doubts \nabout the U.S. commitment on this issue would certainly emerge.\n  So for all those for whom Jerusalem is important and vital, I cannot \nimagine a more devastating outcome to the first legislation ever sent \nto a President mandating moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem than to \nhave this legislation vetoed. For that reason, I think it is imperative \nthat we try to address the concerns that exist about the bill. And we \nhave tried to do that in conversations that have taken place on Friday \nand taken place today as well.\n  One of the administration's concerns is that the bill in its current \nform does not provide a degree of flexibility in the end date by which \nan Embassy must be established in Jerusalem. We are hopeful that waiver \nlanguage can be agreed upon by all the parties concerned that would \nallow the President under certain key conditions, best defined as \nnational security interests, to suspend any necessary provisions of \nthis bill related to the timetable if there was a determination that it \nwas in the national security interest to do so.\n  I suspect we can all agree that the President should, whenever \npossible, be granted this kind of flexibility. As a matter of fact, it \nis within his own constitutional responsibility to be able to do so.\n  One of my concerns, for example, is that the move of our Embassy \ncould overlap with key events unfolding in the Middle East peace \nprocess. In the opinion of this Senator, and perhaps some others would \nagree, the conclusion of a comprehensive peace between Israel and its \nneighbors is in the national security interests of the United States.\n  The bill, in its current form, would require the new Embassy to be \nopened by May 31, 1999, regardless of what is happening in the peace \nprocess. May 1999 is, of course, also the deadline Israel and the \nPalestinians have set for themselves to complete final status talks and \nalso the transition period. But we all know that despite good will on \nboth sides and a series of important agreements, Israel and the \nPalestinians have missed virtually every deadline they have set during \nthe course of the peace process.\n  First, the agreement on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, scheduled \nto be signed in December 1993 and implemented by April 1994, was signed \nand implemented in May 1994.\n  Second, Palestinian elections were supposed to take place in July \n1994. They have not. Now the commitment is that they would take place \nprior to Ramadan, hopefully in January 1996, a year and a half later.\n  Third, for weeks leading up to the recent agreement on Israeli \nredeployment in the West Bank, the negotiators set numerous deadlines \nfor themselves that went unmet.\n  With all of this background, can we accurately predict that a peace \nprocess will definitely conclude on May 4, 1999, as scheduled? Of \ncourse not. It is a difficult, fluid process, but it is working. The \nPresident should have the ability and the flexibility to postpone \nactions \n\n[[Page S 15467]]\nthat might have an impact on the negotiations if they were taken at a \nsensitive moment in the talks. The waiver, we hope, will be forthcoming \nas a product of these discussions and would provide, we believe, that \nkind of flexibility.\n  Another purpose of a waiver amendment is to address the \nadministration's constitutional concerns about this bill. The State \nDepartment has made it clear that they will recommend against the \nsignature of a bill that they deem interferes with the constitutional \nprerogatives to conduct foreign policy. They have also indicated their \nstrong objection to a specific date for location or establishment of \nthe Embassy in Jerusalem.\n  Specifically, the President interprets this bill to infringe upon his \nconstitutional prerogatives by forcing him to establish an Embassy by a \nspecific date, at a specific location. But by providing a sufficient \nwaiver, renewable, if need be, the President has the opportunity to \ntemporarily delay implementation of section 3(b), the timetable under \nthis bill, should he find that it harms the peace process, to the \nextent of violating what we hope will be in the waiver, national \nsecurity interests.\n  There is no question that Congress and the executive branch \nfrequently have differing interpretations of the constitutionality of \nparticular statutes. I do not expect all of my colleagues to agree with \nevery aspect of the President's interpretation. Indeed, there are \naspects of his interpretation with which I disagree.\n  But, in the interest of allowing the administration's views to speak \nfor themselves, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks a legal analysis of the earlier \nversion, S. 770, prepared by the Justice Department, and a June 20, \n1995 letter from the Secretary of State to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Nevertheless, despite our \ndiffering interpretations, we must face facts, and the fact is that the \nState Department has determined that the President should veto the bill \nin its current form.\n  As I said before, the damage that would result to Jerusalem, first \nand foremost, and to our common cause of moving the Embassy there from \npassing a bill that could get vetoed cold be irreparable. So I am \nhopeful that this bill will not be vetoed.\n   Mr. President, with a sufficient waiver, we can pass a bill that \nmandates the moving of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, but \nallows the President to waive the timing of the establishment of the \nEmbassy in Jerusalem if national security interests are involved.\n  This would be first-time legislation, the first time a bill on this \nissue has been passed, and I think that is extraordinarily important.\n  I must say, I have never conceived of this issue as a litmus test of \none's support for Israel. I find deeply committed friends of Israel \nholding a wide variety of views on the question of when and how to move \nthe United States Embassy to Jerusalem, and on these bills.\n  As for the debate in Congress, let us establish a basic understanding \nthat all participants in this debate agree on one fundamental truth: \nthat united Jerusalem is and will remain as the capital of Israel.\n  So Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital has never been in question \nhere. The debate is, instead, focused on a side debate to the central \nissue, the placement of the Embassy, and I, like my colleagues, believe \nthere is basic agreement in this body, and I share the view of my \ncolleagues, that the United States Embassy in Israel does, indeed, \nbelong in Jerusalem. It is elementary that a sovereign nation, as I \nhave pointed out, has that right to place an Embassy at the site of a \nnation's capital with whom it enjoys diplomatic relations.\n  So this should not in all logic, in all reason, in all sovereign \npower be privy to negotiations having to do with peace and security \nbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and the State of Israel, \nor between the State of Jordan and the State of Israel, or between any \nof the Arab neighbors and the State of Israel. However, there is one \nimportant point, and I think this is where we need to be very careful \nthat we are not provocative.\n  There was a letter sent to Secretary of State Christopher sponsored \nby the two distinguished Senators from New York, Senator Moynihan and \nSenator D'Amato, last March. I joined with 92 of my colleagues in \nsigning this letter in which we said, and I quote:\n\n       We believe that the United States embassy belongs in \n     Jerusalem. It would be most appropriate for planning to begin \n     now to ensure such a move no later than the agreements on \n     permanent status take effect and the transition period is \n     ended which, according to the Declaration of Principles, is \n     scheduled for May 1999.\n\n  This letter, I believe, reflected a true consensus on this issue in \nthe Senate and, to a great extent, in the community affected. In a \nletter to the Jewish Press on April 7, 1995, Senator Moynihan explained \nwhy the letter was written, and I quote:\n\n       Senator D'Amato and I chose to write a letter rather than \n     to introduce legislation because we wanted to secure maximum \n     public support for the proposition that united Jerusalem is \n     the capital of Israel and the appropriate home of our \n     embassy.\n\n  So when legislation was introduced on this issue in May, however, the \nconsensus cracked and then, as we know, with the earlier bill, 62 \nSenators signed on.\n  There was one point in that earlier bill that very deeply concerned \nme, and that was the provision that the commencement of construction on \nthe Embassy site in West Jerusalem would begin in 1996, and I felt that \nthat could truly be provocative, be disturbing to the peace process at \nthis very difficult time, particularly in view of the fact that \nPalestinian elections for the first time have not yet taken place and \nare about to take place. And we now know that the date agreed to is \nprior to Ramadan or in January of next year. Therefore, to mandate the \nbeginning of construction in 1996 could be, I think, unintentionally, \nbut very realistically, provocative and something that we would not \nwant to do.\n  The leader, in his wisdom, and I am grateful and thankful for this, \nand Senator Kyl agreed, did remove that section and, hence, that laid \nthe basis for the new legislation which is before us today, entitled \nSenate bill 1322. So my major concern has really been addressed, and I \nam very pleased and grateful for that. The concern expressed then that \nthe original bill might precipitate a difficult situation I think has \nbeen remedied.\n  There was also a lack of consensus at that time in statements that \nwere issued by a number of major American Jewish organizations who felt \nthat the objectives of the legislation were good but hoped that \neverybody would come together and agree on a piece of legislation that \nwould not be provocative to the peace process but could establish the \nintent with the clarity of law, in this body and the House, for the \nfirst time in the history of debate over this issue.\n  I believe that if we can agree on waiver language that does not limit \nthe constitutional authority of the President, that we will have given \nthe bill the necessary features to meet a variety of needs. For the \nfirst time, we will have mandated in law the move of the U.S. Embassy \nto Jerusalem, an important achievement, and a variety of preparations \nfor that move spelled out in the timing of report language.\n  We will have also provided the President with the flexibility to \npostpone the actual move if events in the Middle East peace process or \nother U.S. National security interests warrant it, and I believe this \nis a responsible way for the Congress to legislate in this area.\n  I think that, as we vote on this bill, we should be aware that some \nof the leading Middle East experts in the administration do worry, \nstill, about its impact on the peace process--not in 1999, but today. I \nthink this Government is so privileged to have one of the most skillful \nand determined young negotiators I have met, in the person of Dennis \nRoss. His perspicacity, his energy, his undying commitment to this \nprocess has really been helpful in America playing the role of the \nhonest broker, in sitting down with the two sides, and in being \nresponsible for bringing the chairman of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of \nIsrael, the President of Egypt, the King of Jordan, and a host of other \ndignitaries from the European Union, \n\n[[Page S 15468]]\ntogether recently at the White House to witness what was an \nunbelievable signing. I, for one, during many times in the past decades \nthought we would never see that day. But, Mr. President, we did see \nthat day, and a lot of it is due to the skill and dedication of Dennis \nRoss. I think that has to be said.\n  Mr. Ross has warned that passing this legislation could now \ncomplicate the already-difficult implementation of the recent agreement \non redeployment in the West Bank. He is also concerned that Jerusalem \ncould become a central issue in the upcoming Palestinian election now \nscheduled for January, which would likely play to the radical faction \nand put Chairman Arafat in a very difficult position. Martin Indyk, our \nAmbassador to Israel, at his confirmation hearing in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, at which I was present, has echoed many of these \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I raise these issues simply because I believe we \nshould be aware of what people in the administration--in an \nadministration that has been extremely supportive of Israel--are \nthinking about this legislation. This administration has achieved \nsomething that has never in the history of the area been achieved, and \nthat is an agreement which may guarantee safe and secure borders and \npeace between the small, tiny State of Israel and the Arab nations that \nsurround it. And its importance cannot be overlooked in that regard.\n  So I am looking for a way that we can indicate the rights of the \nsovereign nation by saying that we should place our Embassy in \nJerusalem, that it should be the policy of the Congress that Jerusalem \nis the capital and that Jerusalem should remain undivided, without \npresenting a provocation in what I think is the most important process \nfor peace ongoing, certainly, in the history of the Middle East.\n  I am hopeful that the negotiations now ongoing will be able to \nprovide that form of waiver. I think it is vital--a waiver that does \nnot in any way compromise the President's constitutional authority. So \nat this time I would like to yield the floor, and I will have more to \nsay when those negotiations are completed.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                      Office of Legal Counsel,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1995.\n     Memorandum for Abner J. Mikva, Counsel to the President.\n     From: Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General.\n     Re Bill to relocate United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to \n         Jerusalem.\n       This is to provide you with our views on S. 770, a bill \n     introduced by Senator Dole and others, ``[t]o provide for the \n     relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to \n     Jerusalem, and for other purposes.'' The provisions of this \n     bill that render the Executive Branch's ability to obligate \n     appropriated funds conditional upon the construction and \n     opening of the United States Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem \n     invade exclusive Presidential authorities in the field of \n     foreign affairs and are unconstitutional.\n       The bill states that\n       [i]t is the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the \n     State of Israel;\n       (2) groundbreaking for construction of the United States \n     Embassy in Jerusalem should begin no later than December 31, \n     1996; and\n       (3) the United States Embassy should be officially open in \n     Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n       Section 3(a).\n       The bill requires that not more than 50% of the funds \n     appropriated to the State Department for FY 1997 for \n     ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Building Abroad'' may be \n     obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports \n     to Congress that construction has begun on the site of the \n     United States Embassy in Jerusalem. Section 3(b). Further, \n     not more than 50% of the funds appropriated to the State \n     Department for FY 1999 for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of \n     Buildings Abroad'' may be obligated until the Secretary \n     determines and reports to Congress that the United States \n     Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened. Section 3(c).\n       Of the funds appropriated for FY 1995 for the State \n     Department and related agencies, not less than $5,000,000 \n     ``shall be made available until expended'' for costs \n     associated with relocating the United States Embassy in \n     Israel to Jerusalem. Section 4. Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated in FY 1996 and FY 1997 for the State Department \n     for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad, ``not \n     less than $25,000,000 (in FY 1996) and $75,000,000 (in FY \n     1997) ``shall be made available until expended'' for costs \n     associated with, respectively, the relocation of the United \n     States Embassy to Jerusalem, and the construction and \n     relocation of the Embassy. Section 5.\n       The Secretary is required to report to Congress not later \n     than 30 days after enactment ``detailing the Department of \n     State's plan to implement this Act.'' Section 6. Beginning on \n     January 1, 1996, and every six months thereafter, the \n     Secretary is to report to Congress ``on the progress made \n     toward opening the United States Embassy in Jerusalem.'' \n     Section 7.\n       It is well settled that the Constitution vests the \n     President with the exclusive authority to conduct the \n     Nation's diplomatic relations with other States. This \n     authority flows, in large part, from the President's position \n     as Chief Executive, U.S. Const. art, II, Sec. 1, cl. 1, and \n     as Commander in Chief, id. art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 1. It also \n     derives from the President's more specific powers to ``make \n     Treaties,'' id. art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2; to ``appoint \n     Ambassadors . . . and Consuls,'' id.; and to ``receive \n     Ambassadors and other public Ministers,'' id., art. II, \n     Sec. 3. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the \n     President's authority with respect to the conduct of \n     diplomatic relations. See, e.g., Department of Navy v. Egan \n     484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988) (the Supreme Court has ``recognized \n     `the generally accepted view that foreign policy was the \n     province and responsibility of the Executive' '') (quoting \n     Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 293-94 (1981)), Alfred Dunhill of \n     London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U.S. 682, 705-06 n. 18 \n     (1976) (``the conduct of [foreign policy] is committed \n     primarily to the Executive Branch''); United States v. \n     Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 35 (1960) (President is ``the \n     constitutional representative of the United States in its \n     dealings with foreign nations''). See also Ward v. Shannon, \n     943 F.2d 157, 160 (1st Cir. 1991) (Breyer, J.) (``the \n     Constitution makes the Executive Branch . . . primarily \n     responsible'' for the exercise of ``the foreign affairs \n     power''), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1558 (1992); Sanchez-\n     Espinoza v. Reagan, 770 F.2d 202, 210 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n     (Scalia, J.) (``broad leeway'' is ``traditionally accorded \n     the Executive in matters of foreign affairs''). Accordingly, \n     we have affirmed that the Constitution ``authorize[s] the \n     President to determine the form and manner in which the \n     United States will maintain relations with foreign nations.'' \n     Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and \n     Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16 Op. O.L.C. 18, 21 \n     (1992) (preliminary print).\n       Furthermore, the President's recognition power is \n     exclusive. See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. \n     398, 410 (1964) (``[p]olitical recognition is exclusively a \n     function of the Executive''); see also Restatement (Third) of \n     the Foreign Relations Law of the United States Sec. 204 \n     (1987) (``the President has exclusive authority to recognize \n     or not to recognize a foreign state or government, and to \n     maintain or not to maintain diplomatic relations with a \n     foreign government''). It is well established, furthermore, \n     that this power is not limited to the bare act of according \n     diplomatic recognition to a particular government, but \n     encompasses as well the authority to take such actions as are \n     necessary to make the power of recognition an effective tool \n     of United States foreign policy. United States v. Pink, 315 \n     U.S. 203, 229 (1942) (The authority to recognize governments \n     ``is not limited to a determination of the government to be \n     recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy \n     which is to govern the question of recognition.'').\n       The proposed bill would severely impair the President's \n     constitutional authority to determine the form and manner of \n     the Nation's diplomatic relations. The bill seeks to \n     effectuate the policy objectives that ``Jerusalem should be \n     recognized as the capital of the State of Israel'' and that \n     ``the United States Embassy should be officially open in \n     Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.'' ``To those ends, it \n     would prohibit the Executive Branch from obligating more than \n     a fixed percentage of the funds appropriated to the State \n     Department for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' in FY 1997 until the Secretary determines and \n     reports to Congress that construction has begun on the site \n     of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. It would also \n     prohibit the Executive Branch from obligating more than a \n     fixed percentage of the funds appropriated for the same \n     purpose for FY 1999 until the Secretary determines and \n     reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in \n     Jerusalem has ``officially opened.''\n       By thus conditioning the Executive Branch's ability to \n     obligate appropriated funds, the bill seeks to compel the \n     President to build and to open a United States Embassy to \n     Israel at a site of extraordinary international concern and \n     sensitivity. We believe that Congress cannot constitutionally \n     constrain the President in such a manner.\n       In general, because the venue at which diplomatic relations \n     occur is itself often diplomatically significant, Congress \n     may not impose on the President its own foreign policy \n     judgments as to the particular sites at which the United \n     States' diplomatic relations are to take place. More \n     specifically, Congress cannot trammel the President's \n     constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's foreign \n     affairs and to recognize foreign governments by directing the \n     relocation of an embassy. This is particularly true where, as \n     here, the location of the embassy is not only of great \n     significance in establishing the United States' relationship \n     with a single country, but may well also determine our \n     relations with an entire region of the world. Finally, to the \n     extent that S. 770 is intended to affect recognition policy \n     with respect to Jerusalem, it is inconsistent with the \n     exclusivity of the President's recognition power. \n\n[[Page S 15469]]\n\n       Our conclusions are not novel. With respect to the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act, FY 1994 & 1995, which included \n     provisions purporting to require the establishment of an \n     office in Lhasa, Tibet, the President stated that he would \n     ``implement them to the extent consistent with [his] \n     constitutional responsibilities.'' Statement by the President \n     at 2 (Apr. 30, 1994). The Reagan Administration objected in \n     1984 to a bill to compel the relocation of the United States \n     Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, on the grounds that \n     the decision was ``so closely connected with the \n     President's exclusive constitutional power in \n     responsibility to recognize, and to conduct ongoing \n     relations with, foreign governments as to, in our view, be \n     beyond the proper scope of legislative action.'' Letter to \n     Dante B. Fascell, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, \n     United States House of Representatives, from George P. \n     Shultz, Secretary of State, at 2 (Feb. 13, 1984). Again, \n     in 1987, President Reagan stated that he would construe \n     certain provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act, FY 1988 & 1989, including those that forbade ``the \n     closing of any consulates,'' in a manner that would avoid \n     unconstitutional interference with the President's \n     authority with respect to diplomacy. Pub. Papers of the \n     Presidents: Ronald Reagan 1542 (1987). Indeed, as long ago \n     as 1876, President Grant declared in a signing statement \n     that he would construe legislation in such a way as to \n     avoid ``implying a right in the legislative branch to \n     direct the closing or discontinuing of any of the \n     diplomatic or consular offices of the Government,'' \n     because if Congress sought to do so, it would ``invade the \n     constitutional rights of the Executive.'' 7 James D. \n     Richardson (ed.) Messages and Papers of the Presidents \n     377-78 (1898).\n       Finally, it does not matter in this instance that Congress \n     has sought to achieve its objectives through the exercise of \n     its spending power, because the condition it would impose on \n     obligating appropriations is unconstitutional. See United \n     States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 74 (1936); Issues Raised by \n     Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 of Pub. L. \n     No. 102-140, 16 Op. O.L.C. AT 30-31 (``As we have said on \n     several prior occasions, Congress may not use its power over \n     appropriation of public funds `to attach conditions to \n     Executive Branch appropriations requiring the President to \n     relinquish his constitutional discretion in foreign affairs.' \n     '') (citation omitted).\n       For the above reasons, we believe that the bill's \n     provisions conditioning appropriated funds on the building \n     and opening of a United States Embassy in Jerusalem are \n     unconstitutional.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to express my opposition to \n     S. 770, which would compel the Administration to move its \n     Embassy to Jerusalem. Given the sensitivity of the subject, \n     it is important that there be no misunderstanding on where we \n     stand.\n       There is no issue related to the Arab-Israeli negotiations \n     that is more sensitive than Jerusalem. It is precisely for \n     this reason that any effort by Congress to bring it to the \n     forefront is ill-advised and potentially very damaging to the \n     success of the peace process.\n       I do not say this lightly. Nor do I say it without \n     recognizing the depth of feeling that exists in the Congress \n     about moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Both the \n     President and I am very much aware of this sentiment and the \n     reasons for it. The President expressed himself on this issue \n     during the 1992 campaign and he stands by that position. But \n     he also said at that time, and on a number of occasions since \n     then, that he would not take any step that would disrupt the \n     negotiating process and the promotion of Middle East peace. \n     And S. 770 would unmistakably have that consequence.\n       The President's commitment to promoting peace in the Middle \n     East has been one of his key priorities in foreign policy. It \n     is a commitment all of his predecessors have had since the \n     time of Israel's founding. The President and I know how \n     important the achievement of peace with security is to Israel \n     and to our national interests. We have worked very closely \n     with Israel's leaders to pursue our common interests. The \n     U.S.-Israeli bilateral relationship has never been stronger \n     and the President and I are particularly proud of that fact.\n       Our support for Israel will remain strong and steadfast, \n     and we will work actively to help Israel achieve peace with \n     her neighbors. Given the extraordinary progress of the last \n     two years, that objective appears, for perhaps the first time \n     in history, to be within reach. Having just returned from the \n     Middle East, I am even more persuaded of the opportunities \n     for progress which can ultimately produce a real peace. We \n     must not take steps that make it more difficult to achieve \n     that historic end.\n       Yet, there are few other issues that are more likely to \n     undermine negotiations and complicate the chances for peace \n     than premature focus on Jerusalem. The issues on the table \n     are complex enough without pushing to the fore perhaps the \n     most sensitive and emotional issue for Arabs and Israelis, \n     Muslims and Christians alike. The enemies of peace would use \n     the Jerusalem issue to inflame passions further and attack \n     those who want to see the negotiations succeed. Jerusalem is \n     a powerful symbol of the hopes and aspirations of all sides. \n     As such it has the potential to divide, to polarize, and to \n     divert attention from the critical issues now being \n     negotiated.\n       Palestinians and Israelis both understood this reality when \n     they agreed in the Declaration of Principles that Jerusalem \n     would be covered in the permanent status negotiations. They \n     recognized that deferring this highly sensitive issue as \n     essential if progress were to be made. The negotiations on \n     permanent status are slated to begin as early as May 1996.\n       Safeguarding the negotiations is more vital than ever. This \n     process is now entering an especially delicate period. \n     Israelis and Palestinians have set a July 1 date for an \n     agreement on the second phase of the Oslo accords, including \n     an agreement on elections for a Palestinian Council. Israeli \n     and Syrian Chiefs of Staff are scheduled to begin discussion \n     on security issues on June 27. Few actions would be more \n     explosive and harmful to these efforts than for the United \n     States--as the key sponsor of this process--to be pushing the \n     Jerusalem issue forward. In fact, we recently vetoed a \n     Resolution in the United Nations Security Council which \n     pushed Jerusalem to the fore precisely for this reason. \n     Israeli Prime Minister Rabin recently suspended land \n     expropriations in Jerusalem, effectively reducing the focus \n     on the Jerusalem issue. The last thing we should want is for \n     the U.S. at this very moment to put the focus back on \n     Jerusalem.\n       My opposition to this legislation is also strongly rooted \n     on constitutional grounds. The Justice Department's Office of \n     Legal Counsel has issued an opinion to the White House \n     Counsel concluding that the bill would unconstitutionally \n     invade exclusive Presidential authorities in the field of \n     foreign affairs. Because the bill would seek to compel the \n     President to build and open an embassy at a particular site \n     for foreign policy reasons, it is incompatible with the \n     separation of powers under the Constitution. This is the same \n     position taken by this and previous Administrations on \n     comparable legislative efforts to dictate the location of \n     diplomatic and consular facilities. Accordingly, I would be \n     remiss if I did not counsel the President to protect against \n     the unconstitutional infringement on the prerogatives of his \n     office.\n       In light of this, unless the policy and constitutional \n     concerns noted above are satisfactorily addressed, I will \n     recommend that the President veto S. 770 if it is presented \n     to him. I wish it were otherwise, but for the sake of Middle \n     East peace and the President's constitutional responsibility \n     in foreign policy, I will have no choice but to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Warren Christopher.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, would like to ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks an \neditorial from the New York Times of May 29, 1995, along with a brief \nwith respect to the constitutional prerogatives of the President and \nthe Congress, relating to matters of this kind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make a couple of very brief comments \nbefore I take my place in the chair. I respect the views presented by \nthe Senator from California. I will make additional comments with \nrespect to the issue of the waiver as follows:\n  One of the problems that we have had with this issue, generally, and \none of the reasons why Senator Moynihan brought his letter to the \nSenate, and why all of us have been pursuing legislation now to \nactually bring a close to the issue and make it clear that we will move \nour Embassy to Jerusalem, is that the United States has always found a \nreason not to do it. At the time, those seemed like valid positions. \nObviously, we would not want a waiver to provide a mechanism for \ncontinued lip service to the concept without actually moving toward the \nactual relocation of the Embassy. That is why there has been some \nquestion about how waiver language should be inserted into the bill.\n  Also, there is some oddity, I think, in the matter that locating our \nEmbassy in a country's capital would actually be deemed to be contrary \nto the national security interest of the United States. It seems to me \nthat one has to stretch it a little bit to find that to be the case. \nYet, I know there are those who believe that, even at this point in \ntime, that is exactly the case. I think it is important that if there \nis to be some kind of waiver, it not be a waiver that the President can \nexercise because he has a policy dispute with the Congress on when and \nunder what circumstances the Embassy should be moved. Such a waiver \nshould be exercised by the President only because he finds that the \nnational security interests of the United States require that. \n\n[[Page S 15470]]\nAnd the security of the United States is not necessarily the same as \npeace in the Middle East, which is not necessarily the same as a \ncontroversy between Arabs and Israelis over the status of peace \ndiscussions. So simply because it makes some Arabs anxious or angry, or \ngives them a political issue, is not, I think, a reason why such a \nwaiver would ever be exercised.\n  I also think it is important that the whole world understand one \npoint very clearly--and I think, on this, we are united--that when we \ntalk about the final status of Jerusalem, which is subject to \nnegotiation between the parties there, no one should suffer under any \nillusion that the United States feels itself bound not to locate our \nEmbassy in West Jerusalem pending the outcome of those negotiations. \nThe State of Israel's rights with respect to west Jerusalem, and our \nobligations and entitlements to put our Embassy in west Jerusalem, are \nin no way dependent on those final negotiations which do not go to the \npolitical status of west Jerusalem insofar as the Israelis are \nconcerned.\n  To the point of the constitutional concerns alluded to by the Senator \nfrom California, there are differing opinions on this. I am a very \nstrong advocate of the power of the President in this regard. I do not \ncome lightly to the point of view that Congress has a prerogative in \nthis case to require the relocation of the Embassy. I think it is good \nthat the Record contain both the arguments in support of the \nPresidential and congressional power in that regard. I am delighted to \nsee them both included in the Record at the conclusion of this debate.\n  I think it is important that the understanding be with all parties \nthat whatever kind of waiver language may or may not be included in \nthis bill, it is a temporary waiver only. We are not talking about the \nability of the President to simply continue year after year after year, \nsaying, gee, I am really with you on this, but I think I find a reason \nwhy we do not want to do it right now. That is the intent of any \nwaiver. I know that is not what the Senator from California was saying.\n  Should there by any waiver language included, I want it to be crystal \nclear on the record that nobody is talking about a waiver which, \nhowever open-ended it may or may not be, would allow a President, every \n6 months, to simply say that because he has a different point of view \nthan Congress on this, he is going to refuse to implement what the \nCongress has directed him to do, finding that there is somehow a \nnational security interest of the United States involved.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by making this point. I think the \nimportance of this issue is illustrated by the fact that we have had \ndifficulty in arriving at the exact language because everybody is \nconcerned about what the impact of it will be. Those are very \nlegitimate concerns. I am going to conclude by addressing myself to \nthose concerns. This is not a tangential issue. It is symbolic in one \nrespect, but sometimes symbolism is extraordinarily important. In this \ncase it is, regardless of how you come down on this issue. If you are \nan Arab, for example, one can argue that this would make you very \nanxious and concerned. Therefore, the symbolism of it is very \nimportant. There are those, in fact, who believe that it would be so \ndistressing to certain Arabs if the United States exercises its \nlegitimate right to put our Embassy where we want to, particularly \nsince it is the capital of the host country, and that should not be \nconsidered to be a policy matter with respect to our position in these \nnegotiations. But the fact of the matter is that some people will see \nit as that. Nobody should be allowed to use--in a political campaign or \nin the conduct of terrorism, or in negotiations--the fact that a \ncountry like the United States exercises its right to put its Embassy \nin the capital of the host country. That is not a legitimate concern.\n  So while I understand the politics of it, that is different from the \nlegitimacy of the issue.\n  The final point is this: Some people have said, well, even though it \nis an irrational and illegitimate argument, people will make it. As a \nresult, it could bring a halt to the peace negotiations even. People \nmight stop talking peace. There may be more demonstrations over this, \neven though it is not a legitimate position to be taken.\n  I will respond to that in this fashion because it goes to the heart \nof the debate. No one knows for sure. That is a very legitimate concern \namong those of us who are very, very supportive of the peace process \nand want it to succeed. Certainly, the people in the region feel that \nmuch more even than any of us in this body can.\n  I think it is also important to reflect upon the history of U.S. \nforeign policy and to note that every time the United States has been \nfirm, fair, resolute, principled, consistent in its investigation of \nfriendships and positions in the world, the world has been better off \nfor that firm, principled expression.\n  It did not always suit nervous nellies during the cold war, that \nPresidents like President Reagan made firm statements about our \ncommitments, calling the Soviet Union what at that time it was and many \nRussians since have confirmed. Sure, in many respects it was an evil \nempire. It made people very nervous when President Reagan said it. Many \npeople say had the United States not taken firm positions, had \nPresident Reagan not spoken so clearly, that evil empire would still \nexist today.\n  Had we not made it crystal clear to the Chinese that they could not \ninvade Quemoy and Matsu Islands back in the 1960's, they might have \ndone so. Had we made it clearer to Hitler that he would not get away \nwith an attack on Poland, perhaps he would not have done so.\n  Mr. President, our history is replete with examples of situations in \nwhich history has shown that the world frequently was thrown into \nconflict in which great human suffering and loss resulted because \nleaders at the time were not firm enough and clear enough in the \nexpression of the principles that stood behind their country's \npositions.\n  In this case, I think a firm, clear statement of something as simple \nas the United States exercising its right to put its Embassy in the \ncapital of a country as we have with every other country in the world \nexcept Jerusalem, I think to the extent that the United States makes \nthat statement very clearly, we advance the ultimate cause of \nfundamental peace, a peace that is lasting. To that extent, I think it \nis important that we do that prior to the time that those negotiations \nare to be concluded.\n  I think that deals generally with the waiver issue however that issue \nis ultimately resolved.\n  I see that Senator Levin is here, who I know has a very strong \ninterest in the matter, as well as Senator Helms, the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  I relinquish the majority position to Senator Helms and Senator \nLevin, if he would like to speak, although I want to make a point, if I \nmay, that the unanimous consent to lift the preceding quorum call by \nthe Senator from California was premised upon the point that it was \nlimited to the discussion of this issue and that it could not be used \nto relate to an amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan.\n  Subject to that agreement, I am happy to yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 29, 1995]\n\n                   To Promote Peace, Move the Embassy\n\n                         (By Douglas J. Feith)\n\n       Washington.--There is something more than Presidential \n     politics behind the bills in Congress to relocate the United \n     States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. It is \n     sensible policy.\n       If American support for Israel's sovereignty in Jerusalem \n     remains an open question, will this help promote peace? No. \n     Alternatively, are Israel's Arab interlocutors likelier to \n     make the philosophical adjustments and political concessions \n     necessary for peace if they know that America's support for \n     Israel on Jerusalem is a closed question?\n       This view--endorsed by the key Republican sponsors of the \n     bills, Senators Bob Dole and Jon Kyl and the Speaker of the \n     House Newt Gingrich--has logic, though not the Clinton \n     Administration, on its side.\n       Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Arab-Jewish \n     conflict over Palestine has been a fight over legitimacy. The \n     Zionists have asserted that the Jews have the right to a \n     state in at least part of Palestine. Arab anti-Zionists have \n     argued that all of Palestine on both sides of the Jordan \n     River is Arab land and that the Jews have no right to a state \n     there.\n       In the conflict, periods of violence have alternated with \n     periods of quiet, though hostility has persisted throughout. \n     Quiet is a type of peace, but in recent years diplomacy \n\n[[Page S 15471]]\n     has aimed at a higher type--peace that is formal and de jure.\n       But Israel's experiences with Egypt and the Palestine \n     Liberation Organization demonstrate that formal accords do \n     not necessarily reflect or produce the highest form of \n     peace--that is, peace based on an absence of hostility.\n       True peace is possible only if Israel's Arab neighbors \n     change their hearts and minds on the fundamental issue of \n     Israel's legitimacy. What might facilitate that change? When \n     Israel appeared vulnerable, it did not achieve peace, or even \n     peace talks.\n       Only after being forced to acknowledge the strength of \n     Israel's position--its military power, its enduring ties to \n     the United States, and, since the end of the cold war, our \n     unchallenged global predominance--did some Arab powers \n     abandon rejectionist positions and start negotiating.\n       If Israel's antagonists bow to unpleasant realities and \n     lower unrealistic expectations, the peace process may produce \n     not merely signing ceremonies but real peace.\n       Inasmuch as the essence of the Arab-Israeli conflict is \n     legitimacy, the essence of the legitimacy issue is Israel's \n     right to sovereignty in Jerusalem. If Israelis do not have \n     the right to sovereignty there, they can hardly justify \n     sovereignty anywhere.\n       Jerusalem has been central to Jewish nationhood for 3,000 \n     years. The Jews' national movement, after all, is Zionism, \n     Zion being Jerusalem. The Arabs understand this, too, which \n     is why the importance of Jerusalem in Arab politics, \n     diplomacy, philosophy and literature increased as the \n     struggle against Zionism intensified.\n       By relocating our embassy to Jerusalem, we would end our \n     anomalous policy of refusing to recognize Israel's \n     sovereignty in its own capital. We would proclaim that \n     Israel's legitimacy in Zion is not an open question for us. \n     This would signal that we expect all parties to the \n     conflict--not just Israel--to pursue peace on the basis of \n     realism.\n       In the ongoing Arab-Israeli negotiations, moving the \n     embassy would not prejudice any issue that is actually open. \n     This is why even dovish voices, like that of Deputy Foreign \n     Minister Yossi Beilin, have categorically endorsed the bill. \n     The Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin says it will \n     in time negotiate Jerusalem issues, but not Israeli \n     sovereignty. In this it deserves our support.\n       Across the political spectrum in Israel and among Jews \n     worldwide, there is a profound commitment to retaining \n     Jerusalem forever as the undivided capital. The cause of \n     peace will be served by whatever helps persuade Yasir Arafat \n     that he will not get American support or Israeli consent to \n     divide Jerusalem and establish part of it as the capital of a \n     new Arab state.\n       The necessary adjustment in expectations on the Arab side \n     would be difficult and even painful. Passionate cries--and \n     worse--would ensue, but in the end the process would be \n     constructive.\n       Like all American pro-Israel initiatives, the bill to move \n     the embassy is being deprecated in certain quarters as a \n     cynical play for political points with American Jews. Such \n     criticism is itself deeply cynical.\n       Every Congressional initiative pleases some constituencies \n     and displeases others. Each is supported by some politicians \n     for substantive by some politicians for substantive reasons, \n     some for political reasons and many for both types of \n     reasons.\n       But support for Israel as a fellow democracy and strategic \n     ally has been sustained by a long line of Democratic and \n     Republican administrations and Congresses. It reflects the \n     nation's strong sympathy for Israel as evinced in public \n     opinion polls decade after decade since 1948.\n       The automatic assumption that a pro-Israel initiative is \n     nothing more than pandering is unfair and at odds with \n     America's national interest as most Americans see it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    Shaw, Pittman,\n\n\n                                           Potts & Trowbridge,\n\n                                                    June 27, 1995.\n     To: American Israel Public Affairs Committee\n     From: Gerald Charnoff, Charles J. Cooper, and Michael A. \n       Carvin\n     Re S. 770; Bill to Relocate U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem\n\n\n                            i. introduction\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for an \n     analysis of the constitutionality of the ``Jerusalem Embassy \n     Relocation Implementation Act of 1995,'' hereinafter S. 770, \n     a measure introduced by Senator Dole in the first session of \n     the 104th Congress. Maintaining that Jerusalem should be \n     recognized by the U.S. as the capital of Israel, the bill, in \n     a Statement of Policy, states that groundbreaking for the \n     U.S. embassy in Jerusalem ``should begin'' by 31 December \n     1996 and that the embassy ``should be officially open'' by 31 \n     May 1999. S. 770, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. Sec. 3(a). The \n     measure further establishes that no more than 50% of the \n     funds appropriated to the Department of State in fiscal year \n     1997 for ``Acquisition & Maintenance of Buildings Abroad'' \n     may be obligated until the Secretary of State certifies that \n     construction has begun on the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Id. \n     Sec. 3(b). Similarly, not more than 50% of the funds \n     appropriated in the same account for fiscal year 1999 may be \n     obligated prior to certification by the Secretary of State \n     that the Jerusalem embassy has officially opened. Id., \n     Sec. 3(c). Additional provisions, contained in sections four \n     and five of the measure, earmark certain funds for the \n     relocation effort.'' \\1\\\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice \n     has taken the position that the funding mechanism \n     incorporated into S. 770 is an unconstitutional infringement \n     on the President's powers. See Bill to Relocate the United \n     States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Op. Off. Legal \n     Counsel (May 16, 1995) (``The proposed bill would severely \n     impair the President's constitutional authority to determine \n     the form and manner of the Nation's diplomatic relations.'') \n     (hereinafter ``OLC Op.'').\n\n\n                              ii. analysis\n\n       The Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC'') Opinion argues that \n     the President has primary responsibility for foreign affairs \n     and that his specific power to recognize foreign governments \n     to exclusive. OLC Op., p. 2-3. Accordingly, OLC concludes \n     that ``Congress may not impose on the President its own \n     foreign policy judgments as to the particular sites at which \n     the United States' diplomatic relations are to take place.'' \n     Id. at 3. OLC maintains that the imposition of fixed-\n     percentage restrictions on the State Department's FY 1997 and \n     FY 1999 acquisition and maintenance funds until specified \n     steps are completed in the relocation effort constitutes an \n     impermissible restriction on the President's discretion in \n     foreign affairs. Although OLC does not in any way dispute \n     Congress' plenary power over the purse, it maintains that \n     Congress may not ``attach conditions to Executive Branch \n     appropriations requiring the President to relinquish his \n     constitutional discretion in foreign affairs.'' Id. at 4, \n     quoting Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 \n     and Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16 Op. Off. Legal \n     Counsel at 30-31 (1992) (emphasis added.). In support of this \n     assertion, OLC places exclusive reliance on prior Executive \n     Branch opinions which criticize congressional appropriations \n     riders that directly required the President to take (or \n     refrain from) a particular action by stating that no \n     appropriated funds could be used for the congressionally \n     proscribed action. Id. at 3-4. See also Issues Raised by \n     Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 & Section 503 of Pub. L. \n     No. 102-140, 16 Op. Off. of Legal Counsel 18, 19 (1992), \n     citing Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 105 Stat. at 820 \n     (1991) (``[N]one of the funds provided in this Act shall be \n     used by the Department of State to issue more than one \n     official or diplomatic passport to any United States \n     government employee. . . .''); Appropriations Limitation for \n     Rules Vetoed by Congress, 4B Op. Off. of Legal Counsel 731, \n     731-32 (1980), citing H.R. 7484, Sec. 608, 96th Cong., 2nd \n     Sess. (1980) (``None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available to implement . . . any regulation which has \n     been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly \n     adopted. . . .'').\n       OLC's assertion concerning the primacy of the Chief \n     Executive in foreign affairs is well-supported,\\2\\ and its \n     further assertion that Congress may not interfere with these \n     foreign policy prerogatives even when exercising its spending \n     power is also consistent with long-standing Executive Branch \n     precedent, although Congress has taken a different view.\\3\\ \n     The issue has never been resolved judicially.\\4\\ However, \n     OLC's assertion that S. 770 ``requires'' or ``compels'' the \n     President to move the Embassy to Jerusalem, and is thus \n     subject to the same constitutional objections as \n     appropriation riders containing such unconditional \n     requirements, is belied by the plain language of the bill and \n     is otherwise unsupported by law or Executive Branch opinions.\n       S. 770 does not purport to restrict the President's ability \n     to maintain an Embassy in Tel Aviv or to otherwise interfere \n     with the President's authority to use appropriated monies in \n     any manner he believes best serves the Nation's foreign \n     policy interests. Rather, the measure merely states that, \n     absent compliance with an established timetable for \n     relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Israel, Congress will \n     invoke its spending power to reduce the aggregate funding \n     level that can be obligated in certain related discretionary \n     accounts. Instead of a prohibition on the ability of the \n     President to use money to exercise his constitutional powers, \n     S. 770 merely provides a fiscal incentive for the President \n     to exercise his discretion in a certain manner, though \n     leaving him capable of eschewing these incentives and acting \n     in direct contravention of Congress' wishes. Thus, such a \n     mechanism in no way restricts the ability of the President to \n     use his foreign affairs power to employ appropriated money as \n     he sees fit.\n       That being so, S. 770 is different in this critical respect \n     from any other appropriation rider ever objected to by \n     Executive Branch officials as an unconstitutional \n     infringement on the President's foreign affairs power or \n     other executive powers. In all such cases, the appropriations \n     riders have directed a particular course of action or \n     inaction by prohibiting certain uses of appropriated funds, \n     even if the President desired to take such actions in \n     fulfilling his constitutionally-assigned duties. Issues \n     Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 & Section 503 of \n     Pub. L. No. 102-140, supra, citing Section 503 of Pub. L. No. \n     102-140, 105 Stat. at 820 (1991) (``[N]one of the funds \n     provided in this Act shall be used by the Department of State \n     to issue more than one official or diplomatic passport to any \n     United States government employee. . . .

In exercising its \n     power of the purse, Congress has no greater authority to \n     usurp the President's exclusive constitutional authority than \n     when it acts pursuant to other enumerated powers. See, The \n     Appropriations Power & the Necessary & Proper Clause, 68 \n     Wash. U. L. Q. 623, 30 (1990) (``[W]hen we hear discussions \n     about Congress' weighty role in . . . the foreign relations \n     power, and Congress adverts to `the power of the purse,' it \n     does not make sense. Congress still has to point to a \n     substantive power. The power of the purse . . . is only \n     procedural.'') (remarks by the Honorable William Barr).\n       Here, in contrast, Congress imposes no restrictions on \n     appropriated funds: such funds may continue to be used to \n     maintain an Embassy in Tel Aviv should the President decide \n     to leave the Embassy there. Accordingly, there is nothing in \n     S. 770 ``requiring the President to relinquish his \n     constitutional discretion in foreign affairs'' and thus OLC's \n     reliance on Executive Branch condemnation of such \n     appropriation riders is entirely misplaced. OLC Op., p. 4.\n       To be sure, if the President retains the status quo in \n     Israel, the State Department will have less funds in two \n     upcoming fiscal years than it would otherwise have, and so S. \n     770 is plainly designed to influence the President's decision \n     on the Jerusalem Embassy. But this sort of ``horse trading'' \n     is a basic staple of relations between the two political \n     branches and hardly infringes the President's constitutional \n     authority or powers. For example, the President has \n     unfettered constitutional authority to nominate whomever he \n     desires for, say, Surgeon General, and Congress does not \n     unconstitutionally interfere with that presidential \n     appointment authority by abolishing or reducing the funding \n     for the Surgeon General's Office if certain nominees are \n     proposed. Similarly, Congress may constitutionally pledge to \n     reduce financial support for certain foreign interests or \n     international organizations simply because it is displeased \n     with the President's exercise of his responsibilities as \n     foreign affairs spokesman or Commander-in-Chief. Since the \n     use of these sorts of quid pro quos to influence the \n     President's exercise of his constitutional duties does not \n     unconstitutionally interfere with those duties, S. 770's \n     establishment of such a device is similarly within Congress' \n     constitutional authority.\n       By entrusting the President with the authority to \n     definitively resolve certain questions, the Framers did not \n     erect a prophylactic shield protecting the President against \n     all attempts to influence the manner in which he resolves \n     those issues. Accordingly, the Founders did not erect some \n     special constitutional protection for the President which \n     immunizes him from the give and take of inter-branch \n     disagreements. Rather, they expected that a President of \n     ``tolerable firmness'' would be able to resist congressional \n     blandishments to pursue a course he deemed unwise, assuming \n     such appropriations riders survived his veto in the first \n     instance. Alexander Hamilton, ``The Federalist No. 73,'' at \n     445 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).\n       For this reason, even those scholars who believe Congress \n     ``ought not be able to regulate Presidential action by \n     conditions on the appropriation of funds . . . if it could \n     not regulate the action directly,'' Henkin, supra at 113, \n     acknowledge that establishment of financial penalties or \n     incentives to influence presidential action is permissible. \n     Henkin, supra at 79. (``Since the President is always coming \n     to Congress for money for innumerable purposes, domestic and \n     foreign, Congress and Congressional committees can use \n     appropriations and the appropriations process to bargain also \n     about other elements of Presidential policy and foreign \n     affairs.''). Indeed, the Attorney General has favorably \n     opined on the constitutionality of an appropriation rider \n     that imposed a markedly more onerous restriction on the \n     President's exclusive Commander-in-Chief powers than S. 770 \n     imposes on his foreign policy discretion. In 1909, Congress \n     attached the following rider to the Navy's appropriation:\n       ``[N]o part of the appropriations herein made for the \n     Marine Corps shall be expended for the purpose for which said \n     appropriations are made unless officers and enlisted men \n     shall serve on board all battleships and armored cruisers, \n     and also upon such other vessels of the navy as the \n     President may direct, in detachments of not less than \n     eight percentum of the strength of the enlisted men of the \n     navy on said vessels.\n       ``Naval Appropriations Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 753, 773, \n     reprinted in Appropriations--Marine Corps--Service on \n     Battleships,'' 27 Op. Att'y Gen. 259 (1909).\n       The Attorney General found this restriction constitutional \n     because, ``Congress has power to create or not to create . . \n     . a marine corps, make appropriation for its pay, [and] \n     provide that such appropriation shall not be made available \n     unless the marine corps be employed in some designated way . \n     . .'' 27 Op. Att'y Gen. at 260.\n       So far as we can discern, neither OLC nor the Attorney \n     General have subsequently disavowed or undermined the \n     vitality of this Attorney General Opinion, although they \n     opined at times that appropriation riders could not direct \n     the President to take action within his constitutional \n     sphere. Presumably, then, even Executive Branch officials \n     have recognized a distinction between impermissible riders \n     that mandate certain action or inaction and permissible ones \n     which, like the Marine Corps appropriation, provide the \n     President with at least a nominal choice between two courses \n     of action, with financial ``penalties'' if he chooses the \n     disfavored option. In the 1909 naval appropriation, the \n     President's ``choice'' was between having marines constitute \n     eight percent of battleship crews or having no funding for \n     the Marine Corps at all. This complete defunding penalty for \n     exercising the disfavored option is obviously far more \n     draconian than the 50% reduction in construction funding \n     occasioned by S. 770.\n       In short, there is an obvious and constitutionally \n     significant difference between an appropriations law \n     forbidding the President to take action which the \n     Constitution leaves to his discretion and a law which merely \n     sets out the negative financial consequences that will ensue \n     if the President pursues a certain policy. This distinction \n     between coercive laws and laws which offer financial \n     incentives to exercise one's sovereign power in the preferred \n     way has been well-recognized by the Supreme Court in directly \n     analogous circumstances.\n       Most notably, in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), \n     the Supreme Court considered a congressional statute, known \n     as Section 158, which directed the Secretary of \n     Transportation to withold five percent of allocable highway \n     funds from any state in which individuals under the age of 21 \n     could legally purchase or possess alcohol. Like S. 770, the \n     funding mechanism in Dole constituted a congressional attempt \n     to provide indirect financial inducement to affect policy in \n     an area presumably beyond Congress' power to legislate \n     directly.\n       Despite earlier recognition that the ``Twenty-first \n     Amendment grants States virtually complete control over \n     whether to permit importation or sale of liquor and how to \n     structure the liquor distribution system,'' \\5\\ the Court \n     upheld this statutory incursion into state sovereignty, \n     asserting that the ``encouragement to state action found in \n     Sec. 158 is a valid use of the spending power.'' Dole, 483 \n     U.S. at 212. Accordingly, even though the Constitution \n     assigned to the states the responsibility for establishing \n     drinking ages, and thus Congress presumably could not direct \n     the states to set a minimum age, this funding restriction was \n     permissible because ``Congress has acted indirectly under its \n     spending power to encourage uniformity in the States' \n     drinking ages.'' Id. at 206. Thus, such restrictions are \n     permissible because the potential recipient of appropriated \n     federal funds is free to reject Congress' financial \n     inducement and exercise unfettered discretion in the relevant \n     area, so long as the recipient is willing to endure the \n     financial sacrifice that ensues. Id. at 211-212 (``Congress \n     has offered . . . encouragement to the States to enact higher \n     minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose. But \n     the enactment of such laws remains the prerogative of the \n     States not merely in theory but in fact.''). Similarly, in \n     upholding federal appropriation riders requiring the \n     regulation of State employees' political activities, the \n     Supreme Court has ruled that even though Congress ``has no \n     power to regulate local political activities as such of state \n     officials,'' the federal government nevertheless ``does have \n     power to fix the terms upon which its money allotments to \n     states shall be disbursed.'' Oklahoma v. Civil Service \n     Comm'n, 330 U.S. 127, 143 (1947). The Court found that the \n     state's sovereignty remained intact because the state could \n     adopt ``the `simple expedient' of not yielding to what she \n     urges is federal coercion.'' Id. at 143-144.\n       Thus, Dole would seem to directly establish that the sort \n     of conditional funding provided by S. 770 is constitutionally \n     permissible. In Oklahoma and Dole, the Tenth and Twenty-first \n     Amendments provided the states with exclusive authority over \n     their employees' political activities and citizens' legal \n     drinking age, yet Congress did not unconstitutionally \n     infringe these powers by offering financial incentives to \n     adopt a particular policy. By the same token, the fact that \n     the Constitution vests the President with exclusive \n     recognition authority does not disable Congress from using \n     its plenary spending power to seek to influence the exercise \n     of that authority.\n       Like the drinking-age restriction in Dole, the funding \n     mechanism in S. 770 merely attempts to induce recipients of \n     federal funds to pursue policy ends advocated by Congress via \n     clearly established conditions on future appropriations, \n     while leaving that decisionmaker with the option of refusing \n     such conditions. The President may exercise his discretion to \n     retain the American embassy in Tel Aviv and accept the \n     potential of reduced congressional funding in certain related \n     discretionary accounts, or he can move the embassy. S. 770 \n     does nothing to alter the fundamental fact that the decision \n     as to where to locate the U.S. embassy in Israel ``remains \n     the prerogative'' of the President ``not merely in theory but \n     in fact.'' Dole, 483 U.S. at 211-12.\\6\\\n       To be sure, the President differs from state governments \n     because, as noted, he cannot pursue any action requiring \n     expenditures without congressional funding. Thus a blanket \n     prohibition against using appropriated \n\n[[Page S 15473]]\n     funds does not leave him with any option to pursue the proscribed \n     activity. Because of this distinction, a straightforward \n     restriction against using any funds for an action otherwise \n     within the President's constitutional power is an effective \n     prohibition against taking such action and thus presents a \n     different, and more difficult, constitutional question. As \n     noted, however, that is not the situation here. The President \n     has been offered a choice directly analogous to that offered \n     the states in Dole--he may pursue the congressionally \n     disfavored option and accept the financial consequences or \n     acquiesce to the preferred option without any such sacrifice.\n       OLC has nonetheless previously sought to distinguish Dole \n     on the grounds that the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for \n     the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, 111 S. Ct. 2298 (1991) \n     (hereinafter ``MWAA'') found Dole ``inapplicable'' to issues \n     that ``involve separation-of-powers principles.'' Issues \n     Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 \n     of Pub. L. No 102-140, supra, at 31. This assertion is \n     patently untrue. MWAA in no way suggests that, while Congress \n     is free to use its spending power to influence the sovereign \n     power of states guaranteed by the Tenth Amendment and the \n     Constitution's basic structure, the sovereign powers of the \n     President are somehow different and thus immune from such \n     congressional blandishments. Contrary to OLC's misleading \n     selective quotation, MWAA never said Dole's rationale was \n     ``inapplicable'' to cases involving ``separation-of-powers \n     principles,'' it simply stated that Dole's Nationale was \n     ``inapplicable to the issue presented by this case.'' MWAA, \n     1111 S. Ct. at 2309 (emphasis added). Dole's rationale was \n     inapplicable not because the sovereign authority of the \n     President is somehow different from that of the states, but \n     because the infringement of executive powers in MWAA was \n     obviously and significantly different from the funding \n     appropriation conditions at issue in Dole.\n       The issue that divided the dissenting and majority opinions \n     in MWAA was whether Congress was effectively responsible for \n     creating the Board of Review, which was composed of Members \n     of Congress and had veto power over the Airport Authority's \n     important decisions. Id. at 2313 (White, J. dissenting). The \n     dissent argued that no separation-of-powers issue was \n     implicated by this Board of Review because the Commonwealth \n     of Virginia (and the District of Columbia) had created that \n     Board and no federalism principles prevented the states from \n     so utilizing the talents of Members of Congress. Id. \n     According to the dissent, the fact that Congress had coerced \n     Virginia to make this decision was of no moment because this \n     ``coercion'' was no different than Congress' use of the \n     spending power to influence states in Dole. Id. at 2316-17.\n       In the section of the opinion relied upon by OLC, the \n     majority refuted both prongs of the dissent's arguments:\n       ``Here, unlike Dole, there is no question about federal \n     power to operate the airports. The question is whether the \n     maintenance of federal control over the airports by means of \n     the Board of Review, which is allegedly a federal \n     instrumentality, is invalid, not because it invades any state \n     power, but because Congress' continued control violates the \n     separation-of-powers principle, the aim of which is to \n     protect not the States but ``the whole people from \n     improvident laws.'' Chadha, at 951, 103 S. Ct. at 2784. \n     Nothing in our opinion in Dole implied that a highway grant \n     to a State could have been conditioned on the State's \n     creating a ``Highway Board of Review'' composed of Members of \n     Congress.''--Id. at 2309.\n       The first two sentences merely make the obvious point that \n     since MWAA deals with a ``federal instrumentality'' and there \n     was no question about the propriety of ``federal power to \n     operate the airports,'' there is simply no issue of federal \n     interference with state power.\\7\\ Since there was no question \n     of federal interference with, or bargaining for, state power, \n     the only relevant question was who controlled the federal \n     power--Congress or the Executive. In that regard, Congress \n     had not ``bargained'' with the Executive by establishing \n     financial conditions analogous to S. 770, but had directly \n     commandeered control over the Airport Authority by \n     establishing the Review Board.\n       The third sentence in the quoted passage simply says that \n     Dole is inapplicable because the infringement in MWAA is \n     different from the appropriation restriction in Dole and \n     would be impermissible if applied to the states. This \n     obviously belies the assertion that Dole was found \n     inapplicable because different standards govern infringement \n     on the President's powers than those which govern state \n     intrusions. Specifically, Dole was distinguishable because, \n     in MWAA, Congress did not provide money in return for \n     Virginia exercising its sovereignty in a certain way. Rather, \n     Virginia agreed to transfer its sovereignty over the Airport \n     Authority to Congress. As the opinion's derisive citation to \n     a ``Highway Board of Review'' makes clear, while the federal \n     government may use its spending power to influence a state's \n     exercise of its own sovereignty, Congress cannot use its \n     spending power to induce the state to enhance congressional \n     authority by creating congressionally-controlled federal \n     instrumentalities. In short, Virginia was not trading away \n     its own state power over airports; it had none. Rather, it \n     was trading away the pre-existing Executive power over the \n     airports to Congress. Since Virginia obviously had no \n     Executive power to trade, Congress could not invoke Dole to \n     justify its exercise of Executive power.\n       As this detailed review establishes, MWAA said that Dole \n     was inapplicable because 1) there was no state power to \n     bargain away, and 2) states cannot enhance congressional \n     power in return for congressional dollars. Nothing in MWAA \n     suggests that Dole was inapposite because the Executive, \n     unlike states, in somehow disabled from agreeing to exercise \n     his sovereign authority in a particular manner in return for \n     increased congressional monies.\n       To the contrary, like the states, the Executive Branch, \n     ``absent coercion . . . has both the incentive and the \n     ability to protect its own rights and powers, and therefore \n     may cede such rights and powers.'' MWAA, 111 S. Ct. at 2309. \n     The fact that preserving the President's powers against \n     congressional enactments is ultimately designed to protect \n     the ``whole people from improvident laws'' does not suggest a \n     different rule, since the federalism concerns implicated in \n     Dole were also designed to preserve the people's liberty. See \n     U.S. v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624, 1626-27 (1995) (``Just as the \n     separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the \n     Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation of \n     excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power \n     between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the \n     risk of tyranny and abuse from either front.''), quoting \n     Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 458 (1991); New York v. \n     U.S., 112 S. Ct. 2408, 2431 (1992) (``[t]he Constitution \n     divides authority between federal and state governments for \n     the protection of individuals.'') (emphasis added.)\n       To be sure, under MWAA, Congress could not condition \n     appropriations on the President's agreement to establish an \n     ``Israeli Embassy Board of Review,'' where congressional \n     agents determine the location of the Embassy. The President \n     cannot transfer his recognition powers to congressional \n     decisionmakers and, as indicated, there is a plausible \n     argument that Congress cannot directly supplant the \n     President's decisionmaking authority on such matters, even \n     though directives in appropriations bills. Like any other \n     sovereign, however, the President may consider many factors \n     in making his own decisions. Just as he may consider the \n     reaction of foreign countries, he may also consider a \n     negative congressional reaction. Accordingly, nothing \n     precludes Congress from seeking to influence that decision \n     through use of its own constitutional powers including the \n     spending power.\n       Indeed, OLC's contrary position demeans the President's \n     constitutional status and certainly cannot be advanced in the \n     name of a strong Executive. The OLC Opinion suggests that the \n     President, unlike the states, lacks the ability or the will \n     to resist Congress' financial inducements. Particularly given \n     the existence of his veto power, this view of the President's \n     authority vis-a-vis Congress is obviously untenable and \n     irreconcilable with the Framers' views. The Framers did not \n     erect a prophylactic constitutional umbrella protecting the \n     President from the persuasive power of Congress' financial \n     inducements, they forged only a shield against congressional \n     directives. OLC simply ignores this vital distinction and the \n     Executive Branch and judicial precedent which support it.\n       Under these precedents and a proper understanding of the \n     constitutional framework, S. 770 does not violate any \n     separation-of-powers principle or infringe any constitutional \n     authority of the President.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Section 4 of S. 770 merely reprograms $5 million in funds \n     appropriated in the Departments of Commerce, Justice, State, \n     the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of \n     1995. Pub. L. No. 103-317, 108 Stat. 1724, 60 (1994) (Title V \n     contains appropriations specifically for the Department of \n     State and related agencies.)

Given the \n     identical requirement that ``not less than [the earmarked \n     amount] . . . shall be made available'' in fiscal years 1996 \n     and 1997 respectively, the President has discretion as to \n     whether to use the money, but cannot use earmarked funds for \n     other general purposes.\n\n[[Page S 15474]]\n\n     \\2\\ See, e.g., Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v.

See United States v. Butler, \n     297 U.S. 1, 69-70, 74 (1936): United States v.

However, OLC, as it has in the past, \n     further maintains that the spending power cannot be used to \n     force the President to take action that is perfectly \n     constitutional, if the appropriation restricts the \n     President's power to exercise his unfettered discretion in an \n     area within his constitutional authority. There is no \n     judicial precedent either way on OLC's extension of the \n     ``independent constitutional bar'' principle in a separation-\n     of-powers context. In the context of congressional funding \n     conditions on state governments, the Supreme Court has \n     unequivocally rejected an expanded notion of the independent \n     constitutional bar:\n     ``[T]he ``independent constitutional bar'' limitation on the \n     spending bar is not, as petitioners suggest, a prohibition on \n     the indirect achievement of objectives which Congress is not \n     empowered to achieve directly.

Of \n     course, the President, unlike the states, has no access to \n     funds other than those appropriated by Congress. Thus, unlike \n     the situation with state governments, a prohibition \n     precluding the President from spending any appropriated \n     monies on a particular activity is a direct prohibition \n     against pursuing that activity. This provides a plausible \n     basis for distinguishing the statute involved in Dole from a \n     direct appropriations restriction on the President's \n     activities. As we discuss below, however, Dole provides \n     direct support, where, as here, there is no prohibition \n     against spending money on the President's desired activity.\n     \\5\\ California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v.

Davis, 301 U.S. 548, 590 (1937). \n     However, the Dole Court dismissed any claim of coercion \n     involved in the drinking age funding provision, stating that \n     the ``relatively small percentage'' of highway funds involved \n     in the cutoff were not coercive. 483 U.S. at 211. The Court \n     further asserted that the mere fact that a conditional grant \n     of money is successful in achieving compliance with \n     congressional restrictions will not establish coercion. Id. \n     seems clear that, given the minuscule amount of funding \n     involved in S. 770, especially relative to the substantial \n     highway fund allocations involved in Dole, the incentive \n     mechanism at issue could not be deemed coercive. Should the \n     President refuse to move the embassy, he would be barred from \n     obligating funds amounting to a mere one percent of the \n     budget authority reserved for international affairs in each \n     of the fiscal years involved and a mere one one-hundredth of \n     one percent of the aggregate budget in those same years. \n     Office of Management & Budget, ``Appendix to the Budget of \n     the United States for Fiscal Year 1996'' 692-93 (1995); \n     Office of Management & Budget, ``Historical Tables to \n     Supplement the Budget of the United States for Fiscal Year \n     1996'' 14, 69 (1995).\n     \\7\\ The Court had previously noted that the Board of Review \n     was ``an entity created at the initiative of Congress, the \n     powers of which Congress has delineated, the purpose of which \n     is to protect an acknowledged federal interest, and \n     membership in which is restricted to congressional officials. \n     Such an entity necessarily exercises sufficient federal power \n     as an agent of Congress to mandate separation-of-powers \n     scrutiny.'' Id. at 2308.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill which I have \ncosponsored which will relocate the American Embassy to Israel's \ncapital of Jerusalem by a date certain.\n  For nearly 50 years now, Jerusalem has served as the capital of the \nState of Israel. Israel is the only place in the world that I know of \nwhere the United States has established its Embassy in a city other \nthan that identified by the host nation as its capital. Jerusalem is \nthe seat of Israel's Government and there should be little question of \nwhere our Embassy should be.\n  Now, some have suggested that establishing the American Embassy in \nJerusalem during the ongoing peace negotiations might adversely affect \nthe peace process. For reasons just stated by Senator Kyl, I think it \nactually could have the opposite effect, that our clear determination \nto place our Embassy in Jerusalem by a date certain will avoid any \nmisunderstanding, and it is that misunderstanding or lack of clarity \nwhich could harm the peace process, because surely no one seriously \nsuggests that Israel would ever agree to change the status of Jerusalem \nas Israel's capital.\n  I do not think anyone has made that suggestion. I do not think anyone \nin the world would make that suggestion.\n  It is now Israel's capital. It is clearly going to remain Israel's \ncapital. We, as Israel's ally, should make it very clear that we \nrecognize that fact and that we act to assure the movement of our \nEmbassy to the capital of the State of Israel by a fixed date.\n  Mr. President, there will be and has been some discussion about a \npossible Presidential waiver. We had such a waiver with the Jackson-\nVanik legislation, for instance--very important legislation which \nfocused some very significant pressure on the then Soviet Union.\n  That legislation had an impact. It worked well to focus pressure on \nthe Soviet Union. It made a very important statement about our feelings \nabout human rights in the Soviet Union and its relationship to trade. \nBut it also had a waiver.\n  The question is, what kind of a waiver would be appropriate for the \nPresident in this instance? It is clear to me that the waiver should be \nnarrowly drawn so as not to undermine or detract from the point of this \nlegislation.\n  This is historic legislation. This is action which is long overdue. \nIt is cosponsored by 67 Senators, which will, hopefully, assure its \noverwhelming passage today. I cosponsor it in the hope that it will \nreceive the overwhelming bipartisan support of the Senate that it \ndeserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am among those who have long supported \nthe concept embodied in the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation \nAct of 1995. Since Senator Dole introduced this legislation, there has \nbeen great gnashing of teeth and wringing of hands that have \ntrivialized a fundamental and significant fact: Jerusalem is the \ncapital of Israel, and the capital is where the United States Embassy \nshould always be regardless of the country involved.\n  The Government of Israel has asserted that Jerusalem is and will \nremain the capital of Israel. The dire warnings being heard that the \npeace process will be endangered are, in fact, threats. The peace \nprocess will be dismantled only if and when Yasser Arafat wants to \ndismantle it.\n  I commend Senator Dole for his efforts, for his conviction, and for \naccomplishing what I feel should have been done years ago. I am pleased \nto be a cosponsor, and I will be pleased to visit the United States \nEmbassy in Jerusalem, capital of the State of Israel.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today as an original \ncosponsor of S. 1322, the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation \nAct of 1995. I would like to commend Majority Leader Dole and Senators \nD'Amato and Moynihan for the leadership they have shown on this \nimportant issue.\n  I think it is only fitting--and long overdue--that the Senate act on \nthis resolution this week, prior to Wednesday's ceremony in the Capitol \nrotunda celebrating the 3,000th anniversary of the Jewish presence in \nJerusalem.\n  The resolution before us today would put the Senate clearly on record \nas supporting a unified Jerusalem as the permanent capital of the State \nof Israel. Some have argued that Senate passage of this resolution \nwould somehow harm the peace process--in particular, the upcoming \nnegotiations on the final status of Jerusalem. I would point out to my \ncolleagues that this resolution has been carefully drafted so that it \nis compatible with the timetable established by the peace process. \nUnder the terms of this resolution, the \n\n[[Page S 15475]]\nSenate would state that it is the policy of the United States that \n``the United States Embassy in Israel should be relocated to Jerusalem \nno later than May 31, 1999.'' That is the date established in the Oslo \nAgreement of 1993 for the completion of final status negotiations for \nJerusalem. I think it is appropriate that we send a clear signal of \ncongressional support for our Israeli allies as they enter these \ndifficult negotiations.\n  Mr. President, Jerusalem has been the declared capital of the State \nof Israel since January 23, 1950. And yet, over 45 years later, the \nUnited States has not recognized Jerusalem as the capital of our friend \nand ally, the State of Israel. Israel is the only nation in the world \nwhere the United States Embassy is not located in the host nation's \ncapital.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had the privilege of visiting \nJerusalem on many occasions. I have seen the many holy sites which make \nJerusalem the cradle of three of the world's largest religons--Judaism, \nChristianity, and Islam--and an inspiration to us all.\n  I have also seen the bombed out buildings in West Jerusalem that \nstand just outside the wall of the Old City--buildings which were \nshelled during the time of the Jordanian occupation of East Jerusalem. \nThose buildings serve as a constant reminder of the sacrifices endured \nby the Jewish people from 1947 to 1967 when Jews were denied access to \nthe holy sites in East Jerusalem; and a reminder that the world must \nnever allow the citizens of Israel--and indeed Jews around the world--\nto be subjected to such suffering again.\n  Mr. President, Israel is our strong friend and ally in the Middle \nEast. As the only democracy in the region, this brave nation stands as \na symbol of hope for millions. The people of Israel claim Jerusalem as \ntheir capital. This is their right. Their choice should be honored. \nAmerica should recognize that Jerusalem is, and will remain, the \nundivided and permanent capital of the State of Israel.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support this legislation, and would like \nto congratulate the distinguished majority Leader for his consistent \nleadership on this very important issue. This bill states the simple \nfact that Jerusalem is Israel's national capital. It puts in place a \nseries of careful, measured steps to eventually locate our Embassy in \nIsrael's capital city, but in any case no later than May 31, 1999.\n  I am a cosponsor of both S. 770, the original Jerusalem Embassy \nRelocation Implementation Act, as well as the slightly modified bill \nthat we are considering today, S. 1322. S. 770 was introduced on May 9 \nby the gentleman from Kansas, Senator Dole, and I am proud to have \njoined with 62 of my colleagues as a cosponsor of both S. 770 and S. \n1322.\n  I was also pleased to join 92 of my colleagues in our March 20 letter \nto Secretary of State Christopher calling for the relocation of our \nEmbassy to Jerusalem no later than May 1999, the time when both the \nIsraelis and Palestinians have agreed that the final status of \nJerusalem would be settled.\n  Some may argue that now is not the time for us to establish a firm \npolicy on the eventual location of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. The \nirony, of course, is that it appears that for 47 straight years the \nState Department has never yet found precisely the right moment to take \nthis commonsense action. All we are saying in this legislation is that \nwe are giving State 4 years in which they certainly can find an \nappropriate time.\n  As a cosponsor of the original House Lantos bill to take this action \nover a decade ago, I have consistently supported this position \nthroughout my congressional career.\n  Only in the sometimes fantastic politics of the Middle East could \nthis issue even be considered remarkable. It is a simple fact that \nJerusalem--or at least some part of Jerusalem--has been Israel's \ncapital city ever since Israel's 1948 war for independence. Observing \nthis fact is no different than observing that the sun rises in the \neast. And trying to deny the act does not make it any less true.\n  This takes us to a potentially troubling aspect of the State \nDepartment's consistent refusal to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's \ncapital. This policy originated from the days of the U.N. partition \nplan ending Britain's colonial mandate over the region. That plan \nenvisioned the establishment of Jerusalem as an international city not \nunder the sovereignty of any nation.\n  The U.N. partition plan of 1947, however, was never implemented due \nto its total rejection by the Arab countries because it would have \nsplit the British protectorate into a Jewish and Arab state. Thus, the \nState Department continues to cling to a formal position refusing to \nacknowledge Israel's sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem.\n  The only, and I repeat only possible justification for such a \nposition would be if the State Department believed that Israeli \nsovereignty over even west Jerusalem was illegitimate, and that Israel \nmust cede the entire city to an Arab state or to international control.\n  If our country does not take this position, we have no more right \nmaintaining our Embassy in Tel Aviv than we do insisting on maintaining \nour Embassy in Alexandria, Egypt, which was that country's capital \nuntil the military overthrow of its monarchy by Col. Gamel Abdel Nassar \nin 1952.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is long past time for our country to \nbegin treating our closest ally in the Middle East--Israel--in the same \nway that we treat every Arab country, and indeed, every other country \nin the world with whom we maintain diplomatic relations. It is time for \nus to locate our Embassy in Israel's capital city, and stop making \nexcuses why any particular moment never seems to be exactly the right \nmoment. Sometime in the next 4 years that moment will arrive, and that \nis all this bill is saying.\n  I urge overwhelming bipartisan support for this important bill, and I \nagain congratulate the Senator from Kansas for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1322, a bill \nto relocate the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel \nAviv. I am honored to be a cosponsor of this legislation and to have \njoined the overwhelming majority of my colleagues in writing a letter \nto Secretary Christopher this past March regarding this issue.\n  Mr. President, for nearly 50 years, the United States and Israel have \nshared a unique and historic relationship. Israel has been our \nstrongest, most loyal ally in the Middle East, and the location of our \nEmbassy in Tel-Aviv is inconsistent with this relationship.\n  Israel is the only country in the world where the United States \nEmbassy is not located in the capital city, and I believe this policy \nmust change. It is important to note that Israel's Parliament, supreme \ncourt, central bank, and all other state institutions and headquarters \nare located in Jerusalem, including the Foreign Ministry. Beyond just \nthe important symbolism, the location of our embassy in Jerusalem, \nrather than in Tel Aviv, an hour away from the seat of government, \nmakes practical sense.\n  Mr. President, I believe that since this year marks the 3,000th \nanniversary of King David establishing Jerusalem as the capital city of \nthe Jewish nation, there is no better time for the United States to \nrecognize this historic seat of government. The site for the Embassy is \nnot located in disputed territory, the status of Jerusalem as Israel's \ncapital is not disputed, and we ought to support this valuable friend \nand ally.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Arab-Israel peace process must be \njudged by one question, and one question only: Will Israel be stronger \nand more secure at the end of the process than it was at the beginning? \nTo achieve that end, I support this legislation to move the U.S. \nEmbassy to Jerusalem.\n  Our Embassy should be located in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is Israel's \nchosen seat of government, where its Parliament, prime ministry, \nSupreme Court, and most government ministries are located. The United \nStates has diplomatic relations with 184 countries, and in every \ncountry--except Israel--our embassy is located in the capital \ndesignated by the host nation.\n  The Clinton administration argues that moving the Embassy will \ndestroy the peace process. I believe that the peace process can \ncontinue only if Israelis believe that their nation's vital \n\n[[Page S 15476]]\ninterests will not be compromised. Moving our Embassy to Jerusalem will \nstrengthen that conviction, and it will be a clear demonstration of the \nfact that no wedge will be driven between Israel and the United States \nover the status of Jerusalem.\n  This week, we will begin a celebration of Jerusalem and its 3,000 \nyears of playing a critical, central role in world history. As we begin \nthis celebration, I am pleased to support this bill in the conviction \nthat moving the American Embassy would send an unmistakable signal that \nthe unity of Jerusalem is irreversible, and it will remain, now and \nforever, the capital of Israel.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1322, as an \noriginal cosponsor, an author, along with my colleague Senator Moynihan \nof a letter to the Secretary of State along with 91 of our colleagues \nproposing this very idea, and finally as a true believer in the \nprinciple of this legislation. I want to make it very clear: Jerusalem \nis and shall remain the undivided capital of the State of Israel. \nJerusalem belongs to Israel and our Embassy belongs in Jerusalem.\n  Relocation of our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem should begin as \nsoon as possible. Under this bill, it will.\n  It is outrageous that we have diplomatic relations with 184 countries \nthroughout the world and in every one, except Israel, our Embassy is in \nthe functioning capital.\n  Israel has endured much throughout her history and for her to have to \nsuffer the indignity of her main ally refusing to place its embassy in \nher capital is an insult.\n  We would never allow another country to tell us where to locate our \ncapital. Why are we dictating this to Israel?\n  In a time when the Palestinians are placing more and more demands on \nIsrael and when the United States is providing $500 million to the PLO, \nonly to find Yasir Arafat unable to deliver on his end of the peace \nagreement, we must make it clear that some things are not negotiable. \nJerusalem for one is not a topic for negotiation. Jerusalem belongs to \nIsrael.\n  If we delay moving our Embassy any longer, we will be raising \nunrealistic hopes about the future of this holy city.\n  It was for this reason that I along with Senator Moynihan and 91 \nother Senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher \nurging him to begin planning now for the relocation of the Embassy to \nJerusalem by no later than May 1999. At this time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1995.\n     Hon., Warren Christopher,\n     Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We believe that Jerusalem is and shall \n     remain the undivided capital of the State of Israel. It is \n     now over eleven years since 50 United States Senators and 227 \n     members of the House of Representatives joined in endorsing \n     the transfer of the United States embassy In Israel from Tel \n     Aviv to Jerusalem.\n       In the subsequent decade both Houses of Congress have \n     passed, by near-unanimous margins, a total of four \n     resolutions calling on the United States government to \n     acknowledge United Jerusalem as the capital of the State of \n     Israel. A fifth resolution adopted last year called on the \n     administration to veto language in United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions that states or implies that Jerusalem is \n     occupied territory.\n       This administration has been open, direct and specific with \n     regard to its position concerning an undivided Jerusalem. In \n     this light, we are particularly pleased to note that the most \n     recent edition of ``Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts: \n     Guide for Business Representatives,'' published by the \n     Department of State lists Jerusalem under Israel for the \n     first time in 46 years, albeit with a disclaimer. This is not \n     enough.\n       There can be little doubt that Jerusalem is a sensitive \n     issue in the current peace process. While the Declaration of \n     Principles stipulates that Jerusalem is a ``final status'' \n     issue to be negotiated between the parties, we share Prime \n     Minister Rabin's view which he expressed to the Knesset that:\n       ``On Jerusalem, we said: `This Government, like all of its \n     predecessors, believes that is no disagreement in this House \n     concerning Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. United \n     Jerusalem will not be open to negotiation. It has been and \n     will forever be the capital of the Jewish people, under \n     Israeli, sovereignty, a focus of the dreams and longings of \n     every Jew.''\n       United States policy should be equally clear and \n     unequivocal. The search for peace only be hindered by raising \n     utterly unrealistic hopes about the future status of \n     Jerusalem among the Palestinians and understandable fears \n     among the Israeli population that their capital city may once \n     again be divided by cinder block and barbed wire.\n       The United States enjoys diplomatic relations with 184 \n     countries. Of these, Israel is the only nation in which our \n     embassy is not located in the functioning capital. This is an \n     inappropriate message to friends in Israel and, more \n     importantly, a dangerous message to Israel's enemies.\n       We believe that the United States Embassy belongs in \n     Jerusalem. It would be most appropriate for planning to begin \n     now to ensure such a move no later than the agreements on \n     ``permanent status'' take effect and the transition period \n     has ended, which according to the Declaration of Principles \n     is scheduled for May 1999. We would appreciate hearing from \n     you as to what steps are being taken to make such a \n     relocation possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Alfonse M.

The bill calls for completion of the Embassy in May \n1999, to ensure that such a move occurs no later than when the \nagreements on permanent status take effect and the transition period \nhas ended, according to the Declaration of Principles signed by Israel \nand the Palestinians in September 1993.\n  Jerusalem is and will remain the permanent and undivided capital of \nIsrael. I am not going to let the State Department bureaucrats forget \nthat.\n  The Clinton administration must recognize this and begin the process \nof moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. It is shameful that the United \nStates continues to bend to pressure to keep its Embassy outside of \nJerusalem.\n  While I understand that the present Middle East peace negotiations \nare both complicated and delicate, I do not want this administration to \nbe under the impression that Jerusalem will belong to anyone other than \nIsrael.\n  Further delay in moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem will only \nembolden the Palestinians who believe that they have a justified claim \nto the city.\n  While some worry that such a move will damage the peace process, \ndelay can only hurt it. If the future of Jerusalem remains unclear in \nthe minds of the Palestinians then they will increase their demands and \nthis will further complicate the already tense negotiations.\n  Let the message be clear: A united Jerusalem is off limits to \nnegotiation. Jerusalem belongs to Israel and our Embassy belongs in \nJerusalem.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 15477]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nlegislation before us, which would compel the movement of the United \nStates Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n  Jerusalem, city of peace, the holy city, was entered almost 3,000 \nyears ago by King David. Mr. President, 47 years ago, in 1948, the \nmodern State of Israel was established. The Prime Minister at that \ntime, David Ben-Gurion, declared Israel a state and declared also that \nits capital would be Jerusalem, although at that time, after the war \nfor independence, Jerusalem was a divided city: the western part \nIsraeli; the old city and the eastern part, Jordanian.\n  In the normal course of diplomatic relations, every nation in the \nworld would have established their embassy in the city, Jerusalem, \ndesignated as the capital by the new state of Israel, the state having \nbeen recognized by the United States, having been accepted as a member \nof the United Nations. But, for reasons that need not be spelled out in \ndetail here, because of controversy that surrounded the State of Israel \nand its creation, the modern state, the United States did not move its \nEmbassy to the capital of the State of Israel.\n  When you think about it, it is nothing short of outrageous. We have \ngone through 47 years of the history of this country, 47 years of \nextraordinary friendship between the United States and Israel based on \ncommon values, common history, our common commitment to what is \nappropriately described as the Judeo-Christian tradition, our common \ncommitment to democratic values. Through most of that time, the 47 \nyears, Israel was the only country in the Middle East that was a \ndemocracy. It was 47 years in which our strategic relationships have \ngrown ever closer, with joint military exercises and joint work on \nresearch and development, even, in this time, as we in the Senate have \nrecently considered the priority threat that ballistic missiles \nrepresent to our country, the United States and Israel have been \nworking jointly on a ballistic missile defense.\n  I remember once years ago hearing the then Prime Minister of Israel, \nGolda Meir, say, and I believe it is true today, that there is one \ncountry in the Middle East where the United States will always know--\nnot just today, not just 10 years from now or 50 years from now or 100 \nyears from now--as long as Israel exists, because the ties between \nthese countries are so deep and so strong--there is one country in the \nMiddle East where the United States will always know that in a time of \nneed, in a time of conflict, in a time of danger, the United States can \nalways land its planes, can always keep its equipment, can always bring \nits ships into Israeli docks. As she said, hopefully there will be a \ntime--and, of course, we echo that here in this Chamber, and there is \nsuch a time now--where there are other countries in the Middle East \nwhere that is so, where U.S. troops, U.S. personnel, are welcome. But \nit will always be so in Israel.\n  Yet, in spite of all these points of common value, common interest, \ncommon strategic purpose, shared strategic developments, nonetheless \nthe United States continued to be frozen into this inconsistent, \nillogical and in some senses insulting position of not moving its \nEmbassy to the city of Jerusalem, which Israel has designated as its \ncapital. There have been succeeding generations of American \npoliticians--of both parties--who somehow manage to be committed to the \nmovement of the embassy to Jerusalem during campaigns, but then when it \ncomes time that they hold office, it does not happen.\n  I think we are about to change all that, and I think we are about to \nchange it in a truly bipartisan way. It is, though a long overdue \nmoment, nonetheless a critically important moment when we are in reach \nof a strong, bipartisan majority in this Chamber and in the other body \nin support of this legislation.\n  Would that the legislation were not necessary. But, it is. In some \nsenses it may be unfortunate that it is, but in other senses it is \nfortunate that we bring this legislation to the Senate because the \neffect will be to show the world, to show the people of Israel, to show \nall concerned parties in the Middle East, that the representatives here \nin the Senate and in the House, both parties, from every section of the \ncountry, agree that this is a matter of principle, a matter of common \nsense, a matter in which the United States, a strong nation--the \nstrongest nation in the world--acts like a strong nation and does what \nis consistent with its principles.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate those who have brought this legislation \nforward: the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, Senator \nInouye, Senator Kyl, Senator Moynihan, and the countless others who \nhave fought this battle for so many years now, standing together \nshoulder to shoulder behind this piece of legislation. I am privileged \nto join them as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, the details of the legislation have been spelled out. \nBut the heart of it is that by this legislation, Congress will have \nstated a clear message. The Embassy of the United States in Israel will \nbe relocated to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel's choice of that city as \nits capital.\n  That relocation will occur no later than May 31, 1999. Why that day? \nObviously, if you believe that the Embassy ought to be moved to \nJerusalem, it should be moved as soon as possible, but that date was \ninserted by the sponsors--and I think wisely so--as an expression of \ndeference, or respect, if you will, for the peace process embodied in \nthe Declaration of Principles signed by the parties, Israel, the \nPalestinian Liberation Organization, the United States, and Russia on \nSeptember 13, 1993, here in Washington. May 1999 is the termination of \nthe process begun by this Declaration of Principles, the so-called \nMiddle East peace process. But let us set that definite date. Let us \nleave no uncertainty about it, that by that date the Embassy of the \nUnited States will be located in Jerusalem.\n  Mr. President, there are those who are concerned about what impact \nthis movement now will have on the peace process. Of course, every time \nin the past--I heard Senator Inouye speak in a meeting about this--any \ntime he has begun to move forward moving the Embassy to Jerusalem, \nthere is always something going on in the Middle East that makes it \nless than the perfect time.\n  So there are those who will say they are worried about what effect \nthis movement will have on the peace process. But I say that this is \nthe perfect time, though long overdue, to move the Embassy to Jerusalem \nbecause of the peace process, because we have a growing level of trust, \nbecause we have a growing level of mutual interest, and of common \npurpose among the parties in the Middle East. The United States has \nplayed a leadership role in bringing those changes about. But at the \nheart of those changes, at the heart of the peace process, must be an \nhonest relationship between the parties involved.\n  I do not think the United States should be at all unclear about this. \nWe are committed to doing in Israel what we do in every other country \nthat we know about in the world--putting the Embassy in its capital. \nLet this not be an act of delusion of the Palestinians or any of the \nother parties to this process. Let us be honest about it and, in a \nsense, let us get the question of where the American Embassy is in \nIsrael off the table in the peace process. Let us get it over with. \nThere is a lot to negotiate.\n  Some have suggested that somehow moving the Embassy was contrary to \nthe Declaration of Principles. Mr. President, I read from article V of \nthe Declaration of Principles signed here in Washington on September \n13, 1993. It says in section 3 of article V that it is understood that \nthese negotiations--which is to say, the permanent statis negotiations \nthat begin next year--shall cover the remaining issues, including \nJerusalem; presumably final status of Jerusalem, and certainly not the \nquestion of where the United States locates its Embassy in this \ncountry. We are a great nation. How could we, as a great nation, yield \nthat sovereign determination of ourselves to a process in which third \nparties are negotiating?\n  So I think we ought to be honest with the Palestinians here and \nindicate that this Embassy of ours will move to Jerusalem. That kind of \nhonesty will lead to trust as we go forward in the peace process.\n  Second, Mr. President, I need not go on at length but would simply \nsay I \n\n[[Page S 15478]]\nhave supported the peace process. I think the status quo before the \npeace process was going nowhere good, nowhere good for Israel, nowhere \ngood for the Arab world, nowhere good for the Palestinians, and nowhere \ngood for the Israeli security. There were no viable options to the \nattempt to make peace between the parties in conflict, understanding \nthat peace would not come overnight. It would be built step by step and \nwith each step outlined in the Declaration of Principles, hopefully \nenough trust would have been built to go on to the next step.\n  There are enemies of peace all around, and the worst enemies of peace \nare committing acts of terrorism still. Those acts of terrorism, \ndirected particularly against citizens of Israel, have an effect on the \nbody politic in Israel and shake confidence in the peace process, shake \nsupport for the peace process.\n  So I want to say, Mr. President, is that as the Israel people wonder \nand ask themselves whether the peace process really will provide more \nsecurity; as they express diminishing support for the peace process in \npolls that are taken; and as the Rabin government finds that in taking \nOslo 2 or Oslo B, the most recent agreement between Israel and the \nPalestinian authority, to the Israeli parliament--in the Knesset, the \nvote on ratification was 61 to 59; it is that close--the people of \nIsrael look to the United States, the foremost, most steadfast \nsupporter of the state, and ask where security will come from. Are \nthere limits to what Israel will be asked to do?\n  I think this is the perfect moment for the Congress of the United \nStates to say there are some limits here. There are some matters that \nare off the table. We understand the critical importance of the city of \nJerusalem to the people of Israel. And as a sign of that, this is the \nappropriate moment--long overdue, as I have said, but nonetheless a \nconstructive moment--to say by this act we are ready to move our \nEmbassy to Jerusalem.\n  So I hope, though I know there are questions raised, we will find a \nway, and perhaps before too long here today, to build a strong, \noverwhelming bipartisan vote for this measure.\n  I know there are concerns about constitutional questions. I know \nthere is a discussion of a possible waiver going on; that is to say, to \ngive the President the authority under some circumstances to waive the \nultimate penalties associated with not moving the Embassy by May 31, \n1999. I understand those questions, and I am involved in the \ndiscussions of those questions.\n  But it seems to me, as my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, said, it is critically important that any waiver be narrowly \ndrawn in that it not be a waiver that will go on forever, but that if \nthe President determines--first, the President must be required to find \na genuine threat to America's national security to stop the forward \nmovement of the Embassy to Jerusalem, a threat to our national \nsecurity. Second, that the waiver ought to be limited in time to \nperhaps 6-month periods so that the President will have to make that \ndecision each time those 6 months are over.\n  Mr. President, I am confident at this moment that we share--all of us \nin this Chamber--a goal; that is, to do what is right, to move the \nEmbassy to Jerusalem. The question now really is over legislative \nwording, the appropriate relationship between the branches. I am \noptimistic that we can do that because I think we all share in this \ngoal, and we are all committed to strengthening both our relationship \nwith our cherished ally, Israel, but also in bringing peace both to the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians, and to the Arab nations throughout the \nMiddle East.\n  So I urge my colleagues to do what I know they want to do, which is \nto vote for this proposal.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also rise to speak in favor of S. 1322, \nwhich is the Israel Embassy Relocation Act. I have long supported \nmoving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and I firmly \nbelieve that Jerusalem should remain as the undivided capital of \nIsrael.\n  Earlier this year, I joined 92 of my Senate colleagues in sending a \nletter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher endorsing the transfer \nof the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and as an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 1322, I commend the majority leader and \nSenator Kyl of Arizona for their constant and persistent leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Of the 184 United States Embassies around the world, our Embassy in \nIsrael is the only one that is not located in the chosen capital of the \nhost country. Israel has been mentioned many times on the floor today \nas a key strategic ally for America and the only true democratic nation \nin the Middle East. It makes good sense that the United States Embassy \nshould be located in the same city where the business of government is \nconducted. The Israeli people will not abandon the rightful claim to \nJerusalem as the eternal and undivided capital, and the United States \nwill not force them to relinquish that claim. This simply is not a \nnegotiable matter.\n  As the peace process continues, moving the United States Embassy to \nJerusalem again will send a clear message that America supports \nIsrael's claim to Jerusalem. It is far better that all parties in the \nMiddle East peace process understand America's position and know that \nit is a clear position. By allowing our position to remain ambiguous \nthroughout the peace talks, we would risk creating false and \nunrealistic expectations about the status and the destiny of Jerusalem.\n  Critics out there, including some in the administration, try to \ndismiss this bill as political pandering, but during his 1992 campaign \nit was President Clinton who deplored the fact that ``George Bush has \nrepeatedly challenged Israel's sovereignty over the united Jerusalem \nand groups Jerusalem with the West Bank and Gaza as up for negotiation. \nBill Clinton and Al Gore will . . . support Jerusalem as the capital of \nthe State of Israel.''\n  S. 1322 has strong bipartisan support with 67 cosponsors. This bill \nhas already been modified to provide the administration with more \nflexibility in trying to determine the construction timetable for a new \nEmbassy in Jerusalem, and as a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I hope the administration will drop any of its remaining \nopposition to this important symbolic legislation.\n  Mr. President, S. 1322 would rectify a half-century-old wrong, \ncontribute to the ongoing peace process, implement the wishes of the \nAmerican people, and it would fulfill the hopes of the Israeli people. \nI close by urging my colleagues to show that Congress overwhelmingly \nsupports this effort.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have before us an issue that I \nthink commands attention all around the world. It is an issue about \nwhether or not we acknowledge what is a fact of life--that the Embassy, \nour Embassy, embassies of countries with diplomatic relations with \nIsrael, belong in Israel's capital. There is no doubt that Jerusalem \nwill remain the undivided capital of Israel. What we are discussing \ntoday, frankly, is not whether or not the United States Embassy belongs \nin Jerusalem, our Ambassador to Israel should be stationed there; we \nare talking about something that is, frankly, I believe, a matter of \ntiming more than a matter of principle.\n  The question of timing raises many arguments and many views. I am \nonly able to stand in the Chamber a few minutes now because I have a \nBudget Committee meeting, which is kind of at the crux of lots of \nthings at the moment--reconciliation, how we develop our revenues and \nwhat our expenses are and how we get to a balanced budget.\n  That is certainly critical when we talk about foreign relations \ngenerally because we continue to reduce America's ability to \ncommunicate its views and ideas and implement its policies around the \nworld as we limit the funds available for the operation of the State \nDepartment and our ability to grant aid. \n\n[[Page S 15479]]\n\n  Just by way of quick example, in 1986 we gave 21 billion dollars' \nworth of foreign aid, and in 1996 we are going to provide around $12 \nbillion. And when you consider inflation, it is probably more like 30 \nbillion dollars' worth of aid or more at present values. But we will be \ngiving less than half of that, kind of saying that America is \nwithdrawing; America is stepping back; we are returning to a period, \nnot a very pleasant one in history, where we isolated ourselves from \nthe rest of the world. We continue to fund friendly nations like Egypt \nand Israel so that we can help maintain stability and an honest \nrelationship with these countries. And so part of what we want to do is \nrespect the sovereign view of where the capital lies and functions, \nand, as a responsible ally, place our Embassy there, within the normal \nreach of their Government. I think there are few in this Chamber who do \nnot want it to happen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's Washington Post on \npage A9, entitled ``He Felt What I Felt,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 23, 1995]\n\n ``He Felt What I Felt''--Jew, Palestinian Reach Out After Sons' Deaths\n\n                          (By Barton Gellman)\n\n       Jerusalem, Oct. 22.--Almost exactly a year ago, Abed Karim \n     Bader pinned on a skullcap to pass for a Jew and stopped his \n     rented car for a hitchhiking Israeli soldier.\n       With three confederates from Hamas, the Islamic Resistance \n     Movement, Bader overpowered Cpl. Nachshon Waxman and abducted \n     him to the West Bank. Israeli commandos staged a rescue raid, \n     and the kidnappers shot their bound captive to death in his \n     chair. Bader died in the gunfight moments later.\n       This is a conflict that trains even bystanders for their \n     roles. Loss calls for vengeance, hate for hate. Most of the \n     time those calls are answered. But not always.\n       Tonight two grieving fathers, Bader's and Waxman's sat \n     together behind a table and spoke of treading a new path of \n     peace. They each wore a gray beard and a skullcap--Yehuda \n     Waxman the knitted kippah of a religious Zionist, Yassin \n     Bader the white linen takiyah of a Muslim sheik.\n       They told a gathering of Israeli and Palestinian youths \n     that things had to change--that, as Waxman said, ``we have no \n     choice but to live together.''\n       ``We are two peoples who live in this land,'' Bader said. \n     ``We have each suffered. We have paid a heavy price with our \n     sons. Mr. Waxman is a religious man. He felt what I felt, and \n     I felt what he felt. I hope no one here will ever feel what \n     we have felt or suffer what we have suffered.''\n       There was no political program in the words, just a heart-\n     heavy hope good might somehow come of their loss. Waxman is \n     tortured by the time he did not make for his son, the \n     conversations he was always too busy to have. Bader asks \n     himself how he could have missed the signs that his son had \n     turned to Hamas. Both want to be teachers of tolerance, and \n     they started here.\n       The result were mixed. All the teenagers gathered at East \n     Jerusalem's American Colony Hotel were inclined to listen. \n     The Israelis were from Peace Now Youth, the Palestinians from \n     an informal peace group in Ramallah. Even so, there was anger \n     in the room, and strong distrust.\n       Ori Dirdikman, 17, an Israeli, stood up and said she wanted \n     to ask how Bader ``responded to all his son's expressions of \n     extremism, since I assume it didn't suddenly happen and he \n     must have had an opportunity to respond.''\n       Bader, a dignified man who runs a grocery in the Beit \n     Hanina section of East Jerusalem, composed his face. ``It is \n     hard,'' he said. ``I didn't know what was inside my son.''\n       Afterward, the Israeli teenager shook her head. ``I want to \n     believe him,'' she said, ``but no. I'm sorry, but I don't \n     think it is possible. If he was really for peace, he was \n     obliged to do something.\n       Fayez Othman, 17, a Palestinian, asked Waxman why Jews who \n     kill Arabs seem to get off lightly, while Arabs who dare cast \n     a stone are imprisoned for years.\n       Waxman tried to deflect the question at first, saying such \n     matters are for the government. But Othman pressed again. \n     ``What do you call this government? Is this a just \n     government?'' he asked.\n       ``You're a young man and you're looking for justice,'' \n     Waxman replied. ``I'm not looking for justice any more. There \n     are no just governments. There is only the best that people \n     can do. . . . It's better for a man to look for justice near \n     his home, with his brothers, with his friends. There you can \n     make a difference. Absolute justice? There's no such thing.''\n       Othman liked the second answer better, but only a little.\n       ``I didn't want to hear, `This is not my responsibility,' \n     '' the Palestinian said. ``I wanted to hear that this is \n     wrong.''\n       Even so, Othman said, he respected a man who could respond \n     to his son's death with a gesture of tolerance. ``This will \n     encourage us,'' he said.\n       Nachshon Waxman's kidnapping transfixed Israel last year. \n     His kidnappers released a videotape of the young man pleading \n     for his life. Yehuda Waxman, who said he could not stand to \n     watch, must be one of the few Israelis who did not see it. \n     His son, who held American and Israeli passports, died the \n     same day that the Nobel Peace Prize committee announced the \n     award would be shared among Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, \n     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Israeli Foreign \n     Minister Shimon Peres.\n       At first, the two families, Waxman and Bader, shared no \n     link save trauma. Yehuda Waxman prayed and spoke of \n     punishment for Hamas. At the Bader home--just a mile away--\n     the funeral tent featured slogans painted by Hamas declaring \n     Yassin Bader's son a martyr righteous cause.\n       The idea for reconciliation came as something of a \n     journalistic stunt. A weekly newspaper called Jerusalem \n     worked tirelessly to bring the two men together, negotiating \n     every detail for months.\n       Israeli soldiers had sealed the Bader home in retribution, \n     and Yassin Bader wanted nothing to do with Israelis. Yehuda \n     Waxman feared being used. Before he would meet Bader, he \n     insisted on a letter dissociating the sheik from his son's \n     acts.\n       Gradually Bader became convinced. He sat down and wrote out \n     longhand the requested note. ``I had no control over my \n     son,'' he wrote. ``I did not know of his plans. Had I known, \n     I would have opposed them. For who would want his son to risk \n     his life? Who would want his son to do such deeds?''\n       When the two men finally met, they said, they were struck \n     by how alike they were. Devout and serious, they decided to \n     work together.\n       Did it help? ``To tell the truth,'' said Naomi Cohen, 17, \n     ``with all the pain and for all the fact that I've grown up \n     on the left, I couldn't help hating [Bader] since he is the \n     father of a murderer, and he was sitting beside the total \n     opposite. They symbolize different things. Waxman is an \n     example to me. He is able to be more forgiving than I am, and \n     it was his son.''\n       Nihaya Harhash, also 17, said she felt ``anger and tension \n     on both sides.''\n       Waxman, interviewed afterward, said he was not discouraged \n     or surprised. ``This is our purpose, to see this anger melt \n     off,'' he said. ``It will take a long time. It will take \n     years and years. But we will do it.''\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The article talks about the pain of two fathers, one \nwhose son was kidnapped by the other's son and put on television when \nthis young man was held by Hamas, pleading for his life. His father \nheard the pleas of the young man as they held a gun to his head.\n  When the rescue attempt took place, just a little later on, not only \nwas the victim killed, but the perpetrator was killed. And now the \nfathers are meeting a year later and discussing their feelings. Nothing \ncan restore their children, but they can describe how they felt, their \nanger, their pain, the call for revenge, the call for healing, still \nunsure about what to do.\n  Mr. President, what we are witnessing now is almost a modern miracle. \nI have traveled many times to Israel and Jerusalem. I know people \nthere. I have visited the entire breadth of the country. And I know how \nimportant Jerusalem is to all faiths and that Israel has promised that \nits responsibility is to make sure that all faiths have access. There \nis not a lot of debate about what the capital of the country is. But \nmore than anything else, people want peace. They want to stop the \nkilling.\n  What we have seen in the last couple of years has been astonishing. \nPresident Clinton and the United States have help make peace between \nthese long-term enemies. It is something that, to me, resembled a \nmodern miracle. Everyone knows Yasser Arafat. They know his costume. \nThey know his manner. They know he was at the United Nations some years \nago with a gun on his hip; and he was there this time, 2 days ago, \nyesterday, talking about peace and moving the process along.\n  It was noted on this same page of the Washington Post, ``Joint \nJordanian-Israeli Flight Marks Anniversary of Treaty.'' Two air forces, \nIsrael and Jordan, flying side by side in joint maneuvers over both \ncountries. And I am sure the sirens in Israel did not go off when the \nJordanian airplanes flew over, and vice versa.\n  Peace in the making, but violence continues. Fathers and mothers \nstill anguish to understand what it is that takes their young son's \nlives. A few days ago six Israelis died on their northern border with \nLebanon. This killing has to stop.\n  Yesterday in New Jersey I spoke on behalf of a newly opened school. \nIt was a religious day school. And I met a man who I had only known by \ntelephone. His name is Stephen Flatow. I \n\n[[Page S 15480]]\nspoke to him on the phone while I was touring Israel and Egypt in April \nof this year, 6 months ago. The day I arrived in Israel from Egypt, an \nattack took place on a bus in which a number of people, innocent \npeople, died.\n  At that time the newly appointed Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, \nwas presenting his credentials in Israel. And he said to me, ``Frank, I \nhave terrible news. A young woman, 20 years of age, was on that bus and \nis on life support at the moment. She comes from New Jersey. She comes \nfrom West Orange, NJ. Her family has been just notified.''\n  I tried to find out more about her condition. It was precarious, at \nbest. And within 2 days she died. Twenty years old. She was in Israel \nstudying, on a learning experience. Murdered. For what reason? No \nexplanation. Terrorism. People angry at one another, so angry that \nreason was obliterated. The father flew to Israel immediately and saw \nhis daughter before she took her last breath.\n  I spoke to him on the phone after the funeral was held in New Jersey. \nI expressed my sympathy and he said one thing to me that, frankly, I \nfound almost so overpowering that it was hard to understand. He told me \nthat his 16-year-old daughter, his other child who was studying in \nIsrael also, was being asked by her father and mother, who just lost a \n20-year-old daughter, to continue her studies in Israel and to continue \nto fight for peace. Their daughter was killed in a senseless act of \nterrorism, and they continued to search for peace.\n  I saw him yesterday, as I said, and we talked about the peace \ninitiatives that are taking shape. I said, ``I may quote you. I want \nyou to know that I am going to mention our conversation. Do you want to \nsee the search for peace continued there, raising all kinds of \nquestions at the same time? Can Chairman Arafat keep law and order in \nthe Palestine community? Will there be disruptions from Hamas and other \nmad organizations, angry, supported by mad men with lots of money, by \nmad nations with lots of money? Is it worth the pursuit?''\n  And he said, ``Yes,'' it was worth the pursuit. ``And they should \ncontinue to search for peace.''\n  And the relevance of this, Mr. President, goes to the discussion \nunderway about whether or not the Embassy should be moved immediately, \nafter 47 years of being established in Tel Aviv, whether it should move \nimmediately or whether the move takes place in the context of general \ndiscussions of peace.\n  Now, I, for one, have advocated the establishment of the American \nEmbassy in Jerusalem from the day that Israel was declared a State, a \ncountry. I have said so as well in my many visits there--the first one \nbeing 1969 after the city had been united, when I saw what happened to \nholy Jerusalem during the years of occupation when there was total \ndisregard for artifacts, for archeological treasures, for custom, for \nreligion, for culture. I was stunned and glad to see the city \nundivided, and declared then, in 1969, that as long as I live and could \ndo anything about it, that city would never be divided again, that it \nwas essential that the world recognize that Jerusalem is the capital of \nIsrael.\n  And I do not like being in a discussion, Mr. President, where there \nare those saying, ``Well, perhaps it ought to take a little more \ntime.'' I do not want it to take more time. But I want it to be \nconsistent with the discussions that are taking place.\n  I could not believe that a couple weeks ago I stood with Chairman \nArafat, shook his hand. I have been very angry with Arafat in the past. \nAnd I am sure he felt the same way about me. But there we were, shaking \nhands and taking pictures because he was here in Washington on a peace \nmission.\n  We do not have to like the people we do business with, but if they \nare on the same wavelength, if they are on the same track, share the \nsame goals and principles, then one would have to be a fool not to \nrespect it.\n  And so, Mr. President, I fully support the establishment of the \nAmerican Embassy in Jerusalem, the undivided capital of the State of \nIsrael, but I will continue to debate the process as to exactly when \nand how we move. That is the only thing I ask, an open discussion.\n  The people who I know, the people I talk to feel similarly about \nwhether or not Jerusalem is the place that embassies belong. It is the \ncapital of the country. It does not belong anyplace else. We do not go \nto France and say we are going to locate our Embassy in Marseilles. We \ndo not go to Russia and say we will locate it outside of Moscow. It is \nup to them to decide where their capital is, and it is up to us, as \nfull diplomatic partners, to locate our Embassy where their capital is.\n  So I hope that as this debate unfolds, Mr. President, that we will \nkeep in mind that peace is the objective, a noble objective. I hope we \nwill try to understand the many sides of this peace discussion, because \nthere is now Jordan, a full diplomatic partner with Israel, there is \nEgypt, and there is hope that other countries will come along.\n  I hope the situation with the Palestinians can be resolved into a \nfull understanding. I hope we will see a more structured community and \nassistance to help the Palestinians establish themselves to have jobs, \nto have schools, to have a structured life, to have a chance to live \npeacefully.\n  So while I respect and appreciate Senator Dole's willingness to have \nthis move take place as well as the willingness of our colleague from \nArizona, who has been fully supportive of the establishment of the \nEmbassy in the capital of Israel, I hope that we have a chance to work \nout an understanding that we do not take away the President's \ninitiative to conduct foreign policy, and I hope that he will help us \nto help them conclude the peace discussions and get the Embassy moved \nas part of a total understanding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to pass on that the majority \nleader, with whom I was meeting, asked me to make the point that he is \nenormously gratified at the support over the years and, in particular, \nthe support of the Senator from New York for the bill on which he is \nabout to speak and without the support of the Senator from New York, \nobviously we would not be nearly as far along in this process as we \nare. The majority leader appreciates that very much.\n\n\n                      unanimous-consent agreements\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 6 \np.m. today, the majority leader, or his designee, be recognized in \norder to move to table the pending Dorgan amendment No. 2940.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I further ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5:40 \np.m., the Senate resume amendment No. 2940 and that there shall be 20 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form prior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. All Senators should therefore be informed, Mr. President, \nthat there will be a rollcall vote on the motion to table the Dorgan \namendment at 6 o'clock this evening.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to carry on the manner and \nthe thoughtfulness of my colleague and friend from New Jersey as we \nbegin this debate, which will shortly, I think, conclude for today.\n  The Senate stands ready to correct an absurdity which has endured for \nnearly half a century. We propose to respect Israel's sovereign right \nto choose her capital. We do this by providing for the relocation of \nour embassy to the city which contains the Parliament of that State.\n  The bill which the distinguished majority leader has proposed will \nensure that the United States Embassy in Israel is moved to Jerusalem, \nthe undivided capital of that State, no later than May 31, 1999.\n  I have been involved with this particular issue in some measure since \nmy tenure as Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 1975. By \nthe early 1970's, the United States was faced with a General Assembly \nwhere a Soviet-led coalition wielded enormous power and used it in an \nassault against the democracies of the world. In that regard, I cite an \neditorial in the New Republic which recently said of the United Nations \nin that time that ``During the cold war, the U.N. became a \n\n[[Page S 15481]]\n\nchamber of hypocrisy and proxy aggression.''\n  Proxy aggression, Mr. President, and in particular directed to the \nState of Israel, which became a metaphor for democracy under virtual \nsiege at the United Nations.\n  Those who had failed to destroy Israel on the field of battle joined \nthose who wished to discredit all Western democratic governments in an \nunprecedented, sustained attack on the very right of a U.N. member \nstate to exist within the family of nations.\n  The efforts in the 1970's to delegitimize Israel came in many forms, \nnone more insidious than the twin campaigns to declare Zionism to be a \nform of racism and to deny Israel's ties to Jerusalem. Those who ranted \nagainst the ``racist Tel Aviv regime'' were spewing two ugly lies. Both \nhad at their heart a denial of Israel's right to exist.\n  The first lie, the infamous Resolution 3379, was finally repealed on \nDecember 16, 1991, after the cold war had ended and the Soviet Union \ndissolved.\n  Today, we take an important step to refute the second lie, the absurd \nsuggestion that Israel did not have a right to select its own capital \ncity.\n  Israel expects attempts by her enemies to undermine her, but it is \nmore difficult to fathom our own refusal to recognize Israel's chosen \ncapital and to locate our Embassy in Jerusalem. In so doing, we have \ngiven and continue to give unintended encouragement to those enemies of \nIsrael who hope one day to be able to divide the United States and that \nnation, the only democratic state in the Middle East. For as long as \nIsrael's most important friend in the world refuses to acknowledge that \nIsrael's capital city is not its own, we lend credibility and dangerous \nstrength to the lie that Israel is somehow a misbegotten, an \nillegitimate, or transient state.\n  This suggestion is all the more untenable when you consider that no \nother people on this planet have been identified as closely with any \ncity as the people of Israel are with Jerusalem --a city which this \nyear celebrates the 3000th anniversary of King David declaring it his \ncapital. No Jewish religious ceremony is complete without mention of \nthe Holy City. And twice a year, at the conclusion of the Passover \nSeder and the Day of Atonement services, all assembled repeat one of \nmankind's shortest and oldest prayers ``Next year in Jerusalem.''\n  Throughout the centuries Jews kept this pledge, often sacrificing \ntheir very lives to travel to, and live in, their holiest city. It \nshould be noted that the first authoritative Turkish census of 1839 \nreported that Jews were by far the largest ethnic group in Jerusalem--\nand this long before there was a West Jerusalem, or even any \nsettlements outside the ancient walled city.\n  When the modern State of Israel declared independence on May 14, \n1948, Jerusalem was the only logical choice for the new nation's \ncapital --even if it was only a portion of Jerusalem, the Jordanian \nArab Legion having occupied the eastern half of the city and expelled \nthe Jewish population of the Old City--Jerusalem was sundered by barbed \nwire and cinder block and Israelis of all faiths and Jews of all \ncitizenship were barred from even visiting the section under Jordanian \noccupation.\n  The world was silent while the historic Jewish Quarter of the city \nwas sacked and razed to the ground, 127 synagogues were destroyed, and \n3,000 years of history were denied. This bizarre anomaly only ended on \nJune 5, 1967, when Israel faced renewed aggression from Egypt and \nSyria, both then close friends of, and dependents of the Soviet Union. \nAs hostilities commenced, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol sent a \nmessage to King Hussein of Jordan promising that, if Jordan refrained \nfrom entering the war, Israel would not take action against it. Jordan, \nhowever, attacked Israel that same day. Within the week, Israeli forces \nhad captured all of Jerusalem, as well as other territories west of the \nJordan River. The City of David was once again united, and has been \nsince 1967. Under Israeli rule Jerusalem has flourished as it did not \nunder Jordanian occupation, and the religious shrines of all faiths \nhave been meticulously protected.\n  Israel has found itself repeatedly attacked, boycotted, and spurned \nby its neighbors. But slowly Israel has worked to secure a less hostile \nenvironment. First, the historic Camp David Accords brought peace \nbetween Israel and Egypt. All Senators are aware of the unprecedented \naccomplishments of the last 2 years. Jordan is at peace with Israel and \na peace process is well underway with the Palestinians. In fact, Mr. \nArafat gave voice at the United Nations just yesterday.\n  The United Nations is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Even Yasir \nArafat, who 21 years ago addressed the General Assembly wearing a gun \nholster, spoke yesterday of the tremendous achievements in Israeli-\nPalestinian relations. The New York Times characterizes Mr. Arafat's \nremarks as ``a far more conciliatory tone than during his last visit.'' \nAnd contrasts his earlier calls for the destruction of Israel with \nyesterday's General Assembly pledge to ``turn over the leaf of killing \nand destruction once and for all so that the Palestinian people and \nIsraeli people may live side by side.''\n  There are those who might criticize our proposal, saying that we have \nno business taking such action while the peace process continues. On \nthe contrary--or such is my view. This is our Embassy and congressional \nsentiment should be made known. In this I am reminded of a message from \nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to the American-Israel Friendship League \non November 28, 1993 in which he wrote:\n\n       In 1990, Senator Moynihan sponsored Senate Resolution 106, \n     which recognized Jerusalem as Israel's united Capital, never \n     to be divided again, and called upon Israel and the \n     Palestinians to undertake negotiations to resolve their \n     differences. The resolution, which passed both houses of \n     Congress, expressed the sentiments of the United States \n     toward Israel, and, I believe, helped our neighbors reach the \n     negotiating table.\n\n  The negotiators will soon turn to final status issues, as defined by \nthe Declaration of Principles signed on September 13, 1993, by Israel \nand the Palestinians. The status of Jerusalem is one of the agenda \nitems to be settled during this final stage of the peace process. It is \ninconceivable that Israel would agree to any proposal in which \nJerusalem did not remain the capital of Israel. Since Jerusalem will \ncontinue to be the capital of Israel, it is time to begin planning to \nmove the United States Embassy to ensure that at the end of the process \nit will be where it belongs.\n  Our Embassy should have been moved long ago, but we recognize the \nmomentous achievements taking place in the Middle East and they temper \nour actions. Our intentions are clear. When the peace process is \ncompleted, which according to the Declaration of Principles is \nscheduled for May 1999, our Embassy will be located in Jerusalem.\n  On March 20th of this year, Senator D'Amato and I sent a letter to \nSecretary Christopher with the support of 91 other Senators. That \nletter made it clear that the overwhelming majority of Senators agree \nwith the proposition that ``Jerusalem is and shall remain the undivided \ncapital of the State of Israel.'' We also wrote that our embassy \nbelongs in Jerusalem and we asked the Secretary to inform us of the \nsteps being taken to make a relocation of our Embassy to Jerusalem \npossible.\n  Today we have before us legislation that reflects the spirit of our \nletter to Secretary Christopher. I am hopeful that the President will \nbe able to sign this legislation. Prime Minister Begin once advised me \nthat the ``battle for Jerusalem should never be fought in the halls of \nCongress.'' I agree and am pleased that the majority leader worked with \nthose of us on our side of the aisle to produce a draft that reflects \nthe bipartisan consensus of the Senate. I would also like to commend my \nfriend, the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, for his \nconsiderable contribution to the formulation of this bill.\n  This administration has been effective in the Middle East peace \nprocess. Secretary Christopher has personally flown to the region \nnumerous times and has clearly committed himself to active \nparticipation in the peace process. On the issue of our Embassy, I \nwould respectfully suggest that the administration direct its attention \nto the comments of Prime Minister Rabin, as our letter to the Secretary \nof State noted:\n\n       There can be little doubt that Jerusalem is a sensitive \n     issue in the current peace process. While the Declaration of \n     Principles stipulates that Jerusalem is a ``final status'' \n\n[[Page S 15482]]\n     issue to be negotiated between the parties, we share Prime Minister \n     Rabin's view which be expressed to the Knesset that:\n       On Jerusalem, we said: ``This Government, like all its \n     predecessors, believes there is no disagreement in this House \n     concerning Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. United \n     Jerusalem will not be open to negotiation. It has been and \n     will forever be the capital of the Jewish people, under \n     Israeli sovereignty, a focus of the dream and longing of \n     every Jew.''\n\n  It continues:\n\n       United States policy should be equally clear and \n     unequivocal. The search for peace can only be hindered by \n     raising utterly unrealistic hopes about the future status of \n     Jerusalem among the Palestinians and understandable fears \n     among the Israeli population that their capital city may once \n     again be divided by cinder block and barbed wire.\n\n  Charles Krauthammer adopted a similar line of argument in a column in \nthe Washington Post on May 19, 1995, when he wrote:\n\n       True, the embassy move does endorse the proposition that \n     Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. What possibly could be \n     wrong with that? Is it the PLO position that even after a \n     final peace, Jerusalem may not be the capital of Israel?\n\n  That is the simple proposition for the Senate today, Mr. President. \nThis bill would provide for the relocation of our Embassy to Jerusalem \nwhere it has always belonged. It does not interfere with the peace \nprocess, because there is no scenario in which Israel would agree to \nrelinquish Jerusalem as its capital.\n  The Senate's involvement in this particular issue could be traced in \nsome degree to the seventh conference of heads of state of government \nof nonaligned countries, which convened in New Delhi, India, March 7 \nthrough 11, in 1983. This summit devoted several lengthy passages of \nits final declaration as it is called--final declaration--to \nexcoriating Israel and its ally the United States. Special attention \nwas devoted to the question of Jerusalem's status. And not just east \nJerusalem as had become the practice of such forums.\n  I happened to be in New Delhi in the days before the summit began and \nwas shown a draft of the final declaration. The draft passage on Israel \nread: ``Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian territory and \nIsrael should withdraw completely and unconditionally from it and \nrestore it to Arab sovereignty.''\n  While surely this can be read as a provocative statement that all of \nJerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory, when pressed on the point, \nmy Indian hosts assured me that by Jerusalem they really only meant \neast Jerusalem, which is to say the old city, or perhaps the Arab \nsection. Hence, the significance of the revised final text of the \ndeclaration of some 101 nations. This is what nonaligned declared in \nthat session in 1983:\n\n       West Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian \n     territory and Israel should withdraw completely and \n     unconditionally from it and restore it to Arab sovereignty.\n\n  West Jerusalem, Mr. President.\n  The 101 nations of the nonaligned movement declared that the Israeli \nParliament and government buildings, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust \nmemorial, the whole of the new city, did not belong to Israel. The \nState of Israel is not a nation. It has no capital, or so said the \nnonaligned.\n  What was the response from Washington to such polemics? Not a word. \nIn effect, our silence could have been interpreted as implying that we \nhad no quarrel with those who state that Israel has no capital. And \nthus, that Israel is less than a sovereign nation.\n  It was at this point that I brought the issue to the Senate floor. On \nSeptember 22, 1983, during consideration of the State Department \nauthorization bill, I offered an amendment to articulate the clearest \nand most emphatic demonstration of a policy of fairness toward Israel. \nThe amendment was only one sentence long: ``The United States shall \nmaintain no embassy in Israel that is not located in the city of \nJerusalem.''\n  I withdrew the amendment after Senator Percy, the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the time, gave his \nassurance that a hearing would be held on the matter. On October 31, \n1983, I introduced S. 2031 which also required the relocation of our \nEmbassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n  Senator Percy, always true to his word, convened a hearing of the \nSenate Foreign Affairs Committee on February 23, 1984, to consider that \nbill. Lawrence Eagleburger, then Under Secretary of State for Political \nAffairs testified on behalf of the administration.\n  I stated in my testimony to the committee:\n\n       I begin with the simple proposition that Jerusalem is the \n     capital of the state of Israel and our embassy in that State \n     should be in its capital.\n       This would seem to be an unexceptional statement, Mr. \n     Chairman. That it is not is the result of actions the United \n     States has taken and actions not taken.\n       In the first category is the unprecedented and bewildering \n     practice of the United States Government in its official \n     publications to record that there is a ``country'' named \n     Israel in which our Embassy is located at a ``post'' named \n     Tel Aviv; and another ``country'' named Jerusalem in which we \n     are represented at a ``post'' named Jerusalem.\n\n  Secretary Eagleburger suggested they might at least be able to \ncorrect the State Department phone book, but nothing was done.\n  Offical documents published by the United States Government at the \ntime, such as the State Department's ``Key Officers of Foreign Service \nPosts: Guide for Business Representatives,'' listed Jerusalem separate \nfrom Israel. The guide listed countries alphabetically, under each of \nwhich in subscript was enumerated the various diplomatic posts the \nUnited States Government maintained in that country.\n  There was Ireland, with the one post in Dublin; then came Israel, \nwith one diplomatic office listed, its address in Tel Aviv; then \ncuriously several pages later, after Japan, there was listed a \nConsulate General in a country called Jerusalem. Then came Jordan and \nKenya.\n  That was how the Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts was organized \nuntil the end of 1994, when Secretary Christopher published the \ndocument with Jerusalem listed under the Israel heading. This is a \nwelcome change. That simple refusal by the United States Government to \nassociate our consulate in Jerusalem with the State of Israel carried \nmuch greater weight with the nonaligned countries than we realized.\n  They would not have acted as they had done in 1983 if they did not \nthink at some measure we were not in disagreement. Our documents have \nso implied.\n  No doubt, we wounded the Israelis more than we intended as well, \nwhile sending a dangerous message to Israeli enemies.\n  Clarifying the status of Jerusalem began to gain momentum in the \nSenate in 1990 when I submitted S. Con. Res. 106, which States simply: \n``Jerusalem is and should remain the capital of the State of Israel.'' \nA simple declarative sentence which gained 85 cosponsors and was \nadopted unanimously by the Senate and by an overwhelming majority in \nthe House.\n  Two years later, Senator Packwood and I submitted Senate Concurrent \nResolution 113 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the reunification \nof Jerusalem.\n  The measure stated that, ``Congress strongly believes that Israel \nmust remain an undivided city.'' That, too, was agreed to unanimously, \nboth in the Senate and the House.\n  Last year, in the wake of the massacre in Hebron, the United Nations \nSecurity Council adopted a measure which referred to Jerusalem as \n``occupied territory.'' Senator Mack and I sent a letter to the \nPresident, with the signature of 81 other Senators, calling on the \nadministration to veto any U.N. Security Council resolution which \nstates or implies that Jerusalem is occupied territory.\n  To his credit, President Clinton responded with a forceful promise to \nveto any future U.N. resolution which raised questions about the status \nof Jerusalem. A promise that he kept on May 17, 1995, when Ambassador \nAlbright cast such a long overdue veto in the Security Council.\n  In the winter of 1981, I wrote an article in Commentary entitled \n``Joining The Jackals'' in response to the Carter administration's \ndisastrous support for a resolution challenging Israel's rights in \nJerusalem. Almost 15 years later, we find that the jackals are in \nretreat. Israelis and Palestinians are negotiating the details of their \nfuture. And today we have an opportunity to make a simple but important \ncontribution to this process by unequivocally recognizing Israel's \nchosen capital.\n\n[[Page S 15483]]\n\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from Connecticut has risen. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom New York for his statement, which is not only characteristically \nlearned--which is to say characteristic of him, not necessarily of all \nof us--but also characteristically principled.\n  The history of our Government's policy on this question of the \nlocation of the American Embassy in Israel is a tawdry history. It is \nnot the history of a great and principled nation. It is a history of a \nnation that has, I think, in the words of a musical, ``bowed and \nkowtowed'' too often and too low, when it was not necessary, on a \nmatter as fundamental as respecting a country--not just any country but \na country that is a dear and cherished, valued ally--in its own \ndecision about where its capital is. It is a sovereign nation, a member \nof the United Nations.\n  There has been a way in which our whole history here--harking to my \nearlier incarnation as Attorney General enforcing consumer protection \nlaws--unfortunately, has been one of bait and switch. The political \nprocess has engaged in kind of alluring promises during campaigns and \nthen switched to an entirely less principled, more pragmatic--in the \nworst sense of pragmatic--position once in office.\n  But I really rise to recite that unhappy history just to say that, \nthroughout all of that, as long as he has been in public office, the \nSenator from New York has been a steadfast beacon of principle on \nthis--and of course other questions--but on this, unwavering, speaking \nout of the best of our traditions and the best traditions of \ninternational law. Hopefully, the Chamber will catch up with him in the \nvote on the measure before us.\n  But I do not know that I have adequate words, not only to express my \nadmiration, but to do the historical record justice here as to the \nreally pioneering and principled and consistent position that the \nSenator from New York has taken. I thank him for his statement, but, \nreally, more than that, I thank him for all he has done over the years \nto bring the Chamber to the point where we may finally be about to \ndirect the movement of the Embassy to Jerusalem by a date certain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I express my profound gratitude for \nthe remarks of my friend from Connecticut. If he is only partially \ncorrect, I am wholly complimented and deeply honored.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nrelocating the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. I want to share \nwith my colleagues my reasons for holding this view.\n  First, locating the Embassy in Jerusalem is practical and will \nstreamline our diplomatic operations. For decades, the offices of \nIsrael's President and Prime Minister, the Knesset, and most government \nministries have been located in Jerusalem. Moving our Embassy there \nwill make it easier to conduct diplomatic business. So it is common \nsense to move the Embassy to Jerusalem.\n  Second, it is consistent with our policies for other nations. Israel \nis the only nation in the world where our Embassy is not located in the \nhost nation's chosen capital. Let me repeat that. Israel is the only \nnation in the world where our Embassy is not located in the host \nnation's chosen capital.\n  A number of concerns have been expressed about the wisdom of moving \nthe Embassy at this time. I want to address each of these concerns \nspecifically.\n  Opponents have said that this bill could trigger anger and terrorism \non the part of Israel's opponents. Indeed, when the bill was first \nbeing circulated, opponents said the peace process would fall apart. \nThey said the peace process would fall apart if we even introduced this \nbill. But the peace process did not fall apart. As a matter of fact, \nthe peace process moved forward. That is because this bill is not \ndirectly related to the peace process. As a matter of fact, this bill, \nas recently modified--and I support the modifications--shows great \ndeference to the peace process. By removing the requirement for an \nearly construction start date, this bill shows complete respect for the \npeace process. Opponents of this bill have also argued we should wait \nto move our Embassy until the so-called final status negotiations are \ncomplete. I would argue that, although the final status of Jerusalem \nmay be an issue in the peace talks, the location of our Embassy is not. \nThe location of an American Embassy is entirely an American decision.\n  In any case, our Embassy will be located within the pre-1967 West \nJerusalem border, not in the more controversial eastern section. It is \nthis fact that leads me to conclude that moving our Embassy would in no \nway prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations. It is not \nas if we are breaking new ground in a new area that has not been under \nIsraeli control.\n  Finally, and perhaps the most important point I wish to make for my \ncolleagues today, is that when I was in Israel in November, I sensed an \nundeniable fear and concern about the future. Terrorist attacks were \nescalating. Support for peace was falling. As a matter of fact, there \nwas not one person, whether it was a cab driver or a student, that I \nmet who did not indicate to me the fears that they had.\n  Israel, of course, is taking a risk for peace, and, therefore, the \npeople are taking a risk for peace. As a matter of fact, all the good \npeople who come to the table, whatever side they are on, are taking a \nrisk for peace. So, when I left Israel, I thought, we need to do \nsomething here to just show that we support the peace process, and that \nwe support our close ally, Israel. I think this is something we can do \nthat demonstrates a high level of respect for the good people of the \nState of Israel, and for the peace process as a whole.\n  I have a very balanced view of this issue. I believe that Yasser \nArafat must have what he needs to build confidence among Palestinians \nfor the peace process so that extremist groups like Hamas renounce \nviolence and go to the ballot box as their way. I think this is very \nimportant. And that is why I supported the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act, which authorized continuing aid to the Palestinian \nauthority so long as they continued to meet their commitments to work \nfor peace.\n  So, Mr. President, I support the Palestinians who are working for \npeace, and I support the Israelis who are working for peace. Just as we \nshow support for the Palestinians through the Peace Facilitation Act, \nwe must also show support for the people of Israel who have taken some \nvery serious risks for peace. I think that this bill sends a very \nimportant message.\n  I want to say again that I understand that there are those in the \nSenate who want changes to this bill. And we may have a couple of \namendments. I will look them over very carefully.\n  But the point that I want to make today is that I hope we are going \nto pass this bill with a united front--all of us together, regardless \nof political party or ideology. To pass this important legislation with \na unified voice would send a strong message. Yes, we support the peace \nprocess, and yes, we support moving our Embassy to Jerusalem. Surely, \nwe should do no less for our friend and ally Israel.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated when I previously rose to \nspeak on this bill, I intend to support the bill. I think this \nunderlying bill makes a great deal of sense. I offered a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment to this bill, which I understand is now going to be \nvoted on at 6 o'clock this evening, and just prior to that vote there \nwill be 10 minutes of debate on each side. I wanted to rise briefly to \ndescribe what the sense-of-the-Senate amendment is.\n  I indicated when I offered it that I have no intention of holding up \nthis legislation. I support this legislation. I want this legislation \nto move. But I was constrained last week from offering this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment, and it is the only way I have to \n\n[[Page S 15484]]\nexpress myself--and hopefully, express the sentiments of the Members of \nthe Senate--on this issue. So this device is an attempt in the sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution to once again weigh in on this question of \npriorities.\n  My sense-of-the-Senate resolution expresses the following: It is the \nsense of the Senate that any tax cut provided by the Congress this year \nshall be limited to those whose income is under $250,000 a year, and \nthe savings, by limiting the tax cut to those who earn less than \n$250,000 a year, shall be used to reduce the cut that is being proposed \nfor Medicare.\n  Again, my suggestion is very simple. This is always a debate about \npriorities. It is really nothing more than that. It is not a debate \nabout whether there should be a balanced budget. Of course, there \nshould be a balanced budget. It is a debate about how we get there. \nSome say give very large tax cuts to some very affluent people, and let \nus give very large budget cuts in Medicare that will affect some very \nlow-income elderly people. I think that the proper priority would be to \nsay, let us think about this more clearly.\n  I offered an amendment a couple of weeks ago saying, let us at least \nlimit the tax cut to those whose incomes are below $100,000 a year and \nuse the savings from that to reduce the amount of cuts in the Medicare \nProgram. That was voted down by the Senate.\n  I say, all right. I indicated then I am going to offer another \nresolution. How about limiting the tax cut to those whose incomes are \nbelow a quarter of a million dollars a year? Gosh, there are not a lot \nof Americans who make more than a quarter of a million dollars a year. \nThose who do I do not think at this point need a tax cut. Their top tax \nrate has gone down from 70 percent in 1980, down to 39 percent low. Let \nus at least decide that we will limit the tax cut to those whose \nincomes are below a quarter of a million dollars a year. Then whatever \nwe save from that limitation, let us use that to offset the cuts that \nare now being proposed for Medicare, to see if we can soften that blow \na bit.\n  That is the purpose of my sense-of-the-Senate resolution. And we will \nhave a vote on that at 6 o'clock. I hope the Senate will approve that. \nThen I hope following approval of that, it will express itself to those \nwho are writing this reconciliation bill, and maybe we will have a \nreconciliation bill to come to the floor that does just that.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much for yielding.\n  I want to commend my friend for giving us an opportunity to express \nourselves on a very basic point. To me, it is extraordinary that the \nRepublican Congress with very few exceptions--maybe one or two--are \ngoing to cut $270 billion out of Medicare and use about $245 billion \nfor a tax cut that mostly benefits the very wealthy.\n  What my friend is saying is, look--to the Republicans--we want to \ngive a tax cut, but at least come along with us and say that the people \nwho earn over a quarter of a million dollars a year do not really need \nthat tax cut as much as our seniors need Medicare.\n  In California, the average woman who is on Social Security earns \n$8,500 a year. I say to my friend from North Dakota that the numbers \nare probably even lower in his State--$8,500 a year for the average \nwoman on Social Security.\n  I daresay that if you talk to any decent human being, a gentleman who \nearns $350,000 or a woman who earns $500,000 a year, and you ask them, \n``Do you really need to have this tax cut, or would you rather that our \nsenior citizens live in dignity,'' I daresay the reasonable, \nthoughtful, decent American in that highest 1 percent income bracket \nwould say, ``You know something? Sure. It would be nice to have another \ntrip to Europe, but I think that is not the American way. I do not \nthink that is really family values.''\n  I want to say to my friend. I wonder if he has heard some of Kevin \nPhillips' quotes on this issue. Kevin Phillips is a Republican \ncommentator, and on the 19th of September he made a number of quotes. I \nwonder if I could read them to my friend and ask him to comment on \nthem.\n  First of all, this is Kevin Phillips. This is not Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia, a Democrat from California, speaking. This is a Republican \ncommentator. On September 19, he said:\n  If the Republican Medicare reform proposal was a movie, its most \nappropriate title would be ``Health Fraud II.''\n  Then he says, ``Today's Republicans see Federal Medicare outlays to \nold people as a treasure chest of gold for partial redirection in their \nfavorite direction towards tax cuts for corporations. Furthermore,'' he \nsays, ``the revolutionary ideology driving the new Republican Medicare \nproposal is cut middle-class programs as much as possible and give the \nmoney back to business and high-income taxpayers.'' And finally he \nsays, ``In part, the Republicans' Medicare shell game is a \nredistribution towards America's small 1 or 2 percent elite.''\n  So my friend is giving us a chance here, in a bipartisan way, to be I \nthink humane, reasonable, sensible, and smart. I wonder if he would \ncomment on these quotations from Kevin Phillips, because I think it is \nrather extraordinary that even a Republican says they have gone too far \nwith their budget proposal. Will my friend comment on that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. This discussion has often been called class warfare; it \nis just more politics, just partisan.\n  I really do not see it so much as Republican versus Democrat. It \nreally is choices. In the case of the reconciliation bill heading our \nway, the choice is to decide that one-half of the American families \nwill pay higher taxes. That is the choice. And that is not for me. That \nis from the Treasury Department and others who have analyzed it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield? Is it not true it is those who earn \nunder $30,000 a year who will pay more taxes under the Republican plan?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was just going to give a multiple choice question, and \nthe multiple choice question would be A or B.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If you learned that the reconciliation bill coming to the \nfloor of the Senate from the majority party provides that one-half of \nthe American families will end up paying higher taxes, do you think it \nwould be, A, the bottom 50 percent of income earners or B, the top 50 \npercent of income earners?\n  I will bet you that most Americans would say, well, given what we \nhave read so far, they probably say that the lower half of the income \nfolks ought to pay higher taxes. And you know, that is exactly what is \ncoming our way. But for the top 5 or 6 or 1 percent of the American \npeople it is not higher taxes. It is an enormous amount of benefits in \nform of lower taxes. That is the purpose of this amendment. It is not \nanti-Republican or anticonservative. It is to say this is about a \nseries of choices we are going to make and let us express ourselves.\n  Is the choice of cutting Medicare funding that is needed for senior \ncitizens to the depths that they are talking about, $270 billion, is \nthat a choice that ought to take precedence over a tax cut for the \nwealthy? That is what I want people to express themselves on.\n  My sense is that if this Congress could sit down without all the \nlights and without a lot of fanfare and thoughtful people discuss what \nreally are the priorities, just in a room without microphones, I do not \nhave any question that this Congress would say those 55,000 kids, those \nlittle 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds, all of them who have names--every \none of them has a name--those little kids on the Head Start Program who \nare disadvantaged, come from low-income households, those that are \ngoing to get kicked off the Head Start Program because we have decided \nthere is not enough money for those 55,000, I do not have any doubt \nthat a group of thoughtful people would say you know something in our \njudgment, Head Start investment for 55,000 4-year-olds and 5-year-olds \nis a better investment and a more important investment than building \nthe second $1 billion amphibious assault ship.\n  I do not think there is any question at all that is the case. This \nCongress was provided with a choice during the defense bill--lots of \nchoices: star wars, yes. B-2 bombers yes--20 of them, $30 billion, and \nthen the choice was which of the two amphibious assault ships shall we \nbuild, the $900 million one or the $1.3 billion one. You know what the \n\n[[Page S 15485]]\nCongress decided? ``Let's build both of them. Why should we have to \nchoose?''\n  My point is the choice is to say yes, let us build a second \namphibious assault ship for $1 billion and then let us take 55,000 kids \nout of the Head Start Program. It is just that simple because it is \nalways about choices. You choose to spend the resources and what \nrepresents an investment in the future of the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield just one last time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because I am going to head back to the Budget Committee \nso I can vote against the Republican budget and proudly do it. I again \nthank my friend for pointing these things out. He is so right about the \ndefense number. The admirals and generals came to us and said we need x \nbillions of dollars to do our job, and this Republican Congress gave \nthem $30 billion-plus, more than they asked for over the next 7 years. \nTo me, it is extraordinary how far those dollars could go, whether it \nis in the Senator's home State, my home State, the Chair's home State. \nAnd just cavalierly not wanting to make any choice, we are going back \nto the days of the $400 hammers and the $600 toilet seats and the \n$7,600 coffee pot. The wasteful spending kind of gets lost in the \ndebate.\n  I wish to make one final point in support of my friend. The \nreconciliation bill that is headed here clearly is really a funnel \nplan. It is a funnel from the senior citizens in our country through \nthe Medicare Program, from the poor, the disabled in our country \nthrough the Medicaid plan--and by the way two-thirds of our seniors in \nnursing homes are on Medicaid, so it is a funnel from those people, it \nis a funnel from those working people who the Senator described who \nearn $30,000 or less, it is a funnel from all of those groups, the \nmiddle-class right into this tax cut for the wealthy.\n  What my friend is giving us a chance to do later on this evening is \nto say enough is enough. Enough is enough. We are hurting too many \npeople in this country. For all the talk about family values, we are \nhurting families. Buried in this bill, we are repealing nursing home \nstandards. It is extraordinary. And I vowed that in my mother's name I \nwould fight that--seniors who are scalded in bathtubs in nursing homes, \nseniors who are sexually molested, seniors who wander out of nursing \nhomes onto the streets and freeze to death. That is why we have \nnational standards.\n  But in the Republican budget, what is more important than nursing \nhome standards is giving a tax break for the wealthiest. What my friend \nis saying is that enough is enough. Defer that tax break, if you earn \nover a quarter of a million dollars, and let us not hurt the kids, the \nfamilies, the middle class, the working poor, the grandmas and grandpas \nin nursing homes. I will be proud to stand with my friend and I hope we \ncan win this vote.\n  I yield back to my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from California. We will have a vote \non this at 6 o'clock. And again I do not intend to pursue it further. I \nwill come back for 10 minutes of debate prior to that time. But it is \nvery simple. It simply says let us limit the tax cut, if there is a tax \ncut coming in this legislation--there apparently is; I would prefer \nthere not be but there is--let us limit that to families earning at \nleast $250,000 a year and then let us use the savings by that \nlimitation to reduce the cuts in Medicare. It is a very simple sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. President, let me mention one additional item. I did not respond \nearlier today. following the presentation by Senator Conrad and myself, \nthe Senator from New Mexico came to the floor and the Senator from \nArizona, and there was some discussion about balanced budgets and the \nCongressional Budget Office and a whole range of other things. So let \nme respond briefly. In effect, the Senator from Arizona was generous \nenough to bring to the floor the voting records and described what \nSenator Conrad  and I had voted for.\n  It always amazes me some to find someone changing the subject. That \nis the equivalent of getting lost and then claiming that where you \nfound yourself is where you intended to be.\n  Well, I guess that is an interesting way to describe what the debate \nis about. But the debate was not about whether Senator Conrad or I \nvoted for budget resolutions in the past. Yes, we did.\n  We voted for the one in 1993. We voted for previous ones. We never \nclaimed those budget resolutions, which, incidentally, reduces the \ndeficit, which is why we voted for them, we never claimed what the \nRepublicans are claiming. They are claiming that they now have a \nbalanced budget. I never claimed that the 1993 proposal balanced the \nbudget.\n  I have felt since 1983 that those who use, in whatever circumstances, \nunder whatever conditions, the Social Security trust funds, are \nmisusing the trust funds, and it does not matter whether it is the \nPresident's budget, President Clinton or President Bush or the \nCongressional Budget Office. When trust funds are included in the \noperating revenues--Social Security trust funds especially--it is not \nbeing honest.\n  Now, the point we made earlier was on October 18 the majority party \ncame over to the floor and held up this letter from the Congressional \nBudget Office. The letter says, we estimated, based on your submission \nto the CBO, that your plan will produce a small budget surplus in the \nyear 2002. And I came to the floor and said that obviously is not true.\n  I wrote to the CBO and said, ``Give us your estimate of the \nRepublican plan if you do not take the Social Security trust funds and \nuse them as operating revenues.'' And the next day the director sent us \nanother letter and said, ``Well, we estimate, if that is the case, that \nthe deficit in the year 2002 will be $98 billion.'' So it went from a \nsmall surplus to a $98 billion deficit.\n  On the third day, October 20, they sent us another letter and said \nthe deficit is not $98 billion: ``We recalculated, and the deficit \nwould be really $105 billion.'' And so that is what we have learned \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. And our point was to say, if you \ntake the Social Security trust funds and use them over on the operating \nbudget, it is dishonest budgeting, and dishonest budgeting for \nDemocrats to do it and dishonest budgeting for Republicans to do it.\n  This is business as usual. It has been going on way too long. I \nintroduced a half dozen proposals to stop it. The Senator from South \nCarolina has. In 1983, I began to try to stop this process. But when \nthe Senator came today with his big chart, and he had a gold medallion \non the chart or a gold certificate of some type, certified with a big \ngold thing, certified balanced budget, that is baloney. There is no \ncertification of a balanced budget. October 20 says that this is a \nbudget with a $105 billion deficit in the year 2002.\n  Why is that important? It is important because if you do not have a \nbalanced budget, you cannot trigger the tax cuts presumably.\n  What is that gold certificate about that they paraded on the floor? \nThat is their certificate so they can go ahead and proceed to make the \ntax cuts. But it is a fraudulent certificate. It does not have any seal \non it, so I assume it was just printed up for their purposes.\n  I mean, that is just gamesmanship. It is not a certificate of \nanything. The only thing that matters is the October 20 letter that \nsaid, ``CBO says in the year 2002 there will be a $105 billion \ndeficit.'' That is the official number. The only way you can say that \nis not true is if you believe you should take the money out of the \nSocial Security trust fund and use it as an operating budget revenue.\n  I would guarantee you, you run a business and do that, you take your \nemployees' trust fund, pension funds and pull them over to your P \nstatement and say, ``This is my business income,'' you will be on a \nfast track to a penitentiary of someplace. You cannot do it in \nbusiness; you ought not be able to do it in Government. It is not \nhonest budgeting.\n  So when the folks came to the floor today--it is amusing to have this \ndebate, I suppose, about past budgets, but no one claimed what the \nRepublicans are claiming, that they have this balanced budget. This is \nnot in balance. The Congressional Budget Office says it is not in \nbalance. They ought to stop pretending it is in balance. If it is not \nin balance, they cannot trigger a tax cut, 50 percent of which, \nincidentally, \n\n[[Page S 15486]]\ngoes to taxpayers with incomes or families whose incomes are over \n$100,000 a year.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from North Dakota. We are fast approaching the \nculmination of this session--the culmination of a year of significant \ndebate on the course of the Federal budget.\n  This amendment goes to the heart of that debate--how should we bring \nthe budget into balance, and how should the burdens of that process be \nshared among the people of this country?\n  As one who voted for a balanced budget amendment, and as a cosponsor \nof a balanced budget plan, I share the conviction that deficit \nreduction should be among the top priorities of this Congress. But we \nshould not let the urgency of that task blind us to our fundamental \nprinciples, or to the other, equally important responsibilities we \nface.\n  As I have explained here before, Mr. President, balancing the budget \nis essential, not as an end in itself, but a means of restoring \nhealthier growth to our economy, and as a means of promoting the basic \nprinciples that first led me to the Senate.\n  I won't revisit here the clear and convincing reasons for fundamental \nchange in our Federal budget. But while I am encouraged by the powerful \nconsensus behind balancing the budget, Mr. President, I am concerned \nabout the shortsighted priorities and the lack of fundamental fairness \nthat characterize the budget plan that is now taking shape in this \nCongress. We will debate that budget plan on the floor of the Senate \nthis week.\n  The amendment of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota \nrepresents what should be simply common sense. But unfortunately, Mr. \nPresident, common sense seems to be in short supply these days.\n  The amendment says simply that we should limit any tax cuts to \nfamilies with incomes under $250,000, and use the savings to reduce the \ncuts that are planned for Medicare.\n  I believe that there is a real need for tax relief--in a perfect \nworld, perhaps we could spread tax cuts around a little more. But there \ncan be no argument that families with middle incomes have seen their \npaychecks stuck for years--with no reward from the substantial gains in \nproductivity that our national economy has made.\n  Those working families spend more of their waking hours running \nfaster just to stay in place. Mothers and fathers strain for a few \nminutes with their kids, with each other--never mind a moment for \nthemselves. Because their wages haven't gone up, they have to spend \nmore hours working every day just to keep up with growing expenses.\n  Chief among the costs that are growing faster than the average \nfamily's income are health care and education. For most middle \nAmericans, Mr. President, those are not luxuries to be deferred or cut \nback--they are costs that must be met by cuts in family time, in \nsavings, in things that we used to consider essential and that \nincreasingly are beyond reach.\n  So we should do what we can to cut the costs of health care and \neducation for Americans. Incredibly, the budget that is shaping up now \ndoes exactly the opposite. In their search for the funds to give tax \ncuts to people with incomes over $250,000, the Republican majority is \nincreasing the costs of health care and education for the average \nAmerican family.\n\n  And, by itself, the tax bill just reported by the Finance Committee \nwould actually increase the tax burden on the majority of Americans, \nMr. President, those with incomes of $30,000 or less. Can't we at least \nput a cap on the unfairness in that plan?\n  And, as the Republicans' own Congressional Budget Office has \ncertified, Mr. President, their plan does not balance the budget. It \ncontinues to borrow from the Social Security surplus in the year 2002 \nto cover up a glaring $98 billion deficit.\n  This is unconscionable, Mr. President, and it is unnecessary. We can \nreach the goal of a balanced budget, provide tax relief for the middle \nclass, and restore some of the excessive cuts in Medicare that are part \nof the Republican budget plan.\n  With Senator Bradley, I cosponsored earlier this year a budget plan \nthat would have permitted up to $100 billion in tax relief for the \nmiddle class, including help with higher education expenses. That plan \nwould have balanced the budget by 2002, without borrowing against the \nfuture obligations of the Social Security system. I also supported \nSenator Conrad's plan, that would have balanced the budget without \nraiding the Social Security system.\n  We apparently cannot pass a budget this year that will not continue \nthe charade of using Social Security surpluses--needed to meet its \nfuture legal and moral obligations--to cover up annual deficits in our \noperating budget.\n  But, by supporting the amendment now before us, we can still restore \nsome fairness to tax relief, and we can reduce some of the damage that \nwill be caused by the exorbitant increases in Medicare costs in the \nRepublican plan.\n  This amendment simply expresses the sense of the Senate--a statement \nof our priorities--that we should limit any tax cuts to those who \nreally need it, and that we should use those savings to reduce the hit \non Medicare that the Republicans have planned--a hit that will be used \nto pay for tax cuts for those who don't really need it.\n  I think those are the real priorities of almost all Americans--even \nthose who may not directly benefit from the tax cuts. Most Americans \nshare the goals of deficit reduction--because it will help all \nAmericans. Deficit reduction will free up more of our scarce saving for \nprivate investments by homeowners, entrepreneurs, and corporations--\ninvestments that will create jobs and sustain a growing economy.\n  For those who are now well off, who will share in the benefits of a \ngrowing economy at least as much as anyone else, a tax brake now to \nsustain those whose incomes have been stuck for years is scarcely \ngrounds for resentment.\n  This amendment recognizes that we must use common sense and fairness \nas we search for ways to reduce the deficit and restore balance to our \ncountry's finances.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, that \nwill put the Senate on record sharing the priorities of most \nAmericans--doing what is right and what is fair while we do what is \nnecessary.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I notice, Mr. President, Senator Pell is waiting to \nspeak.\n  I will, because of that, relinquish the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15463-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15486-S15487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MEDICARE BY THE NUMBERS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the national debate over the future of the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs is not so much about objectives as it is \nabout means. But it is the means that make all the difference.\n  There clearly is widespread agreement that steps must be taken to \nrestrain growth in Government spending for medical programs. But there \nis considerable disagreement about how to achieve this objective, how \nto distribute the impact of change, and about the timeframe in which \nall of this is to occur. In that connection, I join in expressing my \ndistress about the course the congressional majority would have us \ntake.\n  I should say at the outset that I believe it is unfortunate that we \nare allowing arbitrary dollar limits to drive our consideration of \nessential social policy. We are seeking to evaluate fundamental human \nneeds through the green eye shades of accountants.\n  As I have stated on previous occasions, while I do share the view \nthat Government spending should be curtailed where appropriate and that \nthe deficit should be substantially reduced, I do not believe that this \nautomatically translates into a cast-iron doctrine that the national \nbudget must be in absolute balance by a time certain.\n  In the case of the medical programs, it would have been far \npreferable, in my view, to have devised first a rational strategy for \ncurtailing unreasonable growth in spending for these programs--while \npreserving their essential services--and then see how much savings \ncould be dedicated to deficit reduction.\n  But since the majority has committed us to a dollar-driven course of \naction, let's consider the figures.\n\n[[Page S 15487]]\n\n  In their quest to reach budget balance by the year 2002, the majority \nseeks to reduce Government spending by an arbitrary $894 billion over \nthe 7-year period.\n  Over half of the saving--and by far the largest single component--\nwould be $452 billion in reduced spending for the Federal medical \nprograms: $270 billion would be realized from reduced spending on \nMedicare, and $182 billion from Medicaid.\n  While protracted cutbacks may be needed to assure solvency over the \nlong term, there simply does not seem to be justification for \nreductions of the proposed order of magnitude in the timeframe of the \nnext 7 years.\n  I found particularly persuasive in this regard the recent testimony \nof the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin. Speaking in his \ncapacity as managing trustee of the Medicare hospital insurance trust \nfund, Mr. Rubin stated:\n\n       Simply said, no member of the Senate should vote for $270 \n     billion in Medicare cuts believing that reductions of this \n     size have been recommended by the Medicare Trustees or that \n     such reductions are needed now to prevent an imminent \n     funding crisis . . . Nonetheless, the Majority is asking \n     for $270 billion in Medicare cuts, almost three times what \n     is needed to guarantee the life of the Hospital Insurance \n     Trust fund for the next ten years.\n\n  The Secretary went on to observe that the $270 billion in reduced \nGovernment spending would be accomplished in part by increasing costs \nto beneficiaries of the Medicare part B program, even though such \nincreases do not contribute to the solvency of the Part A Hospital \nTrust Fund.\n  ``In this context,'' Secretary Rubin stated, ``it is clear that more \nthan $100 billion in Medicare funding reductions are being used to pay \nfor other purposes--not to shore up the Hospital Insurance Trust \nFund.''\n  Secretary Rubin's testimony is disturbing because it validates the \npresumption that the proposed reductions in Medicare are being made for \nreasons not dictated by necessity, including the possibility that the \namount of proposed reductions might have been inflated for the specific \npurpose of accommodating a tax cut.\n  In that light we can only ask what manner of needless sacrifice, \nworth more than $100 billion, are we asking of our senior citizens. \nWill most of it be accounted for by the $71 billion in increased \npayments by beneficiaries? Or will it be attributed to the $73.6 \nbillion in reduced payments to hospitals, or the $22.6 billion \nreduction in the allowable fee schedule for physicians treating \nMedicare patients?\n  It seems apparent to me that the majority has overreached and that a \nfar more modest cutback of the Medicare Program would serve our \npurpose. Since Secretary Rubin says that more than $100 billion is \nbeing siphoned off for other purposes, this would suggest that the $270 \nbillion reduction proposed should be in the order of $150 billion at \nthe most. And the reduction could be even less if we take appropriate \nsteps to deal with the annual loss of $18 billion through waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  With respect to Medicaid, I am very distressed that the majority \nproposal would dismantle a 30-year-old commitment to the poor and \ndisabled, and transfer a less binding responsibility to the States.\n  The result, it seems to me, can only be the creating of pockets of \nmedical impoverishment between a few overburdened oases of generosity. \nSome States and regions simply will not be able to maintain the level \nof compassionate service on which their citizens have come to depend.\n  My own State of Rhode Island is in this latter category, partly \nbecause it has a larger proportion of elderly people using nursing home \nfacilities. I would point out that our Republican Governor, Lincoln \nAlmond, has voiced his opposition to the block-grant formula as it was \nproposed in the House.\n  Here, I would like to salute the efforts in the Finance Committee of \nmy distinguished colleague, Senator Chafee, to modify the plan, \nparticularly through restoring entitlement status to pregnant women, \nchildren under age 12, and the disabled. But notwithstanding these \nefforts, the basic proposal is still fatally flawed in my view.\n  As one of the original advocates of the Federal medical programs, I \nregret exceedingly that we have come to this juncture when in the name \nof economy, the gains of decades of progress in social responsibility \nare being jettisoned or badly compromised. The proposals should not \nbecome law, and I applaud and support the President's announced \ndetermination to veto them if they reach his desk in their present \nform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15486-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15487-S15488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        JERUSALEM EMBASSY RELOCATION IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, on the question of the American Embassy in \nJerusalem, I suggest that most of us here believe the same thing, that \nJerusalem is the capital of Israel and that our Embassy belongs there \none day. Where some of us disagree, however, is whether or not the \nPresident has the right to decide when. I do not think the Congress has \nthe right or the obligation or the responsibility to micromanage the \ndecision. We all agree it should move. How it should move and when it \nshould move, that I really think should be left to our President.\n  All Americans are aware, too, of the respect and deeply seated, \nemotional attachment that Israelis--indeed all Jews--have for \nJerusalem. I would add the same emotions and attachments apply to \nMoslems and Christians, and I think all of us appreciate the care and \neffort that Israel has made to make Jerusalem accessible to adherents \nof all faiths. For these reasons, I find it difficult to fathom a final \nsettlement for the Middle East that does not declare, once and for all, \nthat Jerusalem is, and shall forever remain, Israel's undivided \ncapital.\n  The administration has suggested that by adopting this legislation, \nCongress would be prejudging the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian \ntalks, and in doing this, we might undermine our own traditional place \nas the honest broker and cast the peace process into disarray.\n  Mr. President, I believe we must take due acknowledgement of the \nadministration's strong and forceful views about this bill. When \nofficials from the administration suggest, as they have in recent days, \nthat adopting this legislation could interrupt--or indeed kill--the \npeace process, I think we must take those suggestions seriously. When \nthe same officials predict that adopting this legislation could lead to \nan explosion of passions in the West Bank and Gaza, we cannot take \nthose predictions lightly. When these officials say that passing the \nbill could mean that people, whether they are Israelis, Palestinians, \nJordanians, or U.S. diplomats, could lose their lives, we have a solemn \nobligation to be absolutely sure of what we do.\n  I am not convinced that the arguments, both pro and con, have been \ngiven a chance to be aired properly. The Senate is on the verge of \nmaking an extraordinary decision without even having had the benefit of \none hearing on the Senate side, at least, devoted to the issue.\n  Against all these concerns, most of which I share, we must balance \nsome fundamental truths. First among these is the fact that Israel is \nthe only country in the world where the United States does not have its \nEmbassy in the functioning capital. With the Israeli Government based \nin Jerusalem, having our Embassy in Tel Aviv has made it difficult to \nmaintain our official contacts with the Israeli Government. Frankly, it \nhas also stigmatized, indeed cheapened, our relationship with Israel. \nMoving our Embassy will at least settle once and for all what many of \nus know to be true--that Jerusalem is truly the capital of Israel.\n  Second, by requiring the President to move our Embassy, the United \nStates will once and for all dispel whatever unrealistic hopes remain \nthat Jerusalem will somehow become the capital of a Palestinian State.\n  Finally, no one, including the Palestinians, can really contest \nIsraeli sovereignty over West Jerusalem. If this bill passes and is \nimplemented, our Embassy would clearly be moved there, not to East \nJerusalem.\n  I acknowledge, Mr. President, that I opposed this bill when it was \nintroduced in an earlier form. Since then, it has been reintroduced \nwith a significant change in text which has given a more flexible \napproach than existed \n\n[[Page S 15488]]\nearlier. I still believe more is needed, and for that reason, I tend to \nsupport amending it to address some of President Clintons additional \nconcerns. If we moderate this bill sufficiently, then I am hopeful that \nwe can arrive at a version the President could sign and implement. If \nwe do not, then there is the risk that the President might feel forced \nto veto it.\n  I do believe in my heart, however, that Jerusalem is truly and \nrightfully the capital of Israel. Once that premise is accepted, there \ncan be no other choice but to move our Embassy there, whether it be now \nor in the near future. I therefore hope we can arrive at more flexible, \nconsensus-based language that will enable everyone--the Senate, the \nadministration, the Jewish-American community, the American people at \nlarge--to support this bill.\n  To repeat, the important thing here is that eventually it be moved, \nbut specifying the day, the hour, the minute, or the week or the month \neven is not up to Congress, it is up to the Executive to make that \ndecision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nresolution before us to provide for the relocation of the United States \nEmbassy in Israel to Jerusalem where it rightfully belongs and has \nbelonged. This is something that I feel very strongly about and of \nwhich I am proud to be an original cosponsor when it was introduced by \nthe distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole.\n  As Congress and the executive branch grapple with the various issues \nof national policy, oftentimes we tend to overlook what is most \ncompelling and what is most fundamental in terms of right and wrong. \nDespite the best of intentions, the best of motives, by all parties on \nboth sides, occasionally we seem to lose sight of the forest for the \ntrees. When this happens, we owe it to ourselves, as a legislative \nbody, but also to our constituents and, frankly, to the very issue of \nmorality itself, to make amends, to do the right thing, to remedy a \nwrong. Today, with this legislation, we have that historic opportunity; \nthat is, recognizing, by putting our Embassy there, that Jerusalem is \nthe rightful capital of the State of Israel.\n  Mr. President, Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the State of \nIsrael. It has been and, in my opinion, forever will be a shining \nsymbol of faith, of inspiration and tradition, not only to the Jewish \npeople but Christians and Moslems as well. No other place on Earth \nholds such a unique and rich history as this holiest of holy cities, \nand no other place in all the world can reasonably be considered the \ncapital of Israel.\n  I think, in the legislation before us, we see in our findings a \nsampling of many of the reasons, which are really quite obvious. But to \nrecite a few of them, and I know they have been stated before, I do not \nthink it hurts to reinforce the importance of these findings:\n  No. 1, that each sovereign nation under international law and custom \nhas the right to designate its own capital. Israel has done that. Since \n1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital of the State of \nIsrael. The city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's President, \nParliament, supreme court, and the site of numerous Government \nministries and social and cultural institutions.\n  Jerusalem is the spiritual center of Judaism. It is also considered a \nholy city by the members of other religious faiths as well.\n  Historically, from 1948 through 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city, \nand Israeli citizens of all faiths, as well as Jewish citizens of all \nstates, were denied access to holy sites in the area controlled by \nJordan. But in 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the \nconflict known as the Six Day War.\n  Since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city administered by Israel, \nand persons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full access to \nholy sites within that city by Israel.\n  In March 1995, 93 Members of the U.S. Senate signed a letter to \nSecretary of State Warren Christopher encouraging planning to begin now \nfor relocation of the U.S. Embassy in the city of Jerusalem. Well, now \nis the time, Mr. President, to make that happen. The United States \nmaintains its Embassy in the functioning capital of every country, \nexcept in the case of this, one of our most loyal allies and strategic \nallies, the State of Israel.\n  In 1996, the State of Israel will celebrate the 3,000th anniversary \nof the Jewish presence in Jerusalem since King David's entry. I think \nthe facts, Mr. President, in this bill speak for themselves, and I \ncertainly commend its authors--especially Senator Dole--for pointing \nout those facts. But it is troubling that the U.S. policy with respect \nto the status of Jerusalem has been less then clear.\n  Reasonable people can disagree on the best means to achieve peace in \nthe Middle East, but that is another issue. That is not the same issue, \nMr. President. On the question of Jerusalem, there is only one \ninescapable conclusion: It is now, has been in the past, and forever \nwill be and should be the capital of Israel. That is the plain and \nsimply truth.\n  The United States maintains diplomatic relations with over 180 \nnations and, of these, as indicated in the findings of the bill, Israel \nis the only nation in which our Embassy is not located in the \nfunctioning capital. We say Tel Aviv, but we do not have the right to \nsay Tel Aviv. Israel has the right to choose its capital; it has done \nso, and we should honor that. How do we justify anything else? How do \nwe explain this to our friends in Israel, who have endured such \nhardship and remained true to the principles of democracy throughout \nthe years? The answer is that there is no justification for not doing \nit. This is a terrible oversight, and it should be corrected.\n  The legislation offered by the majority leader does correct this \nwrong. It initiates the long overdue process of moving the U.S. Embassy \nto Jerusalem but more importantly, Mr. President, moving it to \nJerusalem by a date certain--May 31, 1999.\n  I understand that the administration, unfortunately, opposes this \nlegislation. I do not think their arguments have much merit--they do \nnot have any merit, and they lose sight of the real issue. This is not \nabout executive-legislative turf battles, Mr. President. It is about \nwhat is right and wrong. It is about the right of a sovereign nation to \nchoose its capital and to have the United States and other countries of \nthe world honor that by putting their embassies in that capital. It is \nabout precedent, it is about history, it is about culture and \nrecognition, and it is about changing a misguided policy. I say to my \nfriends in the administration, correcting such an injustice and doing \nwhat is right is more important than perpetrating some inside-the-\nbeltway turf war between the Congress and the executive branch. This is \nmuch bigger than that; it is much more important than that.\n  Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. The U.S. Embassy belongs in \nJerusalem. I urge the adoption of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to proceed in morning business for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15487-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15488-S15490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I heard earlier a discussion on this floor \nfrom a number of Members on the other side, specifically the Member \nfrom California and the Member from North Dakota about the effects of \nthe coming debate or the implications of the coming debate on the \nmatter of balancing the budget relative to tax policy.\n  First, I think it should be noted once again for the record that for \nthe first time in 25 years this Congress, this Senate, is going to get \nthe opportunity to take up the issue of balancing the budget. For the \nfirst time in 25 years there will be on the floor of this Senate a \nreconciliation resolution which, if passed by this Congress and agreed \nto \n\n[[Page S 15489]]\nby this President, will lead to a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  That fact is certified by the Congressional Budget Office, the fair \narbiter, as we have all agreed around here, including the President \nduring his first speech to Congress, of the number-scoring process.\n  We have a major opportunity, probably the most significant \nopportunity--clearly the most significant opportunity in the last 25 \nyears to bring under control the spending of this country.\n  The purpose of doing this is really rather simple, as has been \ndiscussed before. It is to give our children a chance to have a \nprosperous lifestyle, to pass on to the next generation the opportunity \nto live in a Nation which is fiscally solvent.\n  If we do not take this action, I think the matter has been well \ndebated, and generally agreed to, that the next generation will have \nvery little opportunity for prosperity, that they will be given a \ncountry which is insolvent, that they will be faced with a Nation where \nwe will probably have to grossly inflate our money supply, creating \neconomic havoc as children move into their earning years, as our \nchildren move into their earning years, in the period of their twenties \nand on.\n  So we as a Congress stepped up to this matter. At least as a party we \nhave stepped up to the matter. We have produced a budget which is in \nbalance. As a result of producing that budget in balance, certain very \ngood things happen.\n  First, of course is the point that our children will have a shot at \nan economically solvent future. A more immediate event occurs, which \nwill assist almost all Americans, or at least all Americans who borrow \nmoney--which is I suspect almost all Americans.\n  That is, that under a generally accepted view of economists and once \nagain the Congressional Budget Office, the interest rates in the \neconomy generally will drop as a result of passing a balanced budget \nand having it be in law by approximately 2 percent.\n  What does that mean? It means if you are borrowing to buy a new home, \nthat the interest rates you will have to pay on that new loan will be 2 \npercent less. That translates into literally thousands of dollars for \nmiddle-income Americans seeking home ownership.\n  It will mean if you are going to school as a student that your \ninterest rates will probably be at 2 percent less than what they are \ntoday, meaning you will be able to go to school longer or get out of \nschool with less debt--either one being a very positive aspect of this.\n  It means if you buy a car or household goods or you improve on your \nhome or you are simply borrowing money because it is necessary due to \nsome circumstances of your lifestyle, that the cost of borrowing that \nmoney will drop rather significantly.\n  It also means good news for the Federal Government. It means that our \nrate of interest will drop by 2 percent.\n  As a result, CBO has said that we will receive over the next 7 years, \nbecause we have put in place this balanced budget, a windfall, if you \nwish to describe it that way, or dividend if you wish to describe it \nthat way, or approximately $170 billion in savings on the cost of \npaying for the Federal debt, the interest.\n  We have taken that $170 billion and we have passed it back to the \ntaxpayers of this country. We have said--the Republicans in this \nSenate--that if we are going to balance the budget and we are going to \nreduce the size of growth of the Federal Government, we ought to return \nto the people who support this Government and who are the underpinnings \nof our Nation, the taxpayers specifically, that they ought to be able \nto participate in the benefits of this event of balancing the budget.\n  So we have decided to use this economic dividend, this drop in \ninterest rates which generates $170 billion, and return it, return it \ndirectly to the taxpayers.\n  Now we have heard a lot from the other side about the fact we should \nnot have any tax cut, that there should not be any tax cut at all, that \nthere should be no return to the taxpayers of this country of putting \nin place a balanced budget.\n  Of course, they do not want a balanced budget, so you can probably \nunderstand the fact they do not want to return the money to the \ntaxpayers, but it seems to me a little crass and unfeeling and unkind \nto say to the taxpayers of this country who have been supporting the \nlargess of this liberal Government for the last 40 years when it \nfinally gets its act together those taxpayers will not receive any of \nthe benefit.\n  We are not going to take that on this side of the aisle. We are going \nto suggest that that money flow back to the taxpayer.\n  We also heard first they do not want a balanced budget, or a real \nbalanced budget, put it that way. They want something like the \nPresident sent up here that CBO scores as being out of balance for as \nfar as the eye can see--for at least $200 billion a year, adding $1 \ntrillion of new debt to our children's backs over the next 7 years.\n  They do not want a real budget. They want some sort of gamesmanship \nbudget. They will not support our balanced budget which has been scored \nas a real balanced budget. They do not want a tax cut.\n  Furthermore, not only are they opposed to a balanced budget and \nopposed to a tax cut, they come to the floor and misrepresent the tax \ncut that is before the Senate. I heard a number of Members on the other \nside, or at least two, state that that tax cut is just going to the \nwealthy, that this economic dividend which we are going to use to send \nback to the taxpayers of this country which is their right and due \nreward for having a balanced budget, is just going to go to the \nwealthy.\n  Somebody ought to refer them to real figures. Maybe CBO figures, for \nexample, rather than OMB figures. Under those figures, we will talk \nabout where the benefit of that tax cut goes.\n  Mr. President, 84 percent--84 percent of the benefit of that tax cut \nflows to people with incomes under $100,000; 77 percent of the benefit \nof that tax cut goes to people with incomes under $75,000. Maybe we \nhave a new definition of ``wealthy'' coming from the Members of the \nother side of the aisle. If you make up to $75,000 in this country you \nare suddenly wealthy. I do not think so.\n  If 77 percent of the economic benefit of the tax cut goes to people \nwith incomes under $75,000, I say a vast majority of the tax cut, at \nleast three-fourths of the tax cut goes to people with moderate and \nlower incomes.\n  This is only logical, because if you look at what the terms of the \ntax cut are, they are clearly targeted progressively on assisting \nespecially moderate income families. First, of course, is the $500 tax \ncredit for children.\n  This does not in any way put the average family into the type of \nposition that they were in, say, back in the 1940's and 1950's, when \nyou could have a single earner in a household and maintain a family, \nand about 3 percent of your income went to the Federal Government. \nToday, unfortunately, 24 percent of your income goes to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  But, in order to try to alleviate in some minor way--and actually it \nshould be fairly significant for many people--the cost of raising a \nfamily in this country, and especially the tax cost of being a \nmoderate-income family, we have said we are going to put in place a \n$500 tax credit. That is a fairly reasonable proposal.\n  So, if you have children--one, two, three, four--you can multiply the \nnumber of children you have by $500 and that is how much you are going \nto get back as a tax credit. This tax credit, by the way, phases out as \nyour income goes up. For very high-income people there is no tax \ncredit. So it must be fairly logical, since this is the largest part of \nthe tax cut, it clearly flows to people with moderate incomes, under \n$75,000, who have families. So when you say the tax cut is going to the \nwealthy, when I hear that statement from the other side of the aisle, \nit is either, first, disingenuous; second, uninformed; or, third, \npotentially misleading.\n  Then look at some of the other proposals we have. We have a spousal \nIRA. Again, it phases out as your income goes up, so high-income people \ndo not have the benefit. So, clearly, low- and moderate-income \nindividuals will have that benefit.\n  We have elimination of the marriage tax penalty, again for middle- \nand low-income individuals who find themselves, because they got \nmarried, actually paying more taxes than if they had remained single \nand been filing the \n\n[[Page S 15490]]\nsame type of returns. That is an unfair and unique quirk of our tax \nlaws which has existed too long and needs to be changed.\n  So, we have put in place in this tax package the tax benefits which \nare targeted directly on, essentially, the middle- and moderate- and to \nsome extent low-income families, to the extent they pay taxes, in this \ncountry. So it is a blatant misrepresentation to come to this floor and \nsay this tax cut goes to the wealthy. It is equally unfair and \ninappropriate to come to this floor and suggest there should be no tax \ncut at all if we actually have a balanced budget, when you are not even \nwilling to vote for the balanced budget. There seems to be something \ninappropriate in taking that position.\n  So, as we go forward on this debate, I hope he will look at the hard \nnumbers, at the real substantive action rather than the political \nhyperbole. I hope we will step back from this attitude, which the White \nHouse seems to be taking, which is to pick a constituency a day to \nscare through misrepresentation, and, rather, inform people as to what \nis actually happening. Because, if people look at the facts of this \nsituation, they will come to two very clear conclusions. First, if we \ndo not do something fairly soon, this country is going to find itself \nunable to remain financially solvent; and, second, if we follow the \nprogram put forward by the Republicans in the Senate and in the House, \nwhich leads to a real balanced budget, we will be able to pass on to \nour children a country which is financially solvent and one where they \nhave an opportunity for prosperity. We will be a generation which \npasses on to the next generation opportunities that exceed even those \nthat were given to us by our parents.\n  If we fail to take this action, we will, of course, be the opposite, \nthe first generation in the history of this country which will pass \nless on to our children than was given to us by our elders. That is not \nacceptable, it is not right, and it is not fair. That is why I strongly \nsupport the reconciliation bill that will be coming forward toward the \nend of this week.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair and yield such \ntime as I may have.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  A reminder to the Senator from South Carolina that, under unanimous \nconsent, 20 minutes of debate will begin at 20 minutes before 6, \nequally divided between both sides, dealing with the Dorgan amendment \nto S. 1322.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very good. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15488-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15490-S15491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what I want to do, right quickly is, \nfirst to put in the Record the letter of October 20 from June E. \nO'Neill. I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office printed in the Record at this particular \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC. October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Pursuant to Section 205(a) of the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), the \n     Congressional Budget Office provided the Chairman of the \n     Senate Budget Committee on October 18 with a projection of \n     the budget deficits or surpluses that would result from \n     enactment of the reconciliation legislation submitted to the \n     Budget Committee. As specified in section 205(a), CBO \n     provided projections (using the economic and technical \n     assumptions underlying the budget resolution and assuming the \n     level of discretionary spending specified in that resolution) \n     of the deficit or surplus of the total budget-that is, the \n     deficit or surplus resulting from all budgetary transactions \n     of the federal government, including Social Security and \n     Postal Service spending and receipts that are designated as \n     off-budget transactions. As stated in the letter to Chairman \n     Domenici, CBO projected that there will be a total-budget \n     surplus of $10 billion in 2002. Excluding an estimated off-\n     budget surplus of $115 billion in 2002 from the calculation, \n     CBO would project an on-budget deficit of $105 billion in \n     2002.

Mr. President, as they demonstrate, you can add up the \nCBO outlays--the spending of the years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, \n2001, 2002--and find that over that 7-year period, we will spend a \ntotal of $12.06 trillion. Over that same period, CBO estimates that \nrevenues will total $11,008 trillion. So you can see that spending will \nactually increase over revenues during the 7-year period by $1.052 \ntrillion.\n  Even that figure is low is it requires what the former Senator, John \nHeinz, called ``embezzlement''; namely, using the Social Security trust \nfund to mask the true size of the deficit.\n  I just heard in the Budget Committee the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Domenici, call it a phony argument. But he voted for it and all \nthe Members who were present in 1990 voted to stop using Social \nSecurity surpluses to mask the size of the deficit. Senator Heinz and I \nput it into the law, section 13301 of the Congressional Budget Act. \nThere is nothing phony about it, but I hear the Senator from Washington \ncoming in and quoting Charles Krauthammer as saying the argument was \nfraudulent. I know that Mr. Krauthammer was a psychiatrist before he \nstarted spilling ink in the editorial page. It reminds me of the old \nsaw that a psychiatrist is the fellow who goes to the burlesque show to \nlook at the audience.\n\n  Let us not use economic figures from psychiatrists, let's use the \n$105 billion deficit cited by CBO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15490-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15491-S15492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        JERUSALEM EMBASSY RELOCATION IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2940\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind the Senator that 20 minutes of debate \nhas begun on the Dorgan amendment, but none of the managers is here.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota is here.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Under the previous unanimous-consent order, the Senator has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield myself 5 minutes of the 10 minutes and then \nreserve the time.\n  Mr. President, this issue will be relatively simple. The vote we are \ngoing to have in 20 minutes is a very simple proposition. It is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that says let us limit the tax cut to \nthose whose incomes are under a quarter of a million dollars a year and \nuse the savings from that limitation to reduce the cut in Medicare. It \nis very simple. This follows an amendment I had previously that was \nvoted on by the Senate--it failed--saying let us limit the tax cut to \nthose whose incomes are $100,000 a year or less. That failed.\n  So I indicated that I intended to offer another resolution which I \nnow offer that says I do not personally think we ought to talk about \ntax cuts at the moment. I think we ought to deal with the budget issue, \nand the Congressional Budget Office has told us there is not a balanced \nbudget in this proposal. The deficit in the year 2002 will be $105 \nbillion. But the majority side says they have reached a balanced \nbudget. So they want now to proceed to a tax cut.\n  While I wish they would not do that, my amendment is painfully \nsimple. It says let us at least agree to limit the tax cut to those \nwhose incomes are $250,000 a year or less. If we do that, we will save \nsome money and be able to cut Medicare less than is now proposed.\n  What does this amount to? I do not have exact figures. But, from \ntalking to the Treasury Department and others, my reckoning is that we \nare talking about 20 percent of the tax cut going to slightly more than \n1 percent of the earners in this country, or about $50 billion over the \n7 years. This sense-of-the-Senate would, say, let us save $50 billion \nthat will otherwise, during the 7 years, go to those whose incomes are \nover a quarter of a million dollars a year and use that $50 billion to \nsoften the blow on Medicare recipients. It is interesting. That $50 \nbillion over the 5 years is almost exactly the same amount as the $50 \nbillion increase in part B premiums that senior citizens will be asked \nto pay.\n  It is simply about choices. It is not about Republicans, Democrats, \nconservative, or liberal. It is about choices. What is important? Is it \nmore important to provide tax cuts to people whose incomes are a \nquarter of a million dollars or greater? Is it more important to do \nthat than to try to soften the blow on low-income senior citizens who \nwill, I think, get hit fairly hard on the question of these Medicare \ncuts?\n  So that is the purpose of this amendment. As the Members of the \nSenate know, the Treasury Department has indicated that the \nreconciliation bill that will come to the floor will provide nearly \none-half of its tax benefits to those with incomes of $100,000 a year \nor more, and it will at the same time increase taxes on about half the \nfamilies in our country. Which half? The lower half, of course. That is \nthe subject of this amendment. It is about priorities.\n  I hope that others in the Chamber, having reflected on this and \nhaving turned down the proposition to limit the tax cut to those under \n$100,000 a year, will now at least agree that those who make over a \nquarter of a million dollars a year really do not need at this point a \ntax cut. So that is the purpose of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has about 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill will come to the \nfloor of the Senate tomorrow perhaps, or at the latest Wednesday. We \nwill begin debate on the reconciliation bill under a procedure that is \nvery restricting and very constrained, as you know.\n  It will, by necessity, limit the debate on the amendments, and, \nfrankly, we will have an insignificant opportunity to effect what is \nhappening in the committees that is brought to the floor under the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Tragically, this reconciliation bill really does almost everything. \nIt is going to have a farm bill in it. For the first time in history, \nthey stick a farm bill in the reconciliation bill. I mean, it has the \nkitchen sink in it--profound, massive changes in Medicaid and Medicare \nand eliminates national standards for nursing homes. You name it. But \n\n[[Page S 15492]]\n\nespecially it deals with choices, and that is the purpose of my sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. The choice that says what we would like to do \nat this point is balance the budget and provide a tax cut.\n  I have no objection to a tax cut provided that we have done the heavy \nlifting to balance the budget first. But the Congressional Budget \nOffice says that with the reconciliation bill there exists a $105 \nbillion deficit in the year 2002, and still the majority party wishes \nto proceed with a tax cut, half of which will benefit those families \nwith incomes over $100,000 a year, $50 billion of which over the 7 \nyears will benefit those families with incomes over a quarter of a \nmillion dollars a year.\n  My point is very simple. With the number of people out there in this \ncountry living on very modest incomes, especially senior citizens, the \nbulk of whom live on less than $15,000 a year, we are saying to them, \n``Tighten your belt, buckle up, you are in for some tough times, \nbecause we are going to change the programs that you count on because \nwe cannot afford to do otherwise.''\n  And then we say to the wealthiest families in America, those who earn \nover a quarter of a million a year and more, guess what. We are going \nto stop at your house with an envelope, and guess what is in the \nenvelope. A very significant tax cut. So start grinning; it is coming \nyour way. Why? Well, it is about pals and pols. It is about choices. It \nis about the wrong choices. My sense-of-the-Senate resolution is very \nsimple. It says let us at least make a decision to limit this tax cut \nto those families that earn less than $250,000 a year and say to those \nwith a quarter million dollars a year or more income, we think you are \ndoing great; you do not need a tax cut, and use the savings, $50 \nbillion in 7 years, to offset some of the cut that is going to be \nimpacting and hurting senior citizens in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be deducted from both sides equally.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 4 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Again, we are under a unanimous-consent order \nbetween 5:40 and 6 o'clock. Any unanimous consent would have to use \npart of that time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, 100 years ago, New Mexico was 17 years \nfrom becoming a State and Grover Cleveland was in his second term as \nPresident, the x ray was discovered, and O. Henry, who was a writer of \ngreat importance in this country, was charged with embezzlement. Also, \n100 years ago was the time that Senator Anderson, Clinton Anderson of \nmy home State of New Mexico, was born. Senator Anderson was a man who \nwould mean a great deal to this institution, to this country, and to my \nhome State of New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, 100 years ago today he was born in Centerville, SD. As \na young man, he contracted tuberculosis and moved to New Mexico for \ntreatment of that disease. I should note, Mr. President, that many \nother of my State's distinguished residents did the very same thing. \nThe dry air of New Mexico revived more than one set of eastern lungs, \nand Senator Anderson's were among these. He recovered from his illness. \nHe worked in journalism. He was active in Democratic politics. He was \nelected to the House of Representatives in 1941, served until 1945, \nwhen President Truman asked him to become Secretary of Agriculture. In \n1948, he ran for the Senate and came to this body in the famous class \nof 1948 that included Margaret Chase Smith, Lyndon Johnson, Hubert \nHumphrey, Paul Douglas, Russell Long, Robert Kerr, and Estes Kefauver.\n  He served for 24 years, creating a very distinguished legislative \nrecord, as many of his illustrious classmates did.\n  One of the finest studies of this outstanding Senator was written by \nSenate historian, Richard Baker, entitled ``Conservation Politics/The \nSenate career of Clinton P. Anderson.'' Dr. Baker perfectly described \nSenator Anderson's technique as a legislator. He said in that book, and \nI quote:\n\n       Anderson saved his shots. He was not accustomed to \n     launching trial balloons. When he spoke, his colleagues \n     listened. When he decided that New Mexico could gain no more \n     by prolonged debate, he settled for the best package \n     available. And when he attached to a legislative measure the \n     full weight of his intellect and prestige, doubting solons \n     set aside their skepticism, and he prevailed.\n\n  Mr. President, however many of us have the honor of representing New \nMexico in the Senate, Senator Anderson provides a benchmark against \nwhich we will be measured. I am proud to have known him. My uncle, John \nBingaman, was active in getting him elected and reelected to the Senate \nand felt when he died we lost a great public servant.\n  Today we honor the fact of his birth and the value of his life. For \nus in New Mexico and in the Senate, his are the shoulders we stand on \nas we move into the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the chance to speak, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15492-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15492-S15493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        JERUSALEM EMBASSY RELOCATION IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, here we go again. It is not enough that \nPresident Clinton has admitted that he and his allies have raised taxes \ntoo much, but here his allies in Congress are already seeking to \nundermine real tax relief for middle-class Americans.\n  These folks cannot have it both ways. What Senator Dorgan's amendment \namounts to is little more than business as usual. At home and on the \ncampaign trail, the President and his allies talk about change--real \nchange--but here in Washington they continue a game that has been \nplaying out for three decades, a game that has led our Nation into a \ndebt that is almost $4.9 trillion, a game that has run us into $200 \nbillion deficits, and a game that has done little, if anything, to \nimprove the conditions of the most vulnerable among us.\n  Why do they persist? Because they want it both ways. In some quarters \nthis is called talking out of both sides of the mouth. Even the \nWashington Post has identified this symptom. According to the Post, the \nDemocrats have fabricated the Medicare tax cut connection because it is \nuseful politically. In an earlier editorial, the Post opined that\n\n       The Democrats are engaged in demagoguery, big time. And \n     it's wrong. . . . [The Republicans] have a plan. Enough is \n     known about it to say it is credible; it's gutsy and in some \n     respects inventive--and it addresses a genuine problem that \n     is only going to get worse. What Democrats have, on the other \n     hand, is a lot of expostulation, TV ads and scare talk.\n\n  What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not tell the \nAmerican people is that under the plan we are proposing, using Medicare \nsavings for tax cuts would be illegal. The law requires that money \nsaved on the Medicare Program will stay in the Medicare Program. \nRemember, these are trust funds, the assets of which may not be used \nfor any other purpose. And to say otherwise, as the Post points out, is \nlittle more than politically motivated scare tactics.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment completely undermines the progress \nwe have made toward saving Medicare. Without our plan, the trust fund \nis bankrupt in 2002. It is that simple. Without our plan, the \nGovernment will not be able to live up to its obligations. We assure \nsolvency of the program until the year 2020. This gives us a sufficient \ntime to focus on the needs that will arise when the baby-boom \ngeneration reaches the age of eligibility.\n  It is important to note that Senator Dorgan's plan is not even based \non the \n\n[[Page S 15493]]\nSenate Finance Committee proposal. It is based on the Clinton \nadministration assessment of the House plan. How in the world are we \nsupposed to make an intellectual judgment call when the amendment \nSenator Dorgan asks us to vote on mixes apples and oranges, citing what \nonly can at best be called partisan economic data.\n  Let us restore intellectual honesty to the debate. According to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, 70 percent of the benefits of the Finance \nCommittee tax bill will go to families making under $75,000 a year. \nSeventy percent. Our bill provides a $500 per child tax credit to our \nhard-working families. It eliminates the marriage penalty for many, \ncreates a credit for adoption expenses, and helps with student loan \npayments. We also provide much-needed incentives for savings and \ninvestment. These are all middle-class provisions that go to help the \npeople President Clinton has admitted to raising taxes on. What we are \ndoing is trying to help the President and his allies correct a mistake. \nLet us make it right for the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the pending Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the unanimous-consent agreement \nhas expired.\n  The question now occurs on agreeing to the motion to table the Dorgan \namendment numbered 2940.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, a few hours ago this afternoon the Senate \nBudget Committee reported to the Senate the reconciliation bill for \n1996 through the year 2002. We will soon begin to debate that bill--\nperhaps the most momentous debate that this Senate will engage in this \nyear or perhaps any year during the course of the last decade.\n  The design of that bill is, of course, to see to it that the budget \nof the United States is balanced in the year 2002, precisely the time \nat which the constitutional amendment on a balanced budget would have \nrequired such a balance, had it been passed and submitted to the States \nby this Senate.\n  Hidden in the debate over the budget, however, is one vitally \nimportant proposition. That is, that this budget does not lead us to \nbalance on the basis of figures submitted by my distinguished friend, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, by the majority leader, by a \nparty caucus, or by any other such partisan individual or organization.\n  The certification that this budget will be balanced comes from our \nCongressional Budget Office, an office set up literally decades ago in \norder to provide us with the most objective advice possible with \nrespect to the budgetary implication of our actions.\n  In fact, just 2 short years ago, the President of the United States \nreported that we ought to end debate over assumptions and projections \nand all operate off baselines provided by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. I regret that the President has abandoned that salutary course \nof action.\n  It is not relevant for the purposes of my argument here this evening, \nMr. President. What is relevant is the fact, first, that the \nCongressional Budget Office has said to us, if you pass this bill, if \nyou follow these policies, you will, in fact, reach balance by the year \n2002. As a result, we, the Congressional Budget Office, can tell you \nthat the economy of the United States will be healthier, much \nhealthier, as a result of adopting those policies.\n  The figure the Congressional Budget Office gives in this regard is \nthat we will have a dividend of $170 billion in increased revenues from \nour present tax system as a result of the fact that we are going to \nbalance the budget, increased revenues that come because the economy \nwill grow more rapidly because interest rates will be lower. These will \nbe reflected in the budget itself.\n  Of course, it is this $170 billion dividend, together with changes \nwhich close corporate loopholes--corporate welfare as it were--that \nprovide the great bulk of the $245 billion tax cut for middle-income \nand working Americans, which is an integral part of this reconciliation \nbill.\n  The dramatic differences which will be debated later on this week \nhave to do with whether or not we want that dividend, whether or not we \nwant to adopt difficult and tough policies that will result in a \nstronger or better economy, or whether we prefer the status quo at a \nslower rate of growth, a higher interest rate, and a higher rate of \ninflation. It is just that simple.\n  Now, Mr. President, in addition to repudiating the ideas that were \ncausing this dividend to take place, Members on the other side of the \naisle do not want to give a tax break to middle-income Americans under \nany set of circumstances. They would much prefer to continue the \npolicies of the past--slow growth, no tax reductions, no balanced \nbudget now or ever.\n  The President's budget, by contrast, according to the same \nCongressional Budget Office, will never result in deficits \nsignificantly below $200 billion a year.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we will have, during the course of the debate \nover this reconciliation bill, a paradox. The President, the official \nline is that these spending reductions are too great, that we should \nnot give working Americans tax reductions. We simply ought to continue \nthe status quo.\n  Grace notes from some on the other side in connection with this \ndebate will be that we really have not balanced the budget at all, we \nhave not gone far enough, we should not be using a unified budget, we \nshould ignore all of the taxes collected under the Social Security \nsystem and paid out under that Social Security system.\n  Implicit in that argument is that we have not gone far enough, that \nwe have \n\n[[Page S 15494]]\n\nnot cut spending sufficiently. There will be a great deal of confusion \non the part of the American people when they hear on one side the \nargument that we have not gone far enough because we do not bring the \nbudget to balance in the year 2002, in spite of the words of the \nCongressional Budget Office--without any suggestion, I may say, as to \nhow we should do so--and, on the other side, the argument we are simply \ngoing to far.\n  I hope this debate will be worked out during the course of, simply, \nthe balance of this week. But the bottom line is that this Senate, the \nmajority in this Senate, are going to vote for a budget which not only \nbrings us into balance as quickly as a constitutional amendment would \nhave brought us into balance but will also pay off $170 billion less in \ndeficits than would otherwise take place. That $170 billion is itself \nonly the tip of the iceberg above water. That is how the Federal \nGovernment benefits. The people of the United States will benefit two, \nthree, four times as much, in higher incomes, in better jobs, in a \nbrighter future and in more opportunity.\n  So I commend my friend, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nfor his work in getting us to the verge of this great success and look \nforward to a significant and vitally important debate in this Senate on \nthe future of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15493-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1322\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to my friend from the \nState of Washington. It seems like the only hearings we are going to \nhave on this budget are on the Senate floor. It is very difficult not \nto have people in to hold hearings and have markups on many pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, it is a little bit interesting to look at all the \nfigures that are coming out. Everybody has different figures. CBO says \none thing and they give you a certification. Then we get numbers from \nsomeplace else. Then the Budget Committee comes up with theirs, and I \nam tickled to death with the work of the Budget Committee except I do \nnot think they ought to give the tax cut.\n  Now we see almost 50 percent of the taxpayers of this country are \ngoing to have their taxes increased by not allowing the tax credit that \nthey have had in past years that encouraged people to work, to bring \npeople above the poverty level.\n  So, you can say all you want to about how great this is. There is a \nhymn, ``How Great Thou Art.'' There is nothing about ``thou art'' in \nthis budget.\n  So I hope we will look at it very closely. I am disappointed we did \nnot have an opportunity to dig into the details because, as I have \nbrought up, the devil is in the details. We have not seen all the \ndetails yet, and I hope at some point during the debate some of the \ndetails will come out.\n  I do not know whether or not anybody else is seeking the floor, Mr. \nPresident.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each sovereign nation, under international law and \n     custom, may designate its own capital.\n       (2) Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital \n     of the State of Israel.\n       (3) The city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's \n     President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of \n     numerous government ministries and social and cultural \n     institutions.\n       (4) The city of Jerusalem is the spiritual center of \n     Judaism, and is also considered a holy city by the members of \n     other religious faiths.\n       (5) From 1948-1967, Jerusalem was a divided city and \n     Israeli citizens of all faiths as well as Jewish citizens of \n     all states were denied access to holy sites in the area \n     controlled by Jordan.\n       (6) In 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the \n     conflict known as the Six Day War.\n       (7) Since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city \n     administered by Israel, and persons of all religious faiths \n     have been guaranteed full access to holy sites within the \n     city.\n       (8) This year marks the 28th consecutive year that \n     Jerusalem has been administered as a unified city in which \n     the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected.\n       (9) In 1990, the Congress unanimously adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 106, which declares that the Congress \n     ``strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided \n     city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group \n     are protected''.\n       (10) In 1992, the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 113 of the One Hundred Second Congress to \n     commemorate the 25th anniversary of the reunification of \n     Jerusalem, and reaffirming congressional sentiment that \n     Jerusalem must remain an undivided city.\n       (11) The September 13, 1993, Declaration of Principles on \n     Interim Self-Government Arrangements lays out a timetable for \n     the resolution of ``final status'' issues, including \n     Jerusalem.\n       (12) The Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area \n     was signed May 4, 1994, beginning the five-year transitional \n     period laid out in the Declaration of Principles.\n       (13) In March of 1995, 93 members of the United States \n     Senate signed a letter to Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher encouraging ``planning to begin now'' for \n     relocation of the United States Embassy to the city of \n     Jerusalem.\n       (14) In June of 1993, 257 members of the United States \n     House of Representatives signed a letter to the Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher stating that the relocation of the \n     United States Embassy to Jerusalem ``should take place no \n     later than . . . 1999''.\n       (15) The United States maintains its embassy in the \n     functioning capital of every country except in the case of \n     our democratic friend and strategic ally, the State of \n     Israel.\n       (16) The United States conducts official meetings and other \n     business in the city of Jerusalem in de facto recognition of \n     its status as the capital of Israel.\n       (17) In 1996, the State of Israel will celebrate the \n     3,000th anniversary of the Jewish presence in Jerusalem since \n     King David's entry.\n\n     SEC. 3. TIMETABLE.\n\n       (a) Statement of the Policy of the United States.--\n       (1) Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the \n     rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected;\n       (2) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the \n     State of Israel; and\n\n[[Page S 15495]]\n\n       (3) the United States Embassy in Israel should be \n     established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n       (b) Opening Determination.--Not more than 50 percent of the \n     funds appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year \n     1999 for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad'' \n     may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and \n     reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in \n     Jerusalem has officially opened.\n\n     SEC. 4. FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997 FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Fiscal Year 1996.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' for the Department of State in fiscal year 1996, not \n     less than $25,000,000 should be made available until expended \n     only for construction and other costs associated with the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy in Israel in the \n     capital of Jerusalem.\n       (b) Fiscal Year 1997.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' for the Department of State in fiscal year 1997, not \n     less than $75,000,000 should be made available until expended \n     only for construction and other costs associated with the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy in Israel in the \n     capital of Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 5.

I have also authorized the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of State, to designate additional foreign persons who play a \nsignificant role in international narcotics trafficking centered in \nColumbia or who materially support such trafficking, and other persons \ndetermined to be owned or controlled by or to act for or on behalf of \ndesignated persons, whose property or transactions or dealings in \nproperty in the United States or with United States persons shall be \nsubject to the prohibitions contained in the order.\n  I have authorized these measures in response to the relentless threat \nposed by significant foreign narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia \nto the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates.\n  Narcotics production has grown substantially in recent years. \nPotential cocaine production--a majority of which is bound for the \nUnited States--is approximately 850 metric tons per year. Narcotics \ntraffickers centered in Colombia have exercised control over more than \n80 percent of the cocaine entering the United States.\n  Narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia undermines dramatically \nthe health and well-being of United States citizens as well as the \ndomestic economy. Such trafficking also harms trade and commercial \nrelations between our countries. The penetration of legitimate sectors \nof the Colombian economy by the so-called Cali cartel has frequently \npermitted it to corrupt various institutions of Colombian government \nand society and to disrupt Colombian commerce and economic development.\n  The economic impact and corrupting financial influence of such \nnarcotics trafficking is not limited to Colombia but affects commerce \nand finance in the United States and beyond. United States law \nenforcement authorities estimate that the traffickers are responsible \nfor the repatriation of $4.7 to $7 billion in illicit drug profits from \nthe United States to Colombia annually, some of which is invested in \nostensibly legitimate businesses. Financial resources of that \nmagnitude, which have been illicitly generated and injected \n\n[[Page S 15496]]\ninto the legitimate channels of international commerce, threaten the \nintegrity of the domestic and international financial systems on which \nthe economies of many nations now rely.\n  For all of these reasons, I have determined that the actions of \nsignificant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, and the \nunparalleled violence, corruption, and harm that they cause in the \nUnited States and abroad, constitute an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the \nUnited States. I have, accordingly, declared a national emergency in \nresponse to this threat.\n  The measures I am taking are designed to deny these traffickers \nbenefit of any assets subject to the jurisdiction of the United States \nand to prevent United States persons from engaging in any commercial \ndealings with them, their front companies, and their agents. These \nmeasures demonstrate firmly and decisively the commitment of the United \nStates to end the scourge that such traffickers have wrought upon \nsociety in the United States and beyond. The magnitude and dimension of \nthe current problem warrant utilizing all available tools to wrest the \ndestructive hold that these traffickers have on society and \ngovernments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to approve and implement the OECD Shipbuilding Trade \nAgreement; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE SHIPBUILDING TRADE AGREEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to approve \nand implement the Agreement Respecting Normal Competitive Conditions in \nthe Commercial Shipbuilding and Repair Industry, also known as the OECD \nShipbuilding Agreement. While not perfect, this agreement appears to be \nour last best chance to eliminate unfair subsidies, to counter \ninjurious pricing policies, to reign in trade distorting export \nfinancing, and to institute an effective binding dispute settlement \nsystem for shipbuilding controversies. Because of this agreement, for \nthe first time, U.S. shipyard workers will have safeguards against \nhaving to compete with continued funding from foreign treasuries.\n  My involvement with the issue of unfair foreign shipbuilding \npractices relates to my State of Louisiana being one of the premier \nshipbuilding States in the country. Over 27,000 Louisiana jobs are \nimpacted by constructing or repairing ships. As has been the case \nnationwide, Louisiana's shipbuilding employment has suffered \nsignificantly since the 1980's. This situation is due to U.S. defense \ndownsizing and to unfair foreign shipbuilding practices. Since 1989, \nI've been actively working to eliminate unfair foreign shipbuilding \npractices and to restore the U.S. commercial shipbuilding industry.\n  How did the United States get in this dilemma? From 1974 to 1987, \nworldwide overall demand for ocean going vessels declined 71 percent. \nDuring the same time span, United States merchant vessel construction \ndropped drastically from an average of 72 ships/year to an average of \n21 ships/year. Also during this period governments in all the major \nshipbuilding nations, with the exception of the United States, \ndramatically increased aid to their shipyards and their associated \ninfrastructure with massive levels of subsidies in virtually every \nform.\n  The U.S. Government, however, decided to unilaterally terminate \ncommercial construction subsidies to U.S. yards. Instead, U.S. Defense \nshipbuilding increased. U.S. Defense shipbuilding construction rose \nfrom an average of 79 ships/year in the 1970's to an average of 95 \nships/year in the 1980's. The net result was a virtual abandonment by \nthe large U.S. Defense yards to subsidized foreign yards of the \ninternational commercial shipbuilding market. In 10 years, the number \nof major U.S. shipyards producing only commercial ships declined from \n11 to 1.\n  The end of the 1980's saw a Department of Defense reevaluation of the \nneed for a 600-ship navy. It also saw the U.S. shipbuilding industry \nreevaluate its need to compete for commercial ship construction orders \nin a subsidized world market. Consequently, in June of 1989, the U.S. \nshipbuilding industry, \n\n[[Page S 15497]]\nrepresented by the Shipbuilders Council of America, filed a claim for \ninjurious unfair subsidies under section 301 of the U.S. trade laws \nagainst the major shipbuilding countries of the world.\n  Later that year, however, U.S. Trade Ambassador Carla Hills, \npersuaded the industry that a better way to eliminate the foreign \nsubsidies was through multilateral negotiations. Industry decided to \ngive international negotiations a chance and therefore withdrew its \nsection 301 claim. The 5-year OECD quest to eliminate shipbuilding \nsubsidies had begun.\n  From late 1989 to late 1994, the OECD negotiations were constantly on \nagain and off again. During 1993, when the talks had seemingly \ncollapsed, I introduced a bill in the Senate (S. 990) and Congressman \nSam Gibbons introduced a bill in the House (H.R. 1402), that would have \ninvoked significant sanctions against ships constructed in foreign \nsubsidized yards when those ships called upon the United States. This \nlegislation became unnecessary when the agreement was finally signed.\n  From June 1989 until the present agreement was signed on December 21, \n1994, the U.S. objective and the industry's urgent request appeared to \nbe straightforward: ``Eliminate subsidies and we can compete.'' When \nthe Clinton administration came into office, to its credit, it proposed \na shipyard revitalization plan. Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Don \nPhillips described the nature of the plan for the Senate Finance \nCommittee Trade Subcommittee on November 18, 1993 when he said:\n\n       Finally, this five-point program is a transitional program, \n     consistent with federal assistance to other industries \n     seeking to convert from defense to civilian markets. In \n     addition, it seeks to support, not undercut, the negotiations \n     that are currently underway in the OECD. In this regard, we \n     have made clear our intention to modify this program, as \n     appropriate, so that it would be consistent with the \n     provision of a multilateral agreement--if and when such an \n     agreement enters into force. (emphasis added).\n\n  Now we have such an agreement, but the largest U.S. Defense shipyards \ndon't want it because current U.S. transitional subsidies will need to \nbe curbed, as well as additional future subsidies prohibited, in order \nto be consistent with the agreement. This is really the issue in a \nnutshell. We can talk about the Jones Act, we can talk about the \ntrustworthiness of other countries, we can talk about the adequacy of \nenforcement mechanisms, but what it really seems to come down to for \nthese big shipyards is whether or not we can keep our currently \nadvantageous subsidies.\n  In all the comments I have heard to date about this agreement, I have \nyet to hear of a scenario whereby U.S. industry is better off fighting \nunfair foreign shipbuilding practices without the agreement than it \nwould be with the agreement. For example, this agreement will give us \nreal tools to fight unfair French subsidies. It will allow us to \ncounter unfair dumping of ships by Japan and Korea. It will finally \nplug the gap in existing U.S. trade laws that has cost so many American \nshipyard workers their jobs.\n  The assertions that this agreement somehow puts the Jones Act \ndomestic build provisions in jeopardy is discredited by our own Jones \nAct carriers who stand to lose the most under a faulty agreement. The \nlargest Jones Act carriers, in fact, support the agreement and they \nclearly would not if this agreement hurt their interests--it does not. \nIn addition, many of the new shipbuilding orders that have been placed \nat U.S. shipyards are for use in the Jones Act trade.\n  It also seems that the optimism over the current success of our title \nXI financing program may be overstated. As I understand it, the new \nexport orders associated with the current title XI program exist \nbecause our stepped-up title XI program is currently protected by a \nstandstill clause in the OECD agreement. If we reject the agreement, we \nlose the standstill clause, and consequently it seems to reason that we \nwill lose our current title XI advantage. While I recognize the need to \nconform our title XI program, I am willing to explore the continuation \nof current title XI terms, subject to reasonable due diligence \nnegotiations, to the date that we implement the terms of the agreement.\n  Unless we are prepared to win a long-term subsidies race with our \ncompetitors, I don't understand how we can reject this agreement. Not \nonly is Congress faced with dire budgetary decisions, such as cutting \nover $450 billion from Medicare and Medicaid over the next 7 years, but \nthe Department of Defense has also indicated that it will not fund \ncommercial shipbuilding subsidies through its DOD accounts.\n  Add heightened competition due to increasing world shipbuilding \ncapacity and it seems to me, and history supports, that our competitors \nare very likely to match or exceed what little amounts we will be able \nto devote to title XI. It was estimated by the Shipbuilding Council in \n1993 that the top six subsidizing nations in the OECD were budgeting \nover $9 billion on average each year to assist their shipyards. We may \nthen find ourselves in the same untenable situation that confronted our \nindustry in 1981: No international subsidies disciplines, inadequate \nU.S. trade remedies, and no recourse for the U.S. commercial \nshipbuilding industry and its workers.\n  Mr. President, we're all in the same boat, so to speak. However, \nbefore anyone attempts to scuttle this agreement to help revise our \nU.S. commercial shipbuilding industry, I'd like to redouble efforts \nwith all members of the industry to see what we can do to close the \nremaining competitiveness gap. Our goal should be to couple the \nsignificant advantages of this agreement with genuine and creative \nimprovements in U.S. shipbuilding competitiveness.\n  With this in mind, I am introducing the Shipbuilding Trade Agreement \nAct. The text of this bill closely reflects an administration draft \nthat we have attempted to improve and strengthen. It is a bipartisan \nwork-in-progress bill composed of two titles. Title I contains \n``injurious pricing and countermeasures'' provisions that closely track \ncurrent U.S. antidumping laws, while taking into account the unique \nnature of ship transactions. Title II contains ``other provisions'' \nincluding amendments to the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, repeal of the \nU.S. vessel repair statute for signatory countries, and a special \nmonitoring provision to ensure foreign country compliance with the \nterms of the shipbuilding agreement.\n  The House Ways and Means trade Subcommittee has already held a \nhearing on this agreement. I understand the subcommittee is currently \nmaking final revisions to the same USTR draft that we used and intends \nto introduce a bill in the House shortly. It is my hope that the House \ncan move its bill quickly in order that both legislative bodies might \npass a bill and send it to the President for signature before year-end. \nI have requested a full committee hearing on this Senate bill with the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Commerce Committee Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee Chairman Trent Lott has \nalso indicated interest in holding a hearing on the agreement.\n  In closing, we stand before a window of opportunity for the U.S. \ncommercial shipbuilding industry. The $265 billion commercial \nshipbuilding market is fast approaching its cyclical peak. I am hopeful \nthat we will seize this moment and implement this agreement. It may be \nour best and only chance to end foreign shipbuilding subsidies and \nfinally five our workers and yards the level playing field for which \nthey have asked, and deserved, for too long.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a copy of the October 19, 1995, \nJournal of Commerce editorial supporting the OECD Shipbuilding \nAgreement be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Journal of Commerce, Oct. 19, 1995\n\n                           End Ship Subsidies\n\n       Government subsidies have been the mainstay of foreign \n     shipbuilders for decades. That has been a good deal for \n     companies that buy ships but a burden for taxpayers who \n     underwrite the handouts, and a problem for unsubsidized \n     shipyards, including those in the United States.\n       Much of this would change under a pending global agreement, \n     which would end most subsidies and give U.S. shipbuilders a \n     better chance to compete. But the agreement is languishing in \n     Congress, a victim mainly of political concerns. After more \n     than six years spent negotiating this deal, lawmakers would \n     be foolish to let it unravel over partisan sniping. Congress \n     should approve it, and soon.\n\n[[Page S 15498]]\n\n       Japan, Korea and Europe dominate the world shipbuilding \n     market, and for years their governments have showered them \n     with financial support. The United States, which ended its \n     direct subsidies in 1981, has been trying for six years to \n     stop the foreign handouts. A deal completed in 1994 would \n     largely do that, and it is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 \n     but only if the major shipbuilding nations ratify it. So far, \n     the United States has not, and the prospects for approval are \n     uncertain.\n       Most of the problems are purely political. The shipbuilding \n     agreement's strongest supporter, Rep. Sam Gibbons, is the \n     former Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means \n     Committee. The new Republican chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, has \n     been cool toward an agreement viewed largely as a Democratic \n     initiative--even though, as a Republican, Mr. Archer should \n     be stumping for any plan that ends government subsidies. \n     Indeed, Mr. Archer might eventually back the agreement, but \n     only if influential Democrats support one of his bills. This \n     is the usual Washington game of political trade-offs, but if \n     a deal isn't struck soon, the pact may not be ratified by the \n     January deadline.\n       The other problem is rooted in the White House. The Clinton \n     administration negotiated the shipbuilding agreement and \n     supports it publicly. But several big shipyards oppose it, as \n     do their labor unions. Mr. Clinton, anxious to rebuild his \n     labor base in time for the election, has been careful not to \n     offend unions this year, so the White House hasn't been \n     pushing Congress very hard.\n       Mr. Clinton and Republican leaders would do well to look at \n     the larger issue here. Like farming and steel, shipbuilding \n     has been one of the most distorted of international \n     industries. Decisions on where to build ships have been based \n     as much on government subsidies as on quality and \n     workmanship. This has hurt U.S. shipyards, and the agreement \n     would begin to change that.\n       Ironically, the biggest U.S. shipyards continue to fight \n     the pact, arguing, instead, for new direct subsidies to help \n     them make up for lost time. That is stunningly shortsighted. \n     Any new subsidy plan by the United states would be matched \n     instantly by other shipbuilding nations. Indeed, other \n     countries most likely would top any U.S. subsidy, as they \n     have before. That would leave U.S. shipbuilders in the same \n     position they've been if for the last 15 years. For that \n     reason, many smaller shipyards, including those with more \n     commercial experience, are supporting the agreement.\n       Foreign shipyards, admittedly, have a leg up on their U.S. \n     competitors because of existing subsidies, some of which will \n     not be completely phased out until 1999. But U.S. yards have \n     had their own advantages over the years, including lucrative \n     military work and a government-created monopoly on building \n     ships for the U.S. domestic trades. In fact, commercial ship \n     orders actually have been increasingly lately at U.S. yards. \n     A generous government loan guarantee program has spurred the \n     new orders, and while the program will be scaled back under \n     the new pact, it has given U.S. yards a foot in the door with \n     commercial buyers.\n       No trade agreement can ever instantly level the competitive \n     field between nations. Still, the shipbuilding pact gets \n     other countries off the subsidy treadmill and restores some \n     sense to the global market. Leaders of both parties should \n     put aside politics and get this deal done.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Simon, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Ford, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Bumpers, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1355. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to end \ndeferral for U.S. shareholders on income of controlled foreign \ncorporations attributable to property imported into the United States; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the american jobs and manufacturing preservation act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will soon be making a number of tough \nchoices on the Senate floor to reduce the Federal deficit. There is one \nchoice, however, which should be easy for most of us: eliminating the \ncostly and misguided tax subsidy which encourages American firms to \nmove abroad and then compete, unfairly, with Main Street businesses in \nthe U.S. market.\n  That's why I rise today--with 15 of my Senate colleagues--to \nintroduce the American Jobs and Manufacturing Preservation Act. It \nrepeals a perverse Federal tax incentive which actually encourages many \nof the finest U.S. companies to shut down their manufacturing plants in \nthe United States, move them--and the jobs they provide--abroad, and \nthen supply the U.S. market from foreign tax havens.\n  The often-overlooked loss of our manufacturing jobs is alarming. Yet \nthe Federal Government actually rewards U.S. companies that move their \njobs and capital to foreign tax havens.\n  This special tax subsidy is called deferral. The way it works is \nquite simple. If a U.S. company moves an operation abroad, it can defer \nits taxes on the resulting profits until it sends those profits back to \nthe United States in the form of dividends. Evidence shows that this \nspecial tax break costs U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars in lost \nrevenues, and accelerates the movement of U.S. jobs overseas.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 3 million U.S. \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost since 1979. One half of that job loss \nin manufacturing, 1.4 million, occurred between January 1989 and \nSeptember 1993. During this time, the United States lost an average of \n26,000 manufacturing jobs per month. This is the equivalent to shutting \ndown one Fortune 500 manufacturing firm per month, for 56 months. While \nthere was a short period of job growth in manufacturing in late 1993 \nand 1994, there are new and disturbing signs that employment in \nmanufacturing is again declining.\n  While the United States was losing manufacturing jobs, many foreign \ntax havens were seeing significant increases in jobs creation from U.S. \nowned subsidiaries. For example, while the United States was losing 3 \nmillion manufacturing jobs, the number of jobs with United States based \ncompanies in Singapore sky-rocketed by 46 percent, or 36,800 jobs. In \n1992, U.S. firms had hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs \nlocated in tax haven countries.\n  The Federal Government has just started to track data to tell us how \nmany of the U.S. jobs lost through plant closure moved overseas. \nHowever, if only half of the plant closings involved these runaway \nplants moving jobs to other countries, this would account for the \nelimination of more than half a million U.S. manufacturing jobs per \nyear.\n  This legislation is carefully targeted. It would end tax deferral \nonly where U.S. multinationals produce abroad in foreign tax havens, \nand then ship those tax haven-produced products back into the United \nStates. It is important to note that this bill does nothing to hinder \nU.S. multinationals that produce abroad from competing with foreign \nfirms in foreign markets.\n  We can hardly be shocked when U.S. companies move jobs overseas--jobs \nwhich produce goods for U.S. consumption, no less--when we offer a \nspecial tax break giving them an unfair advantage over U.S. competitors \nto do so. Add the low tax rates and labor costs which foreign \ngovernments often use to entice U.S. firms to move overseas and it's \nnot surprising at all that many companies find the lure to move U.S. \njobs to foreign countries irresistible.\n  Congress should act now both to protect American jobs and to prevent \nany further erosion of our domestic economic base. And I intend to \noffer this legislation as amendment to the budget reconciliation bill \nlater this week.\n  Some companies may still choose to dislocate thousands of workers in \nAmerica in search of greater profits abroad. But taxpayers should not \nbe asked to provide billions of dollars in tax subsidies to encourage \nthem to do so.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER:\n  S. 1356. A bill to amend the Shipping Act of 1984 to provide for \nocean shipping reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 the ocean shipping reform act of 1995\n\n Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nsummary of the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Summary of the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1995\n\n\n             elimination of the federal maritime commission\n\n       Under the new legislation the Federal Maritime Commission \n     will be eliminated no later than October 1, 1997. The \n     legislation directs that the existing functions and \n     responsibilities of the Commission should begin to be \n     transferred to the Secretary of Transportation, beginning as \n     soon as practical in fiscal year 1996.\n\n\n    elimination of tariff enforcement and tariff and contract filing\n\n       On January 1, 1997, tariffs shall no longer be enforced \n     and, on June 1, 1997, all requirements that tariffs and \n     service contracts be \n\n[[Page S 15499]]\n     filed with the federal government are eliminated.\n\n\n                            common carriage\n\n       On June 1, 1997, a new and separate system for common and \n     contract carriage takes effect. Under the common carriage \n     regime, common carriers and conferences will be required to \n     make available a schedule of transportation rates which shall \n     include the rates, terms, and conditions for transportation \n     services not governed by an ocean transportation contract. \n     Upon the request of any person, the schedule of \n     transportation rates shall be provided to the requesting \n     person in writing. Common carriers and conferences may assess \n     a reasonable charge for providing the schedule in writing; \n     however, the charge may not exceed the cost of providing the \n     information requested. Any disputes concerning the \n     applicability of the rates, terms, and conditions provided, \n     or any claim involving false billing, false classification, \n     false weighing, false report of weight, or false measurement \n     must be decided in State or Federal court.\n\n\n                           contract carriage\n\n       The new legislation eliminates completely the rules and \n     requirements pertaining to service contracts and establishes \n     a broad and deregulated system of ocean transportation \n     contracts. Under this system, one or more common carriers or \n     a conference may enter into an ocean transportation contract \n     with one or more shippers (as discussed below the definition \n     of shipper has been expanded to include shippers' \n     associations and ocean freight forwarders that accept \n     responsibility for the payment of the ocean freight). The \n     duties of the parties to an ocean transportation contract are \n     limited to the duties specified by the terms of the contract, \n     and ocean transportation contracts may not be challenged on \n     the grounds that the contract violates a provision of the \n     Act. The exclusive remedy for an alleged breach of an ocean \n     transportation contract is an action in State or Federal \n     court.\n       Ocean transportation contracts are not required to be filed \n     with the federal government as are service contracts, and on \n     January 1, 1998, such contracts may be made on a confidential \n     basis, upon agreement of the parties. Also effective on \n     January 1, 1998 is a requirement that members of a conference \n     agreement may not be prohibited or restricted from agreeing \n     with one or more shippers that the parties to the contract \n     will not disclose the rates, services, terms, or conditions \n     of that contract to any other member of the agreement, to the \n     conference, to any other carrier, shipper, conference, or to \n     any other third party.\n\n\n                    independent action on contracts\n\n       On January 1, 1997, authorization is provided to the \n     members of conference agreements to enter individual and \n     independent contracts and, on June 1, 1997, the requirement \n     that conferences may not prohibit or restrict conference \n     members from engaging in individual negotiations for \n     contracts and may not issue mandatory rules affecting \n     individual contracts is implemented. However, a conference \n     may require that a member of the conference disclose the \n     existence of an individual contract or negotiations for a \n     contract when the conference enters negotiations for a \n     contract with the same shipper.\n\n\n                 independent action on conference rates\n\n       On June 1, 1997, the notice requirements concerning \n     independent action on conference common carriage rates is \n     reduced from 10 calendar days to 3 business days.\n\n\n                       changes to prohibited acts\n\n       All prohibited acts related to rebating are stricken from \n     the Shipping Act on January 1, 1997, and a new \n     antidiscrimination provision is added that prohibits \n     unreasonable discrimination by one or more common carriers \n     against a person, place, port, or shipper, except when \n     entering ocean transportation contracts.\n       On June 1, 1997, several other prohibitions concerning \n     discrimination are stricken as is the restriction on the use \n     of loyalty contracts. However, prohibitions concerning \n     retaliation by carriers, the employment of fighting ships \n     unreasonable refusals to deal, refusals to negotiate with \n     shippers' associations, the acceptance of cargo or contracts \n     with non-licensed and bonded ocean freight forwarders, and \n     improper disclosure of information are retained. The \n     legislation adds a new and controversial prohibited act that \n     prevents conferences from subjecting a person, place, port, \n     class or type of shipper, or ocean freight forwarder, to \n     unjust or unreasonable ocean contract provisions.\n\n\n                  expansion of the meaning of shipper\n\n       The definition of shipper is expanded to include shippers' \n     associations and ocean freight forwarders that accept \n     responsibility for payment of the ocean freight. One of the \n     primary purposes of this change was to ensure that shippers' \n     associations and ocean freight forwarders could enter ocean \n     transportation contracts under the new contract carriage \n     scheme established by the legislation. This change will also \n     afford certain protections to such entities that \n     traditionally have been limited to shippers.\n\n\n                    ocean freight forwarders/nvoccs\n\n       The new Act collapses the definition of non-vessel-\n     operating common carriers (''NVOCCs'') into the definition of \n     ocean freight forwarders and requires all United States ocean \n     freight forwarders to obtain a license and bond (or other \n     surety). This change effectively eliminates the confusing \n     legal distinctions between various types of third parties who \n     perform similar or related functions.\n\n\n                      other changes to definitions\n\n       The definitions of certain terms that are no longer \n     relevant or necessary under the new statutory scheme are \n     stricken (i.e. ``deferred rebates,'' ``bulk cargo,'' ``forest \n     products,'' ``loyalty contracts'' and ``service contracts'') \n     and a new definition for ``ocean transportation contracts'' \n     is added.\n\n\n                     controlled carriers amendments\n\n       All requirements that controlled carriers file tariffs with \n     the FMC are eliminated by the new legislation. Additionally, \n     a new provision is added to this section of the `84 Shipping \n     Act that would expand the application of rate scrutiny to not \n     only controlled carriers but to ``ocean common carriers that \n     have been determined by the Secretary to be structurally or \n     financially affiliated with nontransportation entities or \n     organizations (government or private) in such a way as to \n     affect their pricing or marketplace behavior in an unfair, \n     predatory, or anticompetitive way that disadvantages United \n     States carriers.'' The Secretary may make such a \n     determination upon the request of any person or upon his own \n     motion. This provision has been strongly criticized by many \n     foreign carriers.\n\n\n                   marine terminal operator schedules\n\n       In order to address concerns raised by the ports and other \n     providers of terminal services relative to the elimination of \n     tariff enforcement, a provision is included in the Act that \n     would require marine terminal operators to make a schedule of \n     rates, regulations, and practices available to the public. \n     This schedule shall be enforceable as an implied contract, \n     without proof of actual knowledge of its provisions, for any \n     activity taken by the operator to-- (1) efficiently transfer \n     property between transportation modes; (2) protect property \n     from damage or loss; (3) comply with any governmental \n     requirement; or (4) store property in excess of the terms of \n     any other contract or agreement, if any, entered into by the \n     marine terminal operator.\n\n\n policy regarding foreign governments' ownership and control of ocean \n                            common carriers\n\n       The Secretary of Transportation is required under the Act \n     to implement a negotiation strategy to persuade foreign \n     governments to divest themselves of ownership and control of \n     ocean common carriers. The Secretary must develop and submit \n     such strategy to Congress no later than January 1, 1997.\n\n\n                            other amendments\n\n       Technical and conforming changes were made to the Penalties \n     section of the 1984 Shipping Act and the Foreign Laws and \n     Practices Act.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BUDGET PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     1996 (H. Con. Res. 67) calls for $245 billion in tax \n     reductions and $270 billion in projected spending reductions \n     from Medicare;\n       (2) reducing projected Medicare spending by $270 billion \n     could substantially increase out-of-pocket health care costs \n     for senior citizens, reduce the quality of care available to \n     Medicare beneficiaries and threaten the financial health of \n     some health care providers, especially in rural areas;\n       (3) seventy-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries have \n     annual incomes of less than $25,000;\n       (4) most of the tax cuts in the tax bill passed by the \n     House of Representatives (H.R. 1215) go to families making \n     over $100,000 per year, according to the Office of Tax \n     Analysis of the United States Department of the Treasury.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate should approve no tax legislation which \n     reduces taxes for those making over $250,000 per year; and\n       (2) the savings from limiting any tax reductions in this \n     way should be used to reduce any cuts in projected Medicare \n     spending.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        DOLE AMENDMENT NO. 2941\n\n  Mr. DOLE proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1322, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Jerusalem Embassy Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each sovereign nation, under international law and \n     custom, may designate its own capital.\n       (2) Since 1950, the city of Jerusalem has been the capital \n     of the State of Israel.\n       (3) The city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's \n     President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of \n     numerous government ministries and social and cultural \n     institutions.\n       (4) The city of Jerusalem is the spiritual center of \n     Judaism, and is also considered a holy city by the members of \n     other religious faiths.\n       (5) From 1948-1967, Jerusalem was a divided city and \n     Israeli citizens of all faiths as well as Jewish citizens of \n     all states were denied access to holy sites in the area \n     controlled by Jordan.\n       (6) In 1967, the city of Jerusalem was reunited during the \n     conflict known as the Six Day War.\n       (7) Since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city \n     administered by Israel, and persons of all religious faiths \n     have been guaranteed full access to holy sites within the \n     city.\n       (8) This year marks the 28th consecutive year that \n     Jerusalem has been administered as a unified city in which \n     the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected.\n       (9) In 1990, the Congress unanimously adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 106, which declares that the Congress \n     ``strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided \n     city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group \n     are protected''.\n       (10) In 1992, the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \n     Resolution 113 of the One Hundred Second Congress to \n     commemorate the 25th anniversary of the reunification of \n     Jerusalem, and reaffirming congressional sentiment that \n     Jerusalem must remain an undivided city.\n       (11) The September 13, 1993, Declaration of Principles on \n     Interim Self-Government Arrangements lays out a timetable for \n     the resolution of ``final status'' issues, including \n     Jerusalem.\n       (12) The Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area \n     was signed May 4, 1994, beginning the five-year transitional \n     period laid out in the Declaration of Principles.\n       (13) In March of 1995, 93 members of the United States \n     Senate signed a letter to Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher encouraging ``planning to begin now'' for \n     relocation of the United States Embassy to the city of \n     Jerusalem.\n       (14) In June of 1993, 257 members of the United States \n     House of Representatives signed a letter to the Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher stating that the relocation of the \n     United States Embassy to Jerusalem ``should take place no \n     later than . . . 1999''.\n       (15) The United States maintains its embassy in the \n     functioning capital of every country except in the case of \n     our democratic friend and strategic ally, the State of \n     Israel.\n       (16) The United States conducts official meetings and other \n     business in the city of Jerusalem in de facto recognition of \n     its status as the capital of Israel.\n       (17) In 1996, the State of Israel will celebrate the \n     3,000th anniversary of the Jewish presence in Jerusalem since \n     King David's entry.\n\n     SEC. 3. TIMETABLE.\n\n       (a) Statement of the Policy of the United States.--\n       (1) Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the \n     rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected;\n       (2) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the \n     State of Israel; and\n       (3) the United States Embassy in Israel should be \n     established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n       (b) Opening Determination.--Not more than 50 percent of the \n     funds appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year \n     1999 for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad'' \n     may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and \n     reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in \n     Jerusalem has officially opened.\n\n     SEC. 4. FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997 FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Fiscal Year 1996.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' for the Department of State in fiscal year 1996, not \n     less than $25,000,000 should be made available until expended \n     only for construction and other costs associated with the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy in Israel in the \n     capital of Jerusalem.\n       (b) Fiscal Year 1997.--Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings \n     Abroad'' for the Department of State in fiscal year 1997, not \n     less than $75,000,000 should be made available until expended \n     only for construction and other costs associated with the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy in Israel in the \n     capital of Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate detailing the Department of \n     State's plan to implement this Act. Such report shall \n     include--\n       (1) estimated dates of completion for each phase of the \n     establishment of the United States Embassy, including site \n     identification, land acquisition, architectural, engineering \n     and construction surveys, site preparation, and construction; \n     and\n       (2) an estimate of the funding necessary to implement this \n     Act, including all costs associated with establishing the \n     United States Embassy in Israel in the capital of Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 6. SEMIANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       At the time of the submission of the President's fiscal \n     year 1997 budget request, and every six months thereafter, \n     the Secretary of State shall report to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate on the progress made toward opening \n     the United States Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Mr. President, on September 20, the Senate passed \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill. I would like to take this time to \nexplain some of the votes I cast during debate on this bill.\n  I voted for several amendments related to reducing the scope of the \nMarket Promotion Program including an amendment which would reduce \nfunding for the MPP's and limit potential users to small U.S. \nbusinesses.\n  While many businesses have benefited from this program, in these \ntimes of extreme budgetary austerity, we must prioritize Federal \nGovernment spending. These are tough choices, but if we don't make them \nnow, the results will be devastating for future generations.\n  One of our goals in this Congress has been to free citizens from \nunnecessary burdens and excessive taxation of bureaucracy. In doing so, \nsome Government programs which support businesses also must be reduced. \nIt is my hope, however, that in the long run, we will allow individuals \nand businesses to keep more of the money they are now paying in taxes \nso that they are able to create programs like the Market Promotion \nProgram without Government involvement.\n  I also voted against an amendment which would have eliminated from \nthe bill a provision to provide assistance to cotton farmers whose \ncrops were devastated by tobacco bud worms, beet army worms, and other \npests. This amendment was accepted without my support.\n  Many farmers were told that the newly created Catastrophic Crop \nDisaster Insurance Program would provide the same level of protection \nas previous Federal disaster programs. These farmers, therefore, relied \non the new program for help in disasters such as this. Unfortunately, \nthe level of protection is not the same as previous disaster programs. \nThe provision to assist cotton farmers was included in the bill because \nthe Catastrophic Crop Disaster Insurance Program is not sufficient to \nhelp these farmers.\n  Mr. President, recognizing the extreme losses these farmers are \nexperiencing through no fault of their own and over which they had \nabsolutely no control, I feel it is appropriate that the Federal \nGovernment, assuming that the Secretary of Agriculture deems the losses \ndisastrous, step in to provide these low interest loans to cotton \ngrowers who have been economically devastated by this disaster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15501-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DRUNK DRIVING PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am joining Senator Dorgan in \nintroducing the Drunk Driving Prevention Act of 1995. I urge my \ncolleagues to lend their support to this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The Drunk Driving Prevention Act of 1995 would require States to take \na commonsense approach to preventing drunk driving accidents and \ndeaths. The legislation would require the transfer of certain Federal \nhighway funds to a State's highway safety program if a State fails to \nprohibit open containers of alcoholic beverages and consumption of \nalcoholic beverages in the passenger's area of motor vehicles. \nSanctions under the bill would not go into effect until fiscal year \n2000, so States will have ample time to comply with this law.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of efforts to eliminate the \nneedless slaughter of innocent men, women, and children on our Nation's \nhighways. I sponsored the legislation that established the 21 minimum \ndrinking age law. That legislation has been credited with saving some \n9,000 lives and 120,600 injuries over the last 10 years.\n  Even with efforts like the ``21'' bill, the killing continues. Last \nyear, nearly 17,000 people were needlessly killed in alcohol-related \ntraffic accidents. That amounts to one alcohol-related death every 30 \nminutes. The repercussions of impaired driving continue to cost our \nsociety some $46 billion each year in direct costs, with approximately \n$5.5 billion allotted for medical care.\n  Mr. President, we all know that mixing alcohol and driving is a \ndeadly combination. Unfortunately, 26 States in this country allow the \nconsumption of alcohol in motor vehicles. This is an open invitation to \ndisaster and an outrage that must be stopped.\n  I commend my friend from North Dakota for his tenacity on this issue \nand I am proud to join him in his effort to make our Nation's roads \nsafer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15501-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15501-S15502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to \nreflect upon the recent announcement of our esteemed colleague from \nGeorgia that he will not seek reelection at the conclusion of his \ncurrent term. I must of course, accept his decision, but I am also \npersonally saddened by it.\n  Sam Nunn has given much to this body, and given even more to the \npeople of Georgia. Early in his career, Sam Nunn quietly impressed his \ncolleagues with his thoughtful and well-reasoned speeches on the future \nof our national defense. And as the former chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, he helped shape that future with strong leadership \nand keen intellect.\n  Sam Nunn let one of this body's most important committees during a \ntime of enormous, it not tumultuous, global change. His foresight about \nevents in the Russian Republic led this body to create one of the \nworld's most important mechanisms for ensuring the peaceful disposal of \nformer Soviet weapons. To this day, the Nunn-Lugar initiative on \nsecurity assistance leaves a legacy of peace in the post-cold-war era--\na peace that stands as a fitting tribute to the efforts of its author.\n  But Sam Nunn's commitment to peace has been matched, if not \nsurpassed, by his commitment to a strong defense. For nearly a decade, \nSam Nunn has helped crystallize the standards by which we examine our \nnational defense. It was Sam Nunn who pushed for the American research \ninitiatives that have resulted in today's stealth technologies. \nLikewise, it was Sam Nunn who ensured those technologies were available \nto those serving in our Armed Forces, giving them the edge they needed \nto defend our country.\n  Finally, it should be noted that Sam Nunn always put first the needs \nand the safety of America's service personnel. Over the past 23 years, \nSam Nunn has consistently fought for our service members and their \nfamilies. Whether it was funds for better housing, or expanded \nopportunities for better medical care, Sam Nunn has always been there \nguarding the interests of our dedicated troops. The dozens upon dozens \nof tokens of appreciation that adorn his office wall are proof of Sam \nNunn's commitment to people.\n  Sam Nunn is a gentleman and a scholar. He has graced these halls for \nmore than two decades with his quick wit, commitment to public service, \nand personal passion for the affairs of our \n\n[[Page S 15502]]\nNation.

One of those amendments \nwill be to strike the provision that opens up the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling.\n  I strongly oppose drilling in ANWR and will support that amendment. \nIf we allow drilling in the coastal plain, we are destroying what the \nFish and Wildlife Service calls the biological heart of the only \ncomplete Arctic ecosystem protected in North America. We will be \ndestroying that resource for a one in five chance of finding any \neconomically recoverable oil in the coastal plain. And, even worse, we \nwill destroy that biological heart in an effort to recover what many \nexperts suggest will be only 200 days worth of oil for the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to argue all the issues surrounding \nthe decision to drill in ANWR, or to keep it as it is. Instead, I want \nto only focus on one issue: caribou.\n  On Saturday, the Anchorage Daily News reported that a new State \nsurvey produced by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game revealed a \nsharp decline in the central Arctic caribou herd, which calves and \nranges in the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields, from 23,400 animals \nin 1992 to about 18,100 this summer. The census also revealed that the \nherd that stays away from the oil and gas development has not suffered \nas much decline.\n  The State and Federal wildlife biologists do not know what caused the \ndecline, but one thing is sure. The article paraphrases a State \nwildlife biologist.\n\n       [A]lmost all of the decline has occurred in that part of \n     the herd that ranges near the oil fields. It could be due to \n     noise, traffic or some other disruption of caribou grazing, \n     or to some natural cycle.\n\n  Mr. President, I raise this because there has been some dispute \ninvolving the effects of the proposed drilling on wildlife, and \nparticularly on caribou. Supporters of drilling in ANWR contend that \ncaribou are flourishing and the caribou may even benefit from \ndevelopment. Opponents of drilling contend that the impact will \nnegatively affect caribou, particularly the porcupine caribou, which \ncalve on the 1002 area and on which the Gwich'in people depend for \ntheir food and culture.\n  Two herds occupy ANWR: the porcupine herd and the central Arctic \nherd. There are significant differences between the two herds, but, \naccording to industry, the basic features of the ecology are similar. \nIndustry publications boast that the central Arctic herd caribou are \nhealthy and increasing in the Prudhoe Bay region, and that oil \ndevelopment has not adversely affected caribou. Opponents of drilling \nbelieve otherwise.\n  Reasonable people can and do differ on this point. However, this \nrecent study raises some serious questions as to the health of the \ncentral Arctic herd. More importantly, the fact that the herd is \ndeclining on those lands where there is current oil and gas \ndevelopment, raises critical questions about the effects of proposed \noil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Environmentalists have contended that the effects will be severe to \nthe caribou herd. This survey suggests that they may be right. The \nAnchorage Daily News article cites recent research by a University of \nAlaska Fairbanks biologist, which found that caribou living near the \noil fields have far fewer calves.\n  And, a Federal Arctic National Wildlife Refuge biologist is \nparaphrased as saying:\n\n       If oil activity is to blame, such impacts would be \n     magnified in the wildlife refuge. There, the porcupine herd \n     is much larger--about 150,000 animals--but there is less \n     coastal habitat and the calving grounds are much smaller.\n\n  Mr. President, when the Senate votes on the fate of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, every Member should put politics aside and \nvote on facts. This report is serious. We ought not take a chance on \nthe pristine ecosystem and its wildlife by drilling in ANWR.\n  I ask that the text of the article be printed in the Record.\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Oct. 21, 1995]\n\n      Oil Field Caribou Decline--State Finds Fewer in Arctic Herd\n\n                          (By Steve Rinehart)\n\n       A new state caribou survey has found a sharp decline in the \n     Central Arctic caribou herd, which ranges in and around the \n     Prudhoe Bay oil fields.\n       State and federal biologists said they don't know what \n     caused the decline but said it could have been brought on by \n     interference from the oil fields, or by some unknown natural \n     cause. In any case, the caribou count released late Friday by \n     the Alaska Department of Fish and Game may strengthen \n     arguments against opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     just east of Prudhoe to oil drilling.\n       The effect of oil development on caribou is one of the core \n     issues in the statewide and national debate over drilling in \n     ANWR. There, the much larger Porcupine caribou herd calves in \n     areas that are thought to be hot oil prospects.\n       The Central Arctic herd has dropped from about 23,400 \n     animals in 1992, the most recent prior survey, to about \n     18,100 this summer, according to the count released late \n     Friday. Low calf production brought on by undernourished cows \n     is thought to be the cause of that 23 percent decline, but \n     the reasons behind it are not known, according to state Fish \n     and Game biologist Ken Whitten of Fairbanks, who conducted \n     the survey.\n       However, Whitten said, almost all of the decline has \n     occurred in that part of the herd that ranges near the oil \n     fields. It could be due to noise, traffic or some other \n     disruption of caribou grazing, or to some natural cycle, \n     he said.\n       The department's first accurate count, coinciding with the \n     early days of oil production in 1978, placed the herd at \n     about 6,000 animals. The herd more than doubled in the next \n     five years, then climbed steadily to its peak.\n       The most recent survey was scheduled to be conducted in \n     1994, but was delayed until this year by bad weather. In a \n     memo dated Friday, Whitten said the census was based on \n     ``high quality'' aerial photographs taken July 15.\n       ``Weather conditions and carbou behavior were ideal for the \n     photo-census effort,'' Whitten wrote. ``It is unlikely that \n     many caribou were missed.''\n       The kind of change noticed in the Central herd is not \n     extraordinary for cribou, Whitten said in an interview. ``The \n     fact that it is happening around the oil field is what is \n     drawing attention,'' Whitten said.\n       Biologists for the major oil producers could not be reached \n     for comment Friday evening. However, at a wildlife conference \n     in Fairbanks this summer, before the census was completed, \n     British Petroleum scientist Chris Herlugson said his \n     observations indicate the Central Arctic caribou may benefit \n     from some oil field improvements.\n       Thousands of caribou ``come right into the fields on sunny, \n     calm days when the mosquitoes and flies are abundant,'' he \n     said at the time, ``Those gravel roads and pads will provide \n     a little bit of relief.''\n       Arco spokesman Ronnie Chappell said his company would \n     ``delay comment until we have had an opportunity to talk to \n     the biologists who conducted the census.''\n       Fran Mauer, a federal Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     biologist who has worked with state Fish and Game on caribou \n     studies, said he was not surprised by the findings. Recent \n     research by a University of Alaska Fairbanks biologist found \n     that caribou living near the oil fields have far fewer \n     calves, he said.\n       ``There are a myriad of potential factors,'' he said, but \n     one part of the census stands out: The part of the Central \n     Arctic herd that keeps away from Prudhoe has not suffered \n     near as much decline,\n       If oil activity is to blame, he said, such impacts would be \n     magnified in the wildlife refuge. There, the Porcupine herd \n     is much larger--about 150,000 animals--but there is less \n     coastal habitat and the calving grounds are much smaller, he \n     said.\n       The census got plenty of attention late Friday. For, \n     although the biological significance of the new caribou count \n     is uncertain, the political weight may be considerable.\n       In lobbying to open ANWR to drilling, the Knowles \n     administration, the oil industry and development groups have \n     made much of the fact that the Central herd has grown \n     dramatically during the 20-year history of Prudhoe Bay. \n     Oil exploration ``will not hurt the wildlife or the \n     land,'' declared an advertisement in a Washington, D.C., \n     newspaper this week, placed by the state- and industry-\n     funded group Arctic Power.\n       The new census does not contradict that, said Arctic Power \n     director Debbie Reinwand.\n       ``We could still say that the number of caribou have \n     tripled since Prudhoe Bay,'' she said. ``I think if (oil \n     development) was going to hurt the caribou we would have seen \n     it in that 20-year period.''\n       She said she did not think the new information would sway \n     Congress, which is days away from voting on a major budget \n     bill that includes the ANWR drilling provision.\n       ANWR drilling opponents, though, said the census supports \n     their arguments, and could affect the debate.\n       ``It makes an opening for people to listen who were not \n     inclined to listen before,'' said Bob Childers of the \n     Gwich'in Steering Committee, which represents some Interior \n     Alaska Natives who oppose drilling.\n\n[[Page S 15503]]\n\n       ``Senators and congressmen have been assured by everyone \n     that the herd is growing and all is nifty-keen. This raises a \n     caution flag,'' he said.\n       Teri Camery of the Alaska Wilderness League said, ``This \n     demonstrates that oil and wilderness don't mix.'' If the \n     experience of the Central herd is applied to the Porcupine \n     herd, she said, ``we're likely to see an even more severe \n     decline.''\n       ``It is really interesting in that the state has denied \n     there is a conflict between caribou and oil development,'' \n     said Pam Miller of the Alaska Coalition.\n       A spokeswoman for Gov. Tony Knowles, Claire Richardson, \n     said Knowles would not comment until reviewing the report, \n     which was released after the close of business Friday at the \n     request of the Daily News.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15502-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATOR BILL BRADLEY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute today to our \ncolleague Bill Bradley, who has announced he will be leaving the Senate \nfollowing the conclusion of his term. He will indeed be missed, as \nSenator Bradley's tenure in this body has been one of true \nstatesmanship and outstanding public service.\n  Mr. President, a Renaissance Man is, in this day and age, a rare \nindividual. Not many people distinguish themselves in numerous and \nvarying pursuits. But Bill Bradley is one such person. From his \nacademic record, to his Olympic basketball competition and \nprobasketball career with the New York Knicks, to his service here in \nthe Senate, Bill Bradley has excelled in every endeavor.\n  Here in the Senate, Bill Bradley has shown himself to be an \ninsightful thinker and policymaker, painstakingly studying the nuts and \nbolts of many ideas far before the pundits and the politicians \nrecognized an issue's prominence. He has persistently worked with \ncolleagues to facilitate agreement, standing tall--quite literally--\neven when his ideas were unpopular.\n  The 1986 tax overhaul was one such time. For more than 4 years, Bill \nBradley labored to construct the tax law that still governs most of our \npresent Tax Code. At first, many dismissed his plan, but Senator \nBradley's persistence paid off, and it eventually gained momentum. \nalthough we disagreed over the substance of that plan, I admire and \nrespect Senator Bradley's perseverance in crafting it.\n  More recently, I was pleased to work with Senator Bradley in support \nof NAFTA. An unyielding proponent of free trade, Bill Bradley and I \nserved on a small group that worked within both the House and Senate to \nbring about passage of that important trade agreement. As I'm sure he \nremembers, that was no easy task. But, with Senator Bradley on the \nteam, I was confident as we buckled down to do that job that we would \nsucceed, and we did.\n  But, Mr. President, this body and this country have also reaped the \nbenefits, of Bill Bradley's lesser-known contributions. Senator Bradley \nunderstood that encouraging democracy in the former Soviet Union would \nrequire United States involvement and argued vehemently for both aid \ndollars and cultural exchanges. He has championed legislation to expand \naccess to college education, including direct lending for student loans \nand the Student Right-to-Know Act. And he has been an ardent supporter \nof civil rights, strongly supporting affirmative action while \ndenouncing racism and race-biting. These few examples illustrate but \nsmall battles in the larger fight for freedom and equality in which \nBill Bradley has been engaged throughout his career.\n  And that, Mr. President, will be Bill Bradley's legacy. We may not be \nable to retire his jersey in tribute, but we have a long string of \nimpressive legislative accomplishments by which to remember him. Bill \nBradley has been as skillfully aggressive on the Senate floor as he was \non the basketball court. Whether a member of the New York Knicks or the \nU.S. Senate, Bill Bradley has constructed the game plans, covered the \ncourt, and could be relied upon when he went to the line. His \ncontributions to the Senate have earned him a reputation as one of our \nmost valuable players, and I wish him the very best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15503-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF REUBEN ``RUBY'' COHEN\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, a candle went out late one night recently \nat the Bangor Rye Bread Co. as Reuben ``Ruby'' Cohen--father of my \nfriend and colleague Senator Bill Cohen--passed away while working late \nat night in the bakery he founded and owned.\n  I was deeply saddened to learn of his passing, and my thoughts are \nwith his wife Clara, his three children and his seven grandchildren. \nRuby was laid to rest in his beloved town of Bangor with many friends \nand family members at his side. I joined them to bid my own farewells \nto this remarkable American.\n  Ruby Cohen was an exceptional human being by living his life in a \ntraditional manner: he worked hard, he worked late, he held strong \nvalues, and he raised a family.\n  But these are traits that have made Ruby Cohen a legend in Bangor.\n  At age 86, he had seen it all. The First World War, the Great \nDepression, the Second World War, the cold war, Korea and Vietnam, \nKennedy and King, Nixon in China, Reagan in Russia, and the fall of the \nIron Curtain.\n  To Ruby Cohen, what mattered were the timeless ideals of hard work, \ngood business, a strong family, and straight, honest talk.\n  And he lived it to the hilt. He worked 18 hours a day, 6 days a week, \nfor 70 years. His days began as everyone else's day was ending. And \neven when everyone else's day was beginning, Ruby was on the road \ndelivering bagels, rye bread, French bread, Italian sandwich bread, \nand--last but certainly not least--his trademark Cohen rolls.\n  That diversity of his produce was matched only by the ethnic collage \nfor which Bangor is known. Ruby Cohen himself was a product of \nimmigrants who hailed from Russia, and married an Irish girl named \nClara in 1937. His accomplishments and his stamina shine brightly as \nyet another example of the rich foundation millions of immigrants and \ntheir children have laid down for future generations.\n  As was always the case with his father and then with his children, \nwork at Ruby Cohen's bakery was nothing short of a family affair right \nup until his very last day.\n  In January 1989, I was honored to be a part of an 80th birthday \ncelebration party for Reuben Cohen in the Queen City--Bangor. As \nalways, time spent with Ruby was full of laughs, smiles, and stories \nabout his wit and his candor--all of which will be sorely missed by us \nall.\n  His son and their senior Senator from Maine, Bill Cohen, said \nyesterday that is father ``worked to live and lived to work''. In the \nprocess, Reuben Cohen added light and color to the lives of so many of \nus who knew him, so many of us who took pride in being able to call him \n``Ruby''.\n  There is a richness by which you can measure the success of one's \nlife. It can be found in the satisfied love and companionship of your \nspouse, the abiding love of your children, and in the admiration and \nfriendship of those who have known you across the years. By all these \nmeasures and so many others, Reuben Cohen was a very rich man.\n  Ruby, we know you are still putting in those late hours--only in a \ndifferent place. But it just won't be the same without you. God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15503-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15503-S15504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HARRY KIZIRIAN\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, later in the evening or possibly tomorrow \nthe Senate will approve H.R. 1606, a bill to name the post office at 24 \nCorliss Street in Providence, RI after a renowned Rhode Islander and a \nproud American--Harry Kizirian. Senator Pell and I introduced the bill \nearlier this year, and Representatives Jack Reed and Patrick Kennedy \nintroduced identical legislation in the House of Representatives, which \nalso has been approved.\n  I greatly appreciate the help of Senator Stevens, chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service, in \nhelping to obtain approval of our proposal in an expeditious manner.\n  Harry Kizirian is a household name in Rhode Island because of his \nlifelong career in the Postal Service but, even more so, because of his \ninvolvement with and commitment to his community. He has served on the \nboard of directors of Butler Hospital, Big Brothers of Rhode Island, \nthe Providence \n\n[[Page S 15504]]\n\n  Human Relations Commission, Rhode Island Blue Cross, and the Rhode \nIsland Heart and Lung Associations.\n  Over the years he has earned countless awards and citations for his \ncommunity involvement. He was inducted into the Rhode Island Hall of \nFame and received the Roger Williams Award. He served on advisory \nboards for Rhode Island College, Providence Heritage Commission on R.I. \nMedal of Honor Recipients, the Disabled American Veterans, and the \nMarine Corps League.\n  The lessons learned from Harry Kizirian are lessons of fortitude, \nvalor, strength of character, and perseverance.\n  While Harry was just a boy in school, at Mt. Pleasant High School in \nProvidence, he went to work part time as a postal clerk. He was 15 \nyears old and his father had died, so Harry took responsibility for \nsupporting his family. He did so while keeping his grades up and \nparticipating in athletics. Twenty years later, at 35, Harry was named \npostmaster of Rhode Island, a position he held for more than 25 years.\n  Like many young men at the time, Harry's job was interrupted by World \nWar II. The day after high school graduation Harry enlisted in the \nMarine Corps. He fought on Okinawa with the 6th Marine Division. He was \nawarded the Navy Cross--the second highest honor a marine can receive--\nfor his valor on Okinawa.\n  Harry and a group of marines were pinned down by a Japanese machine \ngunner. Harry got up and ran toward the machine gun. He was shot in the \nlegs. Despite his injuries, he pulled himself forward and eliminated \nthe enemy position. This extraordinary act of valor sent Harry \nKizirian, a teenage boy, to a hospital in Guam with the Navy Cross, a \nBronze Star, and a Purple Heart with a gold star.\n  Harry Kizirian was seen by millions of Americans as the face of the \nwar in the Pacific. Before he was injured, a news photographer captured \nhis image, the image of a boy in battle, for the cover of the New York \nTimes Sunday magazine. Last November, I was present when Harry was \nhonored by his old Atwood-Bucci Detachment of the Marine Corps. The \nfamous photograph was prominently displayed on the podium.\n  After the war, Harry returned to Providence and to his job at the \npost office. He was a substitute clerk. By 1954 he was made foreman. He \nwas named assistant superintendent during the transition from the old \npostal system to the turnkey mechanization system. The Providence post \noffice on Corliss Street was the first post office in the country to \nuse the turnkey system. The turnkey system was the first fully \nautomated system for sorting the mail. Until that point, all of the \nmail was sorted by hand. The new system was not easily implemented, but \nonce again Harry rose to the challenge. In 1961, Harry was rewarded for \nhis hard work and dedication. He was named postmaster of Rhode Island.\n  What better way to honor the life and lessons of Harry Kizirian than \nto name the post office of Corliss Street for him. I am delighted that \nthe Senate has voted unanimously to name our historic post office in \nProvidence ``The Harry Kizirian Post Office Building.'' Again, many \nthanks to Senators Stevens and Pryor for their help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15503-3", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing Federal debt, now about \n$25 billion shy of $5 trillion, has been fueled for a generation by \nbureaucratic hot air; (sort of like a hot air balloon whirling out of \ncontrol), which everybody has talked about, but almost nobody even \ntried to fix. That attitude began to change, however, immediately after \nthe November 1994 elections.\n  The 104th Congress promised to hold true to the Founding Fathers' \ndecree that the executive branch of the U.S. Government should never be \nable to spend a dime unless and until it had been authorized and \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress--money supplied by the approximately \n61.4 percent Americans who pay Federal income taxes, according to the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  So, when the new 104th Congress convened this past January, the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives quickly approved a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. On the Senate side, all but 1 of the 54 \nRepublican Senators supported the balanced budget amendment.\n  That was the good news. The bad news was that only 13 Democrat \nSenators supported it, and that killed the balanced budget amendment \nfor the time being. Since a two-thirds vote--67 Senators, if all \nSenators are present--is necessary to approve a constitutional \namendment, the proposed Senate amendment failed by one vote. There will \nbe another vote during the 104th Congress.\n  Here is today's bad debt boxscore:\n  As of the close of business Monday, October 23, the Federal debt--\ndown to the penny--stood at exactly $4,974,119,827,892.07 or $18,881.84 \non a per capita basis for every man, woman, and child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15504-1", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15504-S15505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, am I the one holding the Senate up here \nnow? I do not want to do that. I thought there was something else to \ndo, because I would very much like you to go home also, Mr. President.\n  I want to say how grateful I am, however, that 12 Members of the \nBudget Committee started this battle for a balanced budget January and \nFebruary and March of this year. They have stuck together. They \nproduced a very exciting budget resolution for America's future. It had \na real chance for the first time of making America's Government decide \nthat you could not just spend willy-nilly on anything that anybody \nwanted, but that you had to stop spending beyond what you were taking \nin in taxes so our children will have a future, so they will not be \npaying our bills.\n  This afternoon, after an hour and a half of debate, 12 Republican \nSenators, in spite of all of the talk across this land, much of it \noverstating the case on the Democrat side, voted aye to bring that \nbudget resolution not only to the Senate, but to the American people.\n  Sometimes it is hard to explain the future. Everybody would like to \ntalk about now. Or they would like to talk about the past. But I do not \nthink you can be a leader and not talk about the future--especially \nwhen it is not 100 years. That may be too far for any of us. But the \nnext 10, 15 years are going to bring absolute chaos to the U.S. money \nsupply, to the value of our dollar, to interest rates and to our \nstandard of living if we do not stop spending what we do not have.\n  So we are sending a very good message tonight that we are proud, \nvery, very proud that our committee has put together this package which \nwill get the American budget moving downward in a permanent manner. I \nsubmit, in the next few days, as we debate each component, you should \nnot be frightened to death by those prophets of gloom who, I believe, \nare thinking in the present and trying to frighten you about the \npresent while they hide their eyes and their minds from 10 years from \nnow, when some of our children are going to be in this society.\n  I close by saying we are very pleased the American Revolution--not \nthe one we are involved in now, the one that started with the Boston \nTea Party--was built on a premise that is absolutely sound: No taxation \nwithout representation.\n\n  What we are doing with deficit spending is taxing the next \ngeneration, taxing the teenagers--taxing everybody that cannot vote, \nexcluding generations yet unborn. We are taxing them without any \nrepresentation for they cannot vote, and we are saying we are going to \nput more burden on your shoulders, on your brains, and on your \nproductivity. You are going to just have to pay all these bills even \nthough you did not get to vote. That is the issue.\n  Then a second issue is: Are the reductions fair? Mr. President, I \nsuggest that the seniors of America, before they get so concerned and \nfrightened by those who want everybody to worry about today and the \nstatus quo and no change, let us present our Medicare in its totality. \nAnd you are going to find that it is very fair. There will be some \nseniors who have money--more than Social Security--$50,000, and even \nmore, will have to pay a little more for Medicare. But that is not \nreally unfair. \n\n[[Page S 15505]]\nWhen we unfold it and show you precisely what it is, it is very, very \nfair.\n  So, as we look at this, we want to insert a new word in the \nvocabulary of those who represent America. And that is what we can \nafford, not what we can promise--not what we have already promised, and \nnot what we feel compelled to continue giving to people because they \nneed, they want it, and they contend they cannot do without. Our \nposition is we cannot do that unless we can pay for it. It is not too \ncomplicated for average folks. They are doing that every day in the \nUnited States. It is time we do it. That is what that budget resolution \nis going to do.\n  I thank the Chair for yielding time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might for just a moment respond \nto the statement of the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, \non which I sit.\n  I hear the intonation that we are trying to take care of our budget \nresponsibilities so that our children in the future have not sacrificed \ntheir opportunities, that they have not been burdened with debt--and so \nthe story goes--because of expenditures like Medicare and Medicaid.\n  But, Mr. President, are we burdening our children when we spend more \non defense than was requested by the President, or is necessary in the \njudgment of many to preserve the strength of our military? Are we \nburdening our children, our future generations, Mr. President, when we \ngive sweetheart leases for mineral development in the West, when there \nis a recent story about a sale for something less than $10,000 for a \npiece of property that can produce $1 billion worth of ore recovery? Do \nwe burden our children when we give tax breaks to people of substantial \nmeans, when we give $20,000 to someone who earns $350,000? I think that \nis a darned burden for our children. I really do.\n  So the only response to the growing deficit is not simply to put a \ndagger in the hearts of Medicare, or to deprive Medicaid recipients of \ntheir sustenance in many cases for life.\n  So that is just to set the record clear from this Senator's vantage \npoint, Mr. President. I know that we are close to, as they say, closing \nshop for the day. The distinguished Senator from Mississippi is on the \nfloor, and is in the chair. I shall relinquish the floor to the \nMississippi delegation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, perhaps we should vote since this is an all-\nMississippi presence at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/10/23/senate-section/article/S15504-2", "month": "10", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
