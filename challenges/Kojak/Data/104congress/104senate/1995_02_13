Halverson, Jr., of \nArlington, VA, offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray:\n  As we bow in prayer, in anticipation of St. Valentine's Day and of a \nburdensome schedule, let us reflect upon those we love most: our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  The story is told about Charles Francis Adams (1807-1886), son of \nJohn Quincy Adams and a successful politician, that on a certain day \nCharles entered these words into his diary: ``Went fishing with my \nson--a day wasted.'' His son, Brooks Adams (1838-1918) also kept a \ndiary, and on that same day, Brooks made this entry: ``Went fishing \nwith my father--the most wonderful day of my life!'' (Obtained from \nFran Woods, Washington Fly Fishing Club).\n  Our Heavenly Father, as we consider this ``most wonderful, wasted \nday'' of a father spending time with his son, we recall the final words \nof the Old Testament which declare: ``Behold, I will send you Elijah \nthe prophet *** and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the \nchildren, and the heart of the children to their fathers ***''--Malachi \n4:5, 6. And the New Testament which says, ``*** where your treasure is, \nthere will your heart be also.''--Matthew 6:21.\n  Lord, we confess that sometimes we do not treasure our children as we \nought, and sometimes our heart is more with our achievements than with \nour descendants. Often, those we most love, we most neglect.\n  We pray, therefore, in the midst of demanding schedules, that Thou \nwouldst graciously turn our hearts to our children and grandchildren, \nwith Valentines of time not wasted.\n  In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2533-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the information of Members, following \nthe time for the two leaders, which will be reserved, there will be a \nperiod for morning business not to extend beyond 1 o'clock with \nSenators permitted to speak for not to exceed 10 minutes each. At 1 \no'clock we will resume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment and the pending Reid \namendment.\n  At 5 o'clock today, there will be a rollcall vote on adopting the \ncommittee funding resolution, Senate Resolution 73. Further rollcall \nvotes are possible today. We have not made that determination yet. We \nare trying to get an agreement to have some of those votes tomorrow \nmorning to accommodate some Senators who are necessarily absent. We are \nnot going to accommodate those who are just absent. But there are some \nnecessarily absent. I think we can understand that on Mondays and \nFridays we will have votes, and anybody who is not here on Monday and \nFriday will just take that risk. Certainly they have a right to do \nthat.\n  I also hope that we can bring to a conclusion the debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment. We have been on it for 2 straight weeks. \nThere has been no effort on this side to slow down the debate. We spent \nhours and hours and days and days on a couple of amendments. My view is \nthat it is time that we bring this to a conclusion.

Mr. President, I rise to be one of the first to speak \nabout some things that happened 50 years ago which were a part of our \nfreedom and a part of our history. So I am pleased to do that.\n  Mr. President, on this date 50 years ago, one of the most powerful \narmadas ever assembled in American military history prepared to depart \nSaipan in the Mariana Islands. Their destination was a tiny, 8-square-\nmile piece of volcanic sand and rock in the Western Pacific--Iwo Jima.\n  The importance of capturing Iwo Jima was its strategic location, \nalmost midway between Japan and the recently captured Mariana Islands. \nSince the summer of 1944, the Japanese home \n[[Page S2534]] islands had been reeling from strikes by the new, long-\nrange American B-29 bombers, operating from Saipan and Tinian. Iwo \nJima, with its three air-fields, would be a vital fighter escort \nstation if captured. In addition, it would serve as a sanctuary for \ncrippled bombers returning from their strikes on Japan.\n  No American planner contemplating the assault and seizure of this \nisland suggested that taking Iwo Jima would be an easy task. To meet \nthe challenge, Fleet Adm. Chester W. Nimitz assembled a veteran Navy-\nMarine Corps team, which included the largest force of U.S. marines \never committed to a single battle--a force which eventually totaled \nmore than 80,000 men--a majority of whom were veterans of earlier \nPacific battles. These troops were arguably the most proficient \namphibious force the world had yet seen. On February 13, 1945, this \nformidable armada of American firepower and might prepared to embark on \na mission that would move America one giant step closer to final \nvictory.\n  I think it is appropriate that we remember those men and women who \ngave so much to ensure that we could continue to have freedom and peace \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, if I may, since there seems to be no one else asking \nfor time, I would like to comment a little on the balanced budget \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2533-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2534-S2535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise, as I have in the past, to support \nthe balanced budget amendment. I believe strongly that it is the right \nthing to do. I believe strongly that it is the only way that we are \ngoing to be able to achieve some kind of financial balance in our \nGovernment, to achieve some kind of responsibility for not spending \nmore than we take in.\n  So I rise to share my impressions of what has gone on here for the \npast 2 weeks, and apparently at least for another week. I am new to the \nSenate. I am very pleased and proud, of course, to be here to represent \nthe people of Wyoming. But I am, I must say, a little bit disappointed \nin the lack of progress that we have made.\n  It seems to me that, in some instances, we have not really had an in-\ndepth debate of issues, but rather a sort of a slowing of the process, \ntalking about what seems, at least to me, to be peripheral issues often \nas the method of establishing a rationale for voting ``no'' on an issue \nthat those who argue against have no intention of voting for at all.\n  It is fairly easy to examine the status of the record of performance \nthat leads to this issue coming before the Senate which leads to a \nconsideration of the balanced budget amendment. Certainly, history does \nthat. You cannot change history. You can interpret it, I suppose, and \nspin it. But the fact is that we have not balanced the budget, this \nCongress has not balanced the budget for some 26 years. Only four or \nfive times out of 50 years has the budget been balanced. That is not a \ngood record, but it is indeed a record.\n  Some talk a lot about the efforts that have been made over the last 3 \nyears to do something about the deficit. And, indeed, there has been \nsomething done and it has been good. Starting with the last budget of \nPresident Bush and on through the next 2 years, there have been some \nreductions. The fact is, however, that the reductions now are not \nthere. They are not in this budget. They are not proposed for the next \nyear's budget and, indeed, beyond the year 2000, there would not be a \nreduction in the deficit, but the national debt would continue to grow.\n  It is also true that much of the reduction was a one-time \nreadjustment in terms of spending on savings and loans, in terms of \nspending on Medicaid, and what the reduction was, a direct result of \nwhat this Congress did, was an increase in taxes. So I am certainly \npleased that this deficit has been reduced, but I am not pleased with \nthe fact that it is now scheduled to go up, unless we do something \ndifferent.\n  The cost of the imbalance, the cost of these years of not balancing \nthe budget, are extremely high. We have now approximately a $260 \nbillion line item in this year's budget to pay interest on the debt. If \nit were not for the interest on the debt, this year's budget would be \nbalanced. But there is an interest of $260 billion, probably the third \nlargest line item in the budget and continuing to go up.\n  Spending has gone up every year. When we read about the budget, we \noften read in our hometown paper that the President makes the cuts. Of \ncourse, there are some cuts, but the fact is the total spending \ncontinues to go up; this year, 5.5 percent over last year. So we \ncontinue to have larger Government, spending goes up.\n  Fortunately, revenues go up as well. But we have not been able to \nbring the two together. We have not been able to be responsible, both \nmorally and fiscally, with this budget. Clearly, we need to do \nsomething different.\n  You cannot continue to do the same thing you have been doing over the \nyears and expect there to be a different result.\n  What is the opposition? Some say, ``Don't change the Constitution. \nThe Founders did not draft it that way and we should not change it.''\n  Of course, changing the Constitution is not something we take \nlightly. The process does not allow for it to be taken lightly. It \nrequires a two-thirds majority of both Houses of this Congress. It \nrequires that it be ratified by the State legislatures and in fact be \nratified by the people. The Founders did not include it. However, \nThomas Jefferson said that if he had had the opportunity to make one \nchange, it would have been limiting the amount of debt that the Federal \nGovernment could undertake.\n  The Founders also did not have a $20,000 per person debt to deal \nwith, which we do now. Each of us in this country has a $20,000 debt, \nin terms of the national debt.\n  The Founders did not have a huge Federal Government to deal with. The \nFounders, I believe it is fair to say, thought that this would be a \nfederation of States in which the basic spending responsibility, the \nbasic decisionmaking responsibility for most things in this Government, \nwould be done by the States. They did not envision the kind of Federal \nGovernment that we have now.\n  Some say judges will make the decisions on the budget. I do not think \nthere is a basis for that. Forty-eight States have balanced budgets in \ntheir legislatures. My own State of Wyoming has a balanced budget in \nthe constitution that says they shall not borrow more than 1 percent of \nthe value of the revenues. Judges do not do our budget. The legislature \nknows that they have to bring spending within revenues. And they do it.\n  Some say it will not work because the States have capital budgets. \nThey do not all have capital budgets. Furthermore, even if you do have \na capital budget, like you and I might have and have loans on our homes \nto pay, we still have to balance between our revenue, our budget, and \nour debt service. And we do not do that in the Federal Government.\n  So these arguments really are to define, I think, a philosophy. And \nthere is a basic difference. There is a basic difference in philosophy \nand it is a legitimate difference. There are those who believe that \nGovernment should be big, it should spend more, it should be involved \nin more activity.\n  Some of us, including myself, believe that it should be smaller; that \nit should be limited. Those who seek larger Government would naturally \noppose the balanced budget amendment. Those of us who think there \nshould be some control, that Government is too big, that Government is \ntoo expensive, believe that a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is the tool that we need to make it work.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we do move forward. It seems to me \nthat we came here to undertake this task of resolving this question, \nregardless of the outcome. It seems to me that we do have a \nresponsibility to vote. We have a responsibility to make the decisions. \nIt is not an easy one. People see it differently. There is a legitimate \ndifference of view.\n  But the idea of just continuing to string it out, I think, is not \nbeneficial for us and is not beneficial for the country. We have to \nbite the bullet and do it, and I think the time is now.\n  [[Page S2535]] I rise in support of a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I have often said in the Chamber, \nparticularly quite recently in the last couple of weeks, Micron, a \nsemiconductor manufacturing company in Idaho, is selecting a site to \nbuild a computer chip manufacturing facility. One of the thirteen \nlocations under consideration around the country is the city of Butte; \nthat is, Butte, MT.\n  Access to affordable, efficient transportation is vital to the \neconomic viability of any business. We all know that. American \nsemiconductors in particular are the world's best. They need access. \nMicron sells chips all over the United States, also in countries like \nSingapore and Taiwan in East Asia and to the United Kingdom and Germany \nin Europe.\n  To reach all of these places, a modern company needs top quality \ntransportation. And it may be surprising, but few places in America are \nbetter connected to world markets than Butte. Butte is sited at the \njuncture of two interstates, I-90 and I-15, interstates which \nrespectively tie the east coast and the Great Lakes to the ports in \nCalifornia and Seattle.\n  This map shows, if you can see it, the two interstates, again I-90 \neast-west, I-15 north-south, the juncture in Butte, the only place in \nMontana where interstates cross like that.\n  Butte also is at the site of the interstates which connect Canada and \nDenver, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, and ultimately Mexico City, \nthat is, north-south. It has a top quality, modern airport. It is \nserved by two continental railroads. In this era of consolidation, that \nis unusual, Mr. President, but two continental railroads join in Butte; \nthat is, the Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern.\n  And then we have the port of Montana, obviously, located in Butte. It \nis one of the Nation's first inland ports. Director of Marketing Bill \nFogarty has made the port one of the finest intermodal facilities. Its \naccess to transportation expands the markets for Montana's businesses \nand products.\n\n\n                    Montana's Transportation History\n\n  Mr. President, all of this is no accident. It is no coincidence. \nMontanans have always known how important transportation is to a \ncompetitive business. As far back as Butte's mining boom and beyond, \nMontana has a long history of providing transportation options--options \nsuch as well-maintained highways, railroads, and airports.\n  As a testament of Montana's ``can do'' attitude, get this, camels--\nyes, camels--were brought to Montana in the summer of 1865 in an \nattempt to secure an economic and reliable source of transportation--\ncamels back in 1865. And while camels did not prove the best solution \nto our transportation challenges, we in Montana have managed to \nintegrate virtually all other kinds of transportation into our economy.\n  Historians cite 1841 as the date the first wagons were driven into \nMontana from the Southwest. Not long afterward, mule trains were \nbringing goods into and out of Montana. The mule trains needed roads to \ncross the rugged frontier, and one of the first routes in the State was \nauthorized by U.S. Secretary of War John Floyd in 1858. The Mullan \nMilitary Wagon Road from Fort Walla in Washington to Fort Benton in \nMontana was constructed to transport troops and was completed in 1860.\n  I might add, Mr. President, my great grandfather, Henry Sieben, drove \nwagon trains on that Fort Mullan Trail. In fact, that was his line of \nbusiness and that is how he got his start in the State of Montana.\n  By the time the wagon road was finished, the gold mining boom had \nbegun. Discovery of mines in Idaho and Montana meant that we needed a \nshortcut from the Oregon Trail to the mines.\n  Well, in the spring of 1863, John Bozeman, a Georgian who migrated to \nMontana, teamed with a man named John Jacobs to build such a short road \nthat is called the Bozeman Road.\n  Mr. President, these early roads were nothing like the blacktops we \ndrive on today. In fact, one road was even described by travelers as \n``50 miles long and 1 inch deep, according to the corroborative \nevidence of lungs and linen.''\n  But travel by land was not limited to roads. The first railroad to \nreach Montana Territory was the Utah & Northern, later known as the \nUnion Pacific. This railroad was constructed to link business interests \nwith the rich mineral and agricultural areas in Montana. The Utah & \nNorthern built its first railroad bed in March of 1880. It continued \nbuilding until it reached Silver Bow, a few miles west of Butte, on \nDecember 21, 1881.\n  Aviation secured an early place in the transportation system of \nMontana. Montana's first airline was the National Parks Airlines, which \nwas founded in 1927 and offered service to Butte, Helena, Great Falls, \nand Salt Lake City.\n  And I might add there, my grandfather, Fred Sheriff, had a Ford \ntrimotor and founded airports in Montana and worked very hard to get \nhigh quality aviation to Montana. Amelia Earhart spent much time in \nMontana, and I very much remember a photograph of my grandfather and \nAmelia Earhart when she was in Montana helping us to establish the \nhighest quality aviation in our State.\n\n\n                   Micron and Montana Transportation\n\n  Mr. President, Montana has a long, proud history of efficient and \nproductive transportation, and that history continues today in Butte.\n  We operate in a global economy these days, however, and the \nintermodal transportation partnership found in Butte will increase the \nproductivity of Micron and lower the transportation costs to ship their \nproducts. This will improve the marketability of Micron's products and \nmake it more competitive throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Chamber several times now \ndescribing the unique virtues of Montana and of Butte. Montana is a \nvast State. It is a beautiful State. As Micron prepares to make a final \ndecision on the location of its new facility, I would like to end with \na quote from an essay by Glenn Law, entitled ``More Than Skin Deep.'' \nAnd I quote:\n\n       Montana's special gift is space, landscape made personal; \n     space that reaches out to horizons and comes back and gets \n     under your skin. It reaches inward, wraps itself around your \n     soul, incubates and grows. When you finally begin to \n     understand just what it is about Montana that is important to \n     you, it has already taken root in your heart and you'll never \n     be the same.\n\n  Mr. President, when Micron comes to Montana, they will understand the \nmeaning of these words. They will never be the same. They will be \nbetter. There is no place in the world like Butte, and we look forward \nto opening our arms, welcoming Micron to Butte.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2535-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2535-S2536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GLEN WOODARD\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Florida and America have lost a big-\nhearted \n[[Page S2536]] man who worked hard to make his State and his Nation \nbetter: Glen Woodard of Jacksonville, FL.\n  Mr. Woodard was 77 when he died late last month in Jacksonville after \na long illness. A vice president at Winn-Dixie Stores, Mr. Woodard was \n``the last of a breed,'' his friend Bill Birchfield said admiringly.\n  Mr. President, I submit the following eulogy to Glen Woodard, \ndelivered by Robert O. Aders in Jacksonville on January 28, 1995:\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                         Eulogy to Glen Woodard\n\n   (By Robert O. Aders, President Emeritus, Food Marketing Institute)\n\n       Glen, it is an honor to be invited to eulogize you. It is \n     not the first time that I or others have praised you in \n     public but it is the first time you won't have the last word. \n     I speak on behalf of myself and Tabitha and your other close \n     friends in the industry that you have served so well for so \n     many years--on behalf of your many associates in FMI and \n     other groups in Washington and the State capitols with whom \n     you have worked to improve the food system and the \n     supermarket industry--to improve the quality of government--\n     and to improve the relationships between industry and \n     government--in order to better serve the public. We have \n     enjoyed considerable success in all these things and you have \n     truly left your mark. You have made a difference. And today \n     we celebrate your life.\n       We all lead our lives on many levels--our home, our church, \n     our country, daily work, recreation. So did Glen Woodard. I \n     would like to say a few words on behalf of those who knew him \n     mostly in his Washington life, that part of his Winn-Dixie \n     career where some of us in this room were his extended \n     family. Glen was born in Washington, D.C.--says so in the \n     Jacksonville newspaper so it must be true. But Glen always \n     denied that. He didn't want to be a Washington insider. \n     Instead Glen told a Supermarket News reporter who asked where \n     he was born:\n       ``Born in North Georgia in 1917, RFD 1, Clermont. Go out \n     from Gainesville, turn left at Quillens store, going toward \n     the Wahoo Church, and then past there up toward Dahlonega. We \n     lived there till the Grand Jury met--then moved to Florida.''\n       My friendship with Glen goes back a long way. We both \n     joined the supermarket industry 38 years ago. In 1957 Glen \n     joined Winn-Dixie and I joined Kroger--he as a lobbyist, I as \n     a lawyer.\n       These were the good old days of smaller government but it \n     was growing and soon Kroger decided to form a government \n     relations department. I was chosen to do it. We were going to \n     lobby and all I knew about that was what you had to go \n     through when you check into a hotel. Then\n      I got lucky. The American Retail Federation was holding a \n     regional conference in Springfield, Illinois, and the \n     already-famous Glen Woodard was the featured speaker on \n     ``lobbying.'' Glen spoke on the nitty-gritty of working \n     with government--the day-to-day task of dealing with small \n     problems so they don't get big--the same way we all deal \n     with our family and business problems. He spoke on the \n     day-to-day things that government does, wittingly or \n     unwittingly, that impose a great burden on business. While \n     business is focusing on the big issues we tend to ignore \n     the minor day-to-day interferences that cost us money and \n     slow us down. The title of his speech was repeated at just \n     the right time throughout his presentation, in that \n     patented stentorian voice. It was ``While you are watching \n     out for the eagles you are being pecked to death by the \n     ducks.'' And that was my introduction to the famous Glen \n     Woodard vocabulary and the beginning of a long \n     professional relationship as well as a personal \n     friendship.\n       To Glen, a Congressman or a Senator was always addressed as \n     ``my spiritual advisor.'' Glen Woodard's world was not \n     populated by lawyers, accountants and ordinary citizens but \n     by ``skin 'em and cheat 'ems,'' ``shiny britches,'' and \n     ``snuff dippers.'' These people don't merely get excited, \n     they have ``rollin' of the eyes'' and ``jerkin' of the \n     navel.'' Colorful he was. But Glen needed that light-hearted \n     perspective to survive, for Glen was in the middle of what is \n     now called ``that mess in Washington'' from Presidents \n     Eisenhower to Clinton. Working his contacts, talking to \n     representatives and senators, walking his beat--those endless \n     marble corridors of power--doing as he put it ``the work of \n     the Lord.'' And, indeed, his work affected the law of the \n     land.\n       And, indeed, that work was made a lot more fun for all of \n     us by Glen's marvelous sense of humour and his wonderful \n     delivery. I remember a meeting a few years ago with a top \n     official in the Treasury Department. We had been stymied for \n     years trying to change a ridiculous IRS regulation because of \n     the stubbornness of one particular bureaucrat. One day Glen \n     broke the logjam as follows: ``Jerry, I had occasion to pay \n     you a high compliment when I was with the Chairman of the \n     Ways and Means Committee last week. I said you were just \n     great with numbers. In fact, you're the biggest 2-timin', 4-\n     flushin', SOB I've ever known.'' He got the point and the \n     rule was changed.\n       With all his blunt talk and tough wit, he was a kind and \n     generous man. In fact, my wife described him when she\n      first met him as courtly and gallant. That was at a luncheon \n     at the Grand Ole Opry years ago. My mother was also \n     present and Glen was with his beloved Miss Ann. My mother \n     was so charmed that for the rest of her life she always \n     asked me ``How is that wonderful gentleman from Winn-Dixie \n     that you introduced me to in Nashville.'' Of course, Tab \n     got to know the total Glen over the ensuing years at the \n     many private dinners the three of us enjoyed when Glen was \n     in Washington and had a free evening.\n       Those of us who worked at the Food Marketing Institute \n     during Glen Woodard's career knew the many facets of this \n     fine man. Always with us when we needed him, he was a brother \n     to me and he was Uncle Glen to the young people on the staff.\n       Those young people he mentored over the years--young people \n     now mature--carry the principles and values that he lived and \n     taught. Here are some of them:\n       Integrity--stick to your principles.\n       Strength and toughness--take a position and stand on it.\n       Work ethic--It may not be fun at first. If you work hard \n     enough you'll enjoy it.\n       Responsibility--Take it. Most people duck it.\n       Generosity--Take the blame; share the credit.\n       Reliability--Say what you'll do and then do it.\n       Fairness--It isn't winning if you cheat.\n       And finally, Grace under pressure.\n       On behalf of those young people, Glen, I say you brought a \n     great deal of nobility to our day-to-day lives and you made \n     us feel worthwhile.\n       A few years ago we tricked Glen into coming to a \n     testimonial dinner on his behalf. He thought it was for \n     someone else. The dinner menu was designed especially to \n     Glen's taste. He always said he was sick of over-cooked beef, \n     rubber chicken and livers wrapped in burnt bacon. So we had a \n     Glen Woodard menu prepared at one of the fanciest private \n     clubs in Washington--The F Street Club. Their kitchen staff \n     will never forget it. We had country ham, redeye gravy and \n     biscuits with collard greens. We had cat fish, hush puppies \n     and cole slaw. All the condiments were served in their \n     original containers--ketchup in the bottle, mustard in the \n     jar, and alongside each table a silver ice bucket we had \n     Glen's cheap rose' wine in a screw-top bottle.\n       The FMI staff had prepared a special plaque for this man \n     who already had a wall covered with plaques, but this was \n     different and it expressed how the staff felt about him. It \n     went this way:\n       ``FMI to Glen P. Woodard, The Best There Is\n       ``For nearly 30 years you have served your company and our \n     industry in the area of public affairs with unparalleled \n     skill and devotion. Currently chairman of the FMI Government \n     Relations Committee, recent Chairman of the FMI Fall \n     Conference, untiring laborer in the vineyards of government \n     on behalf of the American food system, you have accomplished \n     mightily for our industry.\n       ``We salute your dedication, your knowledge, your wit and \n     your style. And we treasure your friendship. You are, indeed, \n     The Best There Is. And we love you. Washington, D.C., October \n     22, 1985.''\n       And that still goes Glen, old buddy.\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2535-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2536-S2537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredibly enormous Federal debt is \nlike the weather--everybody talks about it but, up to now, hardly \nanybody has undertaken the responsibility of doing anything about it. \nThe Congress now had better get cracking--time's a-wasting and the debt \nis mushrooming.\n  In the past, a great many politicians talked a good game--when they \nwere back home--about bringing Federal deficits and the Federal debt \nunder control. When they got back to Washington, many of these same \npoliticians regularly voted in support of bloated spending bills that \nrolled through the Senate. The American people took note of that on \nNovember 8.\n  As of Friday, February 10, at the close of business, the Federal debt \nstood--down to the penny--at exactly $4,805,266,970,855.19. This debt, \nremember, was run up by the Congress of the United States.\n  The Founding Fathers decreed that the big-spending bureaucrats in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. Government should never be able to spend \neven a dime unless and until the spending had been authorized and \nappropriated by the U.S. Congress.\n  The U.S. Constitution is quite specific about that, as every school \nboy is supposed to know.\n  And do not be misled by declarations by politicians that the Federal \ndebt was run up by some previous President or another, depending on \nparty affiliation. Sometimes you hear false claims that Ronald Reagan \nran it up; sometimes they play hit-and-run with George Bush.\n  [[Page S2537]] These buck-passing declarations are false, as I said \nearlier, because the Congress of the United States is the culprit. The \nSenate and the House of Representatives are the big-spenders.\n  Mr. President, most citizens cannot conceive of a billion of \nanything, let alone a trillion. It may provide a bit of perspective to \nbear in mind that a billion seconds ago, Mr. President, the Cuban \nMissile Crisis was in progress. A billion minutes ago, the crucifixion \nof Jesus Christ had occurred not long before.\n  Which sort of puts it in perspective, does it not, that Congress has \nrun up this incredible Federal debt totaling 4,808 of those billions--\nof dollars. In other words, the Federal debt, as I said earlier, stood \nthis morning at four trillion, 805 billion, 266 million, 970 thousand, \n855 dollars and 19 cents. It'll be even greater at closing time today.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2536-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2537-S2538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             THE UNITED STATES-NORTH KOREA AGREED FRAMEWORK\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee \non East Asian and Pacific Affairs I intend to share with my colleagues \nmy views on a specific area within the jurisdiction of the subcommittee \nevery Monday. Today I rise to briefly address the current status of \nrelations between the United States and North Korea [DPRK].\n  Since the division of the Korean Peninsula, we have not maintained \ndiplomatic relations with the DPRK. While South Korea has prospered and \ngrown into one of the strongest economic engines in Asia, the DPRK has \nbecome increasingly isolated, paranoid, and violent. If any country has \ncome to epitomize a rogue regime, it is North Korea. In the 1960's the \nDPRK seized the U.S.S. Pueblo and its crew, and staged a violent attack \non the residence of the South Korean President. In the 1970's Pyongyang \nperpetrated several acts of violence along the Demilitarized Zone, \nincluding the unprovoked ax murder of an American solder within the DMZ \nin 1977. In the 1980's the North orchestrated a bombing attack on the \nSouth Korean cabinet during a state visit to Burma, and in 1987 was \nresponsible for blowing up a South Korean airliner with the loss of all \naboard. The DPRK has constructed numerous tunnels under the DMZ into \nSouth Korea territory to facilitate invasion, some of which have been \ndiscovered and some of which, undoubtedtly, have not. Finally, as noted \nin a story last week in the Washington Times, the Russian intelligence \nagencies have implicated the North Korean Government in a plan to \ndistribute some 8 tons of heroin in Russia. And these are just the \nincidents we know about; I do not doubt but that this is, as the Korean \nwould say, subak keot halkki--just ``licking the outside of the \nwatermelon.''\n  Despite this, since 1988 the United States has begun a process of \nestablishing a limited relationship with North Korea in an effort to \ndraw that country out of its self-imposed isolation. The United States \npolitical counselor at our Embassy in Beijing has met dozens of times \nwith his North Korean counterpart to discuss increased North-South \ndialog and a variety of other issues. However, since the early 1990's \nthe DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons program has overshadowed all other \nissues.\n  Although a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, DPRK-ROK \njoint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and an \nagreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, North Korea is \nsuspected of violating--and in some cases in known to have violated--\nall three. In late 1992, the IAEA discovered evidence that the DPRK has \nreprocessed more plutonium that it had disclosed. This worrisome \nbecause it may indicate that North Korea is reprocessing nuclear \nmaterial for the purpose of developing military nuclear capabilities.\n  North Korea rejected a subsequent demand by the IAEA that it be \nallowed to inspect several nuclear sites to confirm or disprove its \nsuspicions, and announced on March 12, 1993, its intention to withdraw \nfrom the NPT. The administration responded by initiating direct \nnegotiations with the DPRK on the nuclear issue. Two meetings were \nheld--one in New York\n in June 1993, and in Geneva in July of that year--at which time North \nKorea suspended its withdrawal from the NPT and agreed to negotiate \nwith the IAEA and the ROK. The two governments also agreed to discuss \nthe conversion of the North's nuclear reactors to light-water \nreactors--a reactor from which it is more difficult to manufacture \nweapons-grade nuclear material.\n\n  However, the DPRK continued to reject IAEA inspection of its \nfacilities, and reneged on its promise to resume talks with the ROK. \nAfter several weeks of continued negotiations, in February 1994 the \nNorth eventually accepted the IAEA's suggested inspections. The \nadministration agreed to suspend U.S.-ROK military training exercises \nfor 1994 and begin a new round of talks in March as a quid pro quo for \nthe North's agreement to implement the inspections and begin high-level \nnegotiations with the ROK.\n  True to form, Pyongyang prevented the IAEA from completing the \ninspections and disavowed any obligation to begin talks with the ROK. \nAs a result, the United States began discussions with members of the \nU.N. Security Council with an eye toward imposing sanctions on North \nKorea in order to encourage the DPRK to comply with its agreement. The \nNorth backed down, and completed the March inspection in May.\n  But before the United States could restart comprehensive \nnegotiations, the North precipitated a new crisis in late May by \nremoving some 8,000 spent fuel rods from its 5 Mw(e) Yongbyon reactor. \nThe rods contained spent uranium from which plutonium could be \nseparated out through reprocessing. The DPRK allowed IAEA inspectors to \nbe present, but prevented them from sampling any of the rods--a process \nthat would have allowed the agency to determine whether prior to 1992 \nNorth Korea had removed enough fuel rods from the reactor to produce \nweapons-grade plutonium.\n  Revisiting what had become a familiar scenario, the United States \ncalled North Korea's bluff and announced that it would again seek U.N. \nsanctions against that country, and circulated a draft resolution among \nthe members of the Security Council. When the DPRK learned that the \nPeople's Republic of China would not veto the resolution, it quickly \nresumed negotiations.\n  Over the ensuing months, the parties worked out a final agreement \nwhich was signed in Geneva on October 21, 1994. I will not go into any \ngreat detail about the specifics of the agreed framework as they were \nrecently discussed at length in two hearings before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. Although in the end I saw little alternative but \nto support the administration's deal, I will say that certain portions \nof it made me somewhat uncomfortable. Principal among those is the \nrequirement that the United States supply North Korea with 500,000 tons \nof heavy oil annually until the first light-water reactor called for \nunder the agreement is up and running. We agreed to supply the DPRK \nwith this, and the two light-water reactors, in return for North Korea \nhalting the development of its nuclear program.\n  I was not convinced at that time, nor am I now, that we got the best \nend of the deal. North Korea is receiving a shot in the arm that will \ngo a long way toward forestalling what will certainly be North Korea's \neconomic implosion. We, on the other hand, only received an intangible \npromise on the DPRK's part that I do not believe we have the means \nadequately to verify. Moreover, it was my view at that time that we had \nbeen too quick to reward a tantrum by a spoiled child, since such a \nmove almost invariably results in another tantrum.\n  In the last week, I believe we have seen my views validated. During \ntalks in Berlin last week the North Koreans demanded another $500 \nmillion to $1 billion as part of the bargain to which they had already \nagreed. In addition, they refuse to allow South Korea to supply the \nreactors as the United States has agreed. Considering their negotiating \nstyle, and the speed with which we have seemingly met their demands, \nthis should not have come as any great surprise to anyone.\n  I believe that the administration will see this move for what it is, \nsimply a ploy of brinksmanship, and dismiss it clearly and directly. \nBut should that not be the case, let me be very clear on my position \nfor the North Koreans, who appear to be confused as to our resolve in \nthis area. I will not support \n[[Page S2538]] the provision by the United States of one scintilla more \nthan is called for in the agreed framework without substantial \nconcessions from the DPRK; nor will I accept any diminution of the \ncentral role that has been set out for the ROK. South Korea is making a \nhuge contribution to implementing the agreement, and it is their \nnational interest that is clearly most at stake. To accede to any \ndemands by the DPRK in this regard is to assist it in its ongoing \nattempts to increase the United States-DPRK relationship at the expense \nof any North-South dialog.\n  Mr. President, I trust that the administration will resist this \nlatest round of inane demands, and refrain from allowing the DPRK to \nuse this issue to turn us into a cash cow. My subcommittee will be \nwatching this area closely to ensure that it does so. I intend to hold \na regular series of hearings to afford the administration the \nopportunity to keep us up to date on developments in this area.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2537-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Reid amendment No. 236, to protect the Social Security \n     system by excluding the receipts and outlays of Social \n     Security from balanced budget calculations.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the problems I have already outlined in \nthis debate are not the only objections I have to the proposed \nexemption. The attempt to insert a reference to a mere statute into the \nConstitution raises serious questions of constitutional and legal \npolicy which argue against including such a reference.\n  This amendment exemption proposes to take particular statutes of the \nUnited States and graft them onto the Constitution of the United \nStates. This is unprecedented. It may have the effect of giving future \nstatutory enactments constitutional significance. In other words, this \namendment seems to establish a sort of quasi-constitutional device \nwhereby Congress and the President--or Congress alone if it overrides a \nPresidential veto--can do something of constitutional significance by \nenacting a mere statute.\n  This amendment would exclude from the general definitions of receipts \nand outlays in the balanced budget amendment the receipts and outlays \nof the Federal old-age and survivors insurance [OASI] trust fund and \nthe Federal disability insurance (DI) trust fund.\n  This amendment would constitutionalize the OASI and DI trust funds on \nthe date of enactment and forever thereafter, however amended. This is \nno small point.\n  The entire Social Security Act has been amended hundreds of times. \nThe key section that establishes the old age survivors insurance trust \nfund and the disability insurance trust fund, or title II of the Social \nSecurity Act, has been amended over 20 times, or about once every 3 \nyears. The pace of amendment has increased in recent years. Twelve of \nthese amendments have been made since 1980, or almost once per year.\n  This amendment is not restricted. There is no limit on the subject \nmatter of future amendments. It will constitutionalize every program or \npolicy that future Congresses add to title II, whether or not related \nto the original purposes of those trust funds.\n  Of course, the pace of amendments to title II will likely increase \nrapidly because this amendment provides an incentive for adding \nextraneous items: Once in title II, the additional receipts and outlays \nwill be off budget and exempt from the strictures of the balanced \nbudget rule.\n  Under this amendment, future amendments to title II\n   may have constitutional significance. If this provision were added \nto the constitution, any amendment to title II, no matter how narrow or \nminute, would have some constitutional significance.\n\n  For example, section 201 of the Social Security Act was most recently \namended on October 22 of last year by section 3(a) of the Social \nSecurity Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994. Had the provision \noffered today been in the Constitution at that time, the language on \nthis chart would have had some kind of constitutional significance. \nJust look at it:\n\n       Sec. 3(a) Allocation With Respect to Wages.--Section \n     201(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401(b)(1)) is \n     amended by striking ``(O) 1.20 per centum'' and all that \n     follows through ``December 31, 1999, and so reported,'' and \n     insert ``(O) 1.20 per centum of the wages (as so defined) \n     paid after December 31, 1989, and before January 1, 1994, and \n     so reported, (P) 1.88 per centum of the wages (as so defined) \n     paid after December 31, 1993, and before January 1, 1997, and \n     so reported, (Q) 1.70 per centum of the wages (as so defined) \n     paid after December 31, 1996, and before January 1, 2000, and \n     so reported, and (R) 1.80 per centum of the wages (as so \n     defined) paid after December 31, 1999, and so reported,''.--\n     P.L. 103-387, Sec. 3(a), 108 Stat. 4074-75, Oct. 22, 1994.\n\n  Could you imagine what that would mean to the Constitution?\n  This is not the sort of soaring language proclaiming broad and \ntimeless principles we usually associate with the Constitution. But it \nis the kind of language that will be given at least quasi-\nconstitutional status by this proffered amendment by those who are \noffering it. I would think anyone who reveres the Constitution would \nwant to avoid cluttering up the Constitution and the constitutional \norder by adopting this amendment and giving such legislative language \nsome new para-constitutional status.\n  The language of the Reid amendment, like the slogans surrounding it, \nmay look or sound simple, but it has extraordinarily complex \nimplications. The amendment is short because it uses titles, but using \nsimple labels does not simplify the legal ramifications.\n  This amendment refers to the Federal old-age and survivors insurance \ntrust fund and the Federal disability insurance trust fund, but they, \ntogether with their legislative histories, take up some 300 pages in \nthe United States Code. You can find it at title 42, United States Code \nsections 401-433. I am citing the 1988 edition and supplement V of \n1993. There are also volumes of relevant judicial opinions and agency \nrules and adjudications which could be affected. This amendment's \nimplications are a little clearer if restated with elaboration, as \nshown on this chart.\n  Again, is this the kind of constitutional language we want to put in \nthe Constitution?\n  Look at this next chart:\n\n       The receipts (including attributable interest) and outlays \n     of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund--\n\n  By the way, those are the receipts and outlays mentioned in the Reid \namendment.\n\n     and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund [comprising \n     Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 401(a)-\n     (m), Sec. 402(a)-(x), Sec. 403(a)-(l), Sec. 404(a)-(e), Sec. \n     405(a)-(r), Sec. 405a, Sec. 406, Sec. 407, Sec. 408, Sec. \n     409, Sec. 410(a)-(q), Sec. 411(a)-(i), Sec. 412, Sec. 413(a)-\n     (d), Sec. 414(a)-(b), Sec. 415(a)-(i), Sec. 416(a)-(l), Sec. \n     417(a)-(h), Sec. 418(a)-(n), Sec. 420, Sec. 421(a)-(k), Sec. \n     422(a)-(d), Sec. 423(a)-(i), Sec. 424(a)-(h), Sec. 425(a)-\n     (b), Sec. 426(a)-(h), Sec. 426-1(a)-(c), Sec. 426a(a)-(c), \n     Sec. 427(a)-(h), Sec. 429, Sec. 430(a)-(d), Sec. 431(a)-(c), \n     Sec. 432, Sec. 433(a)-(e) (1988 ed.), as amended, where \n     relevant, and comprising tens of thousands of words, together \n     with all relevant judicial decisions and agency rules and \n     adjudications, comprising millions and millions of words] \n     used to provide old-age, survivors, and disabilities benefits \n     shall not be counted as receipts or outlays for purposes of \n     this article.\n\n  Additionally, title II of the Social Security Act is referred to in \nnumerous other sections of title 42 of the United States Code, and it \nis also referred to in titles 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 22, 26, 29, 30, 38, \n45, 49 appendix, and 50 appendix of the United States Code.\n  Mr. President, there are further complications raised by the drafting \nof this attempted statutory exemption. The drafters of the Reid \nexemption amendment have attempted to narrow the scope of their \nexemption from previous incarnations by adding an attempt at limiting \nlanguage. This attempt to paper over the gaping, and hugely elastic \nloophole created by this amendment only serves to further clutter the \nconstitutional subtext and confuse the \n[[Page S2539]] constitutional implications of this provision. The Reid \nexemption states that it only applies to funds which are used for ``old \nage, survivors, and disabilities benefits.''\n  But it fails to define those terms. The other way you can find the \ndefinition is through the statute. The Social Security statute which \ndoes attempt to define some of these terms does little to put me at \nease about the vagueness. Just look at some of the definitions of that \nact on these posters. Let us take these two posters behind me and see \nwhat I mean about constitutional confusion. This is ``Constitutional \nLanguage?'' Again with a question mark. ``42 U.S.C. section 306, \ndefinitions.''\n  Section 306 defines ``old age assistance'' in the first sentence of \nthe section. But it does not end there.\n\n       For the purposes of this subchapter, the term ``old age \n     assistance'' means money payments to, or if provided in or \n     after the third month before the month in which the recipient \n     makes application for assistance, medical care in behalf of \n     or any type of remedial care recognized under State law in \n     behalf of, needy individuals who are 65 years of age or \n     older, but does not include any such payments to or care in \n     behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public \n     institution except as a patient in a medical institution. \n     Such term also includes payments which are not included with \n     the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, but \n     which would be so included except that there are made on \n     behalf of such a needy individual to another individual, who \n     (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the \n     Secretary) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of \n     such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose \n     State plan approved under section 302 of this title includes \n     provision for * * *.\n\n  That alone shows the problems of writing a statute into the \nConstitution. But let me read the rest because I think it is worthwhile \nto the people of this country so see how really absurd this becomes, if \nwe adopt the Reid amendment.\n  No. 1:\n\n       Determination by the State agency that such needy \n     individual has--can you imagine what ``needy individual \n     means''--by reason of his physical or mental condition--can \n     you imagine what that means--such inability to manage funds--\n     can you imagine what ``managed funds'' means--that making \n     payments to him would be contrary to his welfare--do you know \n     what ``welfare'' means--and, therefore, it is necessary to \n     provide such assistance--what does ``assistance'' mean--\n     through payments--what does that mean--described in this \n     sentence.\n\n  That just gives you a little bit of an idea what writing a statute \ninto the Constitution means.\n  No. 2:\n\n       Making such payments only in cases in which such payments \n     go will under the rules otherwise applicable under the State \n     plan for determining need and the amount of old age \n     assistance to be paid and in conjunction with other income \n     and resources meet all of the needs of individuals with \n     respect to whom such payments are made.\n\n  Just the word ``needs'' gives you heartburn. That could be defined in \nmany different ways. But every word in there can be defined.\n  No. 3:\n\n       Undertaking and continuing special efforts to protect the \n     welfare of such individual and to improve, to the extent \n     possible, his capacity for self-care and to manage funds.\n\n  Can you imagine what they could do with this language?\n  No. 4:\n\n       Periodic review by such State agency of the determination \n     under paragraph 1 of this subsection to ascertain whether \n     conditions justify such determination still exists and \n     provision for termination of such payments, if they do not, \n     and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other \n     legal representative as described in section 1311 of this \n     title, if and when it appears that such action will best \n     serve the interests of such needy individual; and * * *.\n\n  Let us read No. 5:\n\n       Opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on \n     the determination referred to in paragraph 1 of this \n     subsection for any individual with respect to whom it is \n     made.\n       At the option of a State if its plan is approved under this \n     subchapter so provides.\n\n  So we have State plans brought into this. What does that mean? Can we \nhave 50 different State plans? Of course, you can.\n\n       Such term (i) need not include money payments to an \n     individual whose absence from such State for a period in \n     excess of 90 consecutive days regardless of whether he has \n     maintained his residence in such State during such period, \n     until he has been present in such State for 30 consecutive \n     days in the case of such an individual who has maintained his \n     residence in such State during such period, or 90 consecutive \n     days in the case of any other such individual, and (ii), may \n     include rent payments made directly to a public housing \n     agency in on behalf of the recipient or a group or groups of \n     recipients of assistance under such plan.\n\n  Can you imagine if this is written into the Constitution--which it \nwill be because receipts and disbursements will be written into the \nConstitution--can you imagine what just these paragraphs will do? These \nare only some of the 300 pages of legislation that come under the title \nof what is trying to be excluded from budgetary considerations under \nthe balanced budget amendment. You can see why some of us feel that is \nnot the way to approach this problem. It is not the way to protect \nSocial Security because I can give you at least 3,000 different ways \nright off the top of my head if I had to--it would take us a few days--\nas to how all those terms can be interpreted, or probably 100,000 \ndifferent ways given enough time. Once that starts, Social Security is \ngoing to be the first to be bombarded by every special interest group \nin the country under needy, those who are needy, those who are elderly, \nthose who live in housing projects, those who have any number of these \nqualifications listed just in these few paragraphs. Like I say, we have \n300 pages of the Federal Code on this. That could not even begin to \ntouch the thousands and thousands of pages of regulations pertaining to \nit.\n  Section 306 right here defines old age assistance in the first \nsection of this section. But like I say, it does not end there.\n  The next sentence says:\n\n       Such term also includes payments which are not included \n     with the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, \n     but which would be so included except that they are made on \n     behalf of such a needy individual to another individual who \n     (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the \n     Secretary)--in other words, the Secretary can prescribe the \n     standards. That becomes constitutional, or at least \n     constitutional as long as it is law.\n       * * * is interested in or concerned with the welfare of \n     such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose \n     State plan approved under section 302 * * *.\n\n  This goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, this is not language which belongs in our \nConstitution. This is legal double-talk, not the consistent, clear \nstatement of principles which we have come to associate with the \nConstitution.\n  Remember, since this definition is only in a statute, that statute \ncan be easily amended as we already mentioned. Future Congresses can \ndramatically alter this definition and thereby change the whole meaning \nof the constitutional language.\n  The statutory definition of ``disability'' is even more convoluted. \nJust look at it here on this next poster. It goes on for no less than \nfour pages in the United States Code. It has six subsections, and eight \nsub-subsections.\n  Both the definition of ``old age assistance'' and this definition are \nsubject to change through regulations issued by the Secretary. That \nmeans that the Secretary of Health and Human Services can amend the \nConstitution without any action by the Congress. Let me repeat that. \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services, an appointee of the \nPresident, who at best is going to be a temporary occupant of the White \nHouse, whoever the President is, that means Secretary Shalala and her \nsuccessors will be empowered to define constitutional terms for \nbureaucratic rulemaking. As I have said before, here we are in this new \nCongress trying to reduce the power of the bureaucracy, and here we \nhave an amendment which is trying to ``constitutionalize'' it. This is \na constitutional abomination.\n  Let me make that case again. ``Constitutional Language?'' and a \nquestion mark. Title 42 United States Code, section 423, disability \ninsurance benefit payments. This is just one of the definitions that \ncan be changed. Any word can be changed, any paragraph, any phrase, any \nsentence. Anything in here can be changed by a mere change of statute. \nBut this amendment writes this into the Constitution, which means that \nalthough it becomes part of the Constitution, should there be enough \nvotes for it, it can be changed any time anybody wants to change it. \nLook at this. Look how difficult it is. Disability defined:\n\n       [[Page S2540]] The term ``disability'' means, paragraph \n     (a), the inability to engage in any substantial gainful \n     activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or \n     mental impairment which could be expected to result in death \n     or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a \n     continuous period of not less than 12 months, or, (b), in the \n     case of an individual who has attained the age of 55 and is \n     blind within the meaning of blindness as defined in section \n     416(i)(1) of this title, inability by reason of such \n     blindness to engage in substantial gainful activity requiring \n     skills or abilities comparable to those of any gainful \n     activity in which he has previously engaged with some \n     regularity and over a substantial period of time.\n  Now, they can add another whole alphabet of provisions there and \nparagraphs if they want to in future Congresses and all of that becomes \npart of the Constitution.\n  Let us go to paragraph 2.\n\n       For the purposes of paragraph 1(a). (A) An individual shall \n     be determined to be under a disability only if his fiscal or \n     mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he \n     is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, \n     considering his age, education and work experience, engage in \n     any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in \n     the national economy--\n\n  Can you imagine the loophole there?\n\n     regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area \n     in which he lives or whether a specific job vacancy exists \n     for him or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. \n     For the purposes of the preceding sentences with respect to \n     any individual, work which exists in the national economy \n     means work which exists in significant numbers either in the \n     region where such individual lives or in several regions of \n     the country.\n\n  As you can see, it is legal doublespeak--nevertheless important. But \nis it important enough to put into the Constitution? I just cannot \nimagine why anybody would want to do that.\n\n       3. For purposes of this subsection, a ``physical or mental \n     impairment'' is an impairment that results from anatomical, \n     physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are \n     demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory \n     diagnostic techniques.\n\n  Can you imagine how that could be amended?\n\n       4. The Secretary shall by regulations prescribe the \n     criteria for determining what services performed or earnings \n     derived from services demonstrate an individual's ability to \n     engage in substantial gainful activity.\n\n  Boy, talk about giving the Government control of our lives. Put that \ninto the Constitution and, my gosh, it is going to be unbelievable. It \nis bad now; can you imagine what it would be like if we put it into the \nConstitution?\n\n       No individual who is blind shall be regarded as having \n     demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful \n     activity on the basis of earnings that do not exceed the \n     exempt amount under section 403(f)(8) of this title which is \n     applicable to individuals described in subparagraph (D) \n     thereof. Nothwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), an \n     individual whose services or earnings meet such criteria \n     shall, except for purposes of section 422(c) of this title, \n     be found not to be disabled.\n      In determining whether an individual is able to engage in \n     substantial gainful activity by reason of his earnings, \n     where his disability is sufficiently severe to result in a \n     functional limitation requiring assistance in order for \n     him to work, there shall be excluded from such earnings an \n     amount equal to the cost (to such individual) of any \n     attendant care services, medical devices, equipment, \n     prostheses, and similar items and services (not including \n     routine drugs or routine medical services unless such \n     drugs or services are necessary for the control of the \n     disabling condition) which are necessary (as determined by \n     the Secretary in regulations) which are necessary (as \n     determined by the Secretary in regulations) for that \n     purpose, whether or not such assistance is also needed to \n     enable him to carry out his normal daily functions; except \n     that the amounts to be excluded shall be subject to such \n     reasonable limits as the Secretary may prescribe.\n\n  I think I am making the case. Those who are arguers for this or \nproponents of it are saying all we are asking for is that the receipts \nand disbursements be put off budget. It is not as simple as that. We \nall know that every word in the Constitution has resplendent meaning. \nEvery word can be interpreted by the courts in different ways. Every \nword can be interpreted by Congress in different ways and by the \nPresident in different ways. So when you put this into the Constitution \nand it is a statute, a mere statute at that, albeit important, then you \nare just asking for it because that becomes a loophole for which you \ncan drive anything you want to drive.\n  Mr. President, the Framers used only a few thousand words. You can \nread the Constitution in a half hour from beginning to end, including \nthe amendments. It took a few thousand words, or less than 2,500 words, \nI think, to create the U.S. Constitution. Title II of the Social \nSecurity Act, on the other hand, is comprised of tens of thousands of \nwords and hundreds of pages and thousands of regulations. Many of those \nare going to have some constitutional significance if the Reid \namendment is accepted. Is this what we want to add to our Constitution?\n  I would like to point out that none of these issues that I am raising \ncan be solved by more elegant drafting. The constitutional problems \nraised by the unprecedented step of attempting to incorporate a mere \nstatute into the Constitution are simply insuperable. No variations on \nthe theme presented in this amendment can be fixed by an alternative \nrendering. This amendment and all variations on it are simply \nunacceptable and wholly inappropriate for a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is not simple stuff we are doing here. This is \nnot a simple amendment. This is not a constitutional amendment, the way \nthey have drafted it. It is placing a statute and all that that statute \nmeans and may mean and will mean in the future into the Constitution \nwhere they could write anything into it they want. Under the guise of \ntrying to do something good--that is, protect Federal and old age \nsurvivors insurance, their trust fund and the Federal disability trust \nfund, the Reid amendment would constitutionalize those trust funds on \nthe date of enactment or ratification and forever thereafter, however \namended. Like I say, that is no small point. The Social Security Trust \nAct--both of these trusts have been amended a number of times. I am \nvery concerned if we put language like this into the Constitution.\n  Let me just spend a few minutes on why is this language essential. \nLast Friday, we had the pictures of young kids whose future depends on \nwhether we pass the balanced budget amendment or not, whether we are \ngoing to get spending under control, or whether we are going to get \nserious about it, or whether we are going to have a mechanism in the \nConstitution to help us to get serious about it.\n  It is no secret to anybody that because of voting power, our seniors \nnow have some of the most massive power in our country today. We keep \nputting more and more money into our seniors and more and more children \nare left behind. That is not a reason not to help our seniors. But I do \ncaution everybody that we have to worry about helping our children, \ntoo, because they are the future generations who have to pay the price \nso that the seniors can get their Social Security. But it still does \nnot negate my point.\n  My point is that the seniors are one of the most powerful voting \nblocks in our country today and, rightly so; I find no fault with that. \nThey should exercise their voting power. On the other hand, are we not \nshortchanging the children if we just worry about the seniors, when \nthey have the power to compete very well with every other item in the \nFederal budget? If we pass the constitutional amendment without the \nReid language, everybody knows that the Congress of the United States \nis going to have to take care of the seniors because of the voting \npower and because it is the right thing to do.\n  On the other hand, are we going to do that to the exclusion of \neverybody else in our society, to the exclusion of children, who are \ncontinually getting less and less of the Federal pot in comparison? \nWell, I hope not. But the only way you can balance these things up is \nnot by writing one special interest group into the Constitution when \nthey have the power and the most massive power in our country today to \nget their will done anyway. Our seniors and Social Security and most \nevery program pertaining to seniors will complete excellently against \nall other spending programs of the Federal Government. There is no \ndoubt in my mind about that, and I do not think there is any doubt in \nanybody else's mind.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I see that the distinguished Senator \nfrom New York is here and may want to speak on this subject. The \nbiggest threat to Social Security is our growing debt and concomitant \ninterest payments. Debt-related inflation hits especially hard those on \nfixed incomes, and the Government's use of capital to fund \n[[Page S2541]] debt slows productivity and income growth.\n  The way to protect Social Security benefits is to support the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment and balance the budget so that \nthe economy will continue to grow. Senior citizens know this. That is \nwhy a recent poll shows that an overwhelming 91.8 percent of senior \ncitizens favor a balanced budget amendment. They know it is simply the \nbest way to protect their children and grandchildren and the best way \nto ensure that runaway deficits do not lead to runaway inflation, which \nhurts those on fixed incomes especially hard.\n  Being a supporter of both the balanced budget amendment and Social \nSecurity, I believe this exemption raises major concerns. The proposal \nbefore us now, to exempt Social Security, will not only destroy the \nbalanced budget amendment but will cause the Social Security trust fund \nto run out of money sooner than it would under a clean balanced budget \namendment. And I believe that the Senate has already voted on a better \nway to protect Social Security, which would protect Social Security \nfrom benefit cuts and tax increases to balance the budget.\n  Let me repeat in no uncertain terms that the best way to protect the \nSocial Security program in our country is to pass a clean balanced \nbudget amendment. This is the best and most appropriate way to protect \nSocial Security for our seniors and for all other generations, and to \nprovide for a future for our children and our grandchildren, those who \nare going to have to work very hard to pay for our Social Security.\n  I do not know how anybody can read that amendment that is the current \npending amendment before this body and not be concerned about writing a \nstatute into the Constitution and about opening loopholes through which \nyou could drive spending trucks bigger than any trucks we have every \ndriven through spending loopholes in the history of the Congress, and \ndo it in a way that totally negates and makes feckless the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when in doubt, wave your arms, scream and \nshout.\n  Now, my friend from Utah has not been screaming and shouting because, \nin his mild manner, that is not how he speaks. But it appears clearly \nthat those who are looking for a way to oppose this amendment to exempt \nSocial Security are in doubt. That has to be the case, based upon the \nargument we have just heard.\n  Mr. President, I have here a copy of the Constitution of the United \nStates. Let us flip over to----\n  What do we pick? Let us pick amendment No. 16. Amendment No. 16 is \nthe amendment that allows this country to collect an income tax. I do \nnot know how many thousands of books--not words or paragraphs, books--\nare in our statutes and codes regarding IRS. Now, using the logic of \nthe manager of this bill, the 16th amendment is inoperable.\n  We could take the 14th amendment. We know the spate of litigation and \nlegislation that has ensued following the passing of this very \nimportant amendment, that dealing with equal rights, due process under \nthe law. How many thousands of words are in our statute books regarding \ndue process? Does that mean it is not a good amendment or it is an \nunworkable amendment? The obvious answer is no.\n  Mr. President, what about the 19th amendment? This is the amendment \ngiving people in our country, regardless of sex, equal rights. How many \nstatutes, how many pages in our code books are relating to the 19th \namendment?\n  I say, respectfully, that the argument of the manager of this bill \nindicates to me that there are grave reservations on their behalf that \ntheir position is valid. Otherwise, how could they come up with \nanything as ridiculous as reading statutes that apply to a particular \npart of the constitutional amendment?\n  My friend from Utah used a couple of terms that I think are \nreversibly applicable, ``legal doubletalk.'' Well, I am not sure legal \ndoubletalk is really clear enough. It is at least 10 or 12 times more \nthan doubletalk. Another statement made by my friend from Utah is, ``I \nthink I am making my case.'' With all due respect: Sorry, case not \nmade.\n  I see a member of my staff walking in here. I sent him out just a \nminute ago to see what he could grab close by that were code books \nrelating to the 16th amendment. These are just a couple at random that \nwere grabbed right outside the doorway here.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, how many pages we have here. This book \nhas about 1,600 pages; this book about 1,200 pages; this book about \n1,700 pages. These are just a few. These are all my staff could lug in \nfor illustrative purposes.\n  So we have been through this argument on a previous occasion that the \nproblem that we now have----\n  I did not write it. Somebody drafted a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I say, we have a tremendous amount of precedent on \nthis floor that indicates that we, as a Congress, want to keep Social \nSecurity out of our general revenues.\n  The balanced budget amendment does just the opposite. The language of \nthe balanced budget amendment--I will go into this in more detail later \non--but the language of the balanced budget amendment, House Joint \nResolution 1, says: ``Total outlays shall include all outlays of the \nUnited States Government.'' That is what it says. I did not write it.\n  And I want to simply state that this amendment keeps out of the \ngeneral revenues of this country Social Security. That is what this \namendment does. It very simply and concisely does that. Social Security \nshould rise or fall on its own merits.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot here this morning, really not too \nmuch, that we do too much for senior citizens; we have to worry about \nour children. I believe we do not do too much for senior citizens. In \nfact, if you will look at the State of Nevada as an example, you will \nfind that, in Nevada, the average retired worker gets $680 a month.\n  That is really not a lot of money. I ask anyone within the sound of \nmy voice--and there are plenty of them--who do try to live on $680 a \nmonth, how difficult it is.\n  But most people that are living on $680 a month are seniors. They do \nnot qualify for welfare. Why? Because they are Social Security \nrecipients.\n  So we do not really overpay senior citizens who are recipients of \nSocial Security. In fact, Mr. President, it is quite the opposite. They \nare not welfare recipients. They receive benefits from Social Security \nthat they paid into while working and their employer paid into. That is \nnow 12.4 percent of their monthly income.\n  This Nation was founded based on a core belief that governments are \ninstituted and exist not as rulers but as servants of the people.\n  The American people are good masters. They are tolerant of mistakes \nand waste which would have most employees, perhaps, out on the street. \nBut like all employers, the American people have a characteristic that \nthey will not tolerate, and that is dishonesty.\n  As the servants of the people in 1935, this body and the Government \nof which we are a part, made a promise to the Nation that we would \ncreate a separate insurance trust fund paid for, Mr. President, out of \nworking people's pockets, to provide for the widowed and the aged, the \norphaned, and the infirm.\n  As servants of the people, we radically overhauled the fund in the \nearly 1980's, substantially raising the tax burden that people had to \nbear in order to secure the Nation's solvency and the system's \nsolvency. That overhaul worked, Mr. President.\n  The Social Security trust fund now pulls in a substantial surplus to \nprovide for the future when America's graying baby boomers need their \npromised retirement. There are those, however, who would raid that \naccount to pay for the mess created by the reckless deficit spending in \nthe general fund.\n  During the past few weeks, I have urged each Senator not to violate \nthe Social Security trust fund in the name of a balanced budget. This \nwould be like going out of your home to go grocery shopping, and when \nyou get there someone has picked your pocket.\n  [[Page S2542]] To violate Social Security, Mr. President, would not \nresolve the central problem of this Government, created over the last \ndecade and a half, that we have spent more than we have taken in, and \nat a very reckless pace, but would create a new and wholly illusory \nsource of revenue which would encourage more spending, not the \nreductions we so desperately need to put in place.\n  It would also do something even worse. It would dishonor a promise we \nmade to the American people when we completely overhauled the Social \nSecurity system. It would prove this Government unworthy of the only \nthing it has which really matters: the trust of the American people. It \nwould shred the Social Security contract created by the legislators and \npresidents of yesteryear, and it would justify the cynical rejection of \nour core values, which is already so badly infecting many of our young \npeople.\n  There was a time in this country when honor was an individual's most \nimportant possession. There was a time that as a people, we looked to a \nnational honor as our most honored birthright. There was a time when \none's word was his bond.\n  So, my colleagues, my fellow Senators, is that time passed? Have we \nbecome such little men and little women, of such low morals and such \neasy virtue, that we can disregard our solemn vows to those whom we \nserve, to the oaths that we made, to the values we espouse? I think \nnot.\n  Sixty years ago, this body made a promise to the American people that \nwe would not touch the Social Security trust fund for any other \npurpose. This promise was reaffirmed by President Reagan, Speaker of \nthe House, Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill, Claude Pepper, and the chairman of \nthe Aging Committee, my friend, the senior Senator from New York, who \nwas in on the program to bail out Social Security.\n  They did it because it was the right thing to do. We should do this \nbecause it is the right thing to do. Keep that promise, because it is \nthe plaintive plea of the American people: This Reid amendment is not \nonly for senior citizens, it is for all Americans, so Social Security \nwill protect them.\n  Mr. President, I see on the floor, the senior Senator from New York \nand the senior Senator from Florida. I have some questions I want to \nask the Senator from Florida. How long will the Senator from New York \nspeak?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak for approximately \n10 minutes to make a point in support of the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to have this opportunity to \nmake a point which I will summarize first, which is that the analyses \nof the effect of the balanced budget amendment that have been prepared \nin the Department of Treasury, for example, have typically been static \nestimates of the reduction of Government programs and Government \ntransfers that would be required to reach a balanced budget by the year \n2002. I think the familiar figure is about $1.2 trillion, and we will \nget that much less in the way of highway funds and this much less in \nthe way of some other program.\n  I would like to introduce not a new thought but a parallel--and in my \nview, much more important--point which is that we put in jeopardy with \na balanced budget amendment everything we have learned in the 60 years \nsince the Great Depression about Government's capacity, through fiscal \npolicy and monetary policy, to restrain the business cycle and put the \neconomy on a steady path of economic growth.\n  The Senator from Nevada speaks of the Social Security trust funds. \nThey are in surplus. In 1977 we moved from a pay-as-you-go system which \nwas purely intergenerational. Persons paid into system and moneys were \nreceived by people who had left the system, or retired. We went to a \npartially funded basis in anticipation of the baby boom retirement. We \nput in place a surplus which would--just to give a sense of the \ndimension--would buy the New York Stock Exchange.\n  But we have not saved it. It was used to run or pay down the public \ndebt, which translates into an increase in investment. We have used it \nfor general fund purposes as the Senator from Nevada has said.\n  All should be on notice that that surplus, that cash surplus, runs \nout in the year 2012. Thereafter, the increasing portions of the Social \nSecurity payments will have to be brought out of the economy generally, \nnot from the payroll tax. The year 2012 is not that far in the \ndistance. I would be closer to 2012 than I would be from the time that \nI entered the U.S. Senate.\n  Therefore, the great issue is to maintain the economic growth of the \npast four decades, which marks a great change in our understanding of \nthis subject. How to maintain more or less steady growth without the \npanics and depressions that have preceded it for a century and brought \nthe great crisis of capitalism as it was understood to be in the \n1930's.\n  Here is a chart with one of the most remarkable bits of line drawings \nwe will ever see. Here is the real growth, percent change of real GDP--\nwhich is gross domestic product--from 1890 up to 1945. Look at that \ngraph. Up, down; up, down; up, down. Three distinct times in that 60-\nyear period there is a drop in GDP of 5 percent; twice there is a drop \nof 10 percent; once a drop of 15-percent. That 15-percent drop was the \n1930's. If you liked the 1930's, you would like what came out of the \n1930's--war. World war, with horrors still shaping citizens.\n  It was thought, what could be done? Classical economics taught us \nthat markets clear, prices change, and we always get the full use of \nresources.\n  In the 1930's, an economics developed that we associate with John \nMaynard Keynes, however, he is not the only one that said, ``No, no, \nyou can have an equilibrium with large proportions of capacity in the \nwork force and capital unused.''\n That was the great insight of the 1930's.\n\n  And now, Mr. President, if I may say, I speak about what I saw. I \ncame to this city in the Kennedy administration. I became Assistant \nSecretary of Labor for Policy Planning and Research. The Bureau of \nLabor Statistics provided the data on which our economic policies were \nbased. We had in 1958 the first real recession in the postwar period. \nUnemployment reached 6.8 percent. Then a recovery began in 1959 and \n1960. Then it stalled, and President Kennedy came in and unemployment \nwas 6.7 percent.\n  What to do. The analysis, and a correct one, which followed through \nthree Presidencies, was that the revenues of the Federal Government \nwere greater than its outlays. We kept running a surplus. In \nconsequence, you had fiscal drag. You never reached full employment.\n  The Kennedy advisers thought of anything that came to mind. They \nmoved the annual dividend on the veterans' affairs life insurance up \none-quarter, which brought $300 to our household. Then inspired, they \ndoubled the dividend, which actually brought us enough money to reach \n$1,000, which was a downpayment on the farm we still live in at \nPindar's Corner in New York. Walter Heller, with the aid of Joseph \nPechman at the Brookings Institution, thought about revenue sharing; if \nwe could give money to the States, they would spend it, and you would \nnot have the fiscal drag of surpluses.\n  President Johnson's people ascribed to this approach to fiscal policy \nand followed it pretty much. They did not quite deal with the \ninflationary aspects brought on by spending in the Vietnam war. \nPresident Nixon had to bring that down, but then he had to stimulate it \nup again.\n  George Shultz, one of the great public men of our age, as the first \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, put in place a \nbalanced full employment budget which he defined as one in which actual \noutlays did not exceed revenues that would come in at full employment. \nWe built in a deficit to increase employment. It is a little arcane but \nnot so arcane. Your average high school graduate can understand it. It \nis just if you have been out of high school a long time, it is a little \nharder.\n  Look at that performance--up, down; up, down; up, down; prices, \npanic, depression, and since 1945, a steady growth. This represents \nreal growth, increases in GDP each year, a little tick in 1958, a \nlittle tick in 1961, another tick in 1979. The only real recession was \n1982, when GDP dropped about 2 percent. Otherwise, steady growth. A \ngreat achievement in social learning. I \n[[Page S2543]] do not know the equivalent in modern times. And we put \nit directly in jeopardy with this amendment. A balanced budget, for 12 \nmonths; if you think about it, it is an agricultural cycle. We do not \nlive on an agricultural cycle, Mr. President. We live on a 5-year \ncycle, or something like that.\n  I would like to go back to the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which was another \nidea on this floor in 1930. At that time, 1,028 economists pleaded with \nHerbert Hoover not to sign that bill. He signed it. Within a year, the \nBritish had gone off free trade into imperial preference. The Japanese \nwent to the Greater East Asian Prosperity Sphere. In 1933, with \nunemployment at 25 percent, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany \nin a free election within the Parliament. This is what we climbed out \nof in the way of knowledge and what we are plunging back into in our \nignorance.\n  In 1979, I asked Charles Schultze, then Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, would he run the 1975 recession on a computer down \nat the Council with a balanced budget amendment. He wrote me that the \ncomputer blew up--GDP dropped 12 percent.\n  Just now, Dr. David Podoff, the former chief economist of the \nCommittee on Finance--and now minority chief economist--who studied \nunder Robert Solow, Paul Samuelson, and Franco Modigliani, three Nobel \nlaureates, simulated a drop in the 1995 economy if some--I use a big \nterm--exogenous shock came along, oil prices doubled, Mexico \ndefaulted--you can name a lot of things--and unemployment went up by 3 \npercentage points. Using Okun's law, as to what a rise of 1 percentage \npoint in the unemployment means, a drop of about 2.5 percent in GDP, he \ncomes up with a new equilibrium of 18 percent below GDP's potential \nbecause of this amendment. Unemployment 12 percent. The last time we \nhad 12 percent unemployment was 1937.\n  That is why, just as the economists tried to warn in 1930, last week \nRobert Solow of MIT came here with other economists, and read a \nstatement opposing the balanced budget amendment that he and Paul \nSamuelson, both Nobel laureates, had written. The petition--circulated \nby Mr. Jeffrey Faux made a number of points about this proposal. But \nNo. 2 is this:\n\n       Even if economic forecasting could be done with pinpoint \n     accuracy--\n\n  As the Senator from Nevada knows, it cannot be done and as he was \nsaying--\n\n     requiring balanced budgets in each fiscal year, regardless of \n     prevailing economic circumstances, is bad public policy. The \n     Federal Government, unlike State and local governments or \n     individual households, has a special responsibility to \n     finance its operations in a way that helps balance economic \n     activity in the entire economy. When the private economy is \n     in recession, a constitutional requirement that would force \n     cuts in public spending or tax increases could worsen the \n     economic downturn, causing greater losses of jobs, \n     production, and income.\n\n  Mr. President, we know this, we have shown it, we have done it, and \nthey will curse this generation in times come if we ever inflict this \nabomination on the Constitution of the United States.\n  We will not have the resources to pay Social Security benefits. The \neconomy will be stuck at 80 percent of capacity, 15 percent \nunemployment--whatever it will be. It will not get better because there \nwill be no way for it to get better. The courts will dither and the \nmonetary authorities at the the Federal Reserve will ask what is its \ncapacity. You could cripple the American economy. Just to get \nreelected? No, Mr. President, there are things more important than \ngetting reelected.\n  I hope we understand what is at issue: Social Security and the \nAmerican economy and the extraordinary achievement of economic \nunderstanding of the last half century. Nothing less, Mr. President, \nand we will ignore this to our disgrace if it should pass.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my friend from Nevada for allowing me \nto speak.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the pleasures I have had in serving \nin the Senate of the United States is to be able to serve on a \ncommittee with the distinguished Senator from New York who has just \nspoken. I think one of the two or three highlights of my congressional \ncareer is when a few years ago we did the highway surface bill. We had \na real tough time in the committee, we had a difficult time on the \nfloor, and a real tough time in conference.\n  But we came up with a bill which I am proud of and I think was the \nbeginning of a new surface transportation philosophy in this country. \nWe have come to the realization in this country, as a result of the \ninput of the distinguished Senator from New York, that more highways is \nnot necessarily the answer to all of our problems; that we need \nincentives to keep people from driving their automobiles.\n  I could go on at some length about the statement just made by the \nSenator from New York, but one point is that all Senators who were on \nthe floor during this particular time moved to listen to him.\n  I appreciate the statement of the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I indicated earlier that I saw the Senator \nfrom Florida come to the floor. I am wondering if I could engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Florida. I have some questions based on \na previous statement the Senator gave, the answers to which I think the \nSenator could impart his thoughts and views and I believe wisdom to the \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I would first ask Senator Graham if he could review the structure of \nthe Social Security trust funds. Will the Senator do that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the question that has been \nasked by my friend and colleague from Nevada, and it follows on very \nappropriately after the comments that have just been made by Senator \nMoynihan, who was here for the restructuring of Social Security.\n  As Senator Moynihan indicated, up until the late 1970's, Social \nSecurity was like most Federal trust funds, a pay-as-you-go system. It \ntook in enough money each year to meet the obligations for that year. \nBut beginning in the late 1970's, it became apparent that as \ndemographic changes were occurring in our country, it would be \nnecessary to change the structure of Social Security.\n  What were those demographic changes? Demographic changes were not a \nnew phenomena. They occurred throughout man's history and our national \nhistory, that is, the rate of births is influenced by historic, \neconomic, and social factors.\n  I do not know the exact birth date of the Senator from Nevada, but I \nbelieve that he and I are approximately the same age, which means we \nwere both born during the period of the Depression. If that is correct, \nthat would indicate both of us were born at a time of relatively low \nbirth numbers in the United States. There were not a lot of parents \nhaving children in the period of the 1930's. So we represent a small \npercentage of the total population of the United States.\n  Conversely, in the period immediately after World War II, large \nnumbers of persons who had suffered through the Depression and then \nWorld War II came back, formed families and large numbers of children \nwere born from the late forties up until the mid-1960's, the so-called \nbaby boom era.\n  Those demographic highs and lows are going to have significant impact \non the demand of the Social Security system. When Senator Reid and I \nretire, if we do, at around 65, we and our cohorts and aides will not \nbe putting too much of a demand on Social Security because there are \nnot that many of us.\n  Conversely, when our children retire, they will be putting a very \nsubstantial demand on Social Security because there are so many of \nthem. So beginning in the late 1970's and particularly with a revision \nof the Social Security System that occurred in 1983, Social Security \nshifted from a pay-as-you-go system to a surplus system, and the theory \nwas that amounts beyond those necessary to meet immediate demands would \nbe raised primarily through the payroll tax for Social Security and \nwould build up surpluses until you reached the point that the large \nnumber of persons who were born in the post-World War II period reached \nretirement, and they would then draw upon those accumulated surpluses \nto meet their needs.\n  And so this first-blue-then-red line indicates the structure of the \nSocial \n[[Page S2544]] Security system as outlined under a surplus plan.\n  This structure is not a mistake. It is not an aberration. It is not \nsomething where part of the machinery went bad. This is the way it is \nsupposed to operate. And so the system is that this year we will have a \nsurplus of revenues in the Social Security over expenditures of \napproximately $80 billion.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask the Senator another question then?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator has done a good job of reviewing the \nstructure of Social Security. How does that surplus affect our ability \nto bring the rest of the Federal budget into balance?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, it does in a very dramatic way. If Social Security \nwere on a pay-as-you-go basis, it could be melded easily into the rest \nof the Federal budget because each year you would be taking in \napproximately the same amount that you would be expending.\n  However, with Social Security, since it is structured to have large \nsurpluses followed by enormous deficits, it will have a very distorting \neffect on the rest of the Federal budget if you attempt to arrive at a \nbalanced Federal budget.\n  Let me just pick a couple of years as an example. In approximately \nthe year 2010, the Social Security system will be running a surplus of \nclose to $200 billion a year. Now, under the way in which the Federal \nbudget is constructed today and in which this amendment will \nconstitutionally require it to be constructed for all times, all \nFederal revenues and all Federal expenditures are merged together. That \nis, a dollar spent on Social Security and a dollar spent on paper clips \nhas exactly the same impact on the Federal deficit.\n  Now, the consequence of that is that the $200 billion of surplus that \nSocial Security will be running in approximately 15 years effectively \nbecomes a subtract factor from the rest of Federal expenditures, that \nis, the Federal Government can run a deficit of up to approximately \n$200 billion in the year 2010 and it will not have any effect in terms \nof a balanced Federal budget because you will be able to subtract the \nSocial Security surplus against the deficit that you are running in the \nrest of the budget and it ends up at zero. Therefore, you have met the \nconstitutional requirement of a balanced Federal budget.\n  Let us just take another year, 10 years further down the stream in \nthe year 2025, when we will be running not a surplus in Social Security \nbut a deficit of approximately $400 billion.\n  Let me just point out to my colleagues that the structure of this \nsurplus plan is that at a point in about 2019 we will reach a maximum \nsurplus of $3 trillion plus or minus, and then in a period of 10 years \nwe will spend that $3 trillion. Every one of those dollars represents a \ncontribution to an enhanced Federal deficit. So our colleagues who will \nfollow us here in the year 2025 will start their budget deliberations \n$400 billion in the hole because that is the amount of expenditures \nover income in the Social Security system in the year 2025.\n  I submit to my friend and colleague from Nevada that the Social \nSecurity pattern of surplus and then spendout is incompatible with its \namalgamation with the rest of the Federal expenditures. It is such a \nlarge and such a distorting factor and its structure is so antithetical \nto the rest of the Federal budget that in my opinion it will be \nimpossible to balance the Federal budget during this period from the \nyear 2019 to 2029 if we mandate Social Security be integrated with the \nrest of the Federal budget.\n  Mr. REID. If I could ask my friend another question, it would seem to \nme from the picture the Senator has painted here the last few minutes \nthat Social Security should rise or fall on its own merits; it is such \na large numerical part of our Government that whatever happens to \nSocial Security should be handled alone, separate and apart from the \ngeneral revenues of this country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator has made a very good point, Mr. President. \nLet me just put some approximate numbers behind that. This year the \nFederal Government will spend approximately $1.6 trillion--$1.6 \ntrillion.\n  Of that $1.6 trillion of expenditures, approximately $320 billion \nwill be Social Security expenditures. So Social Security represents, \nmore or less, 20 percent of all Federal expenditures.\n  In terms of Federal income, the Federal Government will take in this \nyear approximately $1.4 trillion--the difference being the $200 billion \nof deficit that we are currently scheduled to absorb this year. Of that \n$1.4 trillion of income, Social Security represents $400 billion. So \nSocial Security represents well over 25 percent of our income into the \nFederal Government. It represents 20 percent of our outgo. So it is an \nenormous proportion of our Federal fiscal activity.\n  That large scale and this peculiar spending pattern--which is \ndictated by demographic considerations, the surge of births in the \npopulation over generations--are the factors that, in my opinion, not \nonly justify, but mandate that Social Security be removed from the rest \nof the Federal Government and treated as it should be, as a separate \nfund representing a special trusteeship responsibility between the \nAmerican Government and the American people.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my colleague, Senator Graham, are \nthere other policy considerations relating to whether Social Security \nis included in the Federal budget or off budget, as the Reid amendment \nproposes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In my opinion there are some very powerful \nconsiderations. Let me just mention a few of them.\n  One is the fact that Social Security, as the Senator from New York \nindicated, is going to have some serious challenges in and of itself. \nAs an example, there is an assumption among many Americans that the \nsurplus that we have been building up is being invested in some type of \nsecurity that will be sacrosanct, will be protected, will be prudently \nmanaged so that when we need the money--beginning in approximately the \nyear 2019--the Social Security administrators will be able to go to a \nthird party and say, ``Here is the money that I invested in you way \nback there in 1995. We need the money now in order to pay off the \nrights, the aspirations, the expectations of our current generations of \nretirees. Would you please liquidate this instrument so we can make \nthese payments?''\n  Well, the person to whom that question is going to be asked--``Ask \nnot who that person is, because he and she is us.'' We are spending \nthat money now, not investing it prudently for future years' needs. We \nare spending it to finance the deficit. There is no pool of money that \nis being prudently managed. So when the year 2019 comes, the Social \nSecurity Administrator is going to come to us, those who will be in \nthese seats, and say: I need approximately $40 billion, which is the \namount beyond what we will take in this year in order to meet our \nobligations. Please write us a check for $40 billion.\n  We are going to have to either raise taxes or cut spending somewhere \nanother $40 billion, or some combination, in order to meet those \nobligations. That is a very serious issue. We need to be able to deal \nwith that issue. We need to be able to deal with it, in my opinion, as \na separate, discrete issue, not commingled with the question of whether \nwe are trying to do it, really, as an under-the-rug way of balancing \nour Federal budget demands this year.\n  I think as long as we have Social Security integrated with the rest \nof the Federal budget, we are going to be frozen in our capacity to \ndeal with some of the real, fundamental issues facing Social Security \nbecause there will be this cloud of suspicion that we are doing it, not \nto protect and solidify and make more reliable Social Security, but are \njust doing this as a means of balancing the Federal budget on the back \nof Social Security.\n  So I think that is just one policy reason why we ought to remove \nSocial Security from the rest of the Federal budget as it relates to \nthis constitutional amendment to require balancing and be able to treat \nwith the real needs of the Social Security system as an independent \ntrustee would do, not as politicians subject to the cynical charge they \nare doing it in order to balance the rest of the Federal budget on the \nsavings of our Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Mr. REID. I have a subsequent question I would like to ask the \nSenator.\n  [[Page S2545]] What would be the Senator's answer if a question were \nasked, which I am asking: If this amendment, the Reid amendment, is not \nagreed to and Social Security becomes again part of the general \nrevenues of this country, what is the future of Social Security?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think the future of Social Security, if \nit is held within this balanced budget amendment as part of an \nintegrated Federal budget, will mandate major change. For instance, I \nthink we will have to go back to a pay-as-you-go approach to financing \nSocial Security. In my judgment it is incompatible to have a \ncombination of, one, a surplus approach to financing Social Security \nand, two, a constitutional mandate that Social Security revenues and \nreceipts be integrated, commingled with everything else that the \nFederal Government does and, third, that the result of that Federal \nbudget is an equilibrium, a balance of expenditures and revenues.\n  Those three principles are, in my judgment, incompatible. So I think \nwe will have to go back to a pay-as-you-go Social Security system and \ntherefore will face, as the Senator from New York stated, intensified \nintergenerational conflicts as we are going to be \nasking a smaller and smaller pool of Americans--particularly after the \nyear 2019--to be paying for the costs of a larger and larger group of \nAmerican retirees.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would, but----\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. I apologize.\n  Mr. REID. I ask, will the Senator wait until I finish the colloquy \nwith the Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. SIMON. Sure. I did not realize the Senator from Nevada had the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. I see the Senator has some other visual aids here that he \nwanted to go over. Is that right?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do. These really relate, not specifically to the Social \nSecurity issue, but rather to the general question of should we have a \nconstitutional amendment requiring that we balance the Federal budget, \na proposition that I support. We should have it.\n  Mr. REID. As does this Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We should have such amendment. But it should be a \nthoughtful, sensitive--frankly, a smart amendment, not one that is just \na mindless sledgehammer. And I believe part of that intelligence is to \nuse a scalpel and remove Social Security from the balanced budget \namendment, treat it as a separate item, and then balance the remainder \nof the Federal budget.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator from Florida not also suggested that one of \nthe avenues would be to extend the time out for a few years until you \nbalance the budget? Will the Senator explain that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I have indicated one thing that I think we are going \nto have to do if we do not agree to the Reid amendment; that is, we are \ngoing to have to go away from a surplus system of Social Security to a \npay-as-you-go, which I think would be a serious step backward and will \nput in political, if not economic, jeopardy the future of Social \nSecurity because of the generational conflicts that it will create.\n  One of the purposes of this surplus system was to avoid exactly those \ngenerational conflicts. The people who are going to be benefited after \nthe year 2019 are paying the taxes that are building the surplus. So, \nessentially, they are making a payment for themselves. I do not believe \nwe can continue that system if we require a balanced budget which \nintegrates Social Security with the rest of the Federal budget.\n  I believe if the Senator's amendment is adopted that a change that we \nshould make would be to rethink the year that we should attempt to \nreach balance. Currently, we are going to be reaching balance in the \nyear 2002. We do that in large part because we have these significant \nSocial Security surpluses to take into account.\n  My calculations are that if we adjusted that from 2002 to 2005 or \n2006, we would be in exactly the same economic position as we will be \nwith the year 2002, minus the distorting effect of these Social \nSecurity surpluses, and we will be able to reach balance in a prudent \nperiod of time that will not cause unexpected shocks to the economy. No \none wants to be part of passing a constitutional amendment and then \nfind out that we are charged with having contributed to a national \nrecession or depression because of the too-rapid pace in which we tried \nto bring a 30-year, out-of-control spending pattern into balance.\n  So if we do not agree to the amendment, I think we are going to have \nto move away from the current pattern of financing Social Security. If \nwe do agree to the Senator's amendment, which I strongly urge my \ncolleagues do, then I think we should adjust the date from 2002 to 2005 \nor 2006.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Florida, he has been \na long supporter of the balanced budget amendment. We need to do a \nbetter job of matching our spending with our receipts.\n  Does the Senator feel that a Social Security exemption, taking Social \nSecurity out of the balanced budget amendment, in effect, is a more \nsound way of arriving at a balanced budget, working with the unified \nbudget of this country?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely. The reason is because there will be so much \ndistortion in Federal expenditures and receipts because of the size of \nSocial Security today--20 percent of expenditure and 25 percent of \nincome--and even more so because of the way in which those revenues and \nexpenditures are taken in and disbursed based on the desire to meet a \ngenerational shift in demographics.\n  Mr. REID. I would also ask my friend this question. It seems to me \nthat those people who are calling for a balanced budget would have a \nmuch easier time, in the first few years of balancing it, if they can \nuse this money which is not theirs, so to speak.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am afraid of that. There are some, such as the Chair of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, who in fact spoke about the reason that \nhe opposed taking Social Security out of the rest of the Federal \nbudget, which was for exactly that reason. It is going to make our task \nin the next few years more difficult if we are not able to unmask the \nextent of the deficit by these Social Security surpluses. He is \nabsolutely right. It will make our task more difficult. That is one of \nthe reasons I am suggesting that we extend the period by 3 or 4 years. \nBut I do not believe the purpose of this ought to be to meet our \ncomfort level in the next decade.\n  I think it is interesting--and I know the Senator is aware of this \nbecause we discussed it last week--there have been, I believe, some 27 \namendments to the U.S. Constitution since it was first adopted, and \nonly one of those amendments has ever been repealed once adopted. That \nwas prohibition. What that says to me is that we are about very serious \nand long-term business. When the first 10 amendments, the Bill of \nRights, were written, people were not thinking about, ``Well, what kind \nof right of assembly or what type of right of freedom of the press do I \nwant to have for the next 10 years, because I am running a newspaper \nand I want to protect myself for the next decade?'' They were thinking \nfor the indefinite future. And we are the beneficiaries, 200-years-\nplus-later, of their vision.\n  We need to think in the same way about what we are doing here this \nday, this week, this month, this year; that is, if we pass a balanced \nbudget amendment, we should assume that it is going to be part of the \nConstitution of this country for the indefinite future, and should \nattempt to structure it in a way that best meets those long-term needs \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the answers to the questions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, did the Senator from Illinois still have a \nquestion of the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield just for 5 \nminutes, I would like to respond.\n  Mr. REID. I have a statement to make. If the Senator has a question.\n  Mr. SIMON. I do not have a question. I ask unanimous consent that I \nhave the floor for 5 minutes following the statement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there are a \nnumber of other people coming. I do not think \n[[Page S2546]] there will be a problem in the world. I withdraw my \nobjection.\n  The Senator from Illinois, as I understand the unanimous-consent \nrequest, desires 5 minutes when I finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. That is reasonable.\n  Mr. President, I received over the weekend two letters which I want \nto share with this body. One letter is from the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security, wherein the president of that organization, \nMartha McSteen, said among other things the following. The letter is \ndirected to me:\n\n       This is in response to the Republican Policy Committee \n     analysis of your amendment to exclude Social Security from \n     the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  I say as an annotation to this that the Republican Policy Committee \ncame out with a paper as to why this amendment was not good. Martha \nMcSteen is responding to that. She said:\n\n       The first option presented in the paper makes clear once \n     again that supporters of the balanced budget amendment intend \n     to continue using the Social Security trust fund surpluses to \n     mask the general fund deficit. The analysis under option 1 \n     reminds lawmakers that, if the amendment to exclude Social \n     Security is adopted, the Government will no longer be \n     permitted to use the surplus to mask the deficit and would be \n     forced to cut spending or increase taxes . . . Of course, \n     this is precisely what must happen if the Congress is serious \n     about dealing with the deficit. Continuing to use Social \n     Security surpluses to mask the deficit only allowed the \n     continuation of deficit spending in the general fund. The \n     Republican policy paper notes that excluding Social Security \n     would ``make it harder to achieve a balanced budget.'' But \n     although it is a more difficult path, it is the only fiscally \n     responsible path towards balancing the Federal budget.\n\n  This is exactly what my friend, the senior Senator from Florida, just \nsaid on this floor.\n  Ms. McSteen continues:\n\n       A balanced general revenue budget which does not rely on \n     borrowing from Social Security is a budget which will foster \n     the savings necessary to create jobs and to increase \n     productivity. This ultimately is what is necessary to finance \n     retirement of baby boomers. Excluding Social Security \n     receipts and outlays under a balanced budget amendment is an \n     accounting system used by employers and State governments all \n     over the country to balance their budgets without counting \n     the returns of funds as revenues.\n      These entities all recognize that these funds are collected \n     for the purposes of retirement, not general fund \n     financing. The Federal Government should be held to the \n     same standard of fiscal integrity.\n\n  I think that says volumes, Mr. President, about option one of the \nRepublican Policy Committee.\n  Option 2: She says:\n\n       Reid argues there is a potential loophole for Congress to \n     redefine other spending programs as Social Security. Of \n     course, the implementing legislation which supporters contend \n     can deal with any problem with the balanced budget amendment \n     could certainly deal with this problem. At any rate, we \n     believe that Americans would not tolerate such a plainly \n     deceptive practice which would undermine Social Security \n     while increasing the deficit.\n\n  We have said in this debate, Mr. President, that it would take a 60 \nvote supermajority to allow any other programs to come into the \nprogram. So for this and other reasons, Mrs. McSteen is right.\n  Third option: Mrs. McSteen complains that\n\n       Without a constitutional requirement to soundly finance the \n     Social Security system, Congress would deliberately create a \n     deficit in the trust fund. This argument ignores nearly 60 \n     years of history with Social Security. Since the inception of \n     Social Security, Congress has acted repeatedly to keep Social \n     Security solvent, without any constitutional requirement to \n     do so. The discipline of the trust funds' approach has \n     required Congress to maintain a system on a sound financial \n     basis. After all, if the trust funds would run out of money, \n     the Government could not pay the benefits, including Social \n     Security and consolidated budget under the balanced budget \n     amendment, destroys this trust fund discipline, and creates \n     the gravest threat to the future of Social Security.\n       The fourth option raises a serious problem with the \n     balanced budget amendment. The balanced budget amendment \n     changes the definition of Federal debt under the relevant \n     debt limit. Currently, debt for the purposes of the debt \n     limit is defined as ``debt held by the public and debt held \n     by trust funds.'' The balanced budget amendment changes the \n     definition and limits it to only the debt held by the public \n     under this new definition. The debt, at the end of fiscal \n     year 1994 would be $3.4 trillion, not the $4.6 trillion \n     statutorily defined in the Federal debt. Enactment of this \n     balanced budget amendment would wipe out $1.2 trillion in \n     debt owed to Social Security and other Government trust \n     funds. It is this accounting system which is bizarre and the \n     policy paper analysis for option 4, if the amendment is \n     adopted, Congress will not get away with this budgetary \n     sleight of hand. In conclusion, the nearly 6 million members \n     and supporters of the national committee remain committed to \n     your amendment to exclude Social Security as the only way to \n     preserve the integrity of Social Security under the balanced \n     budget amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I also have here a letter from the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons. It says, among other things:\n\n       The AARP thanks you for your leadership in trying to \n     protect Social Security in the proposed constitutional \n     amendment requiring a balanced budget. Your efforts, \n     particularly on the Senate floor, underscore the program's \n     importance and the potential impact of the balanced budget \n     amendment on the over 42 million people of all ages who \n     receive Social Security benefits and the 138 million workers \n     who contribute to the system and expect to receive Social \n     Security.\n       Specifically exempting Social Security recognizes that \n     Social Security is a self-financed program, based on \n     contributions from employers and employees that are credited \n     to Social Security Trust Funds. Social Security currently has \n     over $400 billion in reserves and is not contributing 1 penny \n     to the deficit. The reserve is projected to grow by about $70 \n     billion this year alone, and raiding the trust funds would be \n     devastating to both current and future beneficiaries and \n     would further undermine confidence in this Nation's most \n     important program.\n       A specific exemption in the balanced budget amendment for \n     Social Security is the only way to protect the program from \n     being misused in the name of deficit reduction. Anything less \n     than this exemption is not binding on future Congresses. \n     Older Americans agree that the deficit is a major threat to \n     our Nation's future and that deficit reduction must be a high \n     priority for Congress and the President.\n\n  Signed by Harold Deets, president of the American Association of \nRetired Persons.\n  Mr. President, the Center on Budget Policy Priorities, of which the \nexecutive director is a man named Robert Greenstan, has put out a paper \non February 10, where they analyze what the Joint Committee on Taxation \nsays about the Contract With America and other programs now being \ninitiated here in Congress. The final paragraph of this paper says:\n\n       The potential for large tax cuts to be enacted and paid for \n     only for 5 years suggest the Nation could be placed on a \n     course in which very large deficits would remain as we get \n     close to the year 2002. If a balanced budget amendment has \n     been approved and ratified, this could create a \n     constitutional crisis. In that crisis, it would be extremely \n     difficult for the largest Federal program, Social Security, \n     to be shielded.\n\n  Mr. President, I further say that the amendment that was passed here \nlast Friday is meaningless. I talked about it then. We know that \nsection 7 of the constitutional amendment that is before this body \nmandates that Social Security trust funds be part of the effort to \nbalance the budget. It is not only in the written English language of \nthe proposed constitutional amendment, but the Judiciary Committee \nwhich put the bill on the Senate floor also said specifically that \nSocial Security trust funds will be part of the moneys used to balance \nthe budget. It cannot be any clearer than that.\n  We know that any enacting or enabling legislation could not supersede \nthe language of the Constitution. So amendments like that which passed \non Friday are as worthless as the paper they are written on. It was a \nmeaningless amendment in every form of the word.\n  We have had many statements, Mr. President, in support of Social \nSecurity. When the balanced budget amendment passed in the House, we \nhad Members of that body saying we are going to protect Social \nSecurity. The balanced budget amendment will not use Social Security. \nTheir words could fill up more than these statute books on the Internal \nRevenue Code and what the Internal Revenue Service has done. Stacks and \nstacks more of words. They mean nothing, because the constitutional \namendment now before this body mandates that those trust funds be used \nto balance the budget. Those statements were made only to divert.\n  The only way to show the sincerity to protect Social Security is to \nvote for my amendment. It is very simple. You either exempt Social \nSecurity through voting for this amendment or place the Social Security \ntrust fund into a pot to \n[[Page S2547]] be used for aid to families with dependent children, \nforeign aid, farm subsidies, peacekeeping missions to Rwanda, Iraq, to \nbuy B-1 and B-2 bombers. That is what the Social Security trust funds \nwill be used for. The only way to show one's sincerity about protecting \nthe Social Security trust fund is to vote for the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he would yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. the Senator has raised a point in his last comment, in \nreading from one of the letters he had received, that I do not think \nhas received adequate attention as relates specifically to Social \nSecurity. Let me state my concern and see if I have accurately \nunderstood him.\n  Section 2 of the amendment, which is the section that will require \nthat a three-fifths vote of the whole number of each House--that is the \nwhole number of persons elected--will be required in order to change or \nto increase the debt limit of the United States held by the public. And \nthe key phrase is ``by the public''.\n  It is my understanding that today when we deal with the debt limit, \nwe are dealing with the debt limit of the United States and all of \nthose persons or entities which may hold a portion of that debt, \nincluding the Social Security trust fund, which today holds \napproximately $400 billion of the debt of the United States or a shade \nunder 10 percent of the debt.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Florida is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So this would say, for the future, we would ignore that \nportion of the debt that is held by Social Security and for other \nsimilar governmental trust funds and that would not count in terms of \nwhat the limit on the Federal debt would be.\n  Mr. REID. That is what the specific language of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment says.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That would seem to me, then, to create a situation in \nwhich, if this and future Congresses wanted to borrow money, it would \nbe more appealing to borrow money from the Social Security trust fund \nor other funds like it than it would to borrow money from the general \npublic, corporations, or other potential lenders, since borrowing from \nthe public would require a three-fifths vote to do, whereas we could \nborrow without limit from the Social Security trust fund without such a \nrestraint.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. All these moneys, all these \nexcesses which, as the Senator pointed out earlier, will reach about $3 \ntrillion, we could borrow against those and it would not even show on \nour balance sheet--``we,'' the Federal Government.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In answer to one of the Senator's questions earlier when \nhe asked some of the policy implications of having Social Security \nintegrated with the Federal budget, I said that one of those was that \nit was going to make it more difficult to deal with some of the real \nproblems Social Security has because there will be this cloud of \nsuspicion that we are doing it not to help Social Security but to raid \nSocial Security. And I suggested that one of those real problems is \nthat the Social Security funds today are invested in U.S. Treasury \ninstruments, for which there is no prudent plan of investment, and \nessentially the Social Security fund is going to have to come to the \nCongress in about 25 years, hat in hand, asking that these IOU's be \nconverted into real dollars that can be used to pay the Social Security \nbenefits to real Americans.\n  My own feeling is that we ought to be looking for ways in which to \nreduce that level of dependence on Federal Government borrowing, as, I \nmight say, collaterally, have most of the countries which have a social \nsecurity system analogous to the United States, such as in Europe and \nCanada. They are using a broader investment pool than just their \nnational treasury.\n  It seems to me that this language is going to make it politically \nmuch less attractive for us to consider those other alternatives to \nstrengthen Social Security, because we are going to have a strong \nincentive to want to borrow every dollar we can from Social Security, \nsince those dollars do not have to be subject to a debt limit, whereas \nthe dollars that were borrowed from virtually everybody else are \nsubject to a debt limit.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Florida that he is absolutely \nright. We have been through, here in this body, the savings and loan \ndebacle. That would appear as nothing on the radar screen, literally \nnothing, the billions of dollars that we had to come up with to make \nwhole the savings and loans and those people that made deposits in \nthose institutions. It would be nothing compared to what we would have \nto do if these moneys are gone when we start delving into the Social \nSecurity trust fund which, in effect, would be nonexistent at that \ntime.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to the Senator, I will just conclude by saying his \nresponses to my questions and his analysis of this, I think, raises \neven further reasons why it is so critical that we adopt his amendment \nand treat Social Security as a trust fund, as a contract, as a sacred \nresponsibility between the American people and their Government and not \nhave it mindlessly commingled with the rest of the Federal budget.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with the Senator from Florida.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I start off from the same premise as my \nfriend from Nevada and my friend from Florida. The reality is, we have \na contract with Social Security recipients.\n  And I started--I say to my colleague from Florida, if I may have his \nattention here--I started off precisely where he is for some of the \nsame reasons. If you check back about 10 or 12 years ago, I introduced \na balanced budget amendment that excluded Social Security. I want to \nprotect Social Security.\n  We have today only 11--I should not say ``only,'' because it is still \ntoo high--but 11 percent of those over the age of 65 who live in \npoverty. And those who say, ``Well, since we have 23 percent of the \nchildren who live in poverty, somehow this is wrong,'' the reality is, \nSocial Security has worked, it is a contract that has worked. We have \nto protect it. And we ought to deal in other ways to protect the \nchildren.\n  But my reason for not including it, as we worked on the language, in \nthose outyears is because I want the Federal Government to feel that it \nhas an obligation not just when there is a surplus, as there is today, \nbut in those outyears that go down. And some projections have it \nearlier than the year 2019.\n  I think if this is agreed to, what leaders of Congress should do--and \nmy friend from Florida has been a real champion in the whole area of \nsenior citizens and protecting them--I think people like Senator Graham \nand others ought to sit down with the AARP, with other senior groups \nand say, ``How do we protect this in the long run?'' I do not want an \nexclusion where we say, ``Well, Social Security is off by itself,'' and \nthen in another couple of decades or three decades it starts going down \nthe tube and Congress can say, ``Well, that is excluded from the \nFederal budget. We don't have a constitutional responsibility here.''\n  I think we ought to protect Social Security. I have voted statutorily \nfor many years to balance the budget without including that surplus, \nand I know my friend from Florida has also.\n  But, I think if the constitutional amendment passes--and I would add \nthe great threat to Social Security is the monetizing of the debt; that \nwe are just going to start the printing presses rolling. That is the \nhuge threat. That is what Bob Myers has talked about. This is a \njudgment call. I respect my friend from Florida and my friend from \nNevada and others who are going to vote on the other side of this.\n  But if this amendment loses, let no one have any doubt about it, that \nthe best way to protect Social Security is to protect the value of the \ndollar so that those bonds are meaningful. And that is why we have to \nagree to the amendment.\n  But I think then we are also going to have to review a lot of things \nthat we have not reviewed up to this point.\n  Just as one example--I do not know the right answer here--I think is \nthe immigration law. We may very well, as \n[[Page S2548]] you look at the demographical studies of our population, \nwe may very well have to say in the future we are going to give \npriority to younger people as immigrants because of this situation, \nthings that we have traditionally not done before.\n  But I agree completely that we have to protect the system. I do not \nwant to go on a pay-as-you-go system. I think that would be \ndevastating.\n  And I have to say, I am not convinced we should follow the path of \nother nations in terms of private investments. But this amendment does \nnot change that. I think we have to be cautious as we move in that \ndirection.\n  But I just wanted my colleagues from Florida and Nevada to know that \nthose of us who will vote against the amendment also believe very \nstrongly that we have to protect Social Security.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, would the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this may appear to be tangential to the \nissue before the Senate, which is the question of whether Social \nSecurity should be removed from the calculation of the balanced budget \namendment. But I think that it does, in fact, go to the ability to deal \nwith some of the fundamental problems of Social Security.\n  Section 2 of the amendment which talks about the Congress having to \nvote by a three-fifths margin to raise the debt limit specifically \nrestricts that vote to raising the debt limit for debt held by the \npublic. In the committee report it clarifies that is meant to exclude \nborrowing from the Social Security trust fund or from other Federal \ntrust funds.\n  I am curious as to what is the rationale of that restriction on only \ndebt held by the public being required to be subjected to that higher \nthan majority vote of the Congress.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the idea here is simply that we have to \nhave some kind of an enforcement mechanism. So to increase the debt, we \nhave to have the three-fifths.\n  Now the point that my colleague makes that would make it more \ndifficult to shift to a different way of utilizing the funds of Social \nSecurity, that is accurate. I would agree with his point, though I have \nto add that every committee of Congress that has ever studied this, to \nmy knowledge, has come to the conclusion that it would be a great \nmistake for the Social Security funds to be used for private \ninvestment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, my concern is that it seems to me if we \nare concerned about the amount of debt that the Federal Government is \nundertaking, we ought to be concerned about the amount of debt without \nregard to who the lender of those funds happens to be.\n  I am concerned that by saying that we can borrow from Social Security \nwith a majority vote, would require a three-fifths vote to raise the \ndebt limit where it relates to borrowing from the public, that we will \ncreate a political imbalance which will be more attractive to borrow \nfrom Social Security.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think my colleague misreads the amendment \nhere. We are not talking about treating those funds held by Social \nSecurity--the bonds held by Social Security--as any different than the \nbonds held by the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is not what the committee report says. The committee \nreport specifically states that the purpose of the phrase ``debt of the \nUnited States held by the public'' is to differentiate between \nindebtedness which is held to private individuals, corporations, \nnonpublic institutions, State and local governments, are all part of \nthe category of ``The public''--those that are excluded that are the \nFederal Government trust funds of which Social Security is by far the \nlargest.\n  So, it seems to me we are setting up a system here in which we create \na clear political preference for borrowing from nonpublic entities, for \nexample, Government trust funds, primarily Social Security, as opposed \nto borrowing from other sources.\n  I do not understand what the public policy rationale of that is and, \nmore so, what the rationale is of putting that in the Constitution.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Idaho, and \nthen I will yield the floor, Mr. President,\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the Senator from Illinois for yielding and I \nappreciate the question of the Senator from Florida.\n  Last week, the Senator from California and I got involved in a \nsimilar discussion, what the committee report reflects is the current \nlaw. What the Senator is reading is the current law. The current law of \nthe Social Security system requires that the Federal Government borrow \nthe reserves. No one can borrow them. They cannot be invested outside \nof Government.\n  What the Senator is reflecting, and what the committee report \nreflects, is the current law. I think it is clear in that report. What \nwould have to happen for it to do as the Senator is suggesting might be \ndone, we would have to go in and change the Social Security laws of our \ncountry. That is not what this Senate is about to do in any sense, nor \ndoes it want to.\n  Ever since Social Security was created, the reserves that build up \ncould only be loaned to the Federal Government, and because that is a \ncurrent and constant process, that is what the report reflects.\n  Now, outside borrowing by the sale of Government securities, is a \nseparate and different item. Of course, this report reflects that kind \nof statement. That is what the report of the committee is intended to \nreflect. I believe if we read it we can read that into it. Clearly, \nthat is what was intended.\n  I have been involved with this for a long time. As we began to look \nat Social Security, we knew that the Social Security law was sovereign. \nNobody wanted to change it. We did not have a majority vote to change \nit, did not want to. Nor could we, by crafting an amendment, change the \nnature of that statute. It was not intended.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Idaho has the floor, \nbut I would like to ask the manager of the bill a question.\n  I have had a number of people come over here and then have had to \nleave the floor because of other meetings taking place. I want to meet \nthe concerns of the Republican leader and finish debate on this as \nquickly as possible. Would it be possible when the Senator from Idaho \ncompletes his statement, that we then go to the Senator from \nCalifornia, who has been waiting here for a considerable period of \ntime? She desires 20 minutes. Then the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings] has come to the floor three times, seeking the floor. I think \nit would be good to have him finish his statement, and he said he had \n20 minutes. And I see the Senator here from West Virginia who desires \n10 minutes, so he could follow the Senator from California and then the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the three get \npermission to speak following the Senator from Idaho, as soon as he has \nconcluded, in that order and for those amounts of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will talk briefly this afternoon about \nthe Reid amendment.\n  As the Senator from Florida leaves, there is one comment I would like \nto make about a question that he asked the Senator from Nevada, and an \nensuing dialog that they had that I felt was very insightful and \nextremely important as we address the issue of the inclusion of Social \nSecurity and its trust funds inside a balanced budget amendment, as the \nSenator from Nevada is proposing.\n  After an analysis by the Senator from Florida--and I am only \nparaphrasing from memory--I believe he concluded that one of the real \nproblems that put the Social Security trust funds at risk, based on the \nSocial Security law that those reserves must be borrowed by the Federal \nGovernment and exclusively by the Federal Government, is that we had to \nstop the Federal Government or slow down the Federal Government's \nability to borrow.\n  I believe that is what he said. That is one of the great threats. And \nhe is absolutely right. I agree with it totally. The debt of our \nFederal Government is the threat to Social Security. The borrowing of \nthe Federal Government is the threat to Social Security--not a \n[[Page S2549]] balanced budget amendment. The very accumulative \nactivities that this Congress has been involved in for the last few \ndecades.\n  The Senator from Florida is absolutely right--borrowing is the \nproblem. It is what put Social Security at risk. It is what has \nconsumed the trust funds, in a legal way, in an interest-bearing way. \nBut when the day comes that those trust funds must yield for the \npurposes of paying the recipients of the Social Security system, what \ndo we do?\n  This is what Bob Myers said, who was the actuarial of Social \nSecurity: Stop the debt creation. That is exactly what a balanced \nbudget amendment is intended to do.\n  If we pass a balanced budget amendment and if we follow, then, the \norganic law of the land, the Senator from Florida's worries will begin \nto decrease. So what he is doing if he will support us in the balanced \nbudget amendment is he will work to protect the Social Security system.\n  You just do not set it off to the side and continue to borrow the \nmoney away from it without some day having to ask the citizens of this \ncountry to raise the FICA tax to such a level that it would be \nconfiscatory to the average working person in this country. That is \nwhat puts Social Security at risk; not a balanced budget amendment in \nthe year 2002, but an empty trust fund in the year 2020. It is the \nborrowing of our Federal Government that has created or is creating \nthis risk.\n  Gross interest is a product of the borrowing of the Federal \nGovernment. Right now, that gross interest figure is approaching one-\nfifth of our total spending. It is the second largest spending item in \nthe Federal budget today. As debt grows, the logic is very simple: So \ndoes the interest charged grow. Therefore, I believe the logic that has \nbeen put forth by those who are the knowledgeable accountants and \neconomists of the Social Security system is so sound, and that is that \nthe debt is the threat, not the balanced budget amendment, but the very \ndebt that we are all here trying to address and trying to resolve \nthrough this new mechanism, and that is the changing of the organic law \nof our land.\n  If we do nothing, and my guess is that if we vote the balanced budget \namendment down we will do nothing again, because this Congress has \ndemonstrated no political will to be fiscally responsible. What we are \ntrying to do is to rearrange our institutional biases toward a fiscally \nresponsible attitude and away from the pressures of the special \ninterest groups that force us to borrow or cause us to borrow on a \nregular basis that has created the debt structure that we have.\n  So I am absolutely amazed when somebody wants to take Social Security \nand put it in the constitutional amendment and protect it in a way that \ndoes not allow the board of directors--the Congress of the United \nStates--to manage it in a responsible way that will maintain its \nsovereignty and its solvency as we near those critical years of 2020 \nand 2030.\n  According to the Kerrey-Danforth entitlement commission, we saw the \nfigures of what would happen by the year 2030 in their own projections:\n  Total Federal spending will top 37 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct, if we keep this Government on the auto pilot that it has been \non for the past couple of decades; net interest will exceed 10 percent \nof the gross domestic product of our country, and the deficit will be \n19 percent of the gross domestic product.\n  It does not take a lot of good common sense to understand that if we \ndo not deal with this issue now, Social Security is going to be in \ndesperate trouble at that time.\n  You can almost argue that all of the money of the Federal Government \nwill go to interest on debt and Social Security payments. What about \nthe pressures to fund some of the other programs? That is the risk to \nSocial Security, not the debate on the floor today, not the idea of \nputting it in the amendment. We are not going to do that. The Congress \nknows better than to do that and to put it on auto pilot. It will not \nwork. You cannot manage a system that must be managed as Social \nSecurity has been over the years.\n  The statistics and the facts that bear up under the current spending \nstructure and the nature in which Congress now utilizes by borrowing \nthe reserves of the trust funds of Social Security tell us very clearly \nthat it is the debt that is the threat, not an amendment to the \nConstitution. It is the amendment that we are debating today and will \nvote on, hopefully, this week or next that will begin to move the \nSocial Security system into a much stabler and fiscally sound economic \nenvironment of the Federal budget.\n  So I am always amazed at the idea that somehow we can wave magic \nwands. It does not work; it never has worked. What we are talking about \nhere is a balanced budget amendment, and there is nothing magic about \nthis. It just forces an entirely new responsibility and discipline. But \nthe tough choices, as they have always been, will always be right here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate and in all of the committees of \nauthority and responsibility. We cannot pass go; there is no easy out.\n  But for the first time, we will not be able to just simply shrug our \nshoulders and go borrow a little more money. We will have to make the \ntough decisions, and in making those, we will have stabilized the \neconomy of our Government, our country and, in my opinion, strengthened \nthe Social Security system tremendously.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from California is \nrecognized, under a previous unanimous consent order, for 20 minutes, \nto be followed by the Senator from West Virginia for 10 minutes, to be \nfollowed by the Senator from South Carolina for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina was 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from South \nCarolina will be recognized for 20 minutes. The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to confine my remarks to four specific \nareas of concern. I have spoken on the Reid amendment twice before, and \nthere are four specific areas that I want to discuss today.\n  The first is the committee report and its exemption of the \neverything-is-on-the-table concept.\n  The second is the floor discussion, centering around the concern that \nwe are putting a statute into the Constitution.\n  The third area is the Dole figleaf amendment.\n  The fourth area is the point that Senator Graham, the Senator from \nFlorida, just made in his comments about section 2 of the balanced \nbudget amendment as presented to this body.\n  Let me begin with my first point, the committee report and the \nexemption of the everything-is-on-the-table concept in this committee \nreport.\n  Last Thursday, I mentioned that on page 19 under the section marked \n``Total Outlays'' of the Judiciary Committee report for this \nlegislation, the language states that among the Federal programs that \nwould not be covered by S.J. Res. 1 is the electric power program of \nthe TVA.\n  And then in the course of our floor discussion, it became clear that \nnot only was the Tennessee Valley Authority excluded, but the \nBonneville Power Authority was excluded as well. In other words, the \nelectric power programs of this Nation took a higher priority than did \nthe Social Security of some 42 million Americans today.\n  As I began to take a look at the Bonneville Power Authority, the \npoint was raised, ``Well, these are not quasi-Federal authorities,'' \nand I must dispute that. They are, in fact, quasi-Federal authorities.\n  I refer this body to the General Accounting Office report entitled \n``Bonneville Power Administration, Borrowing Practices and Financial \nCondition,'' dated April 1994. The facts from this GAO report are as \nfollows:\n  The Bonneville Power Authority's plan for fiscal years 1993 to 2001 \nrelies on Treasury for about 90 percent of its borrowing, 76 percent \nfrom bonds and 14 percent from appropriated debt.\n  Second, the accessibility of low-interest Treasury financing plays a \nsubstantial role in Bonneville Power Authority's approach to financing \ncapital projects.\n  Third, Bonneville Power Authority is more heavily leveraged than \nother utilities.\n  [[Page S2550]] Fourth, the Bonneville Power Authority faces \nsignificant operating and financial risks because of its heavy reliance \non borrowing, recent operating losses, and various uncertainties.\n  Fifth, the Bonneville Power Authority's long-term debt in fiscal year \n1991 was equal to 96 percent of its total assets, while the figures for \npublic utilities, investor-owned utilities, and the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority were 67 percent, 37 percent, and 79 percent, respectively.\n  And finally, Bonneville Authority's projected debt for fiscal year \n2001 is $17.9 billion.\n  It was said on the floor that, if the Bonneville Power Authority got \ninto trouble, this body would then have to consider whether we are \ngoing to pick up its debt or not. However, this Government would have \nno choice but to bail it out because the Bonneville Power Authority \ndepends on the Treasury for 90 percent of its borrowing.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we are excluding a heavily \nleveraged power authority from the balanced budget amendment, but we \nare not excluding Social Security.\n  To me, that is a mistaken list of priorities.\n  I was also told on Thursday that I would receive a list of the other \nitems that are excluded from the balanced budget amendment. I have not \nreceived such a list, but it is clear that everything is not on the \ntable in the balanced budget amendment as has hitherto been reported.\n  I must assume that if the wording on page 19 of this report says, \n``Among the Federal programs that would not be covered by Senate Joint \nResolution 1 is the electric power program of the TVA authority,'' that \nthere are also other programs excluded from the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Now, I do not know whether the progams excluded are some Senators' \npet programs, or some House Members' pet programs, or a group's pet \nprograms, or this body's pet programs. But the point I wish to make is \nit is clear, crystal clear, in black and white, that programs are \nexcluded from the balanced budget amendment. Not ``everything,'' as the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois says, is on the table.\n  This report indicates to me that everything is not on the table. I \nthink those of us who are concerned about Social Security have a right \nto know what other programs are being excluded from the balanced budget \namendment that we are not being told about.\n  Let me go on to my second point. The floor discussion that has just \ntaken place, in essence, says that we should not put a statute in the \nConstitution. There is a certain iambic pentameter to the amendments of \nthe Constitution of the United States that would not lend itself to \nanything as crass as protecting old age survivors and benefits trust \nfund moneys and that it should not be in the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  And then, second, the concern is expressed, well, if it is written \ninto the Constitution of the United States, there are sure to come a \nlarge number of statutes.\n  Well, that is correct. However, let us take a look at the 14th \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, a very major \namendment to the Constitution, an amendment which guarantees civil \nrights. There are 20 volumes of statutes defining this amendment, and \nthey are right here--20 volumes of the United States Code Annotated. It \ngoes on and on, statute after statute, that has flowed from the passage \nof the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  That is well and as it should be because constitutional amendments \nneed enabling action. That constitutional amendment, in fact, even says \nthat there will be enabling legislation. So, frankly, that argument \ndoes not hold much water with me.\n  Let me go on to point No. 3, the Dole figleaf amendment. One of the \nthings that is most disturbing to me about this debate is that the \nSenate must do just what the House has done. Suddenly we are the \nsecond-rate body. Just because the House of Representatives has passed \nan amendment, we must pass an identical amendment. There cannot be a \nconference committee to remedy differences.\n  Suddenly, the highest policymaking body in the United States of \nAmerica is relegated to an also-ran body. We must do things just as the \nHouse of Representatives has done.\n  I do not accept that argument, Mr. President. People have often said \nthat the House of Representatives and the Senate are like a cup of \ncoffee and a saucer. The House is the cup of coffee, and you drink the \ncoffee out of the cup. The Senate is the saucer into which you pour the \ncoffee to cool it, and to discuss it, and to have it stand the test of \ntime.\n  If this, in fact, is true, there is ultimate precedent for the Senate \nto take another course and to fashion its own balanced budget amendment \nrecognizing the concerns of tens of millions of young Americans who are \npaying FICA taxes today to save funds for retirements tomorrow. These \nfunds may not be available for their retirements.\n  Now, the Dole amendment. Why is it a figleaf? Why is it a figleaf \nthat does not even cover the parts that a figleaf would normally cover?\n  Let me try to explain. The Congressional Research Service in an \nopinion dated February 6 very clearly states that if the amendment is \nratified as drafted, Congress would be without the authority to exclude \nthe Social Security trust funds from the calculations of total receipts \nand outlays under section 1 of the amendment.\n  The figleaf simply stated that we refer this to the Budget Committee, \nand we say, ``Budget Committee, at your leisure consider this and \npresent back to the Senate at some later time how to achieve a balanced \nbudget without increasing the receipts or reducing the disbursements of \nthe Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal \nDisability Trust Fund to achieve that goal.'' It is whole cloth. It \nwill not make any difference because this esteemed body, number one in \nthe United States of America, would have passed an amendment which \nenshrines language into the Constitution of the United States that the \nDole figleaf is absolutely unable to amend or change in any way. And \nyet we did it because the House of Representatives did it.\n  So what passes the House of Representatives is good, and we then must \nbe in lockstep and also pass?\n  I do not believe that is right. I do not believe that is why the \npeople of the United States elected people to the Senate, to say OK, \nyou say jump and we will say just how high?\n  We have our own minds, our own voices, our own constituencies that \nreach deep across the United States of America and involve entire \nStates.\n  I do not believe that the working men and women of this country are \nwell served if we impose, as this body and the other body have, a FICA \ntax to pay for their retirements and then we take those moneys and use \nthem to balance the budget. That is wrong. It is dishonest. It masks \nthe debt. It betrays people. And it violates a compulsory tax act which \nevery one must pay.\n  If we are going to misuse these FICA taxes, then we ought to cut the \nFICA tax. If we are going to run surpluses in Social Security of more \nthan $700 billion between now and 2002, then we should save them, not \nuse them to finance the deficit and to balance the budget. That is what \nwe who support the Reid amendment say is wrong, is dishonest, and \nshould not be done.\n  I would also like to point out that the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare, representing 6 million \nAmericans, has written stating that clearly this is the case.\n  I will once again have that letter of February 1 printed in the \nRecord, if I may, Mr. President. The Dole amendment, or S. 290, which \nwas at the desk prior to the Dole amendment, are really only fig \nleaves; they cannot countermand a balanced budget amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I pointed out, for 58 percent of all working \nAmericans, the employees' share of FICA and the employer's share of \nFICA put together are more than they pay in Federal income taxes. It is \na big-ticket item for working Americans. Because it goes into a trust \nfund--and this trust fund is like an annuity. It is like buying an \ninsurance policy. What you put in you \n[[Page S2551]] believe you will get back when you retire--we should \nprotect that trust fund. We should protect that annuity.\n  The Reid amendment protects that trust fund and protects that \nannuity, and I am proud to support it and vote for it.\n  The vote on this issue will be very close. The balanced budget \namendment may have 67 votes without the Reid amendment. It may not.\n  There is, however, enough support in this body to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment with Social Security excluded. So if my colleagues \nwant to take a gamble to try to pass a balanced budget amendment \nwithout the Reid amendment because they want to misuse Social Security \nfunds, they can do that. But, they have an opportunity to pass a real \nand honest constitutional balanced budget amendment that protects \nSocial Security. I know this Senate could pass it, and I hope it does. \nIt will be nobody's fault, but their own if the constitutional \namendment goes down because they took this gamble.\n  Finally, I want to address my remarks to the concern that just came \nup about section 2 in the budget report. It was the argument made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Florida. That budget report, right in \nthe very beginning of section 2, points out that to utilize funds from \nSocial Security for purposes of this amendment would only take a \nmajority vote. Votes for other than this program would take a three-\nfifths vote.\n  To run a deficit, the Federal Government must borrow funds to cover \nits obligations. Section 2 removes the borrowing power from the \nGovernment, unless three-fifths of the total membership of both Houses \nvote to raise the debt limit.\n  However, the point that was made by Senator Graham, which is well \ntaken, is that in the case of Social Security this vote would be a \nsimple majority. That is wrong.\n  To sum up, I would like to commend the Senator from Nevada. I would \nlike to commend the coauthors of this amendment. Many of us have said, \nif the Reid amendment is agreed to, we will vote for a balanced budget \namendment. We have said so for good and just reasons. There is a need \nfor the castor oil of a constitutional amendment to force the body to \ndo some of the things it has been loath to do.\n  However, without the Social Security amendment, I believe the \nbalanced budget amendment is, indeed, a slippery and treacherous slope. \nI believe it jeopardizes the retirements of future generations and it \njeopardizes a trust that these bodies have put in place with purpose \nand with specific financing. We should not do that. We should not break \nthat trust with the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare,\n                                                 February 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing with regard to S. 290, \n     introduced recently by Senators Kempthorne, Dole, Thompson \n     and Inhofe. The fact that the sponsors of S. 290 believe that \n     it is necessary to take action to protect Social Security \n     under a balanced budget amendment is, in my view, proof that \n     it is imperative that the Senate adopt your amendment to \n     exclude Social Security from the balanced budget amendment.\n       The pending balanced budget amendment reverses the 1990 law \n     removing Social Security from a consolidated budget and puts \n     Social Security back on budget as part of the Constitution. \n     This presents serious problems for Social Security which \n     cannot be addressed by S. 290 or any statutory measure. The \n     sponsors of S. 290 cannot bind future Congresses to their \n     legislation, or for that matter ensure that this Congress \n     will not modify or overturn this legislation while Social \n     Security would remain on budget as part of the Constitution. \n     I also note that while S. 290 attempts to prohibit Congress \n     from increasing Social Security revenues or reducing benefits \n     to balance the budget, it will allow Congress to continue \n     using the surplus in the Social Security trust funds to \n     conceal the deficit. This only confirms our understanding \n     that the proponents of the balanced budget amendment intend \n     to continue this budgetary charade thereby avoiding balancing \n     the budget until will into the next century.\n       The nearly six million members and supporters of the \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \n     strongly oppose this practice of using the surplus generated \n     by the Social Security payroll tax to fund deficit reduction \n     or mask the true size of the general fund deficit.\n       Let's not forget that the continued borrowing from the \n     Social Security trust funds will only create huge debts for \n     the next generation which will be forced to redeem the bonds \n     through massive tax increases.\n       The only way for proponents of the balanced budget \n     amendment to live up to the many promises not to harm or \n     undermine Social Security is to explicitly exclude it from \n     the text of S.J. Res 1.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senator from California dragged a \nnumber of volumes of the United States Code down here to the floor to \nshow us all how much legislative language Congress has passed pursuant \nto the 14th amendment. The Senator from Nevada has alluded to this \ntheme as well. The Senators from California and Nevada seem to be \nattempting to respond to my criticisms of the Reid amendment's attempt \nto insert a statute into the Constitution. No matter how many volumes \nof legislation are brought to the floor, they do not make these \narguments responsive to mine.\n  Mr. President, the entire body of legislation--every and all volumes \nof the United States Code--are written and passed pursuant to the grant \nof legislative authority to Congress by the Constitution. But nowhere \nin the Constitution has any piece of that legislation been incorporated \nby reference into the constitution text as the Reid amendment attempts \nto do.\n  The 14th amendment, like many other grants of power, allows for \nlegislative application. The balanced budget amendment itself grants \nCongress power to enforce and implement the amendment by legislation. \nBut application of constitutional principles by the legislature is \nwholly different from grafting a mere statute onto the Constitution. \nPutting a statute into the Constitution by reference has never been \ndone before, and with good reason. Such a reference would place that \nstatute in a twilight zone of some type of quasi-constitutional status. \nIt is unclear what such status would mean. Apparently the statute \nreferred to, and any amendments thereto, would have constitutional \nimplications--that is, a mere statutory change could alter the meaning \nof the Constitution, or perhaps we would need to go through a \nconstitutional amendment procedure in order to effect a statutory \nchange in the incorporated statute. It is simply unclear, because it \ncompletely unprecedented.\n  But what is clear is that the Constitution has never referred to \nstatutes, and we should not start now. Other statutes enacted pursuant \nto constitutional grants of power are simply inapposite to the \ndiscussion of this issue, and they provide no precedent for the radical \nand unjustifiable step of grafting statutes into the text of the \nConstitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this unprecedented, ahistorical, and \nunjustified step toward constitutional confusion. I urge them to defeat \nthe Reid exemption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nto speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when the roll is called on this \namendment, the Reid amendment, every American will begin to get a much \nclearer picture of how a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nwill in fact affect them as individuals. Only by adopting the Reid \namendment now before us will the U.S. Senate prove that Social Security \nis safe--prove that it is safe. And that is why I urge its adoption.\n  I must be honest with my colleagues. Even though I intend to vote \nagainst the constitutional amendment before us, I will vote for the \nReid amendment to protect Social Security and the promise that has been \nmade to the people of my State and to the people of America. If the \nReid amendment is rejected or dropped along the way--and, of course, \nthere is a real possibility that it could be accepted and then dropped \nin conference, something of that sort--it will be the equivalent of \nposting a danger sign in front of every household that counts on Social \nSecurity, not only in my State of West Virginia but all across the \ncountry.\n  Our colleagues promoting this balanced budget amendment can promise \nin every way they can possibly think \n[[Page S2552]] of--get on their bended knee and promise they will leave \nSocial Security alone, they will not touch it after they get the \namendment ratified--but unless the Constitution also reminds them of \ntheir promise, I think the pressure to nip, to tuck, and to do much \nmore to Social Security could be unstoppable. This constitutional \namendment for balancing the budget is not just a statement of support \nfor the idea; it is a plan to put the Federal budget on a speeding \ntrain. It will require something in the neighborhood of $1 trillion in \nspending cuts over 7 years.\n  Just imagine what Congress will have to consider when the clock on \nthose 7 years starts ticking. All the theorizing will be gone and the \nbudget cutting will start. You can just hear the talk already. ``Social \nSecurity,'' they say, ``will have to be on the table.''\n  ``No, we did not want it to be on the table. We just had no idea that \nwould happen. But it has just come about that it has to be on the table \nbecause we have to cut this $1 trillion, or $1.3 trillion. How are we \ngoing to cut all these entitlements? How are we going to do all this \nwithout Social Security and without Medicare and without benefits for \ndisabled veterans?'' That is what will happen.\n  Mr. President, I actually do not know how this will come about. I \nbelieve the worst part of this constitutional amendment is its very \nproponents do not know how they will rush their way to its destination. \nThey defeated the right-to-know amendment. They did that very \ndecisively and deliberately. And because I see Social Security as just \none of the sacred trusts that might get torn up on the way, I do not \ntrust them in their budget-cutting zeal. I do not trust their sense of \npriorities.\n  But the Reid amendment is one way to keep the Social Security train \noff the track that could very well plow down any number of things \nimportant to people's lives, to their hopes, to their expectations--\nfrom vaccinations of children, to home health care for seniors, to the \nway we repay our debt to disabled veterans.\n  I mentioned disabled veterans and I will again and again and again, \nbecause the people who were wounded in our wars, we have an obligation \nto them. We pay pensions to them. We have obligations that we must pay, \nand I fear those obligations will be compromised.\n  Why do I say that? Because I believe that.\n  As my colleagues think about the underlying legislation and the more \nimmediate vote on the Reid amendment to protect the Social Security \ntrust funds, I urge you to look at letters from seniors in your State \nand get a sense of what is at stake.\n  I have done that and I assume that other Senators have, too. Skip the \nimpersonal postcards generated by interest groups, skip all of the form \nletters when people's names come rolling out of computers. We all \nunderstand that game. But take the time to pick up some of the personal \nletters with the kind of very scrawled handwriting from seniors who are \ntruly frightened about what will happen to them if the Social Security \ntrust fund is unprotected and this balanced budget amendment passes.\n  I have hundreds of such letters. Let me paraphrase the style. Take a \nletter that I got that starts with:\n\n       I am 69 years old and worked every day of my life until I \n     had to retire. I paid into the Social Security fund since the \n     beginning. I collect $600 to $800 in Social Security a month, \n     but my bills are more than that.\n\n  So she has done everything right all of her life, paid into the fund. \nShe gets Social Security that does not cover her bills. The woman does \nnot live ostentatiously. West Virginia is not one of the richest States \nin our country. People do not have the luxury of living ostentatiously. \nWhen somebody says they cannot pay their bills, I am inclined to \nbelieve them because over the last 30 years, I have seen so many people \nin that condition.\n  I have letters where seniors from my State painstakingly list their \nmonthly expenses, their rent, their heat, their food, and their \nprescriptions. They ask me what they can do. In fact, what will they do \nif Social Security or Medicare is cut? They do not know. They are not \nhostile to a budget amendment. They are not hostile to cutting the \nbudget. They just do not know what is going to happen to them. They \nhonestly do not, and they are honestly afraid.\n  Mr. President, I tell you that there are 9 million senior citizens \nwho live all by themselves in this country, many of whom do not have \ndaily contact with others, except sometimes home health care agencies \ncheck in on them. They do not know what they are going to do if this \ncomes to pass. They are afraid. Where can they turn in their twilight \nyears for help? I do not know what to tell them when they ask me the \nquestion. I do not know how to answer that question.\n  I ask my colleagues who support the balanced budget amendment and who \noppose the Reid amendment, what do you tell the senior citizens of your \nStates? I can only tell West Virginians that I keep fighting to uphold \nthe promise made to them. The benefits they earned by contributing to \nthe Social Security system throughout their working years and careers \nare theirs. It is not a program; it is a trust fund. It is theirs.\n  Over 250,000 West Virginia citizens rely on Social Security benefits. \nNationwide, almost 30 million senior citizens get their benefits that \nway, 30 million people. For many, their monthly Social Security check \nis the difference between poverty and so-called independence, the \ndifference between buying groceries or going hungry.\n  Thirty-eight percent of senior citizens are not living in poverty \ntoday, Mr. President, thanks to Social Security. It has made that kind \nof a difference. This is a tremendous achievement that we can be proud \nof.\n  So our challenge, as I see it, is, one, to protect Social Security \nnow for the seniors living on fixed incomes; and, two, to plan ahead to \nensure that Social Security is there when the young workers who are now \ncontributing over 7 percent of their wages are ready to retire, which \nwill come quicker than they think.\n  Passing this constitutional amendment to balance the budget without \nthe Reid amendment is one way to guarantee that we will fail to meet \neither of the challenges that I listed. We must protect the Social \nSecurity trust funds from becoming a pawn in a political debate over a \npolitically attractive balanced budget amendment which sounds so \nreasonable and sounds so simple. That is why so many Americans support \nit. It sounds so easy.\n  Here is an example of where the devil in fact really does lie in the \ndetails--the details that the proponents refuse, I might say, to spell \nout, where the right-to-know amendment was rejected. We were told in no \nuncertain terms that we were all to strap ourselves onto the speeding \ntrain and to stop worrying about what and who gets trampled along the \nway. This does not say that over the next decade, the Social Security \nsystem will not need change. It will, for its own sake.\n  A recent report of its trustees clearly shows that long-term solvency \nproblems threaten the Social Security trust funds. That is amply spoken \nabout on the floor. If changes are not made, the trust funds will be \nexhausted in the year 2029. We have to begin working on solutions to \nthe danger facing Social Security to restore its integrity, just as \ncourageous Members of this body did, Senator Moynihan being one, in the \npast; in fact, in bipartisan legislation in 1983. But any change made \nto Social Security should be designed to strengthen the trust fund, not \nto surrender to the speed chase started recklessly by the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  This balanced budget amendment--I am sorry; I just have to say it, \nbecause I believe it--is a game. It allows politicians to promise to be \ndeficit hawks without requiring one single act on their part or one \nsingle clue on what they will actually cut. In my book, that is a game. \nAnd because I fear for the people of my State, which is vulnerable to \nthe hidden agendas in this amendment, I support this proposal to make \nabsolutely sure that Social Security is left alone.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous unanimous-consent request, \nthe distinguished Senator from South Carolina is recognized to speak \nfor up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  [[Page S2553]] Mr. President, it is hard to make sense out of the \ndebate in this town. We suffer through tremendous frustrations in \ntrying to balance the budget, trying to pay the bills, trying to put \nthe Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. Every State has to do that. \nEvery city has to do it. I, as a Senator, participated back in 1969 \nwhen the Congress voted and the President signed into law a balanced \nbudget. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I participated in \nPresident Carter's efforts to cut government spending and leave his \nsuccessor with a smaller deficit than he had inherited. We have seen \nthe successes of President Clinton's $500 billion deficit reduction \nplan, and have known the tremendous struggle and frustration--the \npartisanship whereby there was not a single Republican vote in the \nHouse or in the Senate. Instead, Members predicted that the economy \nwould stall, the deficit would rise, and everything was going to happen \nin the next hour.\n  Now comes what the distinguished Senator from West Virginia calls a \ngame. I call it outright fraud, because I know they know better.\n  Here we are, trying to balance the budget without raiding Social \nSecurity, but all we are given is a constitutional amendment that uses \nthese surpluses. This very minute, we have a statutory law on the \nbooks--section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990--signed into \nlaw on November 5 by President George Bush, which in effect says: \n``Thou shalt not use Social Security funds.'' That is the formal \nstatutory law; that is what we should be following today with or \nwithout the Dole amendment.\n  If we are serious about trying to balance the budget, we should \nrecognize that a constitutional amendment alone is not balancing the \nbudget at all. It is a delay. It says you have to pass a joint \nresolution through both of these Houses, and then send it, and \nhopefully have 37 States ratify it in the next few years.\n  So before we pat ourselves on the back for all our good work on \nbalancing the budget, we should be mindful that a balanced budget \namendment may not give discipline but rather may inspire creativity.\n  We have seen that in circumvention of the Byrd amendment which \nstatutorily required Congress to balance the budget, in talk about \ncapital budgets and about off-budget exercises, and in eliminating the \nfixed deficit targets of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings as they did in the 1990 \nbudget summit.\n  Rather than recognize these shenanigans, the media in this town are \nsmitten by the Contract With America and eagerly joins in this fraud.\n  Taking our streets back is not going to balance the budget. The \nPersonal Responsibility Act is not going to balance the budget. The \nFamily Reinforcement Act is not going to balance the budget. The \nAmerican Dream Restoration Act is not going to balance the budget. The \nNational Security Restoration Act is not going to do it. The Senior \nCitizens Fairness Act is not going to balance the budget. The Job \nCreation and Wage Enhancement Act is not going to balance the budget. \nCommon-sense legal reform is not going to balance the budget, and the \nCitizens Legislature Act and constitutional amendment to limit \ncongressional terms will not balance the budget.\n  So I come to this session of the Congress, having worked 28 years now \nin the vineyards trying to pay the bill and put the Government on a \npay-as-you-go basis. Mr. President, we can put the Contract With \nAmerica into law this afternoon. No budget is balanced, but that is \nexactly what we need in this land.\n  On Friday, we got another creative maneuver. We voted on the Dole \namendment which said:\n\n       Strike the Dole amendment. Strike all after the first word \n     and insert the following: ``For the purpose of any \n     constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the \n     Budget Committee of the Senate shall report forthwith H.J. \n     Res. 1 in status quo, and at the earliest date practicable \n     after February 8, 1995, they shall report to the Senate how \n     to achieve a balanced budget without increasing the receipts \n     or reducing the disbursements and the Federal old age and \n     survivors insurance trust funds and the Federal disability \n     insurance trust fund to achieve that goal.''\n\n  But having the Budget Committee report how to balance the budget \nobscures what the law already says that the Congress must do. Instead, \nwe have these creative put-offs that the media covers like they would \nan athletic contest. On Saturday morning, we see the headline ``Senate \nResolution Bars Congress from Dipping into Social Security.'' \nAbsolutely false. There is no bar to Congress dipping into Social \nSecurity. The folks that write these stories have been covering the \nCongress and they keep writing it the way the majority wants it \nwritten, not the way the facts are. They ought to expose this nonsense. \nThey say it is called a fig leaf, but they do not say why. Why it is a \nfig leaf is absolutely important. The Dole amendment does not change \nthe Constitution. But the constitutional provision that they want us to \nvote on after all of the amendments is ``total receipts shall include \nall receipts of the United States Government except those derived from \nborrowing''. That constitutionally mandates the inclusion of Social \nSecurity funds. That is the whole point here. You cannot talk sense in \nthis town; no wonder you can't get anything done.\n  My good friend, the distinguished former Vice President, was on \n``Meet the Press'' this past Sunday. He said, ``These are the types of \nthings that we ought to look at, but when you have amendments in the \nSenate right now that we are going to put in the Constitution that you \ncannot touch Social Security, this is ridiculous.'' Those are the words \nof Vice President Quayle. But the Reid amendment does not say that at \nall. You can touch Social Security. We touched it the year before last \nin the budget.\n  This particular Reid amendment does not say do not touch it; it says \ndo not include it in your receipts and your outlays and disbursements. \nThat is all it says. The Republicans want to use the $636 billion in \nSocial Security surpluses--that is the whole point here. If they kill \nthat Reid amendment, then they have $636 billion in their pocket that \nthey do not have to cut in order to put us on a pay-as-you-go basis. \nThat is the intent of the Concord Coalition which has done some good \nwork. I wish they would get that digital clock that has the running \ntally of the national debt and put it into the parking lot in front of \nthe Capitol so we could see it every morning when we come to work. But \nI wish they would not put forth this subterfuge about entitlements, \nentitlements, entitlements. Social Security is a trust fund; it is paid \nfor. Do not give me 2029. Let us worry about today.\n  I have said time and again that it is like the 49ers, going down to \nMiami and running into the stands hollering ``We want a touchdown.'' \nGet down on the field and score the touchdown. That is what the 49ers \ndid. We are the Government. The Republicans on the other side of the \naisle are in the majority. They have control. They have the Supreme \nCourt, they have the House of Representatives, and they have the U.S. \nSenate. Let them act like they have some responsibility. But do not \ngive me this hit and run driving. All of this is process, process, \nprocess.\n  Nothing is real. Nothing gets done. No budget is balanced. They want \nto use these Social Security funds.\n  Mr. President, a few years ago I had a conference with the former OMB \nDirector, Dick Darman at the insistence of President Bush. Later he \nenumerated in public exactly what he told me in the office. They want \nto get entitlements. They will not say the word ``tax'' even though \nthey know that you have to have tax increases as well as spending cuts \nto balance the budget. Yes, you have to do something about Government \nspending on entitlements, but Social Security is paid for, so why break \nthe trust? You are going to try your best with welfare, you are going \nto try your best with health. If you cut health back from a 10-percent \ngrowth rate to 5 percent, you will be a magician. You will get the good \ngovernment award.\n  President Clinton has already gone a long way in this regard. They \nsay he did not have the courage, but I get letters of thanks for his \nbringing up health reform last year. The chairman of the board of one \nof the largest employers in the State of South Carolina recently told \nme ``Keep on pouring on the coals. For the first time, I got my \ninsurance coverage for the employees instead of going up, it went down \n10 percent.''\n  [[Page S2554]] Why? Because President Clinton had the courage to \nbring up health reform. And for that, they ridicule him and the First \nLady. They criticized him last year for his proposed cuts in Medicare \nand Medicaid. Now they are running around here, bumping over desks and \ntalking about no courage, taking a walk, putting up the white flag, and \nall that.\n  Where has any Republican put up their budget? They will not do it \nbecause they do not want to show senior citizens that they want to use \nthe moneys in the Social Security trust fund. At least the Concord \nCoalition has the decency to say so. This crowd goes around, like the \ndistinguished majority whip, the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, who says, ``No one--no Republican, no Democrat, no \nconservative, no liberal, no moderate--is even thinking,'' he says, \n``about using Social Security.''\n  That is all they are thinking about. Why the big debate?\n  There is already one exception in the language of the constitutional \namendment. Their amendment says, ``Total receipts shall include all \nreceipts of the U.S. Government except those derived from borrowing.'' \nAnd the Reid amendment says, ``except Social Security trust funds.'' \nNow what is the matter with that? Don't give me all this gobbledygook \nabout legislating in a constitutional amendment. They got an exception \nin here. You cannot hide from this.\n  What did old Joe Louis tell Billy Conn? ``You can run, but you cannot \nhide.'' They cannot hide on this one. It is crystal clear and we tried \nto show that in the Record. Some say we are trying to defeat the \nbalanced budget amendment. I voted three times for it; I will vote for \nit again if you get the Reid amendment in there. But I am not going to \nbreach the trust. I am not going to violate the contract that we made \nwith America in 1935.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hatch for \nfinding a few moments for me. I was not part of the unanimous-consent \nagreement. I say to Senator Hatch, whenever it is somebody else's turn, \nif he will just advise me. I cannot be here longer than 10 minutes in \nany event.\n  But I come to the floor to suggest to the senior citizens of this \ncountry that, if they want to protect Social Security, they should not \nadopt the Reid amendment. Quite to the contrary, what he thinks he is \npropounding, and those who think it is to be off budget, off the \nconstitutional amendment, I believe seniors ought to pay attention, \nbecause I believe it will be easier to spend Social Security money on \nthings that are not Social Security if it is outside the budget than if \nit is within.\n  Let me give you some examples, as I see it. First of all, if Social \nSecurity revenues and outlays are outside of the balanced budget \nrequirement, you can be sure that Congress will look for ways to move \ncosts into Social Security and out of the rest of the budget.\n  The Reid amendment says Social Security is excluded from the balanced \nbudget amendment only if the revenues and outlays are, and I quote, \n``used to provide old-age, survivors and disability benefits.'' Social \nSecurity recipients might think that is only them. But this does not \nsay that. It says ``old-age, survivors and disability benefits.'' So \nthis amendment is saying all of those purposes are now outside of the \nbudget.\n  And let me give you a couple of examples of what is going to happen.\n  For instance, the supplemental security income, the SSI Program, as \nSenator Hatch well knows, going through this debate provides income \nsupport for the poor, elderly, and disabled Americans, most of whom \nalso get Social Security benefits. This program is part of the Social \nSecurity Act. In fact, it is title 16, and is administered by the \nSocial Security Administration.\n  But, Mr. President, fellow Senators, and senior citizens who are \nconcerned about this debate, this program is financed out of general \nrevenues of $24 billion in 1994, not the Social Security trust fund. In \nother words, Congress budgets out of regular taxes $24 billion that \ngoes into the trust fund to pay for SSI.\n  Why could not Congress, when it gets pushed in the balanced budget, \nwhy could not Congress cut the SSI to balance the budget and fund \nexactly the same benefits out of Social Security to protect the \nbeneficiaries? There is no question that Congress can say, ``This trust \nfund is protected. Why don't we just not put the $24 billion in from \nthe outside. Why don't we just use the trust fund to pay for the SSI?''\n  I believe it is legal. I believe it is just as possible as any horror \nor scare story about leaving it on budget.\n  Now let me proceed. Is that not doing that to ``old age'' or \n``disability'' benefits? You bet. So the definition used by my good \nfriend from Nevada includes what I am speaking of under the rubric of \nSocial Security, but clearly there is a $24 billion easy loophole to \ncharge the trust fund for SSI and there is nothing illegal about it.\n  Now, let me move on and then insert some things in the Record.\n  First of all, I want to move quickly to another notion. Supporters of \nthe amendment of my friend from Nevada, Senator Reid, may argue that \ncurrent law provides a firewall around Social Security requiring 60 \nvotes to raid it.\n  Now, I do not know if it has been argued, but I think it should be \nput on the table. Frankly, I had a lot to do with it. It is a Domenici \namendment, a Domenici proposed firewall. I helped direct that despite \nobjections from some who wanted to raid the trust fund. That firewall \nis very important.\n  But Congress can change it by changing our internal budget rules. In \nfact, we saw it happen in the 1993 reconciliation bill.\n  Let me tell you what happened. The President proposed to increase \nincome taxes on Social Security benefits and instead of giving that \nrevenue to Social Security--I say to my friend--as required by the 1983 \nbipartisan solvency package--he put the money in Medicare, a pretty \nhealthy chunk of money.\n  In effect, if the Reid amendment passes, the paradox is it will take \n60 votes to run a deficit, but only 51 votes to raid Social Security. \nLet me make sure everybody understands. Right now, the internal law of \nthis Congress--and I believe it will be there for a long time--permits \nraiding on 51 votes. But if--if, in fact, you have a balanced budget \namendment--and remember, it is enforced by a 60-vote rule--if, in fact, \nyou are overspending, it takes 60 votes.\n  I assume part of the way to overspending would be to raid the trust \nfund. If you raid the trust fund, to go out of balance, it will take 60 \nvotes; whereas, if you do not have the constitutional amendment, even \nwith the firewall and all the other things, it will take only 51 votes \nto raid the trust fund.\n  Now, frankly, I believe the second thing we ought to make sure \neverybody knows, the Social Security fund is in danger not by the \nthreats that have been posed by those who essentially, I believe, want \nto kill the balanced budget amendment--I mean, to me it seems like \nthose who are saying put Social Security outside of the balanced budget \nclearly understand that many who are for the balanced budget amendment \nwould leave that side of support and say we should not even have a \nconstitutional balanced budget if everything we spend on is not on it.\n  So, what do I think is the most important thing for Social Security \nin the future? I believe the best way to protect Social Security, Mr. \nPresident, is to balance the Federal budget.\n  There is no doubt that if you ask economists, those who are familiar \nwith the fund, those who are familiar with its idiosyncrasies, they \nwill say the most important thing to do to protect it is to balance the \nbudget.\n  If we continue to run budget deficits as we have been for two \ndecades, we will sap all of our already meager national savings, which \nleads to lower investment and slower productivity growth.\n  Ultimately, let me tell Members what that means. Lower productivity \nand slower growth and lack of investment ultimately means stagnant \nwages. Stagnant wages ruin Social Security trust funds. Lower payroll \ntaxes come from stagnant wages. Stagnant wages come, as I indicated, \nfrom spiraling deficits, without national savings, which make long-term \ninterest rates go up, and the Social Security recipient is doomed.\n  [[Page S2555]] Already we see the deficit in Social Security way out \nthere in about 2\\1/2\\ decades, finally arriving again, because of \ndemographics. And clearly if we have on top of that--without major \nreform in Social Security in the way out years on top of that--a slower \nwage growth base, we will never be able to afford the Social Security \nsystem.\n  That gets back to what is best for the seniors. What is best is a \nbalanced budget. What kind of balanced budget? One that is real, one \nthat is true to valid spending processes, that excludes nothing. That \nexcludes nothing.\n  I want to repeat the fact that because I am here saying the Reid \namendment should fail does not mean that this Senator or that \nRepublicans on this side or Democrats on that side that are with the \nbalanced budget amendment and do not want to take the Reid amendment, \ndo not want to vote for it, we are not against Social Security.\n  Anybody that has taken the floor here and says this is calculated to \nharm Social Security, listen carefully. We are absolutely convinced \nthat to take it off budget lends itself to more mischief and more \nrobbing of the trust fund than if it is on budget. We are firmly \nconvinced of it and we gave only two little examples today. But they \nare big. One is over $39 billion, the one on taxes; and one is $24 \nbillion, just 1994. They will come up like mushrooms. The way is to \nmake it more solvent but not bite the hard bullets of getting the \ndeficit under control. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, make it clear. Social Security and pensions and seniors' well-\nbeing is more predicated upon wage growth, productivity increases and \neconomic prosperity than any other commitment of our Government. What \nis more apt to make those commitments viable and solid? A balanced \nbudget where we spend within our means and live within our revenues.\n  We do not want to kill the constitutional amendment. Seniors do not \nwant Members to kill a constitutional amendment on an amendment that \nsays it will protect while all the time we are assured that it will \nkill the balanced budget amendment which is intended to protect \nseniors, which everybody knows will protect seniors, which everybody \nknows is a necessity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. I do say, however, that no matter how loud the Senator \ntalks, or how many examples the Senator gives that are not relevant, \nthe fact of the matter is that the only way to protect Social Security \nis through the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico did not deny--nor has \nanyone, as a matter of fact--that this amendment, House Joint \nResolution 1, includes in the general revenues of this country Social \nSecurity. There is no question about that.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, the report that came to this body \nfrom the Judiciary Committee which reported the amendment says that \nSocial Security shall be counted in the general revenues of this \ncountry. There is no question about that.\n  House Joint Resolution 1, section 7, if it passes, it will have \npassed with 67 votes. We do not have to worry about 60 or 50 votes. If \nthe constitutional amendment passes and does not have the Reid \namendment it will include Social Security revenues. Clear as that. No \nquestion about that.\n  My friend from New Mexico said on this floor the best way to protect \nSocial Security is to balance the budget. The best way to protect \nSocial Security, according to my friend from New Mexico, is to use \nSocial Security trust funds. That is what this debate is about.\n  The debate on this amendment is whether or not we should exclude from \nthe language of this underlying constitutional amendment Social \nSecurity receipts. I say yes. There are those in this body who \ndisagree. They believe that Social Security funds should be used to \nbalance the budget. I do not. I think that is wrong.\n  We can go back, Mr. President, to a history of Social Security. We \nhear a lot in this body and in the other body about a Contract With \nAmerica. Let me remind everyone again that the real contract with \nAmerica is not something that has to be passed in 100 days. The real \ncontract with America was that contract that was negotiated by the \nMembers of the House and the Senate and the President back in 1935.\n  They set up a trust fund that would be funded by employers and \nemployees so that people when they reached the magic age of 65, they \nwould be able to draw moneys from that trust fund that had been \naccumulated as a result of their paying into the trust fund with their \nemployers. It is a contract. It is the original contract with America.\n  We, as Members of Congress, have a fiduciary relationship with the \npeople of this country--not only senior citizens, but the people of \nthis country--to protect moneys. This is for me, my children and my \ngrandchildren. That is what this is all about. We have an obligation to \nprotect those moneys.\n  We must remember that Social Security moneys come from taxes that are \npaid. Social Security has not contributed one penny to the \nmultitrillion-dollar debt we have in this body. Not one penny. Why \nshould it be used to help balance the budget?\n  Mr. President, we know it has been the intent of this body to exclude \nSocial Security from the general revenues of this country. We know that \nbecause there is a law that says that. This is a section of our \nstatutes.\n  This amendment was offered, among others, by the junior Senator from \nSouth Carolina who recently spoke on this floor. It says there will be \nan exclusion of Social Security from our general revenues--our budget. \nIt says that. This was not a real close vote, although we did have a \nvote on that.\n  In fact, Mr. President, by a vote of 98 to 2, this law was passed: 98 \nyeas; 2 nays. It was the decision of the Senate and the House, and this \nwas signed into law by the President, that we should exclude Social \nSecurity trust funds from deficit calculations.\n  Now, it seems rather unusual to me that we would come along just a \nfew short years later and say, well, that was all wrong, the vote did \nnot really mean that much, and with House Joint Resolution 1, the \nunderlying constitutional amendment that is now pending in this body, \nit says we are going to include total outlays. I repeat, if it is not \ngraphic enough for everyone, look at the report language that we have. \nIt is a report that came from the Judiciary Committee that included \nlanguage that says we are going to include Social Security in the \ngeneral revenues of this country.\n  There could be no mistake made that this underlying constitutional \namendment will take Social Security trust funds and use them to balance \nthe budget.\n  There have been very few objections raised to excluding Social \nSecurity. I heard the Senator from North Dakota say on a number of \noccasions: ``Give me a reason why you would not want to exclude Social \nSecurity from the deficit reduction problems we have in this country. \nSocial Security does not add to the deficit.''\n  So why should we?\n  Some of the reasons that have been raised are, No. 1, we are going to \ntake care of things by using implementing legislation to exempt Social \nSecurity from the balanced budget amendment. We know that if the \nunderlying constitutional amendment passes, it will have section 7 in \nit. This would be part of the Constitution. I have a copy of the \nConstitution in my hand, Mr. President, and this amendment will become \npart of this Constitution. If I am not mistaken, it will be amendment \nNo. 28. If it is part of our Constitution, you cannot pass a statute \nthat says the Constitution does not really mean what it says.\n  If the underlying constitutional amendment passes and you try to pass \na law that says the Constitution does not mean what it says, it is \nobviously unconstitutional. So how could anyone accept the proposition \nthat we will pass a law that will change the Constitution? That is what \nwe are hearing around here.\n  ``We will use implementing legislation to exempt Social Security from \nbalanced budget calculations''--it is irrational; it is impossible to \narrive at any conclusion that would make that possible. Attempts to \nexempt Social Security through implementing legislation would be \nfutile.\n  [[Page S2556]] I repeat, once the Constitution is amended, to \ninclude, as the chart shows behind me, ``Total outlays shall include \nall outlays of the U.S. Government except for those for repayment of \ndebt principal,'' in effect what we want to put here, in addition to \n``repayment of debt principal,'' is ``Social Security.'' That is what \nthis amendment is all about. You cannot change the Constitution with \nsimple implementing legislation.\n  Senator Heflin has said this means that there will be a \nconstitutional requirement that Social Security funds be considered on \nbudget. I point to this for the third time; that is what it says.\n  ``If the balanced budget amendment,'' Senator Heflin continues, ``is \nadopted as presently worded, it would prohibit Congress from \nlegislatively taking Social Security funds off budget and would nullify \nthe provisions of the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act which would require \nSocial Security funds to be considered off budget.''\n  He is not the only one who has said this. It is not as if Senator \nHeflin, who is, I think, one of the leading legal scholars in this \nbody, does not have any support. We have an opinion from the \nCongressional Reference Service that says:\n\n       Under the proposed language, it would appear the receipts \n     received by the United States which go to the trust fund and \n     the Federal Disability Trust Fund would be included in the \n     calculations of total receipts, and that payments from these \n     funds would similarly be considered in the calculation of \n     total outlays.\n       Thus, if the proposed amendment was ratified, then Congress \n     would appear to be without the authority to exclude the \n     Social Security trust funds from the calculation of total \n     receipts and outlays under section 1 of the amendment.\n\n  There has also been an allegation made that statutes never have been \nincorporated in the Constitution and this would be unprecedented, \nconstitutionalizing a statute.\n  As I have said before, Mr. President, if a statute is included in the \nconstitutional amendment, it is no longer a statute. We have \nestablished through Senator Feinstein and the Senator from Nevada that \nevery constitutional amendment has a spate of accompanying legislation \nthat implements legislation, and that is why we talk about the 16th \namendment, IRS.\n  I think, more importantly, you should know though, this is the first \ntime in the history of this country that we have attempted to affix \nfiscal policy in the Constitution. So if we are talking about fiscal \npolicy, should we not be concerned about one of the largest fiscal \nelements of our society, namely, Social Security?\n  We are also told if Social Security is put off budget, then Congress \nwould have to raise taxes or cut spending to meet this year's deficit \nand future years'.\n  That is the whole point of the amendment. We do not believe that the \nbudget should be camouflaged as to its deficit component by Social \nSecurity surpluses, and that is what would be happening if this \namendment is passed without exempting Social Security.\n  The Senator from New Mexico and others have said on occasion that \nexempting Social Security in the constitutional amendment would create \na loophole.\n  Well, Mr. President, as I have stated briefly, after Senator Domenici \nspoke, in section 7 of this proposed constitutional amendment, Social \nSecurity receipts are lumped into the general budgets of this country. \nThe only way that you could change Social Security, as Senator Domenici \nhas said--he acknowledged our previous statement--is if in fact you get \n60 votes. So I think creating a loophole is a real stretch.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are some other things that I desire to say, \nbut I have been in the Chamber now for some time as the manager of this \namendment, and I see two Senators in the Chamber. I would be happy to \nyield to them if in fact they desire to speak on this amendment. Could \nI inquire through the Chair if the Senator from Georgia and Oklahoma \nwish to speak on the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I do desire to speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering, Mr. President--we have until 5 o'clock--if \nperhaps we could enter into some type of agreement--I know we did that \nearlier in the day--and save Senators hustling around. We have about 40 \nminutes left. How long, may I inquire through the Chair, does the \nSenator from Georgia wish to speak?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would only require 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. He is not speaking today.\n  Mr. REID. I would yield the floor to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment as \noffered by my friend from Nevada and the language that has been \nembraced by the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. President, throughout this debate and, for that matter, \nthroughout the last several years as we talked about the balanced \nbudget amendment I have watched Members of Congress, House and Senate, \ncome before the American people and repeatedly say almost with \nabandon--and that may be the right word--they support a balanced budget \namendment. In the President's State of the Union Address, he told us \nthat he supported a balanced budget amendment. Of course, within a week \nhe submitted a budget that nowhere approached a balanced budget and did \nnot even make an attempt to move toward one. And of course, with all \nthe statements that we have heard from both sides of the aisle, all \nacross the board, Republican and Democrat, and for years that said they \nwere for a balanced budget, I think the American people can come to the \nconclusion after 25 or 30 years that must not mean very much because we \njust do not produce balanced budgets.\n  Worse yet, we have spent every dime we have--$5 trillion that we do \nnot have, 30 percent of the property tax base of America through the \negregious unfunded mandates, and now we are in the process of spending \nthe Treasury, so to speak, of the children and grandchildren of \nAmerica--in every corner we can find. So I do not believe that people \nof the country can take much comfort from a President who says he \nsupports a balanced budget but does not offer one, or from the Members \nof Congress, no matter what side of the aisle, who come before us and \nsay they are for balanced budgets but never produce one.\n  Now, the Constitution is our conceptual law. It is an acknowledgment \nthat to manage the affairs of this great Nation there must be core \nlaw--core law.\n  So this idea that we can do this--and this does not need to be added \nto the Constitution--is a specious argument because there is no issue \nof greater concern to the health and the future of our country than its \nfiscal health. No family, no business, no community, State, or nation \ncan conduct the affairs required of it if they are financially \nunhealthy. And the United States is on the verge of enormous financial \ndestabilization.\n  So it is absolutely logical that we now add to our core law a process \nby which we will govern and assure the people of the country sound \nfinancial fiscal law.\n  With regard to the amendment, in my judgment, any amendment of \nexemption makes the law virtually moot because that exemption will \nultimately be the vehicle by which all the pressures we have suffered \nthis last quarter century will focus, whether it is 60 votes or a \nmajority--all the pressures to keep doing what we are doing and to \nresist change will collapse with the full weight of the last 25 years \non the exemption, no matter what it is.\n  Now, we have focused on Social Security here time and time again. I \nhave to say that I believe this is used to raise fear in our country, \nand it is used as a vehicle with which to block the concept of core law \nthat will manage our financial affairs.\n  Now, if you are for a balanced budget and keep saying so, then you \nwould obviously vote for a balanced budget amendment. And if you are \nworried about Social Security--and everybody says they are on both \nsides of the aisle--then the first thing you have to do is to produce \nfiscal health. Otherwise, Social Security and every other meaningful \nprogram in our country will fall victim to a financially destabilized \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I would just say that we are very dangerously close to \nbeing \n[[Page S2557]] the first generation of Americans that would be willing \nto turn over to the future of our Nation a country that is financially \ndestabilized and unable to properly care for itself.\n  Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would be glad to yield if I am within \nthe time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator said something about how long we have been \ntalking about the balanced budget amendment, and tomorrow I plan to go \nback and revisit an experience I had with Senator Carl Curtis, a former \nSenator, conservative Senator who was the father of the balanced budget \nconcept way back in 1972.\n  At that time, when his idea was to get three-fourths of the States to \nratify, force Congress to do this instead of talking about it, he \nbrought up at that time that every time it has been brought up it has \nbeen killed by someone who wanted to have an exception to it written \ninto the Constitution, knowing full well that it will not work.\n  Does the Senator think that after 22 years, people out there are now \ngoing to be in a position to demand that we quit talking about it and \ndo it?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct in the \nassertion of his statement. The American people want the balanced \nbudget amendment passed. It was the centerpiece in the election just \nconcluded; 70 or 80 percent, depending on whose poll you read, want \nthis balanced budget amendment passed, and the reason is they have \nheard us say we are for a balanced budget time and time again--they \nheard the President say it just the other night--and then within hours \nin history reverse themselves and do nothing to produce it. And so they \ncome to believe that the only way our system will be disciplined enough \nin the core responsibility of caring for the financial health is for it \nto be written in the core document that governs the United States, that \nis, the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I certainly will.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Does the State of Georgia have a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes, they do. It goes further than this one. If the \nGovernor fails to meet it, he goes to prison.\n  I remember very well when I first went to the State senate, within \nseveral years, we were going to exceed our revenues by some $120 \nmillion. The Governor was forced, choosing this over prison, to call a \nspecial session, and we found a way to eliminate the expenditure of \n$120 million.\n  Now, if that amendment, a requirement and discipline, I might point \nout to the Senator from Oklahoma, if it had not been in place, do you \nthink we could have come into special session? Do you think we would \nhave taken on the hard job of finding where to eliminate $120 million?\n  The answer is no. It required a discipline built into our core \ngovernance, the Constitution of the State of Georgia, to force us to \nmake the hard decisions, which we did. We fought about them. We set our \npriorities, made the decision, and went home. Some were happy, some \nwere not, but we made the decision, Mr. President. We made the \ndecision. And we kept the finances of the State of Georgia intact. I \nmight add that the financial health of my home State is considerably \nimproved over the financial health of our home nation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I asked that question \nbecause in the State of Oklahoma, I went back and read extensively \nabout our balanced budget amendment which we passed in 1941. The \ninteresting thing is the same arguments that are being used today in \nthis forum were used back then, saying that it would not work, and it \nhas worked since 1941. It would not have worked if it had not been in \nthe constitution.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Senator from \nNevada for yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my friends from \nGeorgia and Oklahoma a couple things. First, I want the record to be \nvery clear the majority leader, the Republican leader, has been \nentirely fair with this Senator and those of us sponsoring this \namendment. Going into this I asked the senior Senator from Utah that we \nbe given enough time, because of the importance of this amendment, to \ndebate the issue. We have had that opportunity. It is my understanding \nthe leadership is now working on a time sometime tomorrow that we will \nvote on this amendment. I think we have had an adequate time to debate \nthis issue, for which I am publicly thankful to the majority leader.\n  The point that I raise here is there has been no effort to stall \nthis. We have had a full and complete debate. I do not think we have \nhad a quorum call, to my knowledge, during the entire time that my \namendment has been debated.\n  I do say, however, in response to some of the statements raised by \nthe Senator from Georgia that people are trying to raise the fear of \nSocial Security recipients: Mr. President, I am not trying to raise the \nfear of Social Security recipients. I am trying to inform the Social \nSecurity recipients of the facts. And the facts are, if this amendment \npasses, the underlying amendment, Social Security will be included in \nthe general funds of this budget. I do not know if that will cause fear \nto be instilled in senior citizens. If it does not, it should, because \nclearly the American public, who badly want a balanced budget \namendment, do not want Social Security receipts to be part of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  My friend from Georgia said 70 or 80 percent of the people want a \nbalanced budget amendment. That is true. But 90 percent of the people \nof this country want a balanced budget amendment that excludes Social \nSecurity.\n  While it is not a big issue and not part of this amendment--and my \nsupport of the balanced budget amendment is not contingent upon a \ncapital budget--I think it is fair to inform everyone that the States \nof Georgia and probably Oklahoma and I know Nevada have a balanced \nbudget requirement but they exclude capital expenditures. We have a \nbeautiful new building in Las Vegas, a State building. But that State \nbuilding was paid for with bonds, or a considerable part of it. Bonds. \nThat is moneys that are paid on time, so to speak, like when we \npersonally buy a home or we buy a car personally, or a company buys a \npiece of equipment. Not often is cash paid for it.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama here. \nDoes the Senator wish some time?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Yes, I would appreciate some time.\n  Mr. REID. Please proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, so we have some \norder, that when the distinguished Senator from Alabama completes his \nremarks in the time he desires, then we move to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee so we can keep some sort of an order here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the resolution calling \nfor a balanced budget amendment. I think it is long overdue. It \nprovides the discipline that is absolutely essential if we are going to \nbalance the budget and eliminate deficit spending. However, I do feel \nin a balanced budget resolution we ought to provide for the absolute \ntruth as it would apply to deficit spending, at least to the extent of \nhaving Social Security off budget and not a part of the overall budget.\n  When Social Security was created in 1935, it was created as a trust \nfund to be held separate and apart from the general operating budget of \nthe Government. That was true up until 1969, when it was used to, \nreally, hide the true deficits that were occurring as a result of the \nVietnam war and some other matters that called for the expenditure of \nfunds.\n  In 1990, we attempted to take Social Security off budget and have \ntruth in the budget. That was the intent but, \n[[Page S2558]] under some mechanisms and maneuvers, we do not really \nhave it today.\n  The amendment calling for a balanced budget would mean that we would \nhave Social Security funds included in the budget process for the \ngeneral operating budget, and this causes me concern. I have looked at \nfigures of projections which the Social Security Administration has \nworked up relative to the amount of excess of receipts over outlays, or \nsurpluses, that are occurring. In 1995, which is the present fiscal \nyear we are in, the Social Security trust fund will have a surplus of \n$69 billion; in 1996, $73 billion; 1997, $78 billion; 1998, $84 \nbillion; 1999, $90 billion. In the year 2000, $96 billion.\n  I do not have the figures, but as I understand it, they continue to \ngrow and we will say, by the year 2001, it is in excess of $100 \nbillion.\n  The present projected deficits, according to the President's budget \nand otherwise, indicate that at around the year 2001 we will have \ndeficit spending around $200 billion. According to the Social Security \nAdministration, the surplus in the Social Security trust fund in the \nyear 2001 will be $951.8 billion. What happens to that surplus? The \nsurplus is invested with the idea of drawing interest in order that \nthat interest can compound the assets each fiscal year to make it grow. \nWe hear the term that it is designed to make it more actuarially sound.\n  So you have interest that is then growing, and in the year 2001, \naccording to the Social Security Administration, they anticipate--and \nit is based on factors based largely on interest rates today--that the \nSocial Security trust fund will yield about $63.3 billion in interest \nin the year 2001.\n  So we have coming in $100 billion and $58 billion from interest, \nmaking approximately a total of $158 billion that will be coming \navailable as surplus interest and surplus payments in the year 2001. \nThe year 2001 is the year before 2002, which is the target date for \nbalancing the budget.\n  So you say if Social Security is a part of the budget, then in the \nyear 2001, we will find--the projections on the deficit spending as of \nthat year would be $200 billion--if you allocate toward the reduction \nof the deficit $158 billion, coming from principal that comes in to be \npaid plus $58 billion that would be drawn on interest on the surplus, \nit would leave $42 billion that you would have to cut in programs.\n  It seems to me that if you were at the stage of that and you were \nattempting to balance the budget and to bring about a reduction of \nspending in unwise programs, you would not want to be in that position. \nBut under the language here, under the definition of total receipts, \nthe total receipts include all receipts of the Government except those \nthat are obtained or derived from borrowing. So, therefore, it is \nmandatory that at least $100 billion of the principal has to be \nincluded on the receipts side relative to the balancing of the budget.\n  This matter of attributable interest causes me concern. The \ndefinition of total receipts shall include all receipts of the U.S. \nGovernment except those derived from borrowing. Therefore, when the \nSocial Security surplus, nearly $1 trillion in the year 2001, has been \ninvested and you bring in the money that has been obtained from \nborrowing, it means, therefore, that the interest, the attributable \ninterest, is not included. One would think it would be included from \nthe borrowing. But when it comes to the outlays, it is excepted because \nof the fact that you cannot allow under the definition of outlays to \npay back interest under the concept of the budget. So, therefore, you \nare in a situation where the total receipts shall include all receipts \nof the U.S. Government except those derived from borrowing. That means \nyou include all receipts that the Social Security tax pays, and it is \nrequired that you have to do it.\n  The money that is invested by Social Security funds can be paid back, \nand they will be paid back, because it says total outlays shall include \nall outlays of the U.S. Government except those for the repayment of \ndebt principal--debt principal--but it does not guarantee necessarily \nthat the interest will be included in the budget. Therefore, it puts it \ninto a situation of uncertainty as to whether or not the interest will \nbe repaid. But the debt principal, of course, is not included in the \noutlays and, therefore, you have a problem that arises in connection \nwith that.\n  I think that we ought to at least, if the Reid amendment is defeated, \naddress the question of debt interest that is coming in regard to the \nSocial Security Administration. This is sort of a complicated concept. \nBut it ought to be that attributable interest is also kept off budget, \nand that we do not have to depend on the payment of interest to come \nfrom actual outlays that are appropriated under the general budget \nbecause it is a temptation. And it may well be that they will be \nrepaid. But there is no guarantee that the debt principal interest, the \ninterest that is grown, will be repaid relative to that matter.\n  I think there are a lot of things pertaining to the Social Security \namendment of Senator Reid that are very important. I think it is one of \nthe most consequential votes of this young session of Congress that we \nhave had.\n  I want to rise to voice my strong support for Senator Reid's \namendment exempting Social Security receipts and outlays from the \nbudget. Social Security is the Federal Government's original contract \nwith America. I believe Senator Reid used that word in one of his \nspeeches. If the Reid amendment does not pass, then we will be breaking \nthat contract, and we will ultimately be forced to balance the budget \non the backs of hardworking Americans who have contributed toward their \nretirement with a portion of each paycheck.\n  This provision says it is a protection for all Americans who pay into \nthe program. There is no question that, under the language in the \nbalanced budget amendment resolution now pending, the Social Security \ntrust fund will no longer be completely safe for future generations.\n  The Reid amendment seeks to correct the deficient language so as to \nuphold the original contract with America, one that has lived up to its \nintent like few other Government contracts have. The amendment is very \nsimple. It protects the Social Security Program by excluding the \nreceipts and the outlays in the system from the budget.\n  Social Security is not causing the deficit. Its revenues and \nsurpluses should not be used to mask the receipts, nor should its \noutlays be counted as part of expenditures. We should keep in mind that \nSocial Security is a program self-financed from contributions by \nemployers and employees, which does not contribute one cent to the \ndeficit. In fact, in 1990, Congress included a provision in the Budget \nEnforcement Act declaring that funds off budget, much like our personal \nsavings accounts, are not counted towards the budget.\n  The current underlying resolution, if not amended, would clearly put \nSocial Security on budget, and thus overturn the decision 5 years ago \nto affirm the off-budget status of Social Security.\n  As we debate and develop the balanced budget amendment, we need to be \ncertain that we protect the integrity of the Social Security System and \nmaintain truth in budgeting. The protection of this self-funded program \ncan only be accomplished by keeping it off budget and out of the \nbalanced budget equation.\n  This vote should be easy. The bottom line is that we are voting on \nwhether or not to protect the true contract with America, Social \nSecurity. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of protecting the terms \nof this sacred contract and covenant, and keep Social Security in its \nprotected position as a trust fund separate and distinct from the \nFederal budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we have been debating the balanced \nbudget amendment now over a 15-day period--or about 11 days of debate. \nI think it is very important that we step back and reconsider the \nfundamental question that we are dealing with here, and that is whether \nor not we are going to take the steps necessary to put ourselves in a \nposition of dealing with the problems facing the next generation, or \nwhether or not we are going to go down the same old road and proceed to \nbankrupt that generation.\n  There is nothing more fundamental in human nature than looking out \nfor \n[[Page S2559]] one's offspring, for the people that we bring into the \nworld. I am not sure we have done a very good job of that so far. We \nhave an opportunity to do that with the balanced budget amendment.\n  We have heard several amendments discussed over this 15-day period. \nMany of those amendments would defeat the balanced budget amendment if \nadopted. I respectfully submit that the Reid amendment under present \nconsideration would fit that category and would defeat the amendment if \nadopted. Many good arguments have been made against this amendment. One \nis that it would be a loophole through which anything could be driven \nand will obviate the purpose of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Senator Hatch from Utah this morning pointed out that the adoption of \nthis amendment would put into the Constitution very complex language \nwhich would create a field day for lawyers, and it does not belong in a \nconstitutional amendment. I believe the most important part is to \nunderstand the protection issue. This amendment is being set forth as \nprotection for Social Security. Social Security, and the protection of \nit, is something we are all committed to. We have made that commitment \nby vote and we have made that commitment by voice in this body. We will \ncontinue to make that commitment.\n  But the fact of the matter is that the safety of Social Security \ndepends upon the commitments of this and future Congresses as we \nproceed, and not upon the language of this amendment. If this amendment \nis adopted, it will do nothing to prevent future taxes of Social \nSecurity. If this amendment is adopted, it will do nothing to prevent \ncuts in Social Security in the future. It is essentially a bookkeeping \nmeasure. The proponents of this amendment rightfully point out that at \nthe present time the surplus in the Social Security trust fund does \nassist in making our deficit picture look a little better, as bleak as \nthat is. That is a short-term consideration, Mr. President.\n  The fact of the matter is that within a relatively few years, \ndepending on how you calculate the Federal Government employer part of \nit, in 2010 or 2013 the Social Security trust fund is going to be in \nthe red and the real protection for Social Security again is not in \nthis amendment, which I think really in many respects would endanger it \nmore than it already is. The real protection is in balancing the \nbudget.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind two factors that are driving \nthis debate. One is the fact that the Social Security trust fund will \nbe going into the red in the not-too-distant future. It is right around \nthe corner. The second is the phenomenon of the interest on the debt.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the interest on the debt right now \nconstitutes--or will in a couple of years--the second highest \nexpenditure of our Federal budget and will continue in that direction \nas far as the eye can see. Those two factors go on together. I submit, \nMr. President, they constitute the real danger to Social Security. All \nprograms are going to be squeezed if this scenario continues to play \nout in the current direction if we do nothing about it. All programs \nare going to be squeezed and those programs applying high expenditures, \nsuch as Social Security, will be high on the list and under close \nobservation, Mr. President, if we come to that point.\n  Let us consider separately those two factors I just mentioned. \nInterest on the debt. Interest payments on the debt are currently $235 \nbillion. They are expected to rise to about $5 trillion by the year \n2030 under current circumstances. This is according to the Commission \non Entitlements. Interest payments on the debt currently accounts for \napproximately 22 percent of the general non-Social Security revenue. By \nthe year 2030, Mr. President, interest payments on the debt will \naccount for approximately 75 percent of general revenues.\n  Let us consider the Social Security trust fund for a minute, the \nsecond part of that equation. We will start to go into the general fund \nto meet current Social Security liabilities by the year 2010, which is \nright around the corner. We will need an additional $850 billion in the \nyear 2030 alone over anticipated Social Security receipts to meet \ncurrent liabilities. That is an additional $850 billion if we proceed \nunder current circumstances. So by the year 2030, we will have Social \nSecurity needing about an additional $850 billion, at the same time \nthat interest payments on the debt are exceeding 75 percent of general \nrevenue. You can see where that takes us.\n  The sum of interest payments and Social Security equals just under $6 \ntrillion. General revenues are expected to be just over $6 trillion. \nClearly, this is a catastrophe waiting to happen, Mr. President. We \ncannot sustain that trend.\n  What else will be going on if this scenario plays out? These are just \nnumbers. What is going to be going on in the real world? Our savings \nrate is going to decline even further. That, in turn, will cause our \ninterest rates, now hurting, to decline even further. That, in fact, \nwill hamper our growth rate; it will hamper the standard of living for \nevery young couple starting out and trying to start a family. It is \nalready going down. We hear a lot of talk that the real income of \nworking Americans today has stagnated for some time now in this \ncountry. The other part of this story is that for younger Americans, \nsince 1973, the real income for them has actually gone down. This \neconomy is slowing down. We talk about what happened last quarter or \nthe quarter before last, but if you take the long-term trend, this \neconomy is slowing down. Our investment rate is slowing down. Our \nsavings rate, which produces that investment, is slowing down. As \ninterest takes a bigger and bigger chunk of the savings dollar, there \nis less there for private investment. Interest rates will go up and \ntaxes will go up astronomically. We all know the demographics, and \nbefore long we are going to have a smaller and smaller working force, \ntaking care of a larger and larger retired population.\n  Some people even talk in terms of a generational war--a generational \nwar, Mr. President. Surely we can do better than that. That is the real \ndanger to Social Security. If that happens, if we get to that point, if \nwe get to a 70-percent tax rate, if we get to an economy slowing down, \nif young working people see this is happening to them and these figures \ngo out of sight, nothing is going to be safe, including Social \nSecurity. We must avoid that, and the only way to do that is by a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  We have already turned ourselves from a creditor nation into a debtor \nnation. We already have the lowest savings rate among all of the \nindustrialized countries. We have now one of the lowest investment \nrates of any of the industrialized countries. We must be able to see \nthe handwriting on the wall. The only other options would be to cut \nSocial Security dramatically, raise taxes dramatically, keep raising \nthe deficit, or not fund anything else, such as defense, \ninfrastructure, Medicaid, or any of those things that we know we must \nfund.\n  Had we balanced the budget in 1981, based on the law passed at that \npoint--as the President recalls, the history is replete with instances \nof failed attempts to balance the budget. We have declared it to be a \nnational priority. We have put it into law in 1979. But even the year \nwe put it into law, there was a $79 billion deficit. Failed attempt \nafter failed attempt, Mr. President. If we, in effect, had balanced the \nbudget, as the law required in 1981, our interest payments today would \nbe only $45 billion, compared to the $234 billion. And it is almost \n$200 billion less than we are paying today. Indeed had we balanced the \nbudget beginning in 1981, interest payments would be so much lower that \nby this year we could have a balanced budget and still spend virtually \nthe same amount as actually is being spent on noninterest spending.\n  Therefore, I urge that we not lose sight of what we are about here. \nThis amendment does not protect Social Security; in fact, it endangers \nit. The only true protection for Social Security is the passing of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n                           the reid amendment\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Reid amendment \nwhich would make crystal clear that if a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget does pass the Senate--I know it is going to be a \nvery, very close vote. So it is very difficult to tell whether that \nwill happen--that there will be language that will ensure that \n[[Page S2560]] Social Security and Social Security trust funds will not \nbe used for the purposes of deficit reduction as spelled out in the \nbalanced budget amendment goal.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear in the beginning that I believe the \nSocial Security trust fund, as we look well into the next century and \nreally not that far into the next century, just in terms of its own \ntrend lines and making sure that it is self-supporting, that reforms \nwill be necessary, that there are steps that we are going to have to \ntake, and difficult decisions will have to be made. But, Mr. President, \nthe reason I feel strongly about the Reid amendment is this is a \nseparate trust fund, and indeed, as other Senators have said, if we are \ngoing to be talking about contracts, Social Security is a contract with \nmany Americans.\n  So, Mr. President, there is no question in my mind that this trust \nfund should be kept separate, that when we look at Social Security--and \nwe do this as a Nation and we take steps that we need to take to make \nthis trust fund work well into the next century--we should do so. But \nthat money should be kept separate. That issue should be kept separate. \nThat should not be part of the effort to balance the budget by the year \n2002. I think the only way we live up to our commitment with older \nAmericans and their children and their grandchildren is to make it \ncrystal clear through this Reid amendment.\n  The second point: There was a reason for passage of the Social \nSecurity bill in 1935. It used to be that in the United States of \nAmerica, if you were to look to see where the vast majority of poor \npeople lived and who they were, they were disproportionately the \nelderly. There is an obvious reason, which is after people became older \nand no longer were able to work, and employment earnings severely \ndropped and, therefore, many of our elderly citizens were destitute. \nThe Social Security Program, because it is universal, because it is a \nsacred contract, has been, I think along with the GI bill of rights, \none of our two or three most successful programs. And, as a matter of \nfact, poverty has dramatically declined among older Americans. It is no \nlonger the case that we find the poverty disproportionate among the \nelderly within our country.\n  The third point: I make the argument that it has been an extremely \nimportant program. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, this is truly a \nmiddle-class program. It is as if middle-class people and working \nfamilies through their own sweat equity and their own work were able to \nin 1935 effect a huge accomplishment which changed our country forever, \nand for the better. That is Social Security.\n  Mr. President, what I resent in some of the discussions about Social \nSecurity and Social Security recipients is this caricature that we have \ntoo many older Americans who are ``greedy geezers playing golf every \nday.'' That is simply not true. It is simply not true.\n  Mr. President, as a matter of fact, there are many people--40 \npercent--for whom Social Security is really their sole source of \nretirement income. I will never forget in a cafe called Wimpy's Cafe in \nFaribault, MN, two elderly women, not that long ago, said to me: \n``Senator, we receive, altogether, I do not know, like $440 a month. Do \nnot cut our Social Security payment; it is what we depend on. Senator, \nwe are terrified that is what you are going to do.''\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we are not going to \ndo that. If that is the case, then let us ensconce that as part of the \nconstitutional amendment, make it a part of the constitutional \namendment. That is what the Reid amendment says.\n  Mr. President, the fourth point is that it bothers me no end that we \ncontinue to focus on--or at least some do--this kind of generational \nconflict. I have not been to one gathering of older Americans, of \nsenior citizens in Minnesota, where people have not said to me that one \nof their top three issues are children, which in many cases are their \ngrandchildren. It strikes me that this is a program that is sacred, \nthis is a program that is a sacred trust, and this is a program that if \nwe are going to make any changes, they ought to be made with the \ncommunity and it ought to be made viewing Social Security as a separate \ntrust fund and a separate program. We have to make sure that there is \nnot a raid on the revenues of this program right now to be used for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, let me make one or two final points. One has to do \nwith what I said last week on the floor of the Senate. I just want to \nsound the alarm that each and every Senator, regardless of his or her \nparty, is held accountable for the remarks we make on the floor of the \nSenate. I take any speech or remarks on the floor of the Senate very \nseriously, first of all, because of the honor of being here.\n  Mr. President, when we look at this balanced budget amendment and we \nunderstand the projections on the amount of money that is to be saved \nby 2002, the amount of budget cuts that have to take place --and we are \ntalking somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.3 trillion, and we are \ntalking about cutting taxes. As I said the other day, there is an old \nYiddish proverb that you cannot dance at two weddings at the same time. \nYou cannot talk about cutting taxes and increasing the Pentagon's \nbudget and paying interest on the debt and say Social Security is going \nto remain separate--what is left to cut? Medicare is much like Social \nSecurity. It is a sacred trust with the elderly in our country.\n  Mr. President, in 1965, much like in 1935, our parents and our \ngrandparents changed the United States of America for the better. And \nthe Medicare program, imperfections and all, is a program that, for \nmany elderly people, is the difference between being able to live the \nend of their lives with dignity as opposed to being destitute because \nof medical bills.\n  Mr. President, we ought to be straightforward with people that there \nare going to be draconian cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. Fifty percent \nof Medicaid goes for elderly and nursing home care. I can tell you that \nin my State of Minnesota, doctors, clinics, hospitals and the elderly \nare very worried; some of them are downright terrified. It is not \nbecause people are using scare tactics; they have reason to be scared \nbecause there will have to be, on present course if this balanced \nbudget amendment is passed, deep cuts in those medical programs.\n  Mr. President, if there are deep cuts--and there will be--then I \nwonder why, as I said last week, the very Senators who, when it came to \nhealth care reform last session and when we were talking about \nuniversal coverage, were yelling and screaming about rationing and lack \nof choice, now when we are about to pass a constitutional amendment--\nmaybe, maybe not--but we do not list where the cuts are going to take \nplace, because we know we are going to have deep cuts in Medicare--and \nsome want to cut Social Security, and we know they want deep cuts in \nMedicaid--the very Senators who know that and know this is going to \nlead to rationing among the elderly, the poor and the disabled, are \nsilent.\n  That is what I find to be so disingenuous about this amendment and \nthe failure on our part, as Senators, to step up to the plate and be \nclear with people as to where we are going to make the cuts, as to what \nour priorities are, as to what kind of choices we are going to make.\n  So I think the Reid amendment is an extremely important amendment. I \nthink if Senators believe that the Social Security trust fund should be \nkept separate, then they should vote for the Reid amendment. It is \nsimple. In a sense, it is sort of like not separating the votes you \ncast from the words you speak.\n  And, by the way, I think it is not just Social Security. It is also \nthe very question of Medicare.\n  Finally, because I think this is what this debate is all about, it is \ninteresting to me that now what I see happening in Minnesota is a lot \nof the education people, not just the teachers or college presidents, \nbut, all of a sudden, students are saying, wait a minute, you say you \nare for the middle class, and our understanding is that there are going \nto have to be significant cuts in Pell grant and on campus need-based \nlow interest loan programs? If you are for the middle class, Senators, \nthen do not cut the very programs that enable our children to have a \nchance to be able to afford their education.\n  Mr. President, I find it interesting that Senators do not want to \nvote to keep the Social Security trust fund \n[[Page S2561]] separate--though I hope we win that vote--and are not \nwilling to go on record saying we will do nothing that will create more \nhunger or homelessness among children. I lost twice on that amendment. \nThey are silent as to all the rationing that is going to take place \nbecause of deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. They have not been \nforthright with the vast majority of Americans, who, all the time, \nwonder how they are going to be able to afford higher education for \ntheir children because we know we are going to be cutting some of those \nprograms. But when it comes to subsidies for oil companies, \npharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, all sorts of loopholes \nand deductions, adding up, I might add, to hundreds of billions of \ndollars, they are silent. I would think that would be part of the way \nin which we do deficit reduction. But none of us will know unless we \nare willing to lay out our budget plan before we vote for a balanced \nbudget amendment. That is what is wrong about our approach.\n  With those remarks, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when the roll is called on this \namendment, every American will begin to get a much clearer picture of \nhow a constitutional amendment to balance the budget will affect them.\n  Only by adopting the Reid amendment, will the U.S. Senate prove that \nSocial Security is safe. That's why I urge its adoption. Even though I \nintend to vote against the Reid amendment to protect Social Security \nand the promise that has been made to the people of my State and the \nrest of America.\n  If the Reid amendment is rejected, or dropped along the way, it will \nbe the equivalent of posting a danger sign in front of every household \nthat counts on Social Security today or sometime in the distant future.\n  Our colleagues promoting this balanced budget amendment can promise \nin every way they know how that they'll leave Social Security alone \nafter they get the constitutional amendment ratified. But unless the \nConstitution also reminds them of their promise, the pressure to nip, \nto tuck, and do much more to Social Security could be unstoppable.\n  This constitutional amendment for balancing the budget is not just a \nstatement of support for the idea. It is a plan to put the Federal \nbudget on a speeding train. It will require something in the \nneighborhood of $1 trillion in spending cuts over 7 years. Just imagine \nwhat Congress will have to consider when the clock on those 7 years \nstarts ticking. You can just hear the talk already. Social Security has \nto be on the table. How can we get $1 trillion or more without all of \nthe entitlements--without Social Security, without Medicare, without \nbenefits for disabled veterans?\n  Mr. President, I actually don't know how. I believe that the worst \npart of this constitutional amendment is the fact that its very \nproponents don't know how they will rush their way to its destination. \nAnd because I see Social Security as just one of the sacred trusts that \nmight get town up on the way, I don't support this idea.\n  But the Reid amendment is one way to keep Social Security off the \ntrack of a train that could very well mow down any number of things \nimportant to the lives, the hopes, the expectations of our people--from \nvaccinations for children to home health care for seniors to the way we \nrepay our debt to disabled veterans.\n  As my colleagues think about the underlying legislation and the more \nimmediate vote on the Reid amendment to protect the Social Security \ntrust funds, I urge you to take a look at letters from seniors in you \nState to get a sense of what is at stake. I have, and it is sobering.\n  Skip the impersonal postcards generated by interest groups. Skip the \nform letters when people's names roll out of computers. But take the \ntime to pick up the personal letters, with scrawled handwriting, from \nsenior citizens who are truly frightened about, what will happen to \nthem if the Social Security trust fund is unprotected and this balanced \nbudget amendment passes.\n  I have hundreds of such letters, and let me paraphrase the style. \nTake a letter I got that starts with:\n\n       * * * I am 69 and worked every day of my life until I had \n     to retire. I paid into Social Security since the beginning. I \n     collect $600 or $800 in Social Security a month, but my bills \n     are more than that * * *\n\n  I have letters where seniors from my State painstakingly list their \nmonthly expenses--rent, heat, food, and prescriptions. They ask me what \ncan they do if Social Security or Medicare is cut? Where can they turn \nin the twilight years of their lives?\n  I don't know what to tell them. And I ask my colleagues who support \nthe balanced budget amendment, and who oppose the Reid amendment, what \ndo you tell the senior citizens of your States?\n  I can only tell West Virginians that I keep fighting to uphold the \npromise made to them--the benefits they earned by contributing to the \nSocial Security system throughout their working years and careers.\n  Over a quarter of a million West Virginia senior citizens rely on \nSocial Security benefits, and nationwide almost 30 million seniors get \nbenefits. For many, their monthly Social Security check is the \ndifference between poverty and independence; the difference between \nbuying groceries or going hungry. Thirty-eight percent of senior \ncitizens are not living in poverty, thanks to Social Security. This is \na tremendous achievement that we can be proud of, and should protect \nand continue.\n  Our challenge, as I see it, is No. 1, to protect Social Security now \nfor the seniors living on fixed incomes, and No. 2, to plan ahead to \nensure that Social Security is there when the young workers \ncontributing over 7 percent of the wages are ready to retire. Passing \nthis constitutional amendment to balance the budget without the Reid \namendment is one way to guarantee that we will fail to meet either of \nthese challenges.\n  We must protect the Social Security trust funds from becoming a pawn \nin a political debate over a balanced budget amendment, which sounds so \nreasonable and so simple.\n  Here is an example where the devil lies in the future details. The \ndetails that the proponents refuse to spell out. When the right-to-know \namendment was rejected, we were told in no uncertain terms that we are \nall to strap ourselves into the speeding train, and to stop worrying \nabout what and who get trampled along the way.\n  This does not say that over the next decade that Social Security will \nnot need to change--it will. A recent report of its trustees clearly \nshows that a long-term solvency problem threatens the Social Security \ntrust funds.\n  If changes are not made, the trust funds will be exhausted in 2029. \nWe have to begin working on solutions to this danger facing Social \nSecurity, to restore the integrity of the trust funds just as \ncourageous members of this body did in the past, most recently through \nbipartisan legislation in 1983.\n  But any change made to Social Security should be designed to \nstrengthen the trust funds--not to surrender to the speed-chase started \nrecklessly by this constitutional balanced budget amendment.\n  This balanced budget amendment is a game. It allows politicians to \npromise to be deficit hawks without requiring a single clue on what \nthey will actually cut.\n  And because I fear, for the people of West Virginia, what the hidden \nagendas are in this amendment, I support this explicit method for \nmaking absolutely sure that Social Security is left alone.\n  There is no other way that the senior citizens can count on their \nbenefits. There is no other way that the millions of working men and \nwomen who put aside part of their income every week, every month, every \nyear for Social Security, can be sure that they will see a dime of it \nback when they retire.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I rise today in support of the Reid amendment to exclude \nthe receipts and outlays of Social Security from the budget. I want to \ncommend the Senator from Nevada for his work on this important issue.\n  As Senator Reid noted last week, Congress ended the practice of \nmasking our deficit by excluding the Social Security trust fund from \nthe budget in 1990. That was a proper and necessary step then just as \nthis amendment is a proper and necessary step now.\n  The provision in 1990 was taken to ensure that the beneficiaries of \nthe Social Security trust fund could trust that Congress would stop the \npractice of using the fund to mask the deficit \n[[Page S2562]] and to ensure that the money put in the system would be \nthere when people retire.\n  That means simply that everyone of us has a right to know that when \nour money is taken out of our check today, it is put into a fund that \ncannot be raided and will be there for us when we retire.\n  Today as we have the serious proposal of passing a balanced budget \namendment in front of us, Congress is being called on again to ensure \nsome level of security for the beneficiaries of the trust fund. We have \na responsibility to every person in this country who pays Social \nSecurity taxes to ensure that their Government required investment in \ntheir future will be there when it is supposed to be.\n  I cannot emphasize this enough. We have a real responsibility to our \ncurrent beneficiaries and to those in the future.\n  The measures this body took in 1990 and before reaffirmed that \nresponsibility, and with consideration of the balanced budget \namendment, we once again are being called on to provide greater \nassurances to Social Security beneficiaries.\n  Given that, how can we in good conscience tell the American people \nthat they do not need to worry about their Social Security when we all \nknow that if this bill passes without this amendment, we cannot promise \nanything. Social Security will be on the chopping block along with all \nother programs.\n  I know we have to get our Federal budget in order. I have a \ncommitment to work on that as a member of the Budget Committee. I also \nknow we have to work on Social Security to ensure its long-term \nsolvency. We cannot achieve either of those goals by violating the \ntrust of the American people and going into the Trust Fund to balance \nthe budget.\n  Let me be clear. I believe we must work to balance our budget. I also \nbelieve that a constitutional requirement to do so is not sound policy, \nbut if this body is going to impose the constitutional amendment on us, \nif we are going to admit we are not strong enough to reduce spending \nwithout being forced to, then we have to let the American people know \nat a minimum that our elderly will not have to bear a disproportionate \nburden in this process.\n  We have to let the American people know that the Federal Government \nwill keep its promises and ensure that the money they put in this \nsystem now will be there for them when they retire. This amendment \nensures just that and I hope that my colleagues will support this \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise today in support of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, this vote has been described in historic terms. Only \nthe historians can make that decision, but a brief description of our \nbudget history might be instructive. In the heat of our arguments the \npast gets poorly presented.\n  Thomas Jefferson was not in the United States when the Constitution \nwas written. He was abroad representing the United States as our \nMinister to France. When he came back, he said, ``If I could add one \nAmendment to the Constitution, it would be to prohibit the Federal \nGovernment from borrowing funds.''\n  His reasoning was simple. ``We should consider ourselves unauthorized \nto saddle posterity with our debts,'' he said, ``and morally bound to \npay them ourselves.'' Thomas Jefferson, as in so many other areas, was \nahead of his time. For two centuries, this moral contract bound our \npredecessors. While debt was accumulated in times of dire national \nemergencies, in 1975 the debt stood at but $629 billion.\n  Since then, we have increased the debt by more than seven fold, \nstanding at $4.7 trillion today. The track record of the past two \ndecades, more than anything else, has led me to the point where I now \nreluctantly support amending the Constitution to impose a discipline on \nCongress which we all wish it had but know it lacks.\n  I agree with critics of the amendment that this is not something to \nundertake lightly. Since 1791, there have been over 10,000 \nconstitutional amendments offered in Congress. During this time, only \n22 of these 10,000 amendments have been deemed important enough by \nCongress to be passed. Of these 22, only 17 have been ratified by the \nStates and have become part of the Constitution.\n\n\n                       interest spent on our debt\n\n  What is the problem with our enormous debt today? The problem that \nexists today, Mr. President, is that the Federal Government owes more \nthan $4.7 trillion. Therefore, we must spend over $800 million on \ninterest every day--that's right, Mr. President, over $800 million on \ninterest every day--and this does absolutely nothing for us to help the \nneeds of all Americans. We send more to our bondholders in 3 days than \nwe do to every man, woman, and child in Vermont over the course of an \nentire year, making Federal interest payments the second largest \nspending item in the budget.\n  Mr. President, these interest payments are crippling our ability to \nadequately fund national priorities, such as education. We now spend \nfive and a half times as much on interest payments than we do for all \neducation, job training, and employment programs combined. We spend \ntwice as much on interest payments than we do on all Federal programs \nfor the poor.\n  In 1950, the publicly held debt per family was $5,800, today the debt \naverages about $54,000 per American family. If we do not balance the \nbudget by the year 2002, the debt burden per family will be a \nstaggering $78,000.\n  Interest on the debt is over $1,200 per person per year. At this \nrate, a child born today, living a normal lifespan of 75 years, will \npay some $135,000 in interest on the debt. That assumes that no further \ndebt is added and interest rates do not increase--both are highly \nunlikely.\n  When I came to Congress in 1975, our gross interest expenditure \ntotaled $49 billion. This year it is expected to be over $300 billion, \nmeaning that today every dollar in personal income taxes collected west \nof the Mississippi is used to pay for interest on our national debt. \nThe CBO estimates that in 10 years it will be over $650 billion and 35 \npercent of the revenue of the Federal Government will go just for debt \nservice. This assumes that there will be no increase in the current \ninterest rates.\n  Since 1975, our national debt has grown from $542 billion to $4.7 \ntrillion. It is expected to grow to $6.3 trillion by 1999--a 1,200-\npercent rate of growth since 1975. It this is the best case scenario, \nwe must get hold of this enormous problem as quickly as possible. The \nonly way I feel that this can be accomplished is by a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Back in 1975, every man, woman, and child owed $2,500 because of the \ndebt. That figure now stands at over $18,000. It is expected that the \namount of national debt that every man, woman, and child owes will \nincrease by $5,000 over the next 5 years to a staggering $23,000. The \nlast time we balanced the budget in 1969--only 9 cents of every Federal \ndollar went to pay interest. Today, 26 cents of every Federal dollar \ngoes to pay for interest on the national debt.\n  Furthermore, projections for our debt are frightening. It is expected \nto double to $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That means if we do \nnothing to balance the budget over the next 10 years, our interest \npayments will double to almost $2 billion a day. It is quite obvious \nthat this trend can not continue.\n           the national debt jeopardizes our economic future\n\n  Mr. President, the greatest economic threat this country is facing is \nout-of-control spending by the Federal Government.\n  Recently, the New York Federal Reserve Board reported that the Nation \nlost 5 percent in GDP due to the deficits in the 1980's--in other words \nour national income did not grow by an astonishing 5 percent. According \nto the CBO, 1 percent of growth is equal to creating 650,000 jobs. That \nmeans that the debt of the 1980's cost us over 3.5 million new jobs. \nMr. President, every dollar that goes to pay for the interest of our \nnational debt takes a dollar away from our economy to assist in \nproductivity increases. Congress can not continue to do this to our \nnational economy and, most importantly, to Americans. We can only guess \nwhere our economy would be if this Nation had a balanced budget \namendment before the 1980's.\n  The GAO recently released a report that a balanced budget by 2001 \nwould \n[[Page S2563]] create an average increase, adjusted for inflation, of \n36 percent for every American's standard of living. Further, since \n1960, the private savings rate has dropped from over 8 percent of our \neconomy to 5 percent. During the same time, the Federal Government \ndeficits have increased from less than 1 percent of the economy to more \nthan 3 percent, resulting in a net national savings rate of less than 3 \npercent. On this note, the OMB reports that if we balance the budget \nover the next 5 years, the net national savings rate would increase to \n6.1 percent. If nothing is done our national savings rate would be a \nmere 3 percent.\n  Over the past 15 years, our expenditures in inflation adjusted \npercentages from fiscal year 1980 to fiscal year 1994 have decreased \nFederal spending for education by 13 percent and transportation by 2 \npercent. On the other hand, defense expenditures were up by 18 percent \nand entitlement expenditures, mainly Social Security and Medicare, were \nup by 50 percent. However, our gross interest payments have grown 120 \npercent. Mr. President, this trend can not continue if this Nation is \ngoing to be able to continue educating our children to compete in this \nglobal economy.\n  If you were to ask what should the priorities of this Nation be? Let \nus just take a choice. Should we spend more money on education for the \nfuture of this Nation, or more money on interest? Well, it is clear \nwhat our choice would be--education. Yet, we have precisely reversed \nour priorities because we have been imprudent with our fiscal policy.\n\n\n                            savings and debt\n\n  Why are deficits so bad for our economy? First, deficits tend to \nconsume savings that we could use for truly productive investments. To \nfund these budget shortfalls, the Federal Government must keep \nborrowing, consuming limited capital. The resulting shortage of capital \nexerts an upward pressure on interest rates, recently done by the \nFederal Reserve, and further depresses economic activity.\n  Second, the budget deficit is eroding our economic standing relative \nto the rest of the world. Raising interest rates and discouraging \nprivate investment, the deficit has continued to slow our economic \ngrowth in terms of our Nation's productive capacity relative to other \nnations. An excellent example of this is the cost American business \npays to borrow capital, about 10 percent; compared to Japan, which can \nborrow money at under 5 percent. Clearly, American businesses are at a \ncompetitive disadvantage because of imprudent fiscal policies followed \nby the U.S. Government. Further evidence of this growing competitive \ndisadvantage can be found during the 1980's, when thousands of American \nbusinesses made the decision that they cannot afford high interest \nrates on future investments--investing instead overseas, where interest \nrates were more affordable. Because of our lack of fiscal restraint, \nAmerican firms are creating new jobs overseas and not in the United \nStates.\n  To further outline the economic incentives to relocate overseas a \nrecent hearing on education and the economy highlighted the tremendous \nfinancial pressures placed on American investments. In his testimony, \nAlan Wurtzel, vice chairman of Circuit City Stores, Inc. stated that \nour poor education system provides very few qualified and skilled \nworkers. For this reason, many firms find it more attractive to \nrelocate overseas where a highly skilled work force can produce quality \nproducts without extensive job training or skill enhancement.\n  Our performance in \nreindustrialization will \ncontinue to remain sluggish until we restore our economic health. This \ncannot be done when the Federal Government continues to run deficits. \nWithout increased productivity in this Nation, our wages can not \nincrease.\n  Even more significant to our international position, our debt has \nbeen the principal factor in the Nation's trade deficits. The CBO \nrecently estimated that over 50 percent of our trade deficit is from \nour Federal deficits. The CBO also reported that ``deficit reduction \nincreases investments, which in turn increase the productive capacity \nof the economy. Moreover, deficit reduction lowers borrowing from \nabroad, which reduces the amount of income that is generated in the \nUnited States but flows to foreigners.'' Not surprisingly, our trade \ndeficit remains a serious problem for our economy.\n\n\n               the need for the balanced budget amendment\n\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues have asked why do we need to \nhave a balanced budget amendment? They often cite the recent Treasury \nDepartment's study which indicates the possible effects on States and \ntheir finances if a constitutional amendment is passed. They often \ndiscuss the possible negative impact this amendment might have\n on their State. What this study does not discuss is what will happen \nto Federal spending if we do nothing. Or, if nothing is done to control \nFederal spending how this will adversely impact our childrens' future. \nWhat this study clearly shows is how far Federal spending is out of \nwhack. The bottom line in this budget battle is what is best for our \nchildren. I believe that for the good of our children we must end \nbudget deficits. Congress needs to learn what those in my home State's \ncapital, Montpelier and all other State capitals, take as an article of \nfaith--a balanced budget.\n\n  Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment is necessary from just \nwhat I outlined above. That is, Congress, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, are unable to make the tough choices necessary to balance \nthe budget. A prime example of not making the difficult choices \nnecessary to balance our budget can be found during the last Congress. \nTake for example, three battles last Congress on appropriation matters, \nas my colleagues will recall. One of these was an amendment to cut the \ndefense budget by only $1 billion--only one-third of 1 percent. The \nsecond fight was on continued funding for the space station. The third \nfight was on increasing the grazing fees to lower Federal costs.\n  How did we deal with these three appropriation battles? We \ncompromised by passing everything, and that is what we do day after \nday, year after year, piling up the debt for our children's children to \ntake care of. Over the past decade, the deficit numbers have worsened \nto the point that they are now deeply embedded in our budgets, in our \npriorities and even in our national consciousness. This constant \nbarrage of deficit spending seems to have given us a sense of numbness, \nmaking us feel that it is now beyond our control and not in the \ninterest of our national will.\n  Finally, over the next few days I plan to discuss what Congress can \nand cannot do to balance the budget. First, I will discuss the \ndesperate need to reinvigorate the American educational system. Our \npoor educational results remain a constant drain on our standard of \nliving and economic growth. The cost to our economy is enormous, mainly \nthrough lost productivity and decreased revenue that results from our \ninadequate education system. Second, I will outline the need to \ncarefully review and reform Federal spending on health care. As my \ncolleagues know, about one-half of the deficit is related to increased \nFederal spending on health care.\n  Mr. President, my experience is that unless we get firm control on \nthese two critical problems, Congress will be unable to balance the \nbudget and our Nation will continue to suffer lost economic growth. Our \nfuture will be dim. However, if we do as I believe we can, our future \nwill be bright and prosperous. In the days ahead, I will show how I \nbelieve it can be done.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I think we need to follow what Thomas \nJefferson voiced some 200 years ago, we must pass a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 2 minutes, \nand I will try to take less time than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I say to the Senator from Utah, a vote has \nbeen ordered. Do you seek consent to postpone that for 2 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I seek unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes or less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the one thing we have not done today is put \nup our balanced budget debt tracker.\n  For the 13th day, we are up to now $10,782,720,000. For the 14th day, \nwhich \n[[Page S2564]] was Sunday, we went up to $11 billion. And for the 15th \nday, just so we all understand where we are here, we are now up to \n$12,441,600,000, just for 15 days that have expired since we started \nthis debate, above the $4.8 trillion baseline that we started with.\n  I just want everybody to understand that, while we are fiddling, \nWashington is burning with deficits that are going up and up and up \nevery day. That is why this balanced budget amendment is so important.\n  I would have felt badly if we had gone through this whole day without \nputting up our balanced budget amendment tracker.\n  With that, I yield back the remaining time and hope we can go to the \nvote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2538-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AUTHORIZING BIENNIAL EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson).

DON NEEL\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Don Neel \nof Owensboro, who was honored last week with the 1994 Physician's Award \nfor Best Notifiable Disease Reporter by the Kentucky Department of \nHealth Services.\n  The department recognized Dr. Neel for his longstanding support of \ncommunity health, particularly his efforts to contain the outbreak of \nan acute infectious disease last fall.\n  Reginald Finger, M.D., chief epidemiologist for the department of \nhealth services, presented the award at Dr. Neel's Owensboro office.\n  ``Dr. Neel represents the very essence of public health in his \nefforts to detect potential health hazards and then prevent the spread \nof these diseases to others,'' Finger said in his presentation. He \nnoted that without Dr. Neel's early actions last fall, many more \nchildren would have come down with shigellosis. ``Dr. Neel is being \nhonored for that and more--throughout his career, he has been a strong \nsupporter and partner of the local health department in Owensboro. Dr. \nNeel's career has been characterized by an unending zeal to improve the \nhealth and well being of children--all children,'' he said.\n  This award from the department of health services recognizes someone \nwho has made outstanding contributions in public health, specifically \nreporting diagnosed diseases to the local health department.\n  Last October, Daviess County experienced an unusual outbreak of \nshigellosis, which is an acute infection of the intestine. This disease \ncan be particularly dangerous for small children. To date, 74 cases \nhave been diagnosed.\n  Upon identifying the first few cases of shigellosis, Dr. Neel \nimmediately contacted the health department to alert public health \nofficials of a possible community outbreak. Working with the health \ndepartment and the Owensboro-Daviess County Hospital, he coordinated \nefforts to have people tested and treated for the disease.\n  Education sessions were held at several schools, preschools, and day \ncare centers to help prevent the disease through thorough hand washing.\n  Lenna Elder, R.N., of the Daviess County Health Center, attributed \nDr. Neel's early action to his sincere interest in the community and \nwell-being of children.\n  ``The health department's goal is to help maintain a healthy \ncommunity so that everybody is well,'' Elder said. ``Dr. Neel has \nalways been cooperative and very helpful in helping us meet that goal. \nHe has always asked, `How can I help you?' We know that he is truly \nonly a phone call away.''\n  Long active in Owensboro's community life, Dr. Neel is a graduate of \nOwensboro High School and received his medical degree from the \nUniversity of Kentucky. He has had a private pediatric practice in \nOwensboro since 1970 and is chief of pediatrics at the Owensboro-\nDaviess County Hospital.\n  He served on the Daviess County board of health from 1980 to 1991, \nthe Green River district board of health from 1980 to 1986 and was \npart-time health officer for the Daviess County Health Center.\n  He lives with his wife, Faye, in Owensboro. He is the father of two \nand has three grandchildren.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2564-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2564-S2565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  CONCERNING DR. HENRY W. FOSTER, JR.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues the excellent column which appeared in this morning's \nWashington Post by Dr. Henry Foster, President Clinton's nominee for \nsurgeon general, entitled ``Why I Want To Be Surgeon General.''\n  I support this sterling nominee. He brings the right professional \ncredentials. He has an extraordinary life history and record. Dr. \nFoster has devoted years to maternal and child health, and he is \ndedicated to the prevention of \n[[Page S2565]] teen pregnancy. He has delivered approximately 10,000 \nbabies. He is a respected doctor for over 30 years, a medical professor \nand former dean of a medical school. He is a community leader in \nNashville--a member of the board of the March of Dimes Birth Defects \nFoundation and the force behind a teen pregnancy prevention program, \n``I Have a Future.'' ``I Have a Future'' was recognized by the Points \nof Light Foundation and former President Bush for its efforts in \nfighting teen pregnancy and fighting drugs.\n  I am very concerned about the toxic atmosphere which has accompanied \nrecent nominations of distinguished professionals to high office in our \nGovernment. I am disturbed at the thought that Americans of great \naccomplishment will decline to serve, reluctant to undergo the invasive \nand debilitating nomination process.\n  Dr. Foster is the kind of distinguished public servant our Government \nneeds. I am pleased that he is telling his own story, through this \ncolumn and through the recent speech he delivered at George Washington \nUniversity. I believe he must have the opportunity to tell his story in \nconfirmation hearings. I am asking all of my colleagues to reserve \njudgment on Dr. Foster until he has the chance to tell his own story \nthrough the normal committee process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Foster's column appear in the Record \nat the conclusion of these remarks, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                    Why I Want To Be Surgeon General\n\n                           (By Henry Foster)\n\n       Just a little over a week ago, few people outside Nashville \n     knew anything about me. But after President Clinton announced \n     his intention to nominate Dr. Henry Foster for surgeon \n     general on Feb. 2, it seems like everybody thinks they know \n     everything about me.\n       Two weeks ago, no one, not even my wife, St. Clair, my \n     daughter, Myrna, and my son, Wendell--as devoted as they \n     are--followed my every move and every word with rapt \n     attention. Now, when I wake up in the morning and look out my \n     window, the press is out there waiting and watching. When I \n     go to my office, they follow me into the elevator. And \n     walking down the street, I have been punched in the face, \n     inadvertently, I think, with one of those huge microphones \n     you see on TV. I have never seen anything like it.\n       I have even picked up a new lexicon. Words that matter in \n     Washington are not in dictionaries in the rest of America. \n     They certainly never taught me these words in medical school \n     or the delivery room: Sound bites. Boom mikes. Stakeouts. \n     Live shots. Talking heads. On-air analysis. All dissecting me \n     over and over again. And all before I've uttered one word at \n     my confirmation hearings before the Senate.\n       People who have never met me analyze my character and my \n     life's work. They attack me personally before they ever give \n     me a chance to introduce myself or tell my story. But those \n     attacks do not define me. I know who I am and what I stand \n     for. I also know that I am a symbol in a larger debate that \n     has polarized this country for many years. But the attacks do \n     hurt.\n       I cannot say that my work as a doctor entirely prepared me \n     for these two turbulent weeks. But I have learned a few \n     things during my 38 years as a doctor, a teacher and a \n     crusader against teen pregnancy that have prepared me to be a \n     good surgeon general.\n       I have been face to face with real life-and-death \n     challenges. When you see low birth-weight babies born to \n     mothers not yet old enough to drive a car, you have an \n     appreciation of what trauma really means. When you visit the \n     homes of families living in grinding poverty and feel the \n     palpable sense of hopelessness in their lives, you begin to \n     understand what it is to be up against the odds. Compared to \n     that, shouted questions and overheated rhetoric may be \n     uncivil, but I can handle them. When people ask me why I want \n     to be surgeon general, I know the answer.\n       When you've had the good fortune to participate in the \n     miracle of birth as many times as I have, it is difficult to \n     stand on the sidelines and watch so many people wasting the \n     precious gift of life.\n       It is difficult to look around America today and see so \n     much needless suffering. Too many children suffer, because \n     their parents have not been taught the value of prevention. \n     Too many people don't have access to quality health care. And \n     too many of us have turned away from those basic American \n     values that can prevent violence or abuse of any kind from \n     taking root.\n       But all is not lost. America is moving forward to confront \n     both our health care crisis and the crisis of values that has \n     led to far too much irresponsibile behavior. As your surgeon \n     general, I believe I can turn the small ripples of success \n     that we have produced into great waves of progress. I believe \n     that I can draw attention and help develop lasting solutions \n     to the tragic public health problems confronting us--from the \n     epidemic of violence to the spread of AIDS to the terrible \n     problem of substance abuse. but I will be giving my greatest \n     attention to what the president has called ``our most serious \n     social problem,'' the epidemic of teen pregnancy in this \n     country.\n       It's ironic that my work fighting teen pregnancy has been \n     overshadowed by my opponents' talk about abortion. I do \n     believe in the right of a woman to choose. And I also support \n     the president's belief that abortions should be safe, legal \n     and rare. But my life's work has been dedicated to making \n     sure that young people don't have to face the choice of \n     having abortions.\n       I have some ideas about how young people can avoid that \n     difficult choice. We are reducing teen pregnancy in the \n     Nashville housing projects through ``I Have a Future''--a \n     program we started at Meharry Medical College back in 1987. \n     Our approach is to expand adolescent health care programs \n     beyond the schools and bring them to the Community, where \n     they can become a part of the fabric of everyday life. \n     Encouraging abstinence and involving the entire community, we \n     have begun to replace a culture of hopelessness with one that \n     gives young people clear pathways to healthy futures.\n       In my work with young people in Nashville, there is one \n     lesson I stress above all others. To break the cycle of \n     despair, you must learn that there is a reward for sacrifice. \n     And earning that reward has a fringe benefit. It allows you \n     to give something back. That is a hard lesson to learn, but \n     it is one that has kept me going through these difficult \n     weeks. Having President Clinton place his faith in me is \n     something I could never had imagined as a young boy growing \n     up in the segregated South. Now, I want to give something \n     back to a country that has rewarded my work and sacrifice, \n     and God willing, I'll have that opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2564-4", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RIGHT TO LIFE OF MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

In response to these senseless acts of violence, the \nMichigan right to life orgnaization has launched a series of television \ncommercials calling for an end of all violence at abortion clinics. I \nrise today to commend Right to Life of Michigan for their leadership on \nan important issue of the day. I also applaud them for their \nconstructive project as they pursue our common goal of advancing the \ncause of the pro-life movement, and I further join them in condemning \nthose who would resort to any form of such violence in an attempt to \nadvance their objectives.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2565-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2565-S2566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   REMARKS OF WILLIAM S. COHEN, WEHRKUNDE CONFERENCE, MUNICH, GERMANY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, on the weekend of February 4, the annual \nWehrkunde Conference was held in Munich, Germany. This conference is a \ngathering of government representatives from NATO countries and leading \nexperts on alliance security. Not surprisingly, one of the main topics \nof discussion was the situation in Bosnia and NATO's role in that \nconflict.\n  This year, the Senate delegation to the Wehrkunde Conference was led \nby the distinguished Senator from Maine, Bill Cohen. In his remarks to \nthe Wehrkunde delegates, Senator Cohen underscored the serious \nweaknesses of the U.N. protection forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as \nwell as the erosion of NATO's military credibility as a result of the \ndual-key arrangement between the United Nations and NATO. His bottom \nline is that if we are unable to provide the U.N. forces with the \nnecessary authority and firepower, these forces should be withdrawn.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Cohen's \ninsightful remarks to the conference be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     [[Page S2566]] Remarks by Senator William S. Cohen, Wehrkunde \n             Conference, Munich, Germany, February 4, 1995\n\n       We have entered a new world of disorder and our inability \n     to formulate coherent policies and strategies to deal with \n     ethnic conflicts and the expansion of NATO membership has led \n     to cross-Atlantic fear, confusion, incoherence, and \n     recrimination--a state of affairs not unprecedented for the \n     NATO alliance.\n       I would like for the moment to offer a few observations on \n     Bosnia to see whether the present is prologue:\n       1. NATO cannot act unless America leads.\n       2. America will not lead unless it can persuade the \n     American people that it is imperative for us to do so.\n       3. The conflict in Bosnia is not perceived to involve \n     American interests that are vital. Rather, it is a quagmire \n     where its inhabitants would rather dig fresh graves than bury \n     old hatreds.\n       4. The European members of NATO were not willing to wade \n     into the quick sand of ancient rivalries and engage in \n     peacemaking operations so the responsibility was passed to \n     the U.N., which has fewer divisions than the Pope and none of \n     his moral authority.\n       As a result, we are all bearing witness to the decimation \n     of a nation that was guaranteed protection under the U.N. \n     Charter while the best we can offer is to seek to minimize \n     the bloodshed by denying arms to the victims of aggression.\n       Our collective acquiescence to aggression may be the lesser \n     of two evils--but it is nonetheless the participation in the \n     evil of ethnic cleansing that we hoped might never again \n     touch the European continent.\n       We are hesitant to take more aggressive action because the \n     consequences of our action cannot be predicted. The absence \n     of predictability prevents the development of consensus:\n       Should we do nothing militarily to stop Serbian aggression?\n       Lift the arms embargo unilaterally if necessary and strike?\n       Lift and get out of the way--if that is possible?\n       Time is running out on our Hamlet-like irresoluteness. \n     Before the decision is made to lift the arms embargo, with \n     all of its attendant uncertainties--including the fear of \n     Americanizing the war on the part of some and the hope of \n     doing so on the part of others--we should make an effort to \n     establish the credibility of UNPROFOR's mission and might:\n       New leadership is required. General Rose has departed. \n     General Smith has taken his place. Mr. Akashi should be asked \n     to resign immediately.\n       When a no-fly zone or weapons exclusion zone has been \n     declared, it should be enforced, not allowed to be violated \n     with impunity.\n       No tribute or tolls should be paid by UNPROFOR forces to \n     gain passage to help the victims of war.\n       No tolerance should be granted for taking hostages or using \n     them as human shields.\n       If any harm should come to UNPROFOR forces, we should take \n     out every major target that allows the Serbs to continue to \n     wage war. That power should be disproportionate to the \n     transgression and no area in Serbia ruled out of our bomb \n     sites.\n       UNPROFOR should be given the heavy armor necessary to \n     protect its forces and achieve its humanitarian mission.\n       If we are unable to give UNPROFOR--whose troops are trapped \n     in the layers of a disastrous dual command structure--the \n     authority and firepower to achieve these ends, then we should \n     remove the forces before the U.N.'s political impotence is \n     allowed to corrode NATO's military integrity and credibility \n     any further than it has already done so.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2565-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2566-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2566-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MIDDLE-CLASS BILL OF RIGHTS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 17\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the \nPresident of the United States, transmitting, a draft of proposed \nlegislation to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax \nrelief for the middle-class, together with accompanying papers; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit today for your immediate consideration and \nenactment the ``Middle-Class Bill of Rights Tax Relief Act of 1995.'' I \nam also sending you an explanation of the revenue proposals of this \nlegislation.\n  This bill is the next step in my Administration's continuing effort \nto raise living standards for working families and help restore the \nAmerican Dream for all our people.\n  For 2 years, we have worked hard to strengthen our economy. We worked \nwith the last Congress to enact legislation that will reduce the annual \ndeficits of 1994-98 by more than $600 billion; we created nearly 6 \nmillion new jobs; we cut taxes for 15 million low-income families and \ngave tax relief to small businesses; we opened export markets through \nglobal and regional trade agreements; we invested in human and physical \ncapital to increase productivity; and we reduced the Federal Government \nby more than 100,000 positions.\n  With that strong foundation in place, I am now proposing a Middle \nClass Bill of Rights. Despite our progress, too many Americans are \nstill working harder for less. The Middle Class Bill of Rights will \nenable working Americans to raise their families and get the education \nand training they need to meet the demands of a new global economy. It \nwill let middle-income families share in our economic prosperity today \nand help them build our economic prosperity tomorrow.\n  The ``Middle-Class Bill of Rights Tax Relief Act of 1995'' includes \nthree of the four elements of my Middle Class Bill of Rights. First, it \noffers middle-income families a $500 tax credit for each child under \n13. Second, it includes a tax deduction of up to $10,000 a year to help \nmiddle-income Americans pay for postsecondary education expenses and \ntraining expenses. Third, it lets more middle-income Americans make \ntax-deductible contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts and \nwithdraw from them, penalty-free, for the costs of education and \ntraining, health care, first-time home-buying, long periods of \nunemployment, or the care of an ill parent.\n  The fourth element of my Middle Class Bill of Rights--not included in \nthis legislation--is the GI Bill for America's Workers, which \nconsolidates 70 Federal training programs and creates a more effective \nsystem for learning new skills and finding better jobs for adults and \nyouth. Legislation for this proposal is being developed in cooperation \nwith the Congress.\n  If enacted, the Middle Class Bill of Rights will help keep the \nAmerican Dream alive for everyone willing to take responsibility for \nthemselves, their families, and their futures. And it will not burden \nour children with more debt. In my fiscal 1996 budget, we have found \nenough savings not only to pay for this tax bill, but also to provide \nanother $81 billion in deficit reduction between 1996 and 2000.\n  This legislation will restore fairness to our tax system, let middle-\nincome families share in our economic prosperity, encourage Americans \nto prepare for the future, and help ensure that the United States moves \ninto the 21st Century still the strongest nation in the world. I urge \nthe Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this legislation.\n                                                  William J.

I proposed, and the Congress enacted, a new \neconomic strategy to restore the American dream. Two years later, that \nstrategy has begun to pay off.\n  Together we have created an environment in which America's private \nsector has been able to produce more than 5 million new jobs. \nManufacturing employment grew during each month of 1994--the first time \nthat has happened since 1978. We have cut the deficit in \n[[Page S2567]] the Federal budget for 3 years running, we have kept \ninflation in check, and, based on actions I have already taken, the \nFederal bureaucracy will soon be the smallest it has been in more than \n3 decades. We have opened up more new trade opportunities in just 2 \nyears than in any similar period in a generation. And we have embarked \non a new partnership with American industry to prepare the American \npeople to compete and win in the new global economy.\n  In short, America's economic prospects have improved considerably in \nthe last 2 years. And the economy will continue to move forward in \n1995, with rising output, falling deficits, and increasing employment. \nToday there is no country in the world with an economy as strong as \nours, as full of opportunity, as full of hope.\n  Still, living standards for many Americans have not improved as the \neconomy has expanded. For the last 15 years, those Americans with the \nmost education and the greatest flexibility to seek new opportunities \nhave seen their incomes grow. But the rest of our work force have seen \ntheir incomes either stagnate or fall. An America that, in our finest \nmoments, has always grown together, now grows apart.\n  I am resolved to keep the American dream alive in this new economy. \nWe must make it possible for the American people to invest in the \neducation of their children and in their own training and skills. This \nis the essence of the New Covenant I have called for--economic \nopportunity provided in return for people assuming personal \nresponsibility. This is the commitment my Administration made to the \nAmerican people 2 years ago, and it remains our commitment to them \ntoday.\n                 the administration's economic strategy\n\n  Our economic strategy has been straightforward. First, we have \npursued deficit reduction to increase the share of the Nation's \neconomic resources available for private investment. At the same time \nwe have reoriented the government's public investment portfolio with an \neye toward preparing our people and our economy for the 21st century. \nWe have cut yesterday's government to help solve tomorrow's problems, \nshrinking departments, cutting unnecessary regulations, and ending \nprograms that have outlived their usefulness. We have also worked to \nexpand trade and to boost American sales to foreign markets, so that \nthe American people can enjoy the better jobs and higher wages that \nshould result from their own high-quality, high-productivity labor. \nHaving fixed the fundamentals, we are now proposing what I call the \nMiddle Class Bill of Rights, an effort to build on the progress we have \nmade in controlling the deficit while providing tax relief that is \nfocused on the people who need it most.\n\n\n                     putting our own house in order\n\n  The first task my Administration faced upon taking office in January \n1993 was to put our own economic house in order. For more than a \ndecade, the Federal Government had spent much more than it took in, \nborrowing the difference. As a consequence, by 1992 the Federal deficit \nhad increased to 4.9 percent of gross domestic product--and our country \nhad gone from being the world's largest creditor Nation to being its \nlargest debtor.\n  As a result of my Administration's deficit reduction package, passed \nand signed into law in August 1993, the deficit in fiscal 1994 was $50 \nbillion lower than it had been the previous year. In fact, it was about \n$100 billion lower than had been forecast before our budget plan was \nenacted. Between fiscal 1993 and fiscal 1998, our budget plan will \nreduce the deficit by $616 billion. Our fiscal 1996 budget proposal \nincludes an additional $81 billion in deficit reduction through fiscal \n2000.\n\n\n            preparing the american people to compete and win\n\n  As we were taking the necessary steps to restore fiscal discipline to \nthe Federal Government, we were also working to reorient the \ngovernment's investment portfolio to prepare our people and our economy \nfor 21st-century competition.\n  Training and Education. In our new information-age economy, learning \nmust become a way of life. Learning begins in childhood, and the \nopportunity to learn must be available to every American child--that is \nwhy we have worked hard to expand Head Start.\n  With the enactment of Goals 2000 we have established world-class \nstandards for our Nation's schools. Through the School-to-Work \nOpportunities Act we have created new partnerships with schools and \nbusinesses to make sure that young people make a successful transition \nto the world of work. We have also dramatically reformed the college \nloan program. Americans who aspire to a college degree need no longer \nfear that taking out a student loan will one day leave them \noverburdened by debt.\n  Finally, we are proposing to take the billions of dollars that the \ngovernment now spends on dozens of training programs and make that \nmoney directly available to working Americans. We want to leave it up \nto them to decide what new skills they need to learn--and when--to get \na new or better job.\n  New Technology. Technological innovation is the engine driving the \nnew global economy. This Administration is committed to fostering \ninnovation in the private sector. We have reoriented the Federal \nGovernment's investment portfolio to support fundamental science and \nindustry-led technology partnerships, the rapid deployment and \ncommercialization of civilian technologies, and funding for technology \ninfrastructure in transportation, communications, and manufacturing.\n  A Middle Class Bill of Rights. Fifty years ago the GI Bill of Rights \nhelped transform an economy geared for war into one of the most \nsuccessful peacetime economies in history. Today, after a peaceful \nresolution of the cold war, middle-class Americans have a right to move \ninto the 21st century with the same opportunity to achieve the American \ndream.\n  People ought to be able to deduct the cost of education and training \nafter high school from their taxable incomes. If a family makes less \nthan $120,000 a year, the tuition that family pays for college, \ncommunity college, graduate school, professional school, vocational \neducation, or worker training should be fully deductible, up to $10,000 \na year. If a family makes $75,000 a year or less, that family should \nreceive a tax cut, up to $500, for every child under the age of 13. If \na family makes less than $100,000 a year, that family should be able to \nput $2,000 a year, tax free, into an individual retirement account from \nwhich it can withdraw, tax free, money to pay for education, health \ncare, a first home, or the care of an elderly parent.\n\n\n       expanding opportunity at home through free and fair trade\n\n  Our efforts to prepare the American people to compete and win in the \nnew global economy cannot succeed unless we succeed in expanding trade \nand boosting exports of American products and services to the rest of \nthe world. That is why we have worked so hard to create the global \nopportunities that will lead to more and better jobs at home. We won \nthe fight for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the \nUruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).\n  Our commitment to free and fair trade goes beyond NAFTA and the GATT. \nLast December's Summit of the Americas set the stage for open markets \nthroughout the Western Hemisphere. The Asia-Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC) group is working to expand investment and sales \nopportunities in the Far East. We firmly believe that economic \nexpansion and a rising standard of living will result in both regions, \nand the United States is well positioned both economically and \ngeographically to participate in those benefits.\n  This Administration has also worked to promote American products and \nservices to overseas customers. When foreign government contracts have \nbeen at stake, we have made sure that our exporters had an equal \nchance. Billions of dollars in new export sales have been the result, \nfrom Latin America to Asia. And these sales have created and \nsafeguarded tens of thousands of American jobs.\n\n\n         health care and welfare reform: the unfinished agenda\n\n  In this era of rapid change, Americans must be able to embrace new \neconomic opportunities without sacrificing their personal economic \nsecurity. My Administration remains committed to providing health \ninsurance coverage for every American and containing \n[[Page S2568]] health care costs for families, businesses, and \ngovernments. The Congress can and should take the first steps toward \nachieving these goals. I have asked the Congress to work with me to \nreform the health insurance market, to make coverage affordable for and \navailable to children, to help workers who lose their jobs keep their \nhealth insurance, to level the playing field for the self-employed by \ngiving them the same tax treatment as other businesses, and to help \nfamilies provide long-term care for a sick parent or a disabled child. \nWe simply must make health care coverage more secure and more \naffordable for America's working families and their children.\n  This should also be the year that we work together to end welfare as \nwe know it. We have already helped to boost the earning power of 15 \nmillion low-income families who work by expanding the earned income tax \ncredit. With a more robust economy, many more American families should \nalso be able to escape dependence on welfare. Indeed, we want to make \nsure that people can move from welfare to work by giving them the tools \nthey need to return to the economic mainstream. Reform must include \nsteps to prevent the conditions that lead to welfare dependence, such \nas teen pregnancy and poor education, while also helping low-income \nparents find jobs with wages high enough to lift their families out of \npoverty. At the same time, we must ensure that welfare reform does not \nincrease the Federal deficit, and that the States retain the \nflexibility they need to experiment with innovative programs that aim \nto increase self-sufficiency. But we must also ensure that our reform \ndoes not punish people for being poor and does not punish children for \nthe mistakes of their parents.\n\n\n                         reinventing government\n\n  Taking power away from Federal bureaucracies and giving it back to \ncommunities and individuals is something everyone should be able to \nsupport. We need to get government closer to the people it is meant to \nserve. But as we continue to reinvent the Federal Government by cutting \nregulations and departments, and moving programs to the States and \ncommunities where citizens in the private sector can do a better job, \nlet us not overlook the benefits that have come from national action in \nthe national interest: safer foods for our families, safer toys for our \nchildren, safer nursing homes for our elderly parents, safer cars and \nhighways, and safer workplaces, cleaner air and cleaner water. We can \nprovide more flexibility to the States while continuing to protect the \nnational interest and to give relief where it is needed.\n  The New Covenant approach to governing unites us behind a common \nvision of what is best for our country. It seeks to shift resources and \ndecisionmaking from bureaucrats to citizens, injecting choice and \ncompetition and individual responsibility into national policy. In the \nsecond round of reinventing government, we propose to cut $130 billion \nin spending by streamlining departments, extending our freeze on \ndomestic spending, cutting 60 public housing programs down to 3, and \ngetting rid of over 100 programs we do not need. Our job here is to \nexpand opportunity, not bureaucracy--to empower people to make the most \nof their own lives. Government should be leaner, not meaner.\n\n\n                          the economic outlook\n\n  As 1995 begins, our economy is in many ways as strong as it has ever \nbeen. Growth in 1994 was robust, powered by strong investment spending, \nand the unemployment rate fell by more than a full percentage point. \nExports soared, consumer confidence rebounded, and Federal \ndiscretionary spending as a percentage of gross domestic product hit a \n30-year low. Consumer spending should remain healthy and investment \nspending will remain strong through 1995. The Administration forecasts \nthat the economy will continue to grow in 1995 and that we will remain \non track to create 8 million jobs over 4 years.\n  We know, nevertheless, that there is a lot more to be done. More than \nhalf the adult work force in America is working harder today for lower \nwages than they were making 10 years ago. Millions of Americans worry \nabout their health insurance and whether their retirement is still \nsecure. While maintaining our momentum toward deficit reduction, \nincreased exports, essential public investments, and a government that \nworks better and costs less, we are\n committed to providing tax relief for the middle-class Americans who \nneed it the most, for the investments they most need to make.\n\n  We live in an increasingly global economy in which people, products, \nideas, and money travel across national borders at lightning speed. \nDuring the last 2 years, we have worked hard to help our workers take \nadvantage of this new economy. We have worked to put our own economic \nhouse in order, to expand opportunities for education and training, and \nto expand the frontiers of free and fair trade. Our goal is to create \nan economy in which all Americans have a chance to develop their \ntalents, have access to better jobs and higher incomes, and have the \ncapacity to build the kind of life for themselves and their children \nthat is the heart of the American dream.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize and direct the Secretary of Energy to \nsell the Alaska Power Marketing Administration, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  alaska power administration sale act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduced \nlegislation to sell the Alaska Power Administration's two hydroelectric \nprojects, as well as a trailing amendment which would lift the Alaska \nNorth Slope crude oil export ban.\n  Mr. President, title 1 of this legislation will authorize the sale of \nthe Alaska Power Administration. The Alaska Power Administration is \nreally different from the other Federal power marketing agencies of the \nDepartment of Energy. It has only two hydroelectric projects, Eklutna, \nnear Anchorage, and Snettisham, near Juneau. These were never intended \nby Congress to remain indefinitely under Federal control.\n  The Eklutna Project Act, for example, states that:\n\n       Upon completion of amortization of the capital investment \n     allocated to power, the Secretary is authorized and directed \n     to report to the Congress upon the feasibility and \n     desirability of transferring the Eklutna project to public \n     ownership and control in Alaska.\n\n  Moreover, these two projects were created specifically to promote \neconomic and industrial development in Alaska, and they are not the \nproduct of a water resource management plan.\n  I have been a strong advocate of ensuring that Alaskans control their \nown destiny, which is really what this bill is about. It will put the \nmanagement of these two hydroelectric projects into the hands of those \nwho best know Alaska. One project would be sold to the State of Alaska \nand the other will be sold to a group of three Alaskan public electric \nutilities.\n  Equally as important, this legislation will relieve the Federal \nGovernment of the expenses of operating and maintaining these two \nprojects. It also provides for the termination of the Alaska Power \nAdministration once the sale is complete, further saving money for \ntaxpayers.\n  [[Page S2570]] It is important to note that this legislation provides \nnecessary safeguards for the environment. It requires the State of \nAlaska and the Eklutna purchasers to abide by the memorandum of \nagreement they entered into regarding the protection and enhancement of \nfish and wildlife. This legislation makes this legally enforceable.\n  Last year, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources reported \nSenate bill 2383, the Alaska Power Administration Sale Authorization \nAct. The administration testified in strong support of this \nlegislation. Unfortunately, the committee acted too late in the year to \nallow for Senate action. With early introduction in this Congress, I am \nhopeful we will see this legislation enacted into law soon.\n  There is one provision which needs to be included in the\n   Alaska Power Administration legislation before it is sent to the \nPresident for signature. But I have not included it because it \naddresses the Internal Revenue Code. In order to indicate my strong \ndesire that such a provision be included in the final bill, I have \nintroduced it as a printed amendment.\n\n  Title 2 of this bill will lift the Alaska North Slope crude oil \nexport ban. Alaska is the only State that is subject to such an onerous \nplan. The 1.6 million barrels of oil transported through the \nTransAlaska pipeline is not forced into the lower 48 crude markets, \ncreating artificially low crude oil prices on the west coast. The \nmajority of this oil is tankered along our coast to Washington and \nCalifornia.\n  Some of the oil is even shipped all the way down to Panama, pumped \nthrough the TransPanamanian pipeline, which is owned in large part by \nthe Panamanian Government. The oil is then put back on smaller U.S.-\nflagged tankers that transport it into the gulf States at exorbitant \nprices. This process is no longer economic with the decline in the \nprice of oil.\n  Now what we have seen is we have seen an increase in the supply of \noil on the west coast. It has depressed the cost of crude oil in \nCalifornia by as much as $3 a barrel, and that has discouraged the \nexploration of development of oilfields in California and Alaska.\n  The Department of Energy completed a study of the Alaskan North Slope \ncrude oil ban in June 1994 and the Department of Energy concluded that \nthe lifting of this ban would add as much as $180 billion in tax \nrevenue to the U.S. Treasury, create some 25,000 jobs by the year 2000, \npreserve some 3,300 maritime jobs, inasmuch as some of the oil will \nprobably be moving to the Far East in U.S.-flagged vessels that are \ncrewed by U.S. sailors, and would require additional ships because, \nobviously, the transit is longer than moving that oil down to the west \ncoast. It would also increase American oil production by as much as \n110,000 barrels a day, according to a DOE estimate. This study also \nfound it would not significantly impact gas prices to consumers in \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, this ban no longer makes any sense. Rather than \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil, it has decreased our domestic \nproduction, and made us more reliant on imported oil. Oil, like any \nother commodity, should find its own level and its own market. The \nexception of this has been the prohibition on allowing the export of \nAlaskan oil.\n  Mr. President, all this legislation would so is to allow the market \nto determine the price and buyer of the crude oil. The TransAlaska \npipeline would still supply the west coast with crude oil because it is \nsimply the closest market for the oil. The excess crude that creates a \nglut in California and the oil that is forced through the \nTransPanamanian pipeline would probably be sold overseas and find a \nmarket there. But the market would primarily determine where it is \nsold.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and the \nassociated amendment be printed in the Congressional Record and that my \nstatement and the accompanying bill be addressed for referral as it \nappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I neglected to announce that the senior Senator from \nAlaska [Mr. Stevens] joins me as a cosponsor on the bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States in Congress assembled,\n\n                                TITLE I\n\n     SECITON 101.

A bill to benefit crime victims by improving enforcement of \nsentences imposing fines and special assessments, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               privatization of defaulted debt collection\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto improve collection of the staggering amount of delinquent debt that \nconvicted criminals owe to crime victims and the Federal Government. \nThe bill calls on the Department of Justice to contract with private \nfirms to collect criminal fines and special assessments from offenders \nwho are in default. These criminal fines and assessments are used to \nfinance various programs to assist crime victims. The Department of \nJustice is responsible for making criminal debt collections, but DOJ is \nnot getting the job done. Privatizing the effort will enable us to tap \ninto the source of billions of dollars that otherwise might go \nuncollected.\n  The Justice Department and the U.S. General Accounting Office \nreported an inventory of more than 110,000 overdue criminal debts \nvalued at more than $2.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 1992. This \nmoney, if collected, would be deposited into the Crime Victims Fund--\nfor the counseling of victims of violent crime, for domestic abuse \nshelters, for many programs nationwide that help victims and their \nfamilies cope with the devastation caused by these criminals.\n  But the money cannot go into the Crime Victims Fund unless it is \ncollected. And right now, many defaulted fines and special assessments \ngo uncollected because there is such a tremendous backlog of cases. \nWhen convicts escape from jail, they are hunted down and forced to do \ntheir time. So it seems ridiculous that criminal debtors who escape \npayment are not hunted down with the same determination and forced to \nmake good on their debts to their victims and the Federal Government.\n  Currently, the Department of Justice is responsible for collecting \npast due debts, both criminal and civil. Within the Department of \nJustice, the Associate Deputy Attorney General plans and supervises the \ncollections, while the U.S. attorneys in 94 judicial districts are \ncharged with actually collecting the past due debts.\n  The U.S. attorney offices are not always able to handle the huge \nvolume of debt collection cases, however, because of a backlog of older \ncases, inadequate resources, and other priorities. In fact, from 1985 \nto 1992, the number of criminal debts tripled while the time spent on \ncollections declined. What effect can these fines possibly have, what \ngood can they do for victims, if they are not strictly enforced?\n  At a time when fiscal restraint is a top priority, it is absurd that \nwe are not vigorously pursuing this multibillions-dollar source of \nfunds and that we are letting convicted criminals compound their crimes \nby defying court orders to pay fines for these misdeeds.\n  Mr. President, privatizing debt collection has proven to be \neffective. Public Law 99-578 authorized a pilot program that allowed \nthe Attorney General to contract with 18 private law firms in 7 Federal \njudicial districts to collect past due civil debts, such as student \nloans as federally guaranteed mortgages. The General Accounting Office \ncompleted an evaluation of the pilot program in September 1994, and in \nits report to Congress, the GAO recommended expanding the pilot program \nbecause it was so successful.\n  The GAO report concluded that the private law firms were cost \neffective, collecting $9.2 million in defaulted civil debts at a cost \nof $2.4 million. Further, the private firms closed more cases at a low \nunit cost than the collectors in \n[[Page S2572]] the U.S. attorney offices. The U.S. attorney collectors \nspend $422 to close each case compared to $243 for the private firms. \nMost important of all, the GAO study noted that the private firms \nworked cases and collected debts that the U.S. attorney collectors had \ngiven up on or may never have dealt with because of their ever-\nincreasing workloads.\n  This pilot program is successful dealing with civil debt collection. \nWe should apply this same approach to capturing the $2.3 billion in \nuncollected criminal debt.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would require the Director of \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to contract with private \nsector firms to collect defaulted criminal debts. The private firms \nwould be paid on a contingent fee basis, which means that these firms \nwould receive a set percentage of any amount that they collected. This \napproach would ensure that the Government will not pay for work unless \nit is completed and it would ensure that the private firms will be \nmotivated to do the work.\n  All of the defaulted criminal debt that would be collected, less the \ncontingency fee, would be deposited directly into the Crime Victims \nFund, in accordance with Federal law. I want to stress that this is \nmoney that would not otherwise be collected if it were not for \nprivatized collection. Every dollar collected will provide additional \nresources to render desperately needed victim assistance.\n  The Crime Victims Fund finances many vital programs across this \nNation. In my home State of Arizona, the Brewster Center in Tucson \nannually depends on money from the Crime Victims Fund to provide \nshelter and counseling for more than 1,000 women and children living \nthrough the horror of domestic violence.\n  In Phoenix, AZ, the Crisis Nursery is a lifeline for the youngest and \nmost helpless victims of crime--children. Last year, money from the \nCrime Victims Fund sheltered and counseled 806 children at the Crisis \nNursery--helping them endure the tragedy of physical and sexual abuse, \nthe loss of a murdered parent, and neglect or abandonment. Victims \nassistance programs in Arizona received slightly more than $1 million \nfrom the Crime Victims Fund last year, but that amount is down for the \nthird year in a row.\n  Every dollar of defaulted criminal debt that is collected as a result \nof this legislation means continued funding for places like Brewster \nCenter and the Crisis Nursery. And, remember, this is money that is \ncoming directly from court fines on the convicted criminals who \ncommitted the crimes.\n  Mr. President, I am amenable to discussion on the mandatory nature of \nthis legislation. There may be some merit to considering an optional \napproach to contracting with private firms or, perhaps, a pilot program \nsimilar to the successful one that Congress created for privatizing \ncivil debt collection.\n  It is imperative, however, that we act swiftly because there is a 5-\nyear statute of limitations on collection of the criminal special \nassessments. Every day that we spend debating this issue is one less \nday spent tracking down and collecting from these deadbeat criminals; \nand when the statute of limitations passes, that money is gone forever.\n  Mr. President, this legislation clearly empowers the Department of \nJustice to obtain much-needed help on an overwhelming task--collecting \nmore than $2 billion in defaulted criminal debts, and I urge quick \nconsideration and passage of this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consult that several letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         National Organization for\n\n\n                                            Victim Assistance,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I write to express the enthusiastic \n     support of the National Organization for Victim Assistance \n     for your proposed legislation to privatize the collection of \n     backlogged, uncollected penalty assessments and criminal \n     fines owed to the federal courts--and to the Crime Victims \n     Fund.\n       As you know, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, as amended, \n     created the Crime Victims Fund, into which are placed \n     virtually all Title 18 federal criminal fines, the ``penalty \n     assessments'' created by VOCA, and forfeited bail bonds. \n     These revenues (which run about $150-$200 million a year) are \n     then expended on two small victim-oriented programs and two \n     major ones--one supporting the various states' crime victim \n     compensation programs, and the other thousands of local \n     programs of personal assistance and advocacy.\n       Through these two programs, VOCA has become the ``Marshall \n     Plan of the victims' movement,'' a stimulator of huge growth \n     in victim compensation and assistance programs. Its \n     multiplier effects make all of us in the victims' movement \n     very protective of its funding base, and very supportive of \n     expanding that base wherever possible.\n       We therefore applaud your many efforts to increase VOCA's \n     revenues, from trying to make the Federal Fine Center more \n     productive in its collection efforts to proposing the \n     doubling of the penalty assessments. But it is our estimation \n     that the privatization of delinquent fine collections, which \n     is your latest proposal, would prove to be by far the most \n     beneficial to the Fund and to the programs and victims it \n     supports.\n       The reason for this is the much-discussed $4 billion \n     backlog in unpaid fines. We, like you, have heard it said \n     that much of this is uncollected and uncollectable, involving \n     everything from many small assessments against deported \n     aliens to a few fines against bigtime, white-collar offenders \n     who are now effectively destitute.\n       To which we say, first, the financial services industry \n     that does collections for government agencies of every \n     description indicates that this is a worthwhile venture to \n     pursue--and second, we have heard of no plausible alternative \n     to the privatization option--and third, the delinquencies in \n     question are over $4 billion--and growing. A mere penny on \n     each of those dollars adds up to very real money in the \n     economy of VOCA.\n       To put this concern about federal fines into perspective, \n     we believe very strongly that victims and their advocates \n     have no special, legitimate interest in the setting of fine \n     levels or the ordering of fines except that they meet one \n     test--that of just and proportionate punishment.\n       But once that test is met, it is fair, indeed essential, \n     for victim advocates to demand more effective efforts to \n     collect the fines that are ordered. In our view, your \n     privatization proposal offers that needed progress in \n     improved collections, which makes it superior to every other \n     alternative brought to our attention.\n       We therefore thank you for this newest expression of your \n     support for crime victims and the programs that help them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Marlene A. Young, Ph.D., J.D.,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       National Victim Center,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, February 13, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Board of Directors \n     and Staff of the National Victim Center, we wish to express \n     our support for your proposed measure to begin the \n     privatization of the Federal fine collection program which \n     secures delinquent penalties, fines and assessments destined \n     for the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Fund.\n       The National Victim Center works with more than 8,000 \n     victim and law enforcement organizations nationwide--a \n     substantial number of which benefit directly or indirectly \n     from VOCA funding through state administered compensation and \n     victim assistance programs.\n       In preparation for last fall's hearing held by the Senate \n     Committee on Government Affairs, I spoke with dozens of VOCA \n     Administrators and VOCA sub-grantees in the field. When asked \n     about the importance of VOCA Funding to their program, the \n     unanimous response was that this source of financial support \n     was not only important but indispensable to the survival of \n     their programs. In fact, most made it clear that given \n     reductions in contributions from other private and public \n     sources, programs are being forced to rely more heavily than \n     ever on VOCA money to keep their doors open.\n       While the resources available to assist crime victims \n     continue to shrink in these times of fiscal caution and \n     restraint, the demand for victim assistance and services \n     continue to grow. Let me provide some specific examples given \n     to me directly from State Administrators and victim service \n     organizations last fall.\n       Typical is the case of the Jefferson County Domestic \n     Violence Shelter in Arvada, Colorado. In 1993 alone 524 \n     domestic violence victims were turned away for lack of space, \n     including 222 children.\n       Texas was forced to de-fund some of its victim service \n     programs like the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) \n     Program that provides child victims of abuse and sexual \n     assault with a volunteer advocate to protect their rights and \n     represent their interests before the court--particularly when \n     the offender is a parent. In many cases, CASA volunteers are \n     the only persons in the system who are performing such \n     services. Without them, children will be left to fend for \n     themselves in a system they cannot comprehend. Surrounded by \n     adults making demands, they are too frightened or simply \n     unable to fulfill.\n       Washington State recently funded a program to provide \n     assistance to male victims of sexual assault (the most common \n     target of \n     [[Page S2573]] pedophiles). The program had resources to \n     serve about 50 clients. Within three months, it had \n     applications from more than 500 victims.\n       Thus, every dollar collected in fines for the VOCA fund \n     makes a difference in the life of some crime victim. This \n     fact viewed in the shadow of $4 billion in outstanding fines \n     makes collection of Federal Fines an important priority of \n     the victims' movement. It is for this reason that the \n     movement generally supported the decision to use a portion of \n     the VOCA fund to aid in the collection. More than $6 million \n     per year is earmarked off the top of the VOCA Fund for that \n     specific purpose. A good portion of that money has been \n     dedicated to the creation of a ``Federal Fine Center'' as an \n     investment that would assure a far greater return in \n     increased collections.\n       Unfortunately, reports raise serious questions concerning \n     the wisdom of that investment. After years in developing and \n     millions of dollars spent, crime victims and their advocates \n     are left with little alternative than to doubt the viability \n     of the Center and Federal Government's current collection \n     strategy.\n       We feel your proposal to privatize a portion of that \n     collection process is an important first step in the pursuit \n     of an alternative and more effective collection strategy. The \n     challenge presented by the collection of fines is not \n     dramatically different than that faced by hundreds of \n     thousands of private firms seeking collection of debt. Yet \n     such private concerns seem to have far greater success in \n     meeting the challenge of debt collection than their counter-\n     parts in the Federal Judicial System.\n       We believe the time has come to look to the private sector \n     for solutions to our critical fine collection quandary. Given \n     current circumstances, we feel that crime victims, advocates \n     and service providers have little to lose and everything to \n     gain.\n       Your proposal to allow private firms the opportunity to \n     collect unpaid fines after 120 days will be a challenging \n     test of private sector's proficiency. If they succeed in \n     collecting these relatively ``stale debts'', than expansion \n     of their role in the collection arena may be desirable.\n       While the National Victim Center continues to believe there \n     is a need to overhaul the entire Federal fine collection \n     process, your proposed measure represent the first serious \n     step toward that undertaking.\n       It is for this reason that the Board of Directors and staff \n     of the National Victim Center strongly urge your colleagues \n     to co-sponsor and support this measure of crucial importance \n     to our nation's crime victims.\n       Thank you for your consideration and support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David Beatty,\n     Director of Public Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Arizona Department of\n\n\n                                                Public Safety,\n\n                                   Phoenix, AZ, February 10, 1995.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for providing us the \n     opportunity to respond to the proposed Privatization of \n     Defaulted Debt Collection Act.\n       The Arizona Department of Public Safety administers the \n     federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) victim assistance grant \n     which supports private non-profit and governmental agencies \n     who serve victims of crime. For the past several years, the \n     level of deposits into the Crime Victims Fund has dropped due \n     to decreasing collections. This results in a reduction of \n     victim services during a time when victim services should be \n     significantly increased. Agencies who provide direct \n     assistance to victims of sexual assault, child abuse, \n     domestic violence and other violent crimes are dramatically \n     impacted.\n       Therefore, the Arizona Department of Public Safety strongly \n     supports the proposed legislation which would ultimately \n     result in more funding for victims of crime.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lynn Pirkle,\n                                 VOCA Grant Administrator.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Cohen, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Heflin, \n        Mr. Graham, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 398. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide \ncongressional authorization for State control over transportation of \nmunicipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                            Flow Control Act\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nFlow Control Act. The Flow Control Act will overturn a 1994 Supreme \nCourt decision and give State and local governments the authority to \ncontrol the flow of solid waste under specific circumstances. The \nSupreme Court decision, if allowed to stand, could result in chaos in \ncommunities in virtually all of the States where flow control authority \nis currently in place and constitutes a critical component of \nstrategies to manage waste. My legislation provides that State and \nlocal governments, not the Federal Government, will decide whether to \nuse flow control authority.\n  The bill I am introducing today contains the provisions of title II \nof S. 2345 which were negotiated by a House-Senate conference committee \nand passed the House. Unfortunately, the bill died on the Senate floor \nbecause of concerns regarding another issue in the bill on the last day \nof the Congress last October. It was endorsed last year by all those \nparties faced with the responsibility of disposing of solid waste. \nWhile there are technical problems with the bill, it incorporates the \nbulk of the agreement worked out last year. I intend to work with all \nof the parties to address these remaining technical issues.\n  On May 16, 1994, in a 6-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the \ncase of Carbone versus Clarkstown that a New York municipality could \nnot require that garbage generated in the locality be sent to a \ndesignated waste management facility. The Court held that a Clarkstown, \nNY, flow control ordinance interfered with interstate commerce and \ndeprived out-of-State firms access to the local trash market. The \nConstitution provides that only the Federal Government may regulate \ncommerce among the States unless it specifically delegates this \nauthority to them. The court's ruling held that this power had not been \ngranted by Congress to the States.\n  If not reversed, this decision will have a significant effect on the \nability of State and local governments to manage garbage. Historically, \nState and local governments have had the responsibility for municipal \nsolid waste management. This is recognized in the Nation's solid waste \nmanagement law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or RCRA. In \nRCRA, the Congress found that collection and disposal of garbage is \nprimarily a function for State and local governments. To foster this \nfunction, RCRA requires EPA to provide assistance in the development \nand implementation of State solid waste management plans. States are \nencouraged to develop statewide solid waste management plans. Before \nEPA approves a plan, it must find that the plan identifies the \nresponsibilities of State, regional, and local governments and has \nprovided for the establishment of such State regulatory powers as is \nnecessary to implement the plan. It's clear from RCRA that Congress \nintended that State and local governments have the authority necessary \nto manage solid waste. My bill authorizes, but doesn't require, State \nand local governments to use flow control authority.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, 43 States, including \nNew Jersey, either utilize flow control authority or have authorized \nlocal governments to use flow control for waste management. Flow \ncontrol laws have been in place in New Jersey since 1979 and control \nall of the nonhazardous solid waste in the State's 567 municipalities \nand 21 counties. Flow control has been a significant part of New \nJersey's ability to build an infrastructure to handle the 14 million \ntons of solid waste requiring disposal annually. Collectively, this \ninfrastructure represents a capital investment of over $2 billion. New \nJersey's recycling programs also are dependent on revenues received for \nuse of New Jersey waste management facilities.\n  The Supreme Court decision threatens this authority, undercuts the \nroles of State and local governments in solid waste management and \nnegates the planning process contemplated by the Congress in RCRA. It \nwould impose a radical change in the way solid waste is managed in the \nUnited States.\n  The Carbone decision could hamper solid waste management efforts in \nthree ways. First, the decision makes it impossible for cities to \nguarantee a steady stream of waste to waste disposal and processing \nfacilities. Without this guaranteed steady stream of garbage, \ncommunities will be unable to secure financing to build solid waste \nmanagement facilities. This threatens New Jersey's program to become \nsolid waste self-sufficient by the end of the decade. It also threatens \nNew Jersey's existing program to restrict exports of garbage without \napproval by the State.\n  In addition, localities would lose the revenue generated by garbage \ndisposal at municipal facilities as garbage flowed to other facilities. \nThis would \n[[Page S2574]] eliminate the source of funding for related \nnonprofitable waste management activities such as recycling and \nhousehold hazardous waste programs. We need to increase recycling \nefforts. But the loss of flow control authority threatens existing \nefforts and makes an expansion of recycling programs less likely. Local \ngovernments will be forced to increase taxes to pay for the costs of \nthese imported solid waste programs.\n  Finally, existing bonds used to finance waste management facilities \nare at risk if localities cannot send an adequate level of garbage to \nthe facility to generate revenues to pay off the bonds. If localities \ncannot send an adequate level of garbage to a facility to generate the \nrevenue needed to pay off the bonds, they face default and the affected \ncommunities face higher taxes.\n  The Supreme Court decision already is having an adverse effect on \nlocal governments. Moody's Investors Services, a bond rating service, \nis reviewing the bond rating for 100 solid waste facilities dependent \non flow control. Facilities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nMinnesota, and Wisconsin where flow control ordinances are facing court \nchallenges are at particular risk of having their bonds devalued or \ndegraded. The bond rating for the Lancaster County Pennsylvania Solid \nWaste Management Authority has been lowered and the rating for the \nCamden County Pollution Control Authority was placed on a credit watch. \nA number of solid waste facilities already have been cancelled or \nstalled because Congress has failed to act to authorize flow control.\n  The flow control provision takes a balanced approach to addressing \nthe concerns raised by the Supreme Court decision. It is intended to \ngive State and local governments flow control authority under certain \ncircumstances while requiring that local communities use a competitive \ndesignation process in making flow control decisions to ensure that \nfree market competition is a component of flow control efforts. The \nprovision has four major components.\n  First, it protects all existing flow control arrangements where flow \ncontrol had been used to designate solid waste management facilities \nprior to May 15, 1994.\n  Second, it grants authority to States and local governments to \ninstitute additional flow control authority for: recyclables which have \nbeen voluntarily surrendered to the government, and municipal solid \nwaste generated from household, commercial, industrial and \ninstitutional sources, as well as incinerator ash and construction and \ndemolition debris if such waste had been flow controlled under a State \nor local law, ordinance, solid waste management plan or legally binding \nprovision prior to May 15, 1994 or the local government had committed \nto the designation of one or more waste management facilities for the \ntransportation, management or disposal of\n waste and had made a designation within 5 years of the enactment of \nthis section.\n\n  Third, it provides that flow control authority can only be used if \nthe community has a program to remove recyclables from the solid waste \nstream in accordance with State law or a local solid waste management \nplan. Recyclable materials are materials which have been separated, or \ndiverted at the point of generation, from municipal solid waste. This \nlanguage does not require materials to be separated at the point of \ngeneration because some recycling operations have multiple sorting \narrangements some of which may occur after the point of generation. The \nlanguage in this bill ensures that such multiple sorting operations \nwill be considered recycling.\n  Fourth, it requires that when a local government decides to implement \nflow control authority, it undertake a competitive designation process \nwhich considers the facilities and services which the private sector \ncan provide. Local governments in states other than New Jersey would \nalso have to undertake a determination regarding whether they needed \nflow control to manage their waste.\n  This competitive designation process requires the government to \nestablish specific criteria to be used to select facilities and also \ncompare alternatives when designating a facility for flow control. The \nprocess also provides for public participation during the selection \nprocess. At the same time, it allows State and local governments to \nretain final decision making authority over most waste disposal \ndecisions. A process is established which allows a Governor to certify \nthat the State has a competitive process which satisfies this \nrequirement.\n  Mr. President, I know some have expressed concern that flow control \nlegislation will allow local governments to establish uneconomical \nmonopolies on solid waste management. I believe that market competition \ncan reduce the costs of solid waste management and, in turn, individual \nproperty taxes. That's why my legislation requires a competitive \ndesignation process. Municipal solid waste is a State and local \ngovernment responsibility but doesn't have to be carried out by these \ngovernments. There are numerous examples of successful efforts to \nprivatize government operations. This bill will bring the pressure of \nthe free market to bear on solid waste decisions and hopefully lead to \nthe most efficient operation providing relief to local taxpayers.\n  I want to make clear what this bill does not do. It does not tell \nState and local governments how to manage waste. Decisions on how to \nmanage garbage and where to cite management facilities are not Federal \nresponsibilities. These decisions have been and continue to be issues \nfor local governments to decide, subject to State permits. The \nprovision does not require State and local governments to use flow \ncontrol authority. Again, this decision is left to these governments. \nThe provision leaves State and local governments with the same \nauthority they've had other than dealing with flow control to address \nsolid waste.\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues have expressed concern about the \neffect that unfunded mandates can have on State and local governments. \nI share this concern. But if we fail to act to overturn this Supreme \nCourt decision, we could significantly increase the costs to local \ngovernments of solid waste management just as if the Congress had \nimposed a costly unfunded mandate on these governments. We should be \ngiving State and local governments wide latitude to address solid waste \nmanagement, particularly because the Federal Government does not \nprovide assistance for State and local solid waste management programs.\n  The legislation I have developed has been endorsed by a wide range of \norganizations including the Conference of Mayors, and National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of Towns and Townships, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and hundreds \nof local communities across the country.\n  Mr. President, we cannot expect State and local governments to manage \nsolid waste as contemplated by RCRA if we fail to provide those \ngovernments with the tools to ensure that properly sized facilities to \nmanage the waste are constructed. My legislation merely overturns the \nSupreme Court decision and provides State and local governments with \nthe tools they need to manage solid waste. It maintains the status quo \nand avoids the radical change in solid waste management which would \nresult from the Supreme Court decision.\n  The Congress must deal with the ambiguities that flow from the \nSupreme Court decision soon. State and local governments need to \ndischarge their responsibilities for solid waste disposal.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join in support of the Flow \nControl Act of 1995. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, \nan October 7, 1994 letter signed by all parties in support of the bill, \nand a number of articles discussing the adverse effect the Supreme \nCourt decision is having on local communities be included in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The attached \n     document represents our best efforts at reaching consensus on \n     this complex and, at times, difficult issue.\n       Negotiators on both sides have made significant \n     concessions. Each of us, if true to his/her own self-\n     interest, would make changes to the attached legislative \n     draft. \n     [[Page S2578]] However, we are united in our belief that \n     Congress must take action to provide a stable municipal solid \n     waste regulatory environment for communities and businesses \n     in light of the Carbone Supreme Court decision. If Congress \n     fails to act in the wake of the Carbone decision, it will \n     leave many facilities in financial jeopardy.\n       The attached document addresses the need to protect \n     existing flow control arrangements and the facilities that \n     are financially dependent on waste flow control, and allows a \n     competitive, free-market process to continue. While \n     imperfect, this proposal meets the immediate needs of public \n     and private entities, and is far more preferable to the \n     uncertainty which will result if no bill is passed.\n       We urge you to support enactment of this compromise in this \n     session of Congress.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n         Browning-Ferris Industries, Public Securities \n           Association, National Association of Counties, WMX \n           Technologies, Environmental Transportation Association, \n           Laidlaw, Inc., Chambers Development Company, Inc., \n           Ogden Projects, Inc., National League of Cities, U.S. \n           Conference of Mayors, Solid Waste Management \n           Association of North America, Southern Pacific \n           Transportation Company.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to speak today about flow \ncontrol authority--an issue that is vital to the public safety and \nfiscal soundness of States and localities. I commend Senator Lautenberg \nand the coalition of local government officials, waste management \ngroups, and public security interests for working to craft this \nimportant legislation.\n  I feel so strongly about the need for action that I was prepared to \nintroduce my own legislation this Congress. Frankly, I would have liked \nto see more authority given to municipalities. State and local \ngovernments have a vested interest in how solid waste produced within \ntheir borders is transported and disposed. However, I recognize that a \nhard-fought consensus has been reached, and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this important legislation.\n  According to the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], approximately \n35 States were adversely affected by the May 1994 Supreme Court Carbone \ndecision, which invalidated local flow control authority. It is \nimportant to note that Justice O'Connor, while siding with the \nmajority, did in fact state that it was within Congress' purview to \nauthorize local imposition of flow control. It is my feeling that if \nCongress does not enact legislation, States will continue to suffer \nenvironmentally and financially.\n  Flow control is essential to the implementation of Connecticut's \nintegrated waste management plan. Many localities have made significant \ncapital investments to move away from outdated landfills to construct \nefficient, yet costly, waste disposal centers. Approximately 86 percent \nof Connecticut's waste is now disposed of in these state-of-the art \nfacilities. The State, and ultimately the taxpaying citizens, are \nbacking $500 million in bonds that were used to finance the \nconstruction of regional waste disposal centers and recycling transfer \nstations. Profits from the facilities, used to pay off the bonds, were \nto be ensured by flow control authority.\n  Almost 75 percent of Connecticut municipalities entered into ``put-\nor-pay'' contracts, and will be forced to pay penalties for the \nshortfall created by trash moving elsewhere. At a time when Congress is \ntrying to ease the tax burden on working families, it is highly likely \nthat their taxes could increase, if towns are unable to meet their \ngarbage quotes. If transporters choose to deliver waste to landfills \nout of State, then citizens will in effect pay twice--first, to have \ntheir waste transported away, and again to cover the put-or-pay \nrequirement. Finally, municipal bond ratings could plummet, increasing \nthe cost of future local projects.\n  This legislation strikes an appropriate balance. Only those \ncommunities that have already relied on flow control authority or have \ndetailed plans to do so, are protected. This legislation is proconsumer \nand probusiness because it preserves competition and levels the playing \nfield. This bill is also proenvironment because it encourages the \nfurther construction of recycling and composting facilities as a \nbyproduct of a successful revenue bond financing program.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today is identical to what \npassed the House of Representatives last fall. It was most unfortunate \nthat in the Senate, flow control legislation fell victim to the \nstalling tactics employed by some members on the other side of the \naisle on the last day of the session. This compromise legislation died, \ndespite strong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this year we will be successful. It is \nclear that this issue is not going away and it is important to the \npeople on my State and in many others that we deal with this problem. I \nurge my fellow Senators to join me in moving forward on this vital \npiece of legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, in recent weeks much has been \nwritten and said about proposals to combine all Federal food assistance \nprograms into a block grant to States. The debate has lead to a close \nexamination of nutrition programs such as WIC and the School Lunch and \nBreakfast Programs. As a strong supporter of these vital programs, I \nhave been deeply concerned about the potential consequences such action \ncould have on our Nation's most vulnerable--children, pregnant women, \nand senior citizens.\n  The Census Bureau estimates that more than 37 million Americans live \nbelow the poverty line. More distressing, however, is that children \ncontinue to be the poorest age group in the country. Over the past 20 \nyears, the number of American children in poverty has increased by more \nthan 37 percent. According to data released by the National Center for \nChildren in Poverty last month, 6 million American children under age 6 \nwere living in poverty in 1992--the highest rate since researchers have \nbeen documenting such figures.\n  Mr. President, in my view, we have a responsibility to these \nchildren. If our children are to succeed in an increasingly competitive \nworld, efforts to guarantee them access to basic nutrition services \nmust be maintained and expanded. Traditionally, the Federal Government \nhas exhibited a strong commitment to its food assistance programs and \nmany of these programs are among the most successful of all Federal \ninitiatives.\n  Take, for example, the WIC or Women, Infants, and Children Program. \nWIC provides food vouchers and nutrition education to pregnant women \nand young children and is expected to support an average of 7.2 million \nparticipants at an average monthly cost of $42.38 per person per month \nin fiscal year 1995. The General Accounting Office estimates that WIC \nservices to pregnant women who gave birth in 1990 cost the Federal \nGovernment nearly $296 million, but could save a projected $1.036 \nbillion in Federal, State, local, and private dollars by the year 2008. \nAccording to a Harvard University study, every dollar spent on prenatal \ncare through the WIC Program saves as much as $3 in future health care \ncosts. The Department of Agriculture also estimates that every dollar \nspent on prenatal care through the WIC\n Program results in a significant Medicaid savings within the first 60 \ndays after birth.\n\n  The WIC Program not only provides taxpayers one of the greatest \nreturns on their investment, it has also improved the long-term health \nof millions of American women and children. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, since the inception of the WIC Program, low \nbirthweight rates have dropped, the prevalence of anemia in preschool-\naged children has declined, and the incidence of stunting has decreased \nby nearly 65 percent.\n  To date, this important program has served almost 90,000 of more than \n210,000 eligibles in my home State of \n[[Page S2580]] Maryland. If this program were to become part of a block \ngrant to States, the USDA estimates that at least 12 percent of the \ntotal funding for the program would be cut, which translates to a loss \nof approximately $3.6 million for Maryland.\n  I wonder, Mr. President how many people realize that the National \nSchool Lunch Program--the oldest of all child nutrition programs--\nserves more than 25 million meals daily and boasts a 90-percent \nparticipation rate of schools nationwide? The average daily \nparticipation rate in Maryland is estimated to be around 374,855 \nchildren out of a public school enrollment of 763,274--nearly half of \nall children enrolled in the Maryland public school system. The \nMaryland State Department of Education estimates that Maryland would \nlose more than $22 million in funding for fiscal year 1996 if proposals \nto block grant nutrition programs were implemented.\n  In addition, block granting nutrition programs would effectively \neliminate all uniform national standards for nutrition. These \nstandards, which were strengthened last year through the Better \nNutrition and Health for Children Act, appropriately recognized that in \nproviding food assistance to needy children, it is equally important to \nmake certain that the food provided is nutritious. To neglect this \nimportant aspect of the debate would be truly irresponsible.\n  A recent editorial in the Baltimore Sun stated that ``By and large, \nFederal food programs work well. They reach the people who need them, \nand their existence over the past couple of decades has demonstrably \nreduced hunger and malnutrition.'' Mr. President, Federal food \nassistance programs do work well. They achieve their desired goals with \na high degree of efficiency and success. In this case, the old adage \n``if it's not broke, don't fix it'' rings true.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2579-5", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nFebruary as Black History Month and to honor the rich cultural heritage \nof African-Americans in my State of New Jersey. In the arts or letters, \nhistory or politics, business or education, New Jersey's African-\nAmerican community has made a strong and lasting impact on our Nation's \nculture.\n  We in New Jersey are very proud that so many great figures in history \nhave called our State home. This morning, in honor of Black History \nMonth, I would like to call the Senate's attention to four \ndistinguished African-Americans who made major contributions to my \nState and our country.\n  First, Mr. President, I would call your attention to Jessie Redmon \nFauset, the seventh child born to Redmon Fauset, an African Methodist \nEpiscopal minister in Camden, NJ. Jessie grew up in poor circumstances, \nbut her family made education a top priority, and in 1905 she went on \nto become the first black woman in the country elected to Phi Beta \nKappa. After graduating, Ms. Fauset taught high school French for many \nyears, before becoming literary editor of the Crisis, an NAACP \npublication that played a central role in the Harlem renaissance.\n  In addition to her work as an editor, Ms. Fauset was also a \nsuccessful novelist. Her initial motivation for becoming a novelist was \nher belief that African-Americans were not being portrayed accurately \nin black fiction. Her work did paint a more accurate picture, and as a \nresult, she is still read by those who want to understand African-\nAmerican life.\n  Second, Mr. President, while many do not know it, the great actress \nand singer Melba Moore is a New Jersey native and a product of New \nJersey schools. Ms. Moore grew up in Newark, where she attended Arts \nHigh School and majored in music, following in the footsteps of other \nprominent musicians, including Sarah Vaughan.\n  After high school, Melba Moore attended Montclair State Teachers \nCollege and worked as an elementary school music teacher. She loved her \nstudents, but her heart was on the stage. Ms. Moore soon left teaching \nand began wowing Broadway crowds with her amazing voice and her \nbrilliant sense of humor. Ms. Moore made her Broadway debut in \n``Hair,'' where she attracted widespread attention as the first black \nlead of any of the Broadway ``Hair'' companies around the world--and in \nmany people's opinion, the best. Melba Moore once said, ``I want to \ngive black people something to look up to, an image they can be proud \nof and kids can emulate.'' She certainly has done that.\n  Third, Mr. President, we in New Jersey are very proud to include \nabolition leader William Still as one of our own. William Still was the \nson of two former slaves who escaped from the Eastern Shore of Maryland \nto Burlington County, NJ, in the early 19th century. As a young married \nman, Mr. Still found a job at the Pennsylvania Society for the \nAbolition of Slavery. He soon became a leader in the underground \nrailroad and began to aid fugitives from slavery, offering many of them \nroom\n and board in his home. One of the former slaves passing through to \nCanada turned out to be William Still's own brother. Mr. Still was so \naffected by that discovery that he began to keep careful records of all \nthe former slaves who passed through Philadelphia and New Jersey.\n\n  In 1872, Mr. Still turned these records into a thorough and \ncompelling book, which continues to be one of the most influential \nrecords of the underground railroad movement. William Still's legacy \nwas not just the many lives he saved through the underground railroad; \nit is also the timeless chronicle he left of his efforts and those of \nothers who helped fugitive slaves escape to Canada.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a spirit of social activism also drove Paul \nRobeson, a Princeton, NJ, native, who achieved fame as an all-American \nfootball player at Rutgers University and later attained worldwide \nrecognition as an actor and singer.\n  In an interview, Paul Robeson once described his goals this way:\n\n       If I can teach my audience who know almost nothing about \n     [my people], to know [them] through my songs and through my \n     roles . . . then I will feel that I am an artist, and that I \n     am using my act for myself, for my race, for the world.\n\n  Anyone who had the fortune to hear Paul Robeson sing a spiritual, \nanyone who saw his unparalleled performance of ``Othello,'' anyone who \nheard him speak so passionately about the ills of segregation and of \npoverty, knows that in his long and fulfilling life, Paul Robeson, the \nson of a former slave, changed all of us, black and white alike, by \nsharing his passion for justice and for equality.\n  Mr. President, there are countless other African-American heroes who \nhail from New Jersey: poets and scientists, entertainers and political \nactivist. And there are uncounted others who may never be known beyond \ntheir families or their neighborhoods, but who have lived their lives \nwith dignity and contributed a basic decency and distinction to our \nState.\n  Let me just say in closing, that Black History Month should be a time \nfor reflection; a time to reflect on the accomplishments of African-\nAmericans throughout this country and throughout our history, \naccomplishments that often were made in the face of racism, of poverty, \nand unequal opportunity. It should be a time to increase our \nunderstanding of African-American history and culture, and a time to \nreaffirm our understanding of our cultural diversity, our commitment to \nequality, and our support of racial justice.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/13/senate-section/article/S2580-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
