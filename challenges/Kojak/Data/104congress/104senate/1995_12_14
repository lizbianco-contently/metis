Mr. President, I rose last week to talk about an issue \nthat is critical to people in my State, and across the Northeast and \nupper Midwest. There have been scores of editorials in major newspapers \nall across the country dealing with a fundamental moral issue that we, \nin this Nation, are confronted with this week in the Senate and House \nof Representatives.\n  The title of this editorial is ``Pray for Warm Winter. GOP Plans Mean \nPork and a Loss of Heating Aid.''\n  I am going to be joined by a number of colleagues throughout the day \nwho want to speak on this issue. My colleague from Wisconsin is here, \nSenator Kohl. I wish to make sure that other colleagues know that only \nlate last night did we realize we would have some time today. But there \nhave been a number of Senators who have taken a lead on this issue--\nSenator Leahy, Senator Jeffords, Senator Cohen, Senator Snowe, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Harkin, Senator Abraham, Senator Moynihan, and \nothers--Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Mr. President, fuel assistance programs across the country have run \nout of money, and people are being forced out in the cold. We are \nconfronted with the fierce urgency of now, and time rushes on. Quite \nfrankly, whether or not this continuing resolution is for 2 or 3 days, \nor whether there is another continuing resolution for 1 week or \nwhatever has absolutely nothing to do with the essential fact that \nthere are men, women, and children in the Northeast, Midwest, and cold \nweather States who are going cold right now. More short-term fixes \nwon't cut it anymore. There are long waiting lists throughout the \ncountry, and when people in this program don't get served, they don't \nheat their homes. In the State of New York, for example, I have heard \nthat people are being told to come back in March to apply for energy \nassistance. Come back in March, when it's freezing there now. In my \nState of Minnesota--and I am sure it is the case in my colleague's \nState of Wisconsin--this weekend temperatures are right around zero.\n  We have to allocate this money now, and the problem is that for all \nof our States we are faced with the situation of needing the money \ndesperately, right now. Let there be no mistake. This is not really a \n1-year program, it is basically a 6-month heating program. We need to \nget funding to people for energy assistance now. By this time in \nMinnesota last year, as opposed to $9 million, we had about $25 million \nout in our State. Right now, Mr. President, \n\n[[Page S18584]]\nthere are 31,000 applications now pending; 16,000 cannot be served; \nclose to 4,000 people in crisis, many in a no-heat situation. In \nMinnesota, many have been turned away.\n  This is outrageous. It is unconscionable. So what we have to do is \nmake sure that in this continuing resolution--Friday, Monday, starting \nwith the one Friday by midnight--we have a formula that accelerates the \ndelivery of funding to our States, to the cold weather States so people \ndo not freeze to death. We cannot go forward on this ad hoc basis--a \nlittle bit here and a little bit there but not enough to serve long \nwaiting lists of people. Our country can do better.\n  In the State of Minnesota last year, 110,000 households, about \n330,000 people, were served by this program. Grants were about $380 or \nthereabouts. The heating bills for people were far more than that \nduring the winter but in many cases this at least enabled people to get \nby.\n  Many of the people who benefit are elderly people who live on Social \nSecurity benefits. Many of them are families with children. Many of \nthem are families struggling with disabilities. Many of them are \nminimum wage workers.\n  It is unbelievable; in the House of Representatives this program was \neliminated outright, cut by over $1.3 billion. The total cost of the \nenergy assistance program for the whole country is less than one B-2 \nbomber. This reflects seriously distorted priorities. These are not the \npriorities of the vast majority of people in this country.\n  There are editorials in newspapers all across the country which \nessentially are saying what the vast majority of people are saying. \nWhat we are doing right now in Washington, DC, is too harsh and it is \ntoo extreme; it is too punitive. It must not be allowed to continue.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of folks in my state who have been \naffected by these immediate, huge cuts. Clara Mager is a 73-year-old \nresident of an Iron Range town. I mentioned her problem briefly the \nother day. She receives about $675 a month in Social Security. She \nlives alone, and she raised 6 children on her own. She just received a \ngrant of approximately $220. She owed her fuel provider, Intercity Oil, \n$177, and on Monday she had only 60 gallons left in her fuel tank. She \ndoes not know how she is going to make it through the winter, and she \ndoes not know whether she can stay in her house.\n  Nancy Watson is 55 years old, from Clear Lake, MN, and disabled. Her \nincome on SSI and MSA is $529 a month. She received a grant of only \nabout $80 this year, and she does not know what she is going to do. It \nis far less than in the past because we are not getting the allocations \nof funds out there in the communities.\n  In Blue Earth County--we are getting calls from all over the State--a \nself-sufficient 90-year-old woman lives alone; her monthly income is \n$204. Right now she has closed off almost all of her home, I say to my \ncolleague from Wisconsin; she is living in one room. She is heating one \nroom. She has not been able to get the energy assistance she needs this \nyear. She does not know where she is going to go, and she thinks she is \ngoing to basically have to leave her home and go into a nursing home.\n  Mr. President, there are people in my State, and in Wisconsin, and in \nmany other States across this land right now, who either have no heat--\ncan you imagine that in the United States of America? There are those \nwho are living or heating one room, or who have turned the thermostat \ndown to 50 degrees, or who are using their oven to try and heat their \nhome, whose furnaces have not been repaired but should be, but there \nwas no funding for that, who are running with dangerous, badly \nmaintained kerosene stoves, running a fire hazard, with the risk of \ncarbon monoxide poisoning. This is the United States of America?\n  And so, Mr. President, let me just be clear about this to my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike: The Low-Income Energy \nAssistance Program requires a minimum amount of resources, but it goes \nto the core of what we are about. This is a cold-weather lifeline \nprogram. This is not an income supplement. This is a survival \nsupplement.\n  Family values, Mr. President, are about extending a helping hand. \nFamily values are about giving people hope. Family values are about \ncompassion. Family values are about all of us here understanding the \nimplications and consequences of what we do.\n  My God, we have statistics and alphabet soup, OMB, CBO, baseline \nbudgets and all the rest. Too often, it is a bloodless debate. I am \ntalking about people who are desperate, right now, today, in the State \nof Minnesota, who are having to go without heat, or being forced to \nscrounge funds from friends, relatives, charities to buy fuel.\n  What is it going to take--someone freezing to death?--for us to take \naction? Then it will be too late. Time rushes on. Time is not neutral. \nPeople are going cold in America. We can do better.\n  And I say to the administration, if there is no agreement come \nmidnight Friday, since this was last year's funding, they should put \nout this money now. The money is there, waiting to be released, but \nit's constrained by law until midnight tomorrow. After that, the \nadministration should release the $1 billion--it is already there--and \nget the funding out to the States and out to the communities so people \ndo not go cold and so people do not freeze to death.\n  I did not come here to the U.S. Senate from the State of Minnesota to \nbe silent, especially not in the face of this kind of cruelty and \nunthinking slashing of the budget. I believe there is goodness in \npeople. I believe there is goodness in people and it extends way beyond \nparty. And I believe this is a moral issue. I honest to God believe \nthis is a moral issue.\n  I think the problem is that we have gotten so caught up in the \nstatistics that we just do not understand what the implications are, \nwhat this translates into in personal terms and human terms.\n  Mr. President, let me just simply say that as I understand this \nchart, just looking at the LIHEAP allocation by December of 1994, at \nleast $800 million had been allocated out to communities. By the end of \nthe second quarter, that number had shot to well over a billion \ndollars. That is last year. It is now December 15, 1995, and $231 \nmillion all together been allocated under the continuing resolution. \nThat says it all.\n  Last year by this time about $800 million had gone out to our \ncommunities to make sure that men, women and children do not go cold in \nAmerica, do not freeze to death in America. By the way, don't anybody \nbelieve that this is scare tactics. Talk to any of the people who are \nout there trying to serve--Salvation Army, churches, foundations--that \nare trying to serve people right now, and they will tell you the same \nthing. By December 15, 1995, only $231 million. That will make for a \ncold Hanukkah and a cold Christmas for many Americans who depend on \nLIHEAP funds.\n  One would think we could do better in this next continuing \nresolution. We have to accelerate the funding right now, and if we do \nnot do that in a continuing resolution and there is no agreement, the \nadministration needs to release the money right now. I yield to my \ncolleague from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague from Minnesota.\n  We are from the same geographical part of the United States so we \nhave the same problem, and my outlook on this problem that we are \nfacing is very similar to Senator Wellstone's.\n  We have 130,000 low-income families in Wisconsin who desperately \ndepend on this energy assistance. They are, all of them, families who \nlive at or beneath the poverty level, and they are understandably and \nwithout question in need of this assistance.\n  For whatever reason, the face of Government this week is on display \nto our country. We are going to demonstrate whether or not we \nunderstand here in Washington what it is to be poor and to be living in \nbitter cold and whether or not we are prepared to respond to that \ndesperate need that these low-income families have for energy \nassistance to heat themselves and their families on their meager \nresources.\n  For reasons that are not understandable, we here in Washington have \ndecided to fund this energy assistance, not when it is needed as we \nhave been \n\n[[Page S18585]]\ndoing heretofore in the program, which is to say, get the money out \nduring the winter months, but we have decided not only to cut LIHEAP \nbut also to fund it in 12 equal annual installments.\n  Anybody listening to this debate this morning knows that that does \nnot make any sense. The money needs to be gotten out during the winter \nmonths, this month and next month, and sending out that money to these \nlow-income families in June and July and August does not make any sense \nwhen they need the money in December and January and February.\n  If we are not able to respond to that need, as Senator Wellstone has \nsaid, now, this week, by tomorrow, we will have demonstrated that we do \nnot have the compassion to understand what is going on in our country \nand what the purpose of Government is, if it is not to help those who \nare in genuine desperate need.\n  So we have a crisis, and we have an ability to respond to that \ncrisis. We are talking about, as Senator Wellstone has said, a total \namount of money of less than $1 billion, which is a cut from what it \nhad been last year.\n  LIHEAP last year was funded at $1.3 billion. We decided to cut it to \n$1 billion. As Senator Wellstone pointed out, the House wants to zero \nout the program entirely. That debate between the House and the Senate \nhas not yet been resolved. But, in the meantime, we have a continuing \nresolution which does fund LIHEAP at a billion dollars, and we have to \nsee to it that that money gets out to those people in desperate need of \nnow. The next day or two will demonstrate what the face of our \nGovernment is and what it is we are interested in depicting to the \npeople of the United States, whom we represent.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues, along with Senator Wellstone and many \nothers--53 Senators have signed a letter urging the negotiators to act \nquickly, with dispatch and without delay, on this urgent need. I urge \nmy colleagues to see to it that our negotiators here in Congress, and \nin the administration, act in a way which is sensible and compassionate \nfor those in our country who need our help so urgently at this specific \ntime.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. \nAgain, really, I think this is the beginning of the discussion today. \nThere will be time--and I believe a number of us will be back on the \nfloor throughout the day. We are going to keep pushing on this.\n  Senator Kohl mentioned this letter, dated December 8 and signed by 54 \nSenators, to Chairman Hatfield, who I really want to say right now has \nbeen very committed to trying to do something about this. He has been \ngreat in the U.S. Senate, and we are going to dearly miss him. I know \nhe feels as if his hands are tied at the moment. He is very committed \nto do something about the acceleration of getting the funding out to \ncommunities. But 54 Senators have signed this letter, simply saying, \nlook, we have to get the funds out. Temperatures have dropped below \nfreezing, there is snow on the ground, and we simply are not able to \nget the money out.\n  There is a real sense of urgency here. So there is a tremendous \namount of support for this on the Senate side. I have been in contact \nwith many offices. I know Senator Leahy, Senator Kerry and others are \nvery, very committed to this and are very anxious for us to get this \nresolved. Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, as well. I mean, Democrats \nand Republicans alike want to get this done. This has become a moral \nissue. I do not believe that is an exaggeration.\n  Are we going to dilly-dally around here and play games and talk about \nall these statistics, and yet not come together to make some change in \na formula to make sure that we get some urgently needed funds out into \ncommunities so people do not freeze to death in the United States?\n  Mr. President, when we went through the rescissions package, I held \nthat package up for a short period. Part of the reason I did that was, \nthere was a deal late at night, and all of a sudden over $300 million, \nor thereabouts, was cut from the energy assistance program. I remember \nsaying in the debate then that if this is a glimpse of what is to come, \nI do not want to have anything to do with it. This is too harsh, too \nextreme, it is too radical. This is beyond the goodness of people in \nAmerica. And when we were faced with our first continuing resolution, \nat one point in time there was some suggested language that said that \nuntil the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill is \npassed, there can be no allocation of energy assistance money. What is \ngoing on here? What is going on? This is so harsh and so extreme. While \nwe beat that effort back, the problem is even more urgent now.\n  Mr. President, this article says, ``Buffalo Prays for a Warm \nWinter.'' We can do better than that, can we not? Are we not \npolicymakers? Is that what people are supposed to be reduced to, \npraying for warm weather? Do we need to just pray for a warm winter? It \nis not a warm winter in Minnesota. We need to take action.\n  Another article focusing on LIHEAP funding problems says, ``A Heap of \nTrouble in New York.'' A Lexington, KY, paper has a headline here that \nsays ``Staying Warm.'' The list goes on. Beaver, PA, ``Bankruptcy, \nHeating Program for the Poor Hit.'' In the Maine Sentinel, ``Heating \nProgram Cut; Out in the Cold.'' ``Timing Wrong for Eliminating Weather \nAid,'' Albany. The list goes on and on, Mr. President. ``Cold \nComfort,'' Boston Globe. Des Moines Register, ``A Shameful Place to \nCut. A rich nation can help its poor stay warm in the winter.'' The Des \nMoines Register editorial says LIHEAP is a shameful place to cut. A \nrich nation can help its poor stay warm in the winter. Is that not true \nany longer?\n  Mr. President, this is a shameful place to cut. Our Nation can do \nbetter, and, in my State of Minnesota, there are citizens who are going \nwithout heat, and one is one too many. There are people who are cold, \nand one family is one too many. There are families who depend on this \nenergy assistance, so they do not get cold and so they will have enough \nresources to be able to purchase prescription drugs if that is what \nthey need, or food. The total cost of this program was less than the \ncost of one B-2 bomber. The Des Moines Register is right, a rich nation \ncan help its poor stay warm in the winter.\n  Mr. President, in this situation, time rushes on; time is not \nneutral. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. I assume \nthere is goodwill on the part of all of my colleagues, and I assume I \nwill receive a tremendous amount of support. Fifty-four Senators \nalready have gone on record as saying we have to act now.\n  Mr. President, I believe that for the next 2 days this must be a \npriority for the U.S. Congress, and for the next week it must be a \npriority to make sure that people in the United States of America--men, \nwomen and children--do not go cold. We must make sure that we do not \nhave people freezing to death in the United States of America. The \nissue could not be clearer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, several of us last night were opposed to \nthe President's program to mass deploy \n\n[[Page S18586]]\ntroops into Bosnia. I remember several talks that many of us who had \nbeen over there had that contradicted what the administration says was \ntotal peace and a calm environment, with no hostilities since the \ncease-fire went off. I can remember being before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee reminding General Shalikashvili and Secretary Perry \nthat, in fact, the firing had not stopped, and the bombs were still \ngoing off and then only to find out they had never been up there.\n  Those of us who are opposed to sending the troops over now will give \nfull support to the troops, full support to the effort, hopefully, \nsomething in the way that would cause this to be over there and the \ntroops would come home.\n  I read this morning--regretfully some news accounts, one of them from \nthe Associated Press--after the treaty was signed and while world \nleaders are still making speeches in Paris, evening explosions and \nseveral heavy machine gun bursts echoed around the front lines of a \nSarajevo neighborhood. Bosnian police officials say one shell impacted \nthe roof of a building close by while two rifle grenades were fired \ntoward Bosnian Government positions in the area. Machine gun burst \npocketed a southern wall of the Holiday Inn hotel. I know the Presiding \nOfficer was over there, as I was. This is the hotel that used to be the \nEmbassy for the United States. It now just has a few windows left and \nthey are still using it as a hotel. They probably will not be now. It \nsounds as if things are still happening over there, and hopefully with \nall of our help and support to the troops that we can accomplish the \nmission that our troops are over there for.\n  I personally plan to spend some time over there. I have gotten to \nknow several of the troops that have come from my State of Oklahoma who \nwill be stationed over there. I am hoping I will be able to have a \nbetter answer for them than I had before when they asked the question: \nWhat is the mission? So we will give our full support to the troops \nover there and to the mission as the President has described and \nhopefully it will be over very soon and our troops will come home.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, among many critical issues currently facing \nCongress, one of the most far-reaching is the Telecommunications \nCompetition and Deregulation Act, which is now the subject of a \nconference with the House of Representatives. In June of this year, \nduring debate on the telecommunications bill, I spoke on the floor \nabout the importance of giving the Justice Department primary \nresponsibility to determine when the Bell operating companies should be \npermitted to enter into long distance markets.\n  I also supported an amendment by Senator Thurmond, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Senator \nDorgan, and others, that would have ensured a strong role for the \nJustice Department as the Bell companies expand their business into \nlong distance, as we all hope they will. That amendment received the \nvotes of 43 Senators.\n  Today, I remain convinced that the Antitrust Division of the \nDepartment of Justice should have a meaningful role in \ntelecommunications in the area of their expertise. As the ranking \nDemocrat on the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust, Business Rights, and \nCompetition Subcommittee, I would like briefly to note three basic \npoints on this issue:\n  First, we all say that we support competition replacing regulation, \nbut the question is how best to make the transition. I firmly believe \nthat we must rely on the bipartisan principles of antitrust law in \norder to move as quickly as possible toward competition in all segments \nof the telecommunications industry, and away from regulation. Relying \non antitrust principles is vital to ensure that the free market will \nwork to spur competition and reduce government involvement in the \nindustry.\n  Second, the Bell companies certainly should be allowed to enter long-\ndistance markets under appropriate circumstances, for it is generally \ndesirable to have as many competitors as possible in each market. The \nissue is how to determine the point at which entry by Bell companies \nwill help rather than harm competition. That question, quite simply, is \nan antitrust matter which needs the antitrust expertise and \nspecialization of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.\n  Third, as one long interested in competition and the antitrust laws, \nI do not believe it is possible for checklists fully to take the place \nof flexible antitrust analysis in any industry or market. If antitrust \nprinciples are ignored, competition is likely to suffer and market \npower may become concentrated in a few companies. This will lead to \nharm to consumers through higher prices, less innovation, and the \nweakening of our country's leadership in telecommunications.\n  Last May, the Antitrust Subcommittee held a hearing on the antitrust \nissues implicated in the Senate telecommunications bill, S. 652. This \nhearing confirmed the importance of competition to achieve lower \nprices, better services and products, and more innovation for the \nbenefit of consumers and our Nation. If we believe in the antitrust \nlaws--which have protected free enterprise for over 100 years--then we \nshould ensure that the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department \nplays a meaningful role in telecommunications.\n  I understand that members of the telecommunications bill conference \nhave not yet resolved the issue of what role, if any, the Justice \nDepartment will have in allowing Bell company entry into long-distance. \nI urge the conferees to make sure the bill gives the Justice Department \na meaningful role, and does not merely suggest to the FCC that it \nconsult with the antitrust experts.\n  I also take this occasion to urge the conferees to reconsider the \nmanner in which they have chosen to regulate constitutionally protected \nspeech on the Internet and other computer networks. Since I spoke last \nweek on this issue, the House conferees have agreed, as I feared that \nthey might, to a provision that would effectively ban from the Internet \nconstitutionally protected speech deemed by some prosecutor in some \njurisdiction in this country to be indecent. This ban will reach far \nbeyond obscenity, mind you, to some vague standard of what is proper \nand decent to speak about both in terms of content and manner of \nexpression. They are heading in the wrong direction. We should affirm \nfreedom and privacy, not Government intervention, when it comes to \npersonal communications.\n  Supporters of these restrictions contend that regulating speech on \nthe Internet is necessary because self-appointed spokesmen for decency \nsay that parents should be concerned about what their children might \naccess on the Internet. But many people, including many parents, young \nfamilies and members of the generations that include our children and \ngrandchildren, are also very concerned. They ought to be concerned \nabout letting the Government step in to censor what they can say \nonline, and to tell them what they might or might not see.\n  The Congress is venturing where it need not and should not go. We \nshould not be seeking to control communications among adults, whether \nold fogeys like ourselves or the vibrant young people who make up the \nvast bulk of the communities in cyberspace. We should not be acting to \nreduce all discourse over the Internet to third-grade readers.\n  There are alternatives to overreaching Government regulation. Instead \nof passing a new law--a new law that tells \n\n[[Page S18587]]\nus what we can say, or think--we should use the laws that are on the \nbooks to protect children, and assume that maybe somewhere, somehow, \nsomeplace parents ought to take responsibility instead of us always \nautomatically passing a law to say what parents should or should not \ndo.\n  Let me tell you what happens. When you start having all of this \nsudden censorship, well-meaning though it might be, it reaches too far.\n  We have left technological advancements, software barriers, access \ncodes, increased enforcement of laws already on the books, and vigilant \nparenting unexplored as alternatives to overreaching Government \nregulation.\n  After a majority of my Senate colleagues rejected my position in June \nand incorporated a so-called Communications Decency Act in the \ntelecommunications bill without hearings, without examination and \nwithout much thought, I still held out hope that they would proceed to \nlearn something about the Internet, how it works, and its potential \nbenefits for those who will be using it in the coming century. I was \nencouraged when the Speaker of the House agreed with me and remarked \nthat the Senate's action was ``clearly a violation of free speech'' and \n``very badly thought out.'' I, again, urge him to rejoin in the debate \nbefore it is too late.\n  We have already seen the chilling effect that even the prospect of \nthis legislation has had on online service providers. Last week, \nAmerica Online deleted the profile of a Vermonter who communicated with \nfellow breast cancer survivors online. Why?\n  They found in checking that this Vermonter had used the word \n``breast.'' Nobody bothered to ask why. She is a survivor of breast \ncancer. She was using the Internet to have correspondence with other \nsurvivors of breast cancer to talk about concerns they might have--\nmedical advances--a basic support group. But the censors looked in and \nso, because the word ``breast'' had been used, she was being stopped.\n  This is what we are opening ourselves up to. We should use the \ncurrent laws already on the books, and we should ask parents to be a \nlittle more vigilant. Will some things get on the Internet that you, I, \nand other Members of the Senate might find objectionable? Of course, it \nwill. But this objectionable material would be a tiny fraction of the \nvast materials available on the Internet. What we should protect is one \nof the greatest experiments we have seen in our age of the Internet \nwhere you have everything from the things you find most valuable to \nthings you might find boring or repulsive.\n  We do not close down our telephone companies because somebody picks \nup the phone and calls somebody else and tells them a dirty joke, or \nreams them out in four-letter words. The behavior between the two may \nbe reprehensible, and maybe they should discuss their personal \nrelationship, but we do not close down the telephone company because \nthat might happen.\n  Last June, I brought to the floor petitions from over 25,000 people \nwho supported my proposal to study technological, voluntary and other \nways to restrict access to objectionable online messages, before we lay \nthe heavy hand of Government censorship onto the Internet.\n  This week, a number of organizations, including the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology and Voters Telecommunications Watch, sponsored \na National Internet Day of Protest over the telecommunications bill \nconference's proposal to censor the Internet. In just one day--\nTuesday--over 18,000 people contacted the offices of conferees. This \ncountry will never accept the new temperance demagoguery that is \nleading us down the road to Government censorship of computer \ncommunications.\n  We have software parents can easily use to pull up on the computer \nand find out where their children have been going--what discussion, and \nwhat chat lines they have been on. If they find things in there they do \nnot want, maybe the parents ought to take the responsibility to speak \nto their children. If you have books or magazines that you do not want \nyour children to read, then maybe parents might just say, do not read \nit.\n  Somewhere there ought to be some responsibility left for mothers and \nfathers in raising their children, and not have this idea that we have \nto turn everything over to the heavy hand of Government.\n  In my years here I have seen rare instances where Senators and House \nMembers in both parties have rushed pell-mell into having the \nGovernment step in to take over for parents. At a time when we hear \nthat we have a new thrust in the Congress where we want to get \nGovernment off your backs, we want to get Government out of your life, \nwe want to turn things back to people, we have a massive effort \nunderway in the telecommunications conference to say we are going to \ntell you what to think; we are going to tell you what to do, when you \ngo online.\n  Do you know why? I am willing to bet that three-quarters of the \nCongress do not have the foggiest idea how to get on Internet; do not \nhave the foggiest idea how to use the Internet; have never corresponded \nback and forth on the Internet. They can say: ``We do not use it. It \ndoes not involve us. So let us screw it up for everybody else who might \nuse it.'' But, ``everybody else'' are millions and millions of \nAmericans.\n  I urge the full telecommunications bill conference to consider the \nthreat its proposals to regulate online speech poses to the future \ngrowth of the Internet.\n  The interests of the young children are not in the stifling of speech \nor Government overreaching. They will be served by the growth of the \nInternet, the development of the World Wide Web and the creative, \neconomic, and social opportunities that they can provide. And for those \nwho want to abuse it, those who want to be involved in child \npornography, we have laws on the books. We can go after those people. \nWe can prosecute them. But let us not close down 99.9 percent of the \nInternet because of a few child pornographers. Go after them, but \nprotect the Internet for the rest of the people.\n  Maybe those who are on the Internet ought to ask their Members of the \nHouse or the Senate, Do they use it? Do they understand it? Do they \nunderstand the computer? I do not want to ask them if they know how to \ndo really technical things, like programming a VCR. Ask them if they \ncan turn on the Internet? Can they actually talk with each other? And \nif they cannot, maybe Internet users ought to tell their Members, \n``Then leave us alone. Leave us alone.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18586-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18587-S18588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Presiding Officer and I \nboth come from States where we know what winter weather is. I daresay \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer has probably heard a weather report \nin his State--one of the most beautiful in this country--probably heard \na weather report similar to one I heard in Vermont last weekend. In the \nnews they said, ``By the way, we expect a dusting of snow tonight, \naccumulations of no more than 3 to 4 inches.'' And nobody thinks \nanything of it. If we have 10 inches of snow overnight, schools still \nopen, people still go to work.\n  I contrast that with the situation we face in the Washington area. \nHow many times have we turned on the TV in the morning and see we have \nremote locations and you have all the people out there bundled up, and \nthe poor camera person has the bright lights on, trying to find one \nsnowflake coming down. They say, ``Oh, and the latest report is the \nsnow appears to be gathering and we switch now to the head \nmeteorologist,'' who, in a state of panic, is saying, ``And we may get \naccumulations of up to an inch.'' An inch? My 86-year-old mother goes \nout with a broom and sweeps anything up to 2 or 3 inches off the walk. \nSchools will open, but here, if they open at all, it is 5 hours late. \n``Two inches were spotted somewhere in the continental United States \nand it might be moving this way.''\n  Last night I drove home around midnight and I saw cars spinning off \nthe road for two reasons. One, they did not know how to drive; and \nsecond, notwithstanding the fact that everybody knew an ice storm was \ncoming, apparently nobody thought to send out the sand trucks and sand \nthe road. This morning, at about 5:45 or so, when I drove with my wife \nto work--she was going to the hospital, she is on the morning shift--\nagain, we saw cars spinning out all over the place. They come roaring \ndown to an intersection, slamming on the brakes--of course they had \n\n[[Page S18588]]\nnot bothered to sand the intersections--and looked amazed and surprised \nthat the law of physics applied. You have a heavy object, you have no \ntraction: It does not stop. It has some aspect to do with the law of \nfriction and physics, something I suggest maybe we may want to teach.\n  We get into a situation around this area that the only effective snow \nor ice removal is a couple of days of warm weather. I once thought the \nreason we keep everything going in the little State of Vermont is we \nmust have a lot more equipment and a lot more people. Apparently that \nis not so. Actually they have more down here. I think they are saving \nit, though. They do not want to use up this equipment. Maybe they are \nthinking someday another Ice Age will come and we will need it then.\n  But in Vermont we do have cold weather. I remember a year or so ago \nthey closed down the Government here because it was about 25 degrees.\n  I was in Montpelier, VT, in the State capital that day and it was 15 \ndegrees below zero. I walked from my office to the capitol. Every place \nwas open, everybody went to work. I constantly got stopped by people on \nthe streets who said, ``We heard on the news they closed down \nGovernment offices and everything in Washington because it is 25 \ndegrees. They really mean 25 below, don't they?''\n  I said, ``No, 25 degrees. That is 40 degrees warmer than it is here \nwhere we are all going to work.''\n  But we do have that 25- to 30-degree below zero weather. I mention \nthat, to be serious, because we need money in LIHEAP. In Vermont we \nhave about 25,000 families eligible for LIHEAP, aid for those who need \nheating assistance. I think last year our families received slightly \nless than $400 a home. But because of the budget, in Vermont they can \nbe promised only about $50 this year.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of those recipients earn $8,000 a year or \nless, 30 percent of them are AFDC homes with children. Mr. President, \n32 percent of them are working Vermonters who need help; 41 percent of \nthe recipients are elderly or disabled. People are going to be dying \nfrom the cold. It does get cold back in my State. We have had many \nbelow-zero days already. We will have days where it will go down to 20 \nor 30 below zero.\n  Congress is no closer to passing a Labor-HHS bill with LIHEAP funding \nthan they were back in September. If Congress feels that block grants \nare such a good idea for school lunches and Medicaid, at least show \nthey are consistent and keep the LIHEAP block grant going. Food shelves \nare getting empty. Frost is on the windows day and night. People are \ndown to the question of heating versus eating. If you are elderly or \ndisabled, that is one heck of a question to have to ask.\n  We need to pass a LIHEAP budget. It is a gaping new hole in the \nwelfare net and it is hurting Americans, especially those who live in \nthe frost belt. I hope we will pass it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for its forbearance and I will be \nhappy to join with the distinguished Presiding Officer in offering \nsnowtime driving lessons to any of our colleagues who may wish them--\ncertainly to the media who report on four or five snowflakes as though \nit was the coming of a new Ice Age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18587-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18588-S18589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, it is cold \noutside. This morning in my home State of Vermont it was minus one \ndegree in Burlington, minus 9 degrees in our capital city of Montpelier \nand in the Northeast Kingdom, there were 18 inches of snow on the \nground. This weekend the temperature fell below zero in Minnesota. It \nwas 20 degrees in Delaware and it has even dropped to below freezing in \nAtlanta, GA.\n  With these cold temperatures, and the subfreezing days that are sure \nto follow, one has to wonder how nearly 6 million low-income American \nfamilies are going to make it through the winter. In past years, the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] has provided aid to \nthese families.\n  LIHEAP is a block grant provided to the States that help low-income \nAmericans with an average income of $8,000 heat their homes. This year \nhowever, states have not received sufficient funds to meet the needs of \ntheir low-income citizens.\n  Since we have yet to pass a fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill for \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Resources, and Education, \nLIHEAP has been funded by the two continuing resolutions [CR's] that we \nhave passed and the President has signed. These two CR's funded LIHEAP \nat 90 and 75 percent of last year's level respectively, but, and this \nis the key, the CR's limited LIHEAP spending to the proportional daily \nrate of the duration of the CR.\n  This cap on the spend-out rate means that States have received only \n75 days' worth of funds. In past years States received 60 percent of \ntheir allotments in the first quarter. This year, they have received \nonly slightly greater than 20 percent. The vast majority of LIHEAP \nfunds are used for heating assistance. Requiring that LIHEAP funds be \nspent out evenly throughout the year makes no sense. While it may leave \nLIHEAP funds available in June, many low-income families would not be \nable to heat their homes this winter.\n  Last year at this time, the Department of Health and Human Services \nhad dispersed around $800 million to the States. So far this year, \nStates have received only $230 million. As Senator Kennedy pointed out \nyesterday, LIHEAP funds were to be reduced by 10 or 25 percent, not 70 \npercent.\n  What has this meant in Vermont? Instead of the $4.5 million we had \nreceived last year by this time, Vermont has received only $1.3 \nmillion. This is not enough to meet the needs of the 25,000 low-income \nVermonters who rely on LIHEAP to avoid freezing in the winter. Gov. \nHoward Dean has had to delay the start of this year's program until \nDecember, and I can assure my colleagues that it can get quite cold in \nVermont in October and November.\n  I think it is fairly clear that we are not going to be able to pass \nall the remaining appropriations bills by the end of this week, so we \nare going to have to take up another CR. It is critical that this CR \nnot include the spend-out limitation on LIHEAP. Last week Senator \nKennedy and I sent a letter to Appropriations Committee, Mark Hatfield, \nasking him to address this problem.\n  Fifty-two other Senators, Republicans and Democrats joined us in \nsigning this letter, and although the Northeast/Midwest Senate \nCoalition, which I cochair, coordinated the effort, Senators from all \nover the Nation cosigned. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nletter along with the 54 Senators who cosigned the letter be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Although most Senators who signed the letter would like \nto see LIHEAP increased, the letter does not ask for additional LIHEAP \nfunding. It simply asks that States be allowed to spend the LIHEAP \nfunds that have been appropriated under the two CR's this winter when \nthe funds are needed. There are similar efforts being undertaken in the \nHouse. In addition to Senator Kennedy, I want to thank Senators \nAbraham, Cohen, Snowe, Moynihan, Kohl, Leahy, and Wellstone for their \nassistance in gathering support for this letter. I also want to thank \nSenator Specter for his continued support of LIHEAP. I think we have \nmade it very clear that this spend-out restriction cannot be included \nin the next CR.\n  Mr. President, LIHEAP is a lifeline for many seniors and families \nwith small children, and cutting LIHEAP will drastically increase the \nenergy burden of many American families. Some Members of the House have \nargued that LIHEAP is no longer needed, but for many low-income \nAmericans, the energy crisis is not over. In some areas of the country, \nenergy prices are still increasing; in Vermont over the last 3 years, \nprices have gone up 21 percent. Since 1980 however, real LIHEAP funding \nhas gone down 65 percent.\n  In fact, no other discretionary formula grant program has seen its \nfunding reduced as much as LIHEAP. The Congressional Research Service \n[CRS] performed a study of energy prices and LIHEAP funding. CRS \nconcluded that, even taking changes in real energy prices into account, \nLIHEAP would have to be funded at between $1.75 and $2.39 billion to \nprovide the same level of benefits as it did in 1980. \n\n[[Page S18589]]\n\n  Last year, over 25,000 low-income Vermonters received a total of $7.5 \nmillion in assistance. The average amount was $75 a month for the 5 \nwinter months. The average AFDC recipient only has $43 a month left \nover after paying the energy bill. Without LIHEAP assistance, many \nrecipients will not be able to afford to pay their heating bills this \nwinter, and many would be forced to choose between heat and food.\n  As I stated earlier, LIHEAP is a block grant. Each State decides for \nitself how to structure its program and how to get the resources to \nthose that need it. It is also a program that has no history at all of \nany fraud or abuse. Without LIHEAP energy providers, many of whom are \nsmall, unregulated businesses, may have to choose between not getting \npaid for the energy they provide and cutting off their neediest \ncustomers.\n  Mr. President, winter is upon us. People are freezing. We must free \nup LIHEAP funds so that low-income Americans will be able to heat their \nhomes this winter. We must remove the spend out rate limitation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, D.C, December 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Mark Hatfield,\n     Appropriations Committee, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatfield: We would like to call your \n     attention to a serious problem with the interim funding for \n     the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). We \n     believe that if we are to continue funding programs under the \n     FY96 Labor/HHS Appropriations bill through a Continuing \n     Resolution (CR), states must be allowed to draw down LIHEAP \n     funds at a higher rate which takes into account their \n     historical spending practices and which is sufficient to \n     ensure the program's viability. Temperatures have dropped \n     below freezing and there is snow on the ground in many parts \n     of the country, but the language in both CRs that limits \n     state draw downs to a proportional annual rate does not \n     provide states sufficient funds to operate programs and meet \n     the heating needs of their low income families.\n       In past years, states have drawn down a majority of their \n     LIHEAP funds during the fall. This allows states to purchase \n     fuel at lower rates, maintain continuity of service, avoid \n     shut offs, and plan for the upcoming winter. Furthermore, \n     nearly 90 percent of LIHEAP funds are used for heating \n     assistance during the coldest months. The CR language \n     requires that LIHEAP funds be spent out over a twelve month \n     period. While this may leave funds for heating assistance in \n     June, many low income families may not be able to heat their \n     homes this winter.\n       We believe it is critical to safeguard this program which \n     protects the elderly, the disabled, the working poor, and \n     children. When it gets cold, these vulnerable Americans \n     should not be forced to choose between heating and eating. \n     Continuing delays in funding and limits on the payout rate \n     will hamper states' ability to help the 5.6 million LIHEAP \n     households survive the winter. We ask your assistance in \n     ensuring that the bulk of LIHEAP funds can be spent during \n     the cold weather months at a rate sufficient to meet the \n     needs of low income families this winter.

Mr. President, on December 4, 1995, Madeleine Albright, our \nAmbassador to the United Nations, signed on behalf of the United States \nthe Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating \nto the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \nMigratory Fish Stocks. As the Ambassador said in her speech at the \ntime, this Agreement offers a tremendous advancement in our global \nefforts to better conserve and manage living marine resources. I ask \nunanimous consent that Ambassador Albright's speech be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks. This Agreement was the result \nof 3 long years of negotiations and will best serve the interests of \nthe United States by putting an end to the lawlessness of high seas \nfisheries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the United States has long held the view \nthat fishing activities should be carried out in a sustainable fashion, \nand with due regard to appropriate conservation and management \nmeasures. The Straddling Stocks Agreement ensures that the \nprecautionary measures we have already adopted will be respected and \nimplemented by our international partners. The United States has \nclearly led the way in this respect and it was of the utmost importance \nto ensure that our efforts would not be undermined by the destructive \npractices of other States.\n  This Agreement is only the latest step in our ongoing efforts to \nestablish a mosaic of international legal agreements that will set up a \nstrong regime for the management of our marine living resources. \nForemost among these is the Convention on the Law of the Sea, \ntransmitted to the Senate on October 6, 1994 (Treaty Document 103-39). \nMore than a year later, this historic treaty is still pending before \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations. I am hopeful that the Committee \nwill be able to consider this Convention early next year. The \nprinciples embodied in the Straddling Stocks Agreement are not only \nconsistent with the Law of the Sea, but it is to be applied \nconcurrently with that Convention.\n  Mr. President, in the past year, I have repeatedly addressed the \nSenate to highlight the ways in which the Law of the Sea Convention has \nbeen improved, and now meets our fisheries interests, our national \nsecurity interests, and our economic interests. This hard-fought treaty \nwas the result of more than 20 years of negotiations, in which both \nDemocratic and Republican Administrations participated actively. As a \nresult, all the concerns that the United States had expressed when the \nConvention was first open for signature in 1982 have now been \naddressed. An agreement modifying the deep sea-bed mining provisions of \nthe Convention was concluded and signed by the United States in 1994. \nSimilarly, the Straddling Stocks Agreement addresses some of the high \nseas fishing issues that had been left open by the Convention.\n  I expect the administration will forward the Straddling Stocks \nAgreement to the Senate early next year. In order to optimize the \neffects of the Straddling Stocks Agreement, it is urgent that the \nUnited States also become a party to the Law of the Sea Convention. The \nStraddling Stocks Agreement specifies that the settlement of disputes \nwill be carried out by the Law of the Sea Tribunal, which will be \nestablished in Hamburg shortly. Fortunately, the judges on this \nTribunal have not been designated yet, but the United States must be a \nparty to the Convention if an American judge is to be designated.\n  This is but one of the many reasons why the United States should \nratify and become a party to the Law of the Sea Convention. We now have \nanother incentive to take urgent action on this issue and I trust that \nall my colleagues who have shown such an interest in the Straddling \nStocks Agreement will join me in my efforts to see the Straddling \nStocks Agreement and the Law of the Sea Convention ratified promptly.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Statement of Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright\n\n       Mr. Chairman, distinguished ministers, fellow ambassadors \n     and delegates, and ladies and gentlemen.\n       This is a memorable occasion for all members of the \n     international community who have labored to conserve fishery \n     resources and strengthen the law of the sea. On this historic \n     day, the United States, joined by other members of the \n     international community, will sign the Agreement, adopted by \n     consensus by the UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and \n     Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. This Conference concluded its \n     work after three years of intense negotiations and \n     outstanding international cooperation. The United States is \n     pleased to have participated in this effort. We are convinced \n     that this Agreement offers a tremendous advancement in our \n     global efforts to better conserve and manage living marine \n     resources. \n     \n[[Page S18590]]\n\n       As both a coastal State and a State whose vessels fish on \n     the high seas, we are keenly aware of the need for a balanced \n     approach in the Agreement, one that recognizes the legitimate \n     concerns of both groups. The United States believes that the \n     Agreement strikes a reasonable balance between conservation \n     and fishing concerns, and between the interests of coastal \n     States and States whose vessels fish on the high seas. We \n     support the Agreement because it establishes new and \n     effective rules to conserve and manage marine fisheries and \n     provides for States to resolve their disputes through \n     compulsory binding dispute settlement procedures. The \n     Agreement, if widely ratified and properly implemented, will \n     both improve the health of our ocean ecosystems and ensure a \n     lasting supply of fish to feed the world's population.\n       The United States wishes to acknowledge the skill, \n     leadership and energy of Ambassador Satya Nandan for crafting \n     the Agreement. We are truly indebted to you.\n       This Agreement is particularly noteworthy because it \n     directly contributes to a broader global effort to promote \n     international cooperation, reduce conflict and achieve more \n     effectively the sustainable use of living marine resources. \n     The Agreement is consistent with and builds upon the United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which entered into \n     force last year. It complements the 1993 Agreement to Promote \n     Compliance With International Conservation and Management \n     Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, which itself is \n     an integral component of the International Code of Conduct \n     for Responsible Fisheries which was adopted last month in \n     Rome. Together, these instruments provide a strong basis to \n     move forward in achieving sustainable use of living marine \n     resources in the world's oceans and seas.\n       Looking to the future, we see many exciting challenges \n     before us. Our first task is to bring this Agreement into \n     force as soon as possible. We hope that all nations that sign \n     the Agreement today will soon deposit their instruments of \n     ratification. We urge those nations which are not able to \n     sign the Agreement today to do so as soon as possible. Also \n     ahead are the challenges of implementing effectively the \n     provisions of the Agreement in various regional and \n     subregional organizations and arrangements throughout the \n     world. The status of the world's fish stocks demands that \n     implementation of the Agreement begin immediately wherever \n     straddling and highly migratory fish stocks are harvested.\n       In closing, Mr. Chairman, the Fish Stocks Agreement is a \n     laudable accomplishment. The tasks before us are not only \n     possible, but absolutely necessary. At stake are important \n     issues involving biological integrity of marine ecosystems \n     and food security. The United States is confident that we \n     will succeed. Let us hope that our imagination and strength \n     are as vast as the oceans we so cherish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18589-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in some parts of Michigan over 5 feet of \nsnow have already fallen and the wind chill has brought the temperature \nto 50 below zero. Understanding the importance of helping the poor and \nelderly pay their heating bills during these cold months, I rise to \nsupport the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] and urge \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee to continue to support funding \nfor this program.\n  Under the current continuing resolution, funding for LIHEAP is \nlimited to the proportional annual rate of the duration of the \nContinuing Resolution. That is, if the Continuing Resolution lasts 32 \ndays, only thirty-two three hundred and sixty sixths of LIHEAP funds \ncan be spent. While this formula may work well for most other programs, \nfor obvious reasons the vast majority of funding for LIHEAP is spent \nduring the winter months. Therefore, the current Continuing Resolution \nformula leaves States with an extreme shortfall in their efforts to \nhelp the poor and elderly through the coldest months of the year.\n  Since LIHEAP is funded through the Labor, HHS, and Education \nappropriations bill which has not yet been debated on the Senate floor, \nthe funding for this program necessarily must come through Continuing \nResolutions. Should this continue to be the case, I urge those \nnegotiating the Continuing Resolution to abandon the daily average \nformula they have been using and allow the bulk of LIHEAP funds to be \nspent during the cold, winter months.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President I rise in opposition to this bill, which I \nfeel represents yet another attack on our Nation's resources and our \nenvironmental protection laws.\n  Our greatest legacy to our children and our grandchildren is the \nworld which we leave to them. Simply put, this bill shortchanges future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I want to commend my colleagues, particularly Senator Gorton and \nSenator Byrd, who have made some progress toward improving this bill.\n  First, and foremost, I want to acknowledge that the outcry from the \ntaxpayers of this country has been heard: After months of wrangling, \nthis bill finally restores the moratorium on the processing of mining \nclaims, contained in last year's bill.\n  Without this freeze, gigantic, foreign-owned mining companies would \nbe permitted to purchase Federal land, loaded with gold, silver, and \nother precious metals, for as little as $2.50, due to an outdated 1872 \nlaw still in effect.\n  Only $2.50 for an acre of land and all the gold underneath it is an \noutrageous ripoff for the taxpayers of this country.\n  Though the bill's language will still permit the processing of \nhundreds of applications which are now pending, this freeze will \nprevent even more companies from receiving this golden giveaway.\n  I also support the funding contained in this bill for the North \nAmerican wetlands conservation fund.\n  This valuable public-private partnership, has enabled Federal and \nState wildlife officials, and conservationists in my home State of \nDelaware, to develop dozens of wetlands and wildlife habitat protection \nplans. It is cost-effective, matching funds are required, and it \ndeserves our support.\n  Despite these few bright spots, much in this bill troubles me.\n  This legislation cuts our efforts to move away from fossil fuels, \ntoward cleaner, renewable fuels, such as solar energy. Energy \nefficiency standards are also relaxed. The end result: a continuation \nof our growing dependence on foreign oil.\n  This conference report also prohibits listing additional species as \nthreatened or endangered and prohibits designating and protecting \ncritical wildlife habitat.\n  Delaware has 9 animal species, and 16 plant species, which are \ncandidates for Endangered Species Act listing, and I am concerned that \nthis provision will hasten their extinction.\n  An unsustainable amount of logging will also be permitted in the \nTongass National Forest, a great temperate rainforest in southeastern \nAlaska.\n  With Christmas fast approaching I can understand a certain amount of \nsentiment for expedited logging. But we are not talking about a few \nChristmas trees here.\n  Under this bill, up to 418 million board feet of timber will be sold \nin 1996 and 1997--an allowable logging level which is 44 percent higher \nthan the cutting average over the previous 10 years. This plan is \nlocked in, and no changes are permitted.\n  The conference report also contains a legislative rider which allows \nthe construction of a telescope on Mt. Graham, near Tucson, AZ, despite \nthe fact that this development will likely harm an endangered species.\n  Putting the merits of the proposal aside, an appropriations bill is \nnot the right location for reforming the Endangered Species Act.\n  Lastly, this bill expands the number of recreational activities \npermitted in the new Mojave preserve in California. If you plan to go \nhiking in the Mojave this summer, be forewarned, the Park Service may \nbe forced to open this wilderness to motorized vehicles and aircraft.\n  In sum, Mr. President, this bill falls far short of adequately \nprotecting our natural resources. Under this legislation, our \ndependency on foreign oil grows, endangered species are threatened, our \nenvironmental laws are disregarded, and Americans are left poorer.\n  President Clinton has announced his intention to veto this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18590-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18590-S18591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to explain why I reluctantly \nsupported last night the resolution written by Majority Leader Dole and \nSenator McCain of Arizona, which authorized the use of American troops \nto implement the Dayton Framework Agreement.\n  I did so with some apprehension. I have no illusions about how \ndifficult this mission could be. Bosnia is a country deeply divided by \n4 years of warfare and centuries of turbulence. The terrain is rough \nand the weather fierce. Much of the land is sown with mines.\n  So why do I--with some apprehension--support the Dole resolution? I \ndo it because I believe implementing the Dayton Agreement is the best \noption in a very bad situation.\n  Our decision would be easier if we could roll back the clock. If \nPresident Bush had used air power to punish Serbian aggression in 1991, \nwe might not be here today. If President Clinton had persuaded our \nallies, over the past 2 years, to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia, \nwe might now have the balance of power in Bosnia that the Dayton \nAgreement seeks to create. That is why I voted to lift the arms embargo \nso that Bosnia could defend itself.\n  But we cannot roll back the clock; 4 years of war have passed, and \nthe parties are now exhausted. Our allies opposed lifting the embargo. \nSo President Clinton began a diplomatic campaign this past summer to \nbroker a peace settlement. The President's leadership and American-led \nNATO air strikes produced the Dayton Agreement. President Clinton \ndeserves congratulations for this historic achievement.\n  Last night the Senate had to decide whether to authorize the use of \ntroops to implement that agreement. Many North Dakotans have shared \ntheir concerns about this mission with me. So I want to take a moment \nto explain my vote to them by describing the decision that the Senate \nfaced and the Dole resolution.\n  Let me put my vote in the context of what is happening in Bosnia. \nSince the war began, 250,000 people have lost their lives. Two million \npeople have become homeless. Innocent civilians have been slaughtered, \nand no one has been spared--not the young, not the infirm, not the \nelderly. Ethnic cleansing has raged across the land of Bosnia. \nAtrocities have been committed, by both sides. And we have reliable \nreports of horrors that we thought we had banished from Europe 50 years \nago, such as concentration camps and mass graves.\n  I agree with Senator Dole's assesment that the President has the \nconstitutional authority to commit these troops for a peacekeeping \nmission. While I have serious reservations about it, it seems to me we \nought to, as the President commits these troops, by resolution, support \nthe troops themselves and create narrow restrictions under which the \nPresident can keep them there--that they are going only in a \npeacekeeping role.\n  The President argues that other countries are sending more troops per \ncapita than we are to carry out this mission. He points out that \nEngland is sending three times as many troops, relative to their \npopulation, as we are. I understand why it was difficult for the \nPresident to withhold a commitment of American troops to keep a peace \nthat he helped negotiate and to keep a peace that will be monitored by \nvirtually all other countries that belong to NATO.\n  But that does not eliminate the deep reservations I have about the \nrisks of this mission, and about the dangers of changing the mission \nonce our troops are in place in Bosnia.\n  It is true, I believe, that America is looked upon as a world leader \nthat is not seeking to gain territory but is helping to promote peace. \nIt is also true that with that leadership comes responsibilities. But \nour country has, in so many ways, for so many years, had to bear the \nbrunt of that responsibility--to pay for the defense of Western Europe \nand to provide international leadership when others would not.\n  I would have much preferred, in this circumstance, that the European \nCommunity would have been willing to step forward and broker a peace \nand keep the peace without having the United States expose our ground \ntroops to the kind of risks we will face in the Balkan region. But the \nPresident has committed our country to helping to secure peace. And it \nseems to me we are in a position now where we must tell the President \nthese are the conditions under which you can meet that commitment, \nwhich is what the Dole resolution attempts to do.\n  I am not, by supporting the Dole resolution, saying that I believe \nthe President made the right commitment for our country. But rather, I \nam expressing support for the troops, acknowledging that the commitment \nwas made and saying that our country must now proceed to keep its word.\n  Because I have real concerns about this mission I want the President \nand my colleagues to know that if a change of mission occurs in Bosnia, \nif the peace does not hold, and there is a decision our soldiers should \nbecome peacemakers instead of peacekeepers then I will be among the \nfirst in Congress to call for the immediate withdrawal of the American \ntroops and to vote for a cut-off of funding, if necessary, to \naccomplish that withdrawal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me highlight a few aspects of the Dole \nresolution that I think are important to my vote. First, the resolution \nexpresses the unequivocal support of Congress for the work of our \ntroops. It commends their professionalism, their bravery, and their \nsacrifice. It expresses the commitment of Congress to give them the \ntools they will need to do their job.\n  Second, it states that the United States will lead an international \neffort to arm and train the Bosnian Moslems. That is important. \nAmerican troops will be able to leave if the Bosnian Moslems are able \nto defend themselves.\n  Third, the Dole resolution recognizes that American troops are going \nto Bosnia to enforce a peace agreement. They are not there to make the \npeace. The leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have decided that \npeace is their policy, and they have again attested to that decision by \nsigning an agreement today in Paris. If the parties themselves abandon \npeace, then our troops should depart.\n  Fourth, the resolution supports a truly multilateral operation. The \nDayton Agreement's implementation force will be composed of 60,000 \ntroops from about 30 different countries, including non-NATO nations \nsuch as Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.\n  This is my thinking on Bosnia, Mr. President, and these are the \nreasons why I voted for the Dole resolution last night. I hope and pray \nthat my vote will help our troops fulfill their mission and will help \nspeed them safely home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18591-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18591-S18594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUNITED STATES DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES CONCERNING WAR CRIMINALS AND \n    EVIDENCE OF WAR CRIMES IN THE UNITED STATES ZONE IN BOSNIA AND \n                              HERZEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter that has \nnot received much public attention during the course of our discussions \nof the United States role in the Balkans and specifically in Bosnia. \nWhile administration officials have discussed how we would respond if \nwe encountered indicted war criminals in Bosnia, they have been silent \non the equally important question of collecting and protecting evidence \nof violations of international humanitarian law.\n  This is a very basic point. You can indict and arrest suspects, but \nfor convictions, you need solid, admissible evidence. The International \nCriminal tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has been doing excellent \nwork, considering the resource limitations it operates under and its \nlack of direct access to many crime scenes. It now lies within the \npower of the United States to advance the tribunal's work and the cause \nof justice in the former Yugoslavia.\n  The United States has supported the Tribunal's efforts to acquire \nmore resources. Now, the United States and our NATO allies in the \nimplementation force will have direct access to the scenes of the \nalleged crimes. The question we face is what do we do with this access? \n\n\n[[Page S18592]]\n\n  I strongly believe that we have a moral obligation to seek out, \ncollect, protect, and provide to the tribunal such evidence of \nviolations of international humanitarian law as we are able to discover \nwithin the United States zone in Bosnia. Let me be specific.\n  Last Wednesday, December 6, 1995, the Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe, better known as the Helsinki Commission, of \nwhich I am cochairman, held a hearing entitled ``Mass Graves and Other \nAtrocities in Bosnia.'' The witnesses at this hearing were Mr. Ivan \nLupis, of Human Rights Watch, Mr. David Rohde of the Christian Science \nMonitor, and Dr. Barbara C. Wolf, M.D., a forensic pathologist who \nparticipated in an AmeriCares exhumation project in Bosnia.\n  Mr. Rohde and Mr. Lupis both testified to events leading up to and \nfollowing the fall of the United Nations-declared safe area of \nSrbrenica on July 11, 1995. According to their testimony, perhaps as \nmany as 8,000 Bosnian moslems were massacred by Bosnian Serbs following \nthe storming of Srebrenica. Their remains were buried in an area \nbetween Srebrenica and Tuzla, the headquarters of the United States \nforces that will be assigned to the implementation force [IFOR].\n  Possible mass grave sites identified following the fall of Srebrenica \nare at or near the following locations: Zabrde, Kravica, Burnice, Nova \nKasaba, Kuslat, Sahanici, Rasica Gai, and Karakaj. These sites all lie \nwithin the U.S. zone. Mr. Rohde personally visited four sites, at Nova \nKasaba and Sahanici, and confirmed that they were in fact mass graves.\n  It is vitally important that the United States act to secure these \nsites and facilitate access to them by international investigators. \nUnder the Dayton Peace Agreement, the United States has the right to do \nthis. I strongly believe that we must exercise that right, and \npromptly, before evidence that is potentially vital to the prosecution \nof the killers can be destroyed.\n  At last Wednesday's hearing, Mr. Rohde testified as follows in that \nregard, according to an uncorrected transcript of the hearing: ``The \nU.S. intelligence said this last month: They have aerial photos of \nbackhoes being in the area digging it up, taking out some kind of \nmaterial which could be bodies. And there's a possibility the Bosnian \nSerbs are pouring acid onto the bodies and destroying evidence.''\n  Now, I want to review specifically what the Dayton Peace Agreement \nsays and how its provisions apply in this situation, so that there can \nbe no misunderstanding of the duties of the parties to the agreement. \nThese provisions now take effect because the agreement was signed in \nParis earlier today.\n  The Dayton agreement provides as follows in article VII: \n``Recognizing that the observance of human rights and the protection of \nrefugees and displaced persons are of vital importance in achieving a \nlasting peace, the Parties agree to and shall comply fully with the \nprovisions concerning human rights set forth in Chapter One of the \nAgreement at Annex 6, as well as the provisions concerning refugees and \ndisplaced persons set forth in Chapter One of the Agreement at Annex \n7.''\n  Article VII thus commits all of the parties, including the Bosnian \nSerbs, to comply fully with the following provision, among others:\n  In particular, annex 6, article XIII, paragraph 4 of the Dayton \nagreement provides as follows: ``All competent authorities in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina shall cooperate with and provide unrestricted access to \nthe organizations established in this Agreement; any international \nhuman rights monitoring mechanisms established for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina; the supervisory bodies established by any of the \ninternational agreements listed in the Appendix to this Annex; the \nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; and any other \norganization authorized by the U.N. Security Council with a mandate \nconcerning human rights or humanitarian law.''\n  In other words, the Dayton agreement singles out the International \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia as one of the organizations with \nwhich all competent authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina must \ncooperate. This means that the Bosnian Serbs may not prevent \ninvestigators from reaching these mass grave sites or exhuming the \nremains or doing any of the other tasks necessary to a full and \ncomplete investigation of the crimes committed there.\n\n  Annex 1-A, ``Agreement on the Military Aspects of the Peace \nSettlement,'' article II, ``Cessation of Hostilities,'' paragraph 4 \nfurther provides as follows: ``The Parties shall cooperate fully with \nany international personnel including investigators, advisors, \nmonitors, observers, or other personnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina \npursuant to the General Framework Agreement, including facilitating \nfree and unimpeded access and movement and by providing such status as \nis necessary for the effective conduct of their tasks.''\n  This provision is even more specific. It requires that the parties \nfacilitate ``free and unimpeded access and movement.'' This means that \nroad blocks, security zones, military areas, or any of the other \nexcuses, ruses, or tricks that were formerly the Serb's stock in trade \nto prevent international observation or investigation of their actions \nare no longer permitted.\n  Now, let us look more closely at the rules covering United States \nforces as part of IFOR in Bosnia. Annex 1-A, article VI, ``Deployment \nof the Implementation Force,'' paragraph 3 provides as follows: ``The \nParties understand and agree that the IFOR shall have the right to \nfulfill its supporting tasks, within the limits of its assigned \nprincipal tasks and available resources, and on request, which include \nthe following: * * * (b) to assist the movement of organizations in the \naccomplishment of humanitarian missions; (c) to assist the UNHCR and \nother international organizations in their humanitarian missions; (d) \nto observe and prevent interference with the movement of civilian \npopulations, refugees, and displaced persons, and to respond \nappropriately to deliberate violence to life and person * * *''\n  Paragraph 5 provides as follows: ``The Parties understand and agree \nthat the IFOR Commander shall have the authority, without interference \nor permission of any Party, to do all that the Commander judges \nnecessary and proper, including the use of military force, to protect \nthe IFOR and to carry out the responsibilities listed above in \nparagraphs 2, 3 and 4, and they shall comply in all respects with the \nIFOR requirements.''\n  This is a key provision, when read with paragraph 3. In essence, it \nmeans that the United States does not have to ask the Bosnian Serbs for \npermission to assist the movement of tribunal investigators or to help \nthem with exhumations or other heavy work. In addition, it means that \nany resistance can be met with military force.\n  Paragraph 9 provides as follows: ``Air and surface movements in \nBosnia and Herzegovina shall be governed by the following provisions: \n(a) The IFOR shall have complete and unimpeded freedom of movement by \nground, air, and water throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. It shall have \nthe right to bivouac, maneuver, billet, and utilize any areas or \nfacilities to carry out its responsibilities as required for its \nsupport, training, and operations, with such advance notice as may be \npracticable. The IFOR and its personnel shall not be liable for any \ndamages to civilian or government property caused by combat or combat \nrelated activities. Roadblocks, checkpoints or other impediments to \nIFOR freedom of movement shall constitute a breach of this Annex and \nthe violating Party shall be subject to military action by the IFOR, \nincluding the use of necessary force to ensure compliance with this \nAnnex.''\n  This is another key provision. It puts teeth into the requirement of \nannex 1-A, article II, paragraph 4, quoted in full above, that ``[t]he \nParties shall cooperate fully with any international personnel \nincluding investigators * * * including facilitating free and unimpeded \naccess and movement. * * *'' It permits the use of military force to \novercome roadblocks, checkpoints, or other impediments to IFOR freedom \nof movement, even when escorting, for example, tribunal investigators.\n  I have just described the legal foundation for United States action \nin support of investigations of violations of international \nhumanitarian law in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That legal foundation comes \ninto force now that the Dayton Peace Agreement has been \n\n[[Page S18593]]\nsigned in Paris earlier today. Now, the issue for the United States is \nwhat we are actually going to do, given that we now appear to have, and \nI would argue that we clearly do have, the legal right to support, \nassist, and facilitate these investigations.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Commission on \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, Representative Christopher H. Smith \nof New Jersey, and I, sent a joint letter to Secretary of Defense \nWilliam J. Perry last Friday, asking just that question. In fact, it is \na long letter and it asks detailed questions about the entire United \nStates approach to the issue of violations of international \nhumanitarian law in Bosnia and the United States response to those \nviolations. While it is much too soon to expect a response, I urge the \nSecretary to put his staff to work on the questions contained in the \nletter so that we can have answers before we make serious mistakes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our joint letter to \nSecretary Perry be printed in the Record.\n  I plan to speak again on this topic as more information is received \nand the situation develops.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  December 8, 1995\n     Hon. William J. Perry, \n     Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, the Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We write today to pose some important \n     questions with regard to the U.S. forces assigned to the NATO \n     Implementation Force in Bosnia. What are the United States' \n     legal obligations concerning the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, what are the United \n     States' moral obligations to support the Tribunal's work, and \n     what instructions have you given U.S. forces concerning those \n     legal and moral obligations?\n       Security Council Resolution 827 (25 May 1993) established \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \n     Yugoslavia. Paragraph 4 of that Resolution provided that ``. \n     . . all States shall cooperate fully with the International \n     Tribunal and its organs in accordance with the present \n     resolution and the Statute of the International Tribunal and \n     that consequently all States shall take any measures \n     necessary under their domestic law to implement the \n     provisions of the present resolution and the Statute, \n     including the obligation of States to comply with requests \n     for assistance or orders issued by a Trial Chamber under \n     Article 29 of the Statute.''\n       Under this United Nations Security Council resolution, the \n     Statute establishing the Tribunal, and other applicable \n     international law, what is the legal obligation of the United \n     States Government should indicted war criminals come within \n     our potential control in the former Yugoslavia? Are we \n     legally obligated to arrest them and deliver them up to the \n     Tribunal for trial?\n       A summary of the Dayton Peace Agreement provided by the \n     State Department contained a paragraph that states that \n     ``[t]he agreement gives IFOR, the peace implementation force, \n     the authority and discretion to use military force to prevent \n     interference with the free movement of civilians, refugees, \n     and displaced persons, and to respond appropriately to \n     violence against civilians. IFOR has the authority to arrest \n     any indicted war criminals it encounters or who interfere \n     with its mission, but it will not try to track them down.'' \n     [Italic added.]\n       A review of the text of the Dayton Peace Agreement, its \n     annexes and appendices, and accompanying side letters, failed \n     to locate anywhere in these texts a provision or provisions \n     conferring upon IFOR ``the authority to arrest any indicted \n     war criminals it encounters,'' or, for that matter, to arrest \n     anyone at all. Moreover, paragraph 3 of Appendix B to Annex \n     1-A provides that ``[a]ll personnel enjoying privileges and \n     immunities under this Agreement shall respect the laws of the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina insofar as it is \n     compatible with the entrusted tasks/mandate and shall refrain \n     from activities not compatible with the nature of the \n     Operation.'' This provision could be wrongfully construed to \n     prohibit U.S. forces from arresting indicted war criminals.\n       What direction has the United States given its forces \n     concerning encounters with indicted war criminals within the \n     territory of the former Yugoslavia? What is the legal basis \n     for such direction? Will U.S. forces be issued pocket cards \n     containing this direction, and a specific reporting channel \n     should they make an arrest? Will they be provided with wanted \n     posters or other detailed identifying information on all \n     persons indicted for violations of international humanitarian \n     law during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia?\n       If U.S. forces do encounter and arrest an indicted war \n     criminal, will the United States remove the suspect from the \n     territory of the former Yugoslavia and deliver the suspect to \n     the International Criminal Tribunal for trial? Will the \n     United States seek permission from any entity within the \n     territory of the former Yugoslavia to remove the suspect, or \n     is the United States prepared to act unilaterally?\n       What direction will be given to U.S. forces to be deployed \n     to the former Yugoslavia concerning the collection of \n     evidence of crimes against humanity or war crimes? Will U.S. \n     forces make an active effort to collect testimony and \n     physical evidence, and protect from destruction physical \n     evidence, including mass grave sites, concentration camps, \n     detention facilities, and records relating to such crimes? We \n     note that the mass grave sites from the Srebrenica massacres \n     appear, according to published maps, to lie within the U.S. \n     zone. Please describe your plans for this effort and specify \n     how the plan will be implemented.\n       Have U.S. forces been trained to safeguard those aspects of \n     war crimes-relevant materials that must be protected so these \n     materials may be legally admissible before the International \n     Tribunal? Are U.S. staff judge advocate, military police, \n     criminal investigation division, counterintelligence, civil \n     affairs, and other personnel who are likely to come into \n     contact with residents, familiar with the Tribunal's rules of \n     evidence, and how they differ from U.S. rules and the Uniform \n     Code of Military Justice? Please explain how the rules differ \n     and what specific steps you have taken to ensure that U.S. \n     troops identify and properly collect, and do not destroy, \n     contaminate, or otherwise render legally unusable, evidence \n     of war crimes or crimes against humanity that they may \n     encounter on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.\n       What specific arrangements have been made for reporting war \n     crimes- and crimes-against-humanity-related information up \n     the U.S. and NATO chains of command in Bosnia? How will this \n     information be passed to the International Tribunal? Is there \n     a memorandum of understanding, an exchange of letters, or any \n     other formal arrangement between NATO and the International \n     Tribunal? Between the U.S. and the Tribunal? Is there a \n     designated position/person in IFOR who is specifically \n     tasked with the responsibility of liaising with the \n     Tribunal and arranging for transfer of custody of suspects \n     and/or evidence?\n       What arrangements has the Department made with the \n     Department of State concerning reporting war crimes- and \n     crimes against humanity-related information to the \n     International Tribunal? If there is not a formal arrangement \n     between NATO or IFOR and the Tribunal, is there an agreement \n     with State that State will receive and forward such \n     information to the Tribunal?\n       If the International Tribunal asks U.S. forces to secure a \n     specific area within the U.S. zone until an investigative \n     team can arrive, will U.S. forces do so? Under the Status of \n     Forces Agreement, could U.S. forces secure, for example, an \n     office building holding records from a prison camp?\n       What is your understanding of the moral responsibility of \n     the United States to take action against suspected war \n     criminals or persons who allegedly committed crimes against \n     humanity in the former Yugoslavia? By ``action,'' we are \n     referring to a range of initiatives from their arrest, \n     through collection and preservation of evidence of the crimes \n     and cooperation with international investigations of the \n     crimes. Have you taken any action to instruct and educate \n     U.S. forces concerning this responsibility, so that they may \n     be properly sensitized to it? (Regular instruction in the Law \n     of Land Warfare is clearly insufficient in such an extreme \n     case as the alleged violations of international humanitarian \n     law that have reportedly occurred in the former Yugoslavia.)\n       Will U.S. civil affairs and/or psychological operations \n     units be tasked to inform the public in the U.S. zone that \n     the U.S. is actively seeking information concerning war \n     crimes and crimes against humanity, and provide to the public \n     points of contact in IFOR or the U.S. contingent of IFOR for \n     them to call or visit to provide such information?\n       When refugees or displaced persons pass through the U.S. \n     zone and have contact with U.S. forces, will our forces be \n     instructed to ask if they have any information on war crimes \n     or crimes against humanity? Will U.S. forces be issued pocket \n     cards with such questions, and a reporting channel for \n     forwarding the information?\n       What arrangements have been made to provide speakers of the \n     Bosnian languages who will serve as translators for U.S. \n     forces deployed as part of IFOR? How many translators do you \n     expect you will need? How will you obtain them? In making \n     these arrangements, has war crimes reporting been a \n     consideration in interpreter selection? Is there a plan to \n     train interpreters in U.S. military terminology? If \n     interpreters will undergo any training, will war crimes \n     reporting be included in that training?\n       While we understand that it may take the Department some \n     time to answer these questions, and many of the people who \n     would know the answers to these questions are essential to \n     the actual deployment of IFOR to the former Yugoslavia, we \n     believe that these questions are sufficiently important to \n     warrant consideration before U.S. forces are present on the \n     ground in full strength. It would be a very grave matter if \n     U.S. forces were inadvertently to allow a war criminal to \n     escape, or were to destroy vital criminal evidence during the \n     deployment process. Accordingly, we ask that these questions \n     receive prompt and careful consideration by the responsible \n     officials, and we look forward to receiving your response in \n     writing in a timely manner. \n     \n[[Page S18594]]\n\n       Sincerely,\n     Christopher H. Smith,\n       Chairman.\n     Alfonse D'Amato,\n       Cochairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18591-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18594-S18595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE ANTICOUNTERFEITING CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was pleased to be an original sponsor of \nS. 1136, the Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1995, to \nprovide additional tools to combat trademark and goods counterfeiting \ncrimes that cost our Nation billions of dollars per year.\n  The Judiciary Committee received estimates that international \ncounterfeiting amounts to more than $200 billion a year. Bank robberies \nin this country involve less than $50 million a year. Just as we do not \ntolerate theft of peoples' funds from our banks, we can no longer \ntolerate the theft of intellectual property rights or reputation \nthrough unlawful copying, counterfeiting and infringement.\n  Even States like Vermont, with one of the lowest violent crime rates \nin the Nation, is home to businesses losing money to counterfeiters. \nVermont Maple syrup producers comply with stringent standards so that \nsyrup lovers around the world are not disappointed. They have to be \nconstantly vigilant against counterfeiters who use the Vermont label to \nget a free ride on the reputation for excellence that syrup from my \nState enjoys.\n  Another example, concerns our IBM facility in Essex Junction, which \nmakes 16- and 64-megabyte memory chips, known as Dynamic Random Access \nMemory Chips or DRAM. These memory chips are also the subject of \ncounterfeiting activities. In addition, IBM has estimated annual losses \nto bootleg computer software at $1 billion.\n  The Software Publishers Association and Business Software Alliance \nestimate that software counterfeiting may account for as much as $6.5 \nbillion a year, which is over 40 percent of all software industry \nrevenues. This is unacceptable for any business if it is to survive.\n  At our Judiciary Committee hearing on October 10, we heard from Tom \nMcGann, executive vice president of Burton Snowboards of Burlington, \nVT. This company is the world leader in making snowboard equipment, but \nloses an estimated $1 million annually to copycat boots made in Korea.\n  Companies that work hard and devote resources to developing good \nproducts, ensure design and safety standards, and develop a well-\ndeserved reputation for quality should have their trademarks and good \nnames protected. Moreover, consumers need to be sure that what they are \nbuying is what it appears to be. Burton Snowboards' testimony brings \nhome the reality and the damage of counterfeit goods.\n  Tom McGann made several important points and was by my estimation the \nmost important and persuasive witness from which we heard. Tom observed \nthat current legal options against counterfeiters were ``so time \nconsuming and so costly that we began to wonder why we went to the \ntrouble of getting the patent at all.'' He also hit the nail on the \nhead when he spoke about the unfairness of allowing those who make no \ninvestment in development and quality control to rip off companies that \ndo. He made perhaps the most critical point when he testified that from \na business perspective copies undercut the reputation and lead to the \nloss of public confidence in products of the company that is being \ncopied.\n  Burton Snowboards is the world leader in making snowboard equipment, \nboots and related products. This private company was begun by Jake \nBurton Carpenter, who is generally credited with having developed the \nsport. This is a classic American story in which Jake-and-a-bandsaw-in-\na-garage has led to a company that invests heavily in research and \ndevelopment to make the finest products of its kind in the world. \nBurton Snowboards' investment should be protected and its customers' \nconfidence rewarded.\n  Our bill takes important steps to address the problem of \ncounterfeiting in several ways. It seeks to expand our existing \nracketeering law to cover crimes involving counterfeiting and copyright \ninfringement and to give our law enforcement officers additional, \nneeded authority to seize counterfeit merchandise and impose fines on \ncounterfeiters. It authorizes statutory damages of up to $1 million in \nprivate suits against infringers.\n  I also want to emphasize one of the considerations that bring me to \nthis fight--the health and safety risks posed by counterfeit products. \nConsumers are being defrauded and being placed in jeopardy by products \nthat do not meet the safety standards that are required of legitimate \nbusinesses. We must do everything that we can to confront these dangers \nas well as the economic damage of illegal counterfeiting. Everything \nfrom snowboard boots to software to airplane parts to baby formula to \nmedicine and medical supplies have been the subject of counterfeiting. \nIn addition to the economic harm, the health and safety risks from some \ncounterfeit products provide additional justification for our doing \neverything that we can to confront the dangers as well as the damage of \nillegal counterfeiting.\n  Most troubling at our hearing was the testimony that increasingly, \nthe revenue lost to legitimate U.S. companies is going into the pockets \nof international crime syndicates and organized criminals, who \nmanufacture, import, and distribute counterfeit goods to fund their \nother criminal enterprises. It is time to use our RICO weapons against \nracketeers who are engaged in criminal infringing activities.\n  As we marked up the bill at the Judiciary Committee, I offered--and \nthe Committee accepted--an amendment to clarify its provisions. Most \nimportantly, my amendment clarified that those subject to civil \npenalties for participating in the importation of counterfeit goods \nshould include those who ``aid and abet'' rather than those ``in any \nway concerned in'' the activity.\n  Even as we make our laws more effective in combating counterfeiting \ncrimes here, we cannot overlook the international nature of the \nproblem. Copycat goods with the labels of legitimate, American \ncompanies are manufactured, distributed, and sold in foreign cities \naround the globe. We should insist that our trading partners take \naction against all kinds of intellectual property violations: Whether \ncounterfeiting or copyright piracy, it amounts to theft and fraud on \nthe consuming public. We cannot tolerate our trading partners and \ninternational allies acting as safe havens for pirates. We must take \nall responsible action we can to protect against piracy and \ncounterfeiting.\n  Our Nation's economic health in the next century rests in large part \nwith our innovative high-technology and intellectual property \ncompanies. It is not protectionism to demand that others around the \nworld recognize basic standards on trademark, patent, and copyright law \nand enforce prohibitions against counterfeiting and infringement. If \nour intellectual-property-based industries are to continue to lead the \nworld, their creativity must be rewarded and their property rights and \ninvestments must be protected.\n  In addition to this legislation, we need to enlist the public in this \nfight and to educate the public about the downside of trademark \ncounterfeiting and patent and copyright infringement. We need to be \nsure that our international negotiators and our trading partners share \nour resolve against these crimes.\n  I thank Jake Burton Carpenter, Tom McGann, and all those at Burton \nSnowboard for working with us on this measure. I also want to note the \nstrong support of the Business Software Alliance and the Software \nPublishers Association, the Interactive Digital Software Association, \nthe Recording Industry Association of America, the International \nTrademark Association, the American Amusement Machine Association, and \nthe Imaging Supplies Coalition.\n  I appreciate hearing from Steven Olechny of The Timberland Co. from \nour neighboring State of New Hampshire and thank Timberland for its \nsupport for this legislation. I note the support a wide range of \ncompanies making everything from the Barney dinosaur and Mighty Morphin \nPower Rangers to Polo, No Fear, Nautica, and Hilfinger clothing to \nOakley sunglasses and thank Hunting World, Hoechst Celanese, Procter & \nGamble, Nintendo, Kodak, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nautica Apparel, Oakley, No \nFear, Tommy Hilfinger Licensing, Chanel, Lyons \n\n[[Page S18595]]\nGroup, Warner Bros., the Walt Disney Co., Saban Entertainment, Rolex, \nthe Coalition to Advance the Protection of Sports Logos, and the \nCosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association for their comments on the \nlegislation and their support. Finally, I want to thank John Bliss and \nthe members of the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition for \ntheir effective work against international counterfeiting and their \nsupport for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n1977, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1977) making appropriations for the Department of the \n     Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1996, and for other purposes, having met, after \n     full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 12, 1995.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, would you state the conditions under which \nthis conference report is being debated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. When the Senate considers the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 1977, the Interior appropriations bill, time \nwill be limited to 6 hours, 3 of which shall be under the control of \nthe Senator from Washington, or his designee, of which 20 minutes shall \nbe under the control of the Senator from West Virginia; and 3 hours \nunder the control of Senators Bumpers and Bradley, or their designees.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate is no considering the \nconference report on H.R. 1977, the fiscal year 1996 Department of the \nInterior and related agencies appropriations bill. This conference \nreport and accompanying statement of the managers appeared in the \nCongressional Record on December 12, 1995, on pages H14288 through \nH14310. This is the third conference agreement. The first conference \nreport was recommitted by the House on September 28 due primarily to \nobjections to the conference adoption of the Senate provisions on \nmining, which lifted the existing moratorium on issuing new patents. \nThe second conference report was recommitted again by the House on \nNovember 15 due to objections to mining and Tongass National Forest \nconcerns.\n  The agreements before the Senate today total $12.235 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority. The outlay scoring totals $13.210 \nbillion. The budget authority and outlay figures are precisely at the \n602(b) allocation levels. The recommendations of this conference \nagreement represent a total decrease below the President's budget \nrequest of $1.7 billion in budget authority and of $949 million in \noutlays.\n  The conference report represents difficult choices and real cuts in \nspending--without scorekeeping adjustments--of $1.4 billion below the \nfiscal year 1995 level or a reduction of 10 percent. Interior bill \nagencies do not share equally in the 10-percent reduction. For \ninstance, the land management agencies are reduced by 14 percent; \ncultural activities are reduced by 15 percent; the Indian programs are \nreduced by 4 percent; and the Department of Energy agencies are reduced \nby 10 percent.\n  The Interior appropriations bill is a complex bill, providing funding \nfor 40 agencies with very diverse programs. This conference agreement \nreflects a meshing of the budget resolution considerations, the \nadministration's fiscal year 1996 priorities, the priorities of the \nSenate and House, and the concerns of individual Members. For example, \nthe Congress and the administration place a high priority on the \nNational Park Service and the Indian programs. Therefore, the National \nPark Service and the Indian programs are reduced significantly less \nthan other programs and agencies within the bill.\n  Our conference addressed a considerable number of differences. There \nwere approximately 900 items in disagreement between the House and \nSenate Interior appropriations bills. As in the past, this bill has \nreceived abundant attention and sparked debate within the Congress and \nthe administration. This conference report represents an earnest effort \nto address many of the administration's objections to this year's \nInterior actions.\n  There may be programs which Senators would like to see funded at \nhigher levels. On many, I agree. Certainly, the administration has \nindicated that it views funding for some programs as inadequate. \nHowever, I would remind these Senators and the administration of the \nfunding constraints for this bill and the difficult choices that had to \nbe made. The conferees had to fund programs within an allocation that \nwas 10 percent less than was available for the bill in fiscal year \n1995. For every program that was reduced less than 10 percent, other \nprograms had to be reduced by more than 10 percent.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight some of the items in the \nconference agreement:\n\n\n                            indian programs\n\n  Programs for native Americans and Alaska Natives are funded at \n$3,652,895,000 within the bill. Within the funding constraints, high \npriority was placed on the health needs of native Americans funded \nthrough the Indian Health Service and on Bureau of Indian Affairs \nfunded elementary and secondary education programs.\n  The conferees restored $111.5 million above the Senate level to the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, resulting in an overall reduction for BIA of \n$159.6 million, or 9 percent, below the fiscal year 1995 level for BIA \nactivities. Funds were restored primarily to tribal priority \nallocations, which fund tribal government services.\n  Additionally, $25 million has been added to the previous conference \nagreement for the Indian Health Service [IHS]. This brings the IHS 1 \npercent above the fiscal year 1995 enacted level.\n\n\n                            land management\n\n  Although the land management agencies have been decreased overall by \n14 percent from the current level, the conferees have attempted to \nprotect the operational base of the land management agencies as much as \npossible:\n  National Park Service: 0 percent.\n  Fish and Wildlife Service: -3 percent.\n  Bureau of Land Management: -5 percent.\n  Forest Service: -5 percent.\n  To assist with the growing recreation demands on the agencies in this \nbill, a pilot recreation fee proposal is included.\n  The construction accounts for the land management agencies have \ndecreased $85 million in total---20 percent. The majority of the \nconstruction projects involve the completion of on-going projects and \nthe restoration or rehabilitation of existing facilities.\n  Overall funding for land acquisition for the land management agencies \ntotals $140 million which is 40 percent below the fiscal year 1995 \nappropriations level. There are no earmarks for specific projects. \nHowever, the administration must obtain congressional approval for any \nprojects to be funded.\n\n\n                      National Biological Service\n\n  The Interior's biological research is placed under the Director of \nthe U.S. Geological Survey. Funding of $137 million is provided for the \nresearch activities, which is a reduction of $35.7 million below the \ncurrent level.\n\n\n                            Mining Agencies\n\n  The conference report includes a compromise between the Senate and \nHouse provisions on mining patents. \n\n[[Page S18596]]\nThe conference agreement continues the existing moratorium on the \nissuance of mining patents as contained in the fiscal year 1995 \nInterior appropriations bill. The conference agreement also contains \nprovisions that the Secretary of the Interior must process within 5 \nyears 90 percent of the patents grandfathered in the current moratorium \nand provides authority for third-party mineral examiners paid for by \npatent applicants.\n  The mining and minerals related agencies are collectively funded at 9 \npercent below the fiscal year 1995 level. The Bureau of Mines is \neliminated and the essential functions of the Bureau of Mines are moved \nto the Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Bureau \nof Land Management.\n  Last year's ban on Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] offshore oil and gas \nleasing continues.\n\n\n                          Department of Energy\n\n  The Energy Conservation Program is funded at $553 million. The low-\nincome weatherization program is funded at $114 million.\n  Fossil energy research and development is funded at $377 million, a \ndecrease of 14 percent below the fiscal year 1995 level, not including \nthe Bureau of Mines.\n\n\n                           Cultural Agencies\n\n  We have made a concerted effort to address the critical repair and \nrenovation needs of the cultural organizations, such as the National \nGallery of Art, the Smithsonian Institution and the Kennedy Center, in \norder to fulfill our primary responsibility of protecting their \ncollections and structures. Reductions to operating accounts, while \nunavoidable, have been kept relatively small in recognition of the wide \narray of public services which in large part define the mission of \nthese agencies.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts is provided $99.5 million and the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities is provided $110 million. The \nSenate and House managers differ with respect to the continuation or \ntermination of the Endowments. The managers on the part of the Senate \nsupport continued funding for the Endowments and believe the \ncontroversial issues surrounding these two agencies are ones which \nshould be addressed by the legislative committees of jurisdiction in \nthe House and Senate.\n  In short, we have done the best we can with severely limited \nresources, concentrating our efforts on those agencies that rely on the \nCongress for the bulk, if not all, of their support and on those \nagencies that are of high priority to the administration and the \nCongress.\n  I have a couple of clarifying items relating to the Interior \nconference report that have been cleared with Senator Byrd, the ranking \nmember of the Interior Subcommittee; Mr. Regula, chairman of the House \nInterior Subcommittee; and Mr. Yates, ranking member of the House \nInterior Subcommittee.\n  In the statement of the managers accompanying the conference report, \nthe managers referred to the ``existing hospital authority'' in \nAmerican Samoa. This reference is to the institutional entity, and does \nnot preclude changes to the composition or the structuring of the \nauthority, particularly if the changes strengthen the management of \nhealth care in American Samoa.\n  The managers for both the House and the Senate agree that funds \nprovided in this bill for cooperative conservation agreements may be \nused for the 4(d) rule to ease endangered species land use restrictions \non landowners, whether large or small.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I wish to thank Senator \nByrd, the ranking member of our Interior Subcommittee and the ranking \nmember of our full Appropriations Committee. In addition, I would like \nto thank all of the Members on both sides of the aisle, who have \nprovided their assistance in forming this bill. Also, I wish to express \nmy appreciation to Chairman Regula and his staff and to Mr. Yates and \nhis staff.\n  I want to recognize and to voice my appreciation to the Interior \nSubcommittee staff as well. On my staff are Cherie Cooper, Kathleen \nWheeler, Bruce Evans, and Ginny James. I also wish to thank Sue Masica, \nwho is Senator Byrd's Interior Subcommittee assistant.\n  Mr. President, on a less formal basis, I would like to call the \nattention of my colleagues to the differences between this bill and the \nbill that originally passed the Senate. I remind my colleagues that \nfinal passage of this bill in the Senate was by a vote of 92 to 6. That \noverwhelming and bipartisan vote, I am convinced, was due to the \nmagnificent cooperation I had from my distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, and other members of the subcommittee. We \nattempted to follow the tradition of many years and deal with this \nbill, including all of its controversial elements, with the least \npossible partisanship, and I believe that we succeeded.\n  This contrasts rather considerably with the way in which this bill \nwas treated in the House of Representatives. But I do wish to say, to \nemphasize to all Members of both parties, to the extent that there are \ndifferences in this bill from the bill which originally passed the \nSenate, those differences are slightly to increase some accounts and to \nattempt in part to meet objections on the part of the administration.\n  It is very clear to me, as I speak to my colleagues at this point, \nthat we have not sufficiently satisfied the administration to have a \nguarantee that this bill will be signed. Nevertheless, as compared to \nthe original bill, which passed by a vote of 92 to 6 in this body, we \nhave made a number of substantive gestures in the direction of the \nobjections of the administration. For example, this bill includes \nbudget authority of $111 million more than the bill which originally \npassed the Senate. Primarily that extra money goes to various Indian \nactivities which were the most controversial elements of the bill as it \nwas debated in the Senate originally and again goes at least part way \nto meeting objections on the part of the administration.\n  Second, the mining patent provisions, while I suspect not \nsatisfactory to all Members, are closer to the present law and to the \nmoratorium that was passed by the House of Representatives than was the \noriginal Senate provision which was adopted by a very closely divided \nvote.\n  In addition, the language relating to the Tongass National Forest is \nmitigated to a certain extent to meet objections on the part of the \nadministration. These two items, not at all incidentally, Mr. \nPresident, were the two items that created the greatest degree of \nopposition in the House of Representatives and caused two referrals \nback to the conference committee after the original conference \ncommittee report was adopted.\n  In several additional areas in which there is substantive legislative \nlanguage in this bill, it has been modified at least modestly and in \npart to meet the objections of the administration.\n\n  I want personally to urge the administration seriously to consider \napproving this bill. It will provide considerably better and more \nassured support for the wide range of activities covered by this \nInterior Department appropriations bill than will any continuing \nresolution carried over an extended period of time.\n  As we speak here on the last day of the current continuing \nresolution, these agencies are operating on the lower figure contained \nin either the House or Senate bill. In almost every case, as a \nconsequence, the bill that we have before us funds those agencies more \ngenerously and with a greater degree of certainty.\n  So I ask my colleagues to approve a bill that is literally easier for \nmost of them to approve than was the one they voted in favor of by a \nvote of 92 to 6, and I suggest strongly to the administration that in \nthe present context it is unlikely to get a bill more favorable to its \nconcerns. If, as, and when there is a final budget agreement, there may \nbe some additional changes, but, of course, they could be taken care of \nas a part of that budget agreement itself.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I strongly suggest to my colleagues \nsupport for and passage of this bill this afternoon.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nI ask that it be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded. \n\n[[Page S18597]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be \ndesignated to control time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume to \nmyself.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report on the \nfiscal year 1996 Interior appropriations bill.\n  One year ago, Congress voted overwhelmingly, with strong bipartisan \nsupport, to pass a California Desert Protection Act and establish the \nMojave National Preserve. This act, the Desert Protection Act, \nculminated an 8-year-long battle in the Congress to protect some of \nAmerica's most spectacular and environmentally sensitive wilderness \nareas, in particular the Mojave National Preserve, often called the \n``crown jewel'' of the act.\n  California has about 25 million acres of desert. This act essentially \nprotected around 6 million of those acres, created the Joshua Tree \nNational Park, Death Valley National Mark, and the East Mojave \nPreserve.\n  The congressional process included literally years of research, \npublic hearings, debate, and every possible consideration and \ncompromise to safeguard the interests of property owners and businesses \nin the region. The bill passed.\n  Now, rather than carrying out the intent of the legislation, which \nwas to have a national preserve with hunting, which some of the \nopponents wanted, under National Park Service management, this bill \ncontains an effort to destroy the Mojave National Preserve. All other \nnational parks are being funded. Yet this conference report singles out \nthe newest unit of the National Park System for budget cuts. The \nPresident had $2.6 million in his budget for National Park Service \nmanagement of this new park.\n  The conference report provides no funding for the National Park \nService to manage the Mojave National Preserve. Instead, it turns \nmanagement back over to the BLM, the agency which managed the East \nMojave so poorly before enactment of the desert bill and provided the \nwhole enthusiasm for creating a national park. And the bill also \nprovides a totally inadequate amount for the BLM to do the job. The BLM \nwas criticized when it had $1.7 million to run this area. It did not do \nit adequately with that amount. And now there is no money for the Park \nService, with the exception of the $500,000 for planning.\n  I believe this is contrary to the wishes of the people of California. \nIncluded in a statewide poll, conducted very recently and just released \nyesterday, were some new poll numbers with respect to the views of \nCalifornians and this park. Statewide, 74 percent of all Californians \nopposed a limit on the Park Service budget for management of this park. \nStatewide, 84.6 percent of Californians today support keeping the \nMojave a national park. In every region of the State, in this new \nstatewide poll, people overwhelmingly supported keeping the Mojave as a \nnational park. Only 9 percent of the people of the State of California \nin this Field Institute poll oppose the park.\n  I want to emphasize that the local communities and businesses--this \nis a very sparsely populated area--and the Barstow, Baker, and Newberry \nSprings Chamber of Commerce have welcomed the Park Service to the \nMojave and support the new park. Let me read what they have to say.\n  The Barstow Area Chamber of Commerce says: ``The National Park \nService is graciously welcomed to Barstow and to the Mojave Desert. The \nchamber hopes that the needed funds will be appropriated in a timely \nmanner so that quality facilities and services will be accomplished as \nsoon as possible by the Park Service's personnel.''\n  The Barstow Development Corp. writes: ``The park will be beneficial \nto the majority of business persons in Barstow and to Barstow's \neconomy, therefore being a positive influence to most of the citizens \nin Barstow.''\n  The Newberry Springs Chamber of Commerce says: ``Newberry Springs is \nproud to be so near this unusual and wonderful area. Let it be known \nthat we highly endorse the new Superintendent and staff and we pledge \nour support and cooperation to this project.''\n  Little do they know, this bill is taking it all away.\n  The Baker Chamber of Commerce says: ``Our community is the gateway to \nthe East Mojave Preserve. Our community has embraced the changes that \nthe Preserve has brought. In accord appropriate funding for the East \nMojave Preserve would be duly appreciated.''\n  The Los Angeles Times, San Jose Mercury News, San Diego Union \nTribune, and the San Francisco Chronicle have all called on the \nPresident to veto the Interior appropriations bill because of its \nattack on the East Mojave.\n  Let me read just a few of the editorial headlines.\n  The San Diego Union Tribune, December 3: ``Starved for funds; \nCongressman victimizes Mojave Preserve.''\n  San Bernardino Sun, a paper in the area, November 18: ``Lewis \nConfuses Park Issue with Flap Over Sheep.''\n  San Francisco Chronicle, November 17: ``While they are at it, they \nshould strip all environmental riders, including the defunding of the \nMojave National Preserve in California.''\n  San Jose Mercury News, September 25: ``Moan on the range; Republicans \nResume the Destruction of Public Lands.'' ``In an insult to California, \nthe bill, this time, appropriated $1 for the management of the new \nMojave National Preserve, a way of undoing congressional establishment \nof the park last year.''\n  Nobody should think it is anything other than just that.\n  Los Angeles Times, Friday, September 22: ``Clinton Should Reject \nSabotage of Desert Act; he needs California and California needs \nprotective law.''\n  San Diego Union, again: ``Desert Mischief; Veto the Interior \nAppropriations Bill.''\n  San Francisco Chronicle, again: ``Veto the Environmental Wrecking \nLegislation.''\n  If it counts for anything at all, these are the views of the people \nof California. Eighty-four percent of the people support the Mojave \nNational Preserve. The chambers of commerce of the small communities \nright in the area support the funding of the Mojave Preserve. Every \nmajor newspaper in the State supports the funding of the Mojave \nPreserve. Yet, today, we have a bill before us that completely undoes \nthe intent of the last Congress to create what is a beautiful national \npark and what is a prime and beautiful desert area.\n  The BLM is neither capable nor mandated to manage the Mojave National \nPreserve. As I say, even with a budget of $1.7 billion, three times the \n$599,000 the conference has now given to the BLM, the BLM did not \nadequately manage this 1.4-million-acre area.\n  Without adequate funding for management of the Mojave, not only park \nvisitors but those who live and work in the region will suffer. \nAccording to the National Park Service, permits for grazing \nimprovements will not be processed and issued. Requests for rights-of-\nway will not be processed and approved. Mining plans of operation will \nnot be processed and approved. Search and rescue and emergency medical \nservices will be dangerously underfunded. Trash collection, restroom \nmaintenance, and any hazardous spill cleanup will be cut back or \neliminated. The visitors center and camp grounds may be closed. Park \nresources will receive minimal protection, like protection to Indian \nhieroglyphics on canyon walls, like protection to the 900 species of \nflora and fauna.\n  It limits the funding for development of a comprehensive management \nplan to $500,000, far less than what it typically costs to develop a \nplan for a new national park. It limits the amount of time the Park \nService has to develop the management plan. The California Desert \nProtection Act required a 3-year planning process and provided for \nextensive public participation. That is what the community wanted. If \nthe Park Service is to satisfy the conferees' conditions for taking \nover management of the Mojave next year, that is completing the \nmanagement plan, the agency will have to expedite the process and limit \npublic participation. That is directly contrary to the intent of the \nDesert Protection Act. The act specifically mandated an inclusive \nplanning process to ensure consideration of the views of the \nlandowners, the ranchers, local government, and others. \n\n[[Page S18598]]\n\n  This language is unprecedented. Never before has Congress required \nthe National Park Service to develop a comprehensive plan before it can \nmanage a new park. No one can tell me this is not just to kill the \naction taken by a majority. Let me say I would never do this to any \nMember or to any project that was approved by Congress--stand in front \nof it and say, all right, after 8 years, more than a dozen hearings, \nthis is authorized, but we are going to kill it because we are not \ngoing to fund it.\n  Some have suggested that the National Park Service has not adequately \nensured the continuation of human uses and has jeopardized wildlife \nrecovery efforts. This is a complete misrepresentation of the Park \nService's record in the Mojave.\n  Let me set the record straight. The Park Service has been doing a \ngood job of managing the Mojave. In the last year, the Park Service has \nimproved visitors' services. It has opened a visitors center in Baker. \nIt has improved law enforcement; it has helped curtail illegal \nactivities such as closing down two drug labs in the desert that were \noperating in the area. The Park Service has improved resource \nprotection. Visitation to the area has increased significantly, \nbringing additional businesses to the surrounding communities.\n  As the Las Vegas Review Journal reported last month, Little Nipton, a \nsmall community, has not seen so much activity since its heyday in the \nearly years of the century. Nipton is one of the entry points to the \nnew Mojave National Preserve. Gerald Freeman, the owner of the Hotel \nNipton, reports:\n\n       Since the National Park Service has taken over management \n     jurisdiction, both the volume and quality of visitation is \n     up. For example, the Hotel Nipton occupancy is up between 80 \n     and 100 percent a year. In contrast to what I would call a \n     condescending, indifferent presence of the Bureau of Land \n     Management over the last 35 years, the National Park Service \n     seems genuinely concerned with the welfare of the region. \n     They appear to me--and others out here--to be a comforting \n     and constructive presence. I urge you to support the National \n     Park Service in its mission in the Mojave National Preserve \n     and to do everything to ensure adequate funding is available \n     to maintain the viability of their presence. I am convinced \n     the rewards will be of great and lasting benefit to the \n     region including a strong and vibrant business all around; \n     greatly improving job opportunities for locals and others \n     moving into the area; a major upgrade in the perception of \n     the Mojave in the world at large; thus establishing a major \n     source of pride and revenue for San Bernardino County and the \n     State of California.\n\n  I cannot understand--we have three major chambers of commerce. We \nhave people writing in, saying visitation has gone up, it is better \nthan it was. Two drug labs have been closed. Yet because of the pique \nof some on the House Appropriations Committee, we defund it. I cannot \nunderstand this.\n  This is not just and fair public policy, particularly when we have 84 \npercent of the people of the State in support of keeping the Mojave a \nnational park according to a poll done as recently as last week. I \nhazard a guess that there is probably no new park in America that would \nget that kind of public support and yet have this body and the other \nbody defund it in its first year of operation. It is bizarre. I do not \nunderstand.\n  Let me give another example, the small little restaurant called the \nBun Boy in Baker. Owner Willis Heron writes:\n\n       I have lived in and been in business in Baker, CA for over \n     40 years. I write to express my strong support to fully fund \n     the National Park Service. Not adequately funding the \n     National Park Service is a disservice to the thousands of \n     people living in the towns of Baker, Barstow, Needles, and \n     Nipton and to the County of San Bernardino. The preserve and \n     the local communities will suffer if the proper funding is \n     withheld.\n\n  Again, I cannot understand it. The support is there. Roxanne Lang, a \nresident of Nipton says:\n\n       The National Park Service has done more for our local area \n     in the last nine months without much funding than the BLM did \n     in ten years I have been here. The National Park Service has \n     managed to eliminate some undesirables--i.e. drug dealers--\n     come into our schools and educate the children living in the \n     desert about the environment; and give locals a generally \n     good feeling that we have protection.\n\n  This body defunds it. I do not understand it. The Overson family, the \nlargest private property owner and ranchers in the preserve, also \nreport that management is much improved under the Park Service. Let me \nread their statement:\n\n       In the past 7 years under the Bureau of Land Management, \n     crucial water replacement projects, pipelines, tanks, and \n     troughs, have been put on hold. It has come to the point of \n     having to get an attorney to sue the BLM to do the \n     environmental assessments on the projects before funding will \n     be allocated. Since the National Park Service took over \n     management of the desert, many changes are apparent. We have \n     been able to work with management for a yes or no answer. \n     Projects are being worked on.\n       The effects of the rangers are also apparent. They have \n     wrote numerous speeding tickets, deterred drunk drivers, \n     closed an illegal drug lab, and have policed this isolated \n     area. Because of these reasons, we feel we would be better \n     off under Park Service management.\n\n  That is from the largest property owner in the Mojave Preserve, and \nthis bill defunds it. I do not understand it.\n  Mr. President, Congress established the national preserve. There was \nalready a concession to the opposition who wanted a national preserve \nwith hunting. They got their national preserve with hunting, but under \nthe Park Service so the environmental protections could be provided.\n  Guess what they did? They then turned around and defunded it--\nsomething that has 84 percent support throughout the entire State of \nCalifornia after the first year in operation. It is absolutely bizarre.\n  I have spoken to the administration. I am convinced they will veto \nthis bill, and one of the reasons they will veto this bill is this kind \nof subrogation of the will of Congress.\n  It is selfish, it is vain, it is wrong, it is not good policy, and it \nshould not happen.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the words of the \nSenator from California, and I must say I have some sympathy for her \nposition on this issue and understand how she is upset. She mentioned \nthat she was concerned about the preservation of Indian hieroglyphics \nin the park there, and I also have a lot of knowledge of native \nAmerican issues. I understand that.\n  I wish that the Senator from California had voted to restore some of \nthe funding for live Indians, the live Indians which Senator Domenici, \nSenator Inouye, and myself tried to restore. We tried to restore some \nof the draconian cuts that were made.\n  Native Americans are deeply concerned about preserving hieroglyphics. \nBut they are also concerned about preserving their ability to manage \ntheir land, child welfare and family services, et cetera.\n  I do not mean it as a criticism of the Senator from California. I \nmust say from listening to her somewhat emotional remarks, I hope that \nwe can sit down and get some kind of better treatment of what is \nobviously a very important cultural and environmental area in the State \nof California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nwith how little funding was restored by the conferees to native \nAmerican programs in H.R. 1977, the fiscal year 1996 appropriations \nbill for Interior and related agencies.\n\n  During our consideration of the bill in August, the Senate rejected a \nDomenici-McCain-Inouye amendment to restore $200 million to address \nwhat I believed was a draconian cut in funding for tribal governments. \nI say ``draconian'' because I know no other word to describe a cut that \nwould have reduced last year's tribal funding by more than 25 percent. \nI withheld from offering further floor amendments after the chairman of \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee assured me on the floor of \nthis Senate that he would support significant restorations to these \ntribal accounts in conference.\n  Mr. President, we now have before us the results of the conference \ncommittee's action. While I appreciate the sincere efforts of the \nmembers of the conference committee, I do not consider the amounts \nrestored to tribal accounts significant enough. The conference bill \nmaintains disproportionately deep cuts in critical funding needed for \nessential services on Indian Reservations. I believe the funding \npriorities reflected in this bill breach our \n\n[[Page S18599]]\nNation's treaty obligations to tribal governments.\n  The conference bill provides $654 million for tribal priority \nallocations, nearly a 9\\1/2\\-percent cut from the fiscal year 1995 \nfunding level of $722 million. This nine and one-half percent reduction \nwill gut basic tribal government operations on Reservations, where the \nspending priorities are set by tribally elected officials, not Federal \nbureaucrats or Members of Congress who are far removed from reservation \nrealities. Let me be clear--the tribal funds slashed by 9\\1/2\\-percent \nunder this bill are under the direct control of tribal governments, not \nFederal bureaucrats. These cuts will not reduce the Federal \nbureaucracy. They will, however, sharply reduce tribal services and \nemployment on Indian reservations.\n  Tribes have used these funds to deliver critically needed services to \nReservation residents, such as criminal law enforcement and public \nsafety efforts, elderly housing improvement and repair, child abuse \nprotection and intervention services, adult vocational training, \nnatural resource protection, child welfare and family services, land \nmanagement, reservation road maintenance, administrative support \nactivities, and other essential tribal government programs and \noperations. Tribal governments spend these funds on social workers, \npolice officers, teachers, jailers, bookkeepers, and auditors. They \nmake emergency home repairs. They fight fires. They clear and maintain \nroadways. They patrol land and water to deter poaching and to protect \nnatural resources. Tribes rely on these funds to meet basic \ngovernmental obligations to their citizens.\n  In addition to the elimination of many essential services, these cuts \nwill cause many reservation jobs to disappear. Since many reservations \nare in remote and impoverished locations with unemployment rates 10 to \n20 times the national rate, tribal governments typically are the \nlargest, and often the only, employers in Indian Country. Consequently, \nthe 9\\1/2\\-percent cut in tribal funding from fiscal year 1995 levels \nwill cause great hardship for many Indian households whose breadwinners \nwill have no choice other than to move away from their reservation \ncommunities to seek employment.\n  Mr. President, the American people have spoken--they don't want new \ntaxes, they don't want the Federal Government to grow, and they don't \nwant deficit spending today that will make their children, and their \nchildren's children, pay and pay for years to come. I stand with those \nof us in the Senate who say enough is enough, that Federal funding must \nbe reduced, not just restrained.\n  My problem with the Interior spending bill is not with its overall \nreductions. My problem is with how the conferees set their priorities \nwithin the overall reductions. Earlier this year I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to analyze Federal spending trends on \nprograms for American Indians and Alaska Natives over the past 20 \nyears, and compare it to Federal spending for other Americans. The CRS \nfound a steadily growing gap between what the Federal Government spends \non Indians and non-Indians that began to widen in 1985. Since 1985, per \ncapita Federal spending for Indians has fallen far behind per capita \nFederal spending on non-Indians. I am convinced there are many accounts \nin the Interior bill which are significantly lower national priorities \nthan these tribal programs. Funding for these lesser priorities should \nhave been reduced or eliminated in order to protect Indian funding.\n  My position on this is consistent with the Budget Resolution, which \nrecommended to the Appropriations Committees that Indian program \nfunding be held at 1995 levels and that the necessary reductions in \nbudget authority be taken from other accounts. The conference committee \nchose to disregard these priorities and instead made Indian programs \nwithin the Interior Department bear a strikingly disproportionate share \nof the cuts.\n  Mr. President, many years ago, our predecessors in the U.S. Senate \nratified treaties made with tribal governments in exchange for land and \npeace. The U.S. Constitution calls these treaties the highest law of \nour land. Neither the passage of time nor the changing of the guard has \neroded our legal obligations as a Nation towards Native Americans. In \nmy view, H.R. 1977 turns our national priorities upside-down, and \nplaces a stain on our national honor.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against \nadoption of H.R. 1977, as proposed by the conference committee, because \nit seriously shortchanges Indian tribes and violates our Nation's \ntreaty obligations to Native Americans.\n  Mr. President, traditionally the Interior appropriations bill has \nbeen loaded with ear marks. Although this year's bill represents an \nimprovement over past year's bills, it still contains many items that \nraise questions.\n  I want to state that these questions should not be interpreted in any \nway as to call into question the integrity of the bill's managers. I \nknow they have worked hard and deserve much credit for the work they \nhave done. But as I have routinely stated on the floor of the Senate, \nwhen earmarks and other specific provisions that have never been \nconsidered by either the full House or Senate are added to bills in \nconference then my right as a Senator to amend those provisions is \ndenied me. That is wrong. The people of Arizona expect me to act to \nprevent their hard-earned tax dollars from being sent to Washington and \nthen squandered on projects that have never seen the light of day. That \nis why I raise these issues.\n  First, let me note my strong concern regarding this legislation's \ntreatment of native Americans.\n  I also want to raise some other issues I would hope the managers \nwould elaborate on.\n  Amendment No. 2 in the conference report contains the following \nearmark:\n  ``Of which $2,000,000 shall be available for assessment of the \nmineral potential of public lands in Alaska pursuant to P.L. 96-487 . . \n.''\n  Perhaps the Senator from Washington could explain the necessity for \nthis provision being added in conference?\n  I would like to know why is this provision being added in conference \nhaving not been considered by either body in an amendable form?\n  Is there any reason this provision could not wait to be added to some \nauthorizing language?\n  I say to the Senator from Washington that it is terribly aggravating \nto those of us who represent the citizens of our State who find these \nprovisions added in a conference report because they are not amendable, \nnor do we have the opportunity to vote up or down.\n  Amendment No. 47 is particularly interesting. The House language \noriginally was one sentence:\n  ``For expenses necessary for the orderly closure of the Bureau of \nMines, $87,000,000.''\n  The Senate struck that language and added a paragraph with more \nspecifics.\n  However, the conference report now contains a long list of specific \nprovisions detailing office closures and transfers in specific cities \nand locations. I am very concerned about these new details, added \nbehind closed door, that I am now expected to vote on. The language \nnotes certain office in Pennsylvania and Oregon.\n  I would like the managers of this bill to explain the meaning and \npurpose of this large amendment.\n  Amendment No. 84 deals with the Presidio. It is my understanding that \nthis historic old Army base has been ordered closed as a result of the \nBRAC process. However, this bill contains language appropriating funds \nto keep this facility, or at least parts of this facility open. The \ncommittee also notes that separate legislation detailing the future of \nthe Presidio may be considered by the Congress later this or next year.\n  Based on that fact, why are we appropriating funds for the Presidio \nat this time?\n  I am very concerned about the creation of the Presidio trust fund. In \nArizona we closed Williams Air Force Base. We have not--nor do I think \nthere will ever be created--a Williams trust fund. This is an issue \nthat deserves much consideration and debate. I would hope that we would \nnot be paving the road for the creation of the trust fund in this bill.\n  Therefore, I want to ask the question, if such funds must be \nappropriated, should they not be subject to authorization or to passage \nof the Presidio trust fund bill?\n  I also have questions regarding amendments Nos. 101 and 104. These \n\n[[Page S18600]]\n  amendments apparently place an across-the-board prohibition on the \nForest Service. After the bill mandates this sweeping prohibition, it \ncontains one specific exception to this new rule. The language added in \nconference states, ``* * * other than the Regional Office for Region 5 \nfor the Forest Service, from San Francisco to excess military property \nat Mare Island, Vallejo, California.'' Perhaps the managers can explain \nthis unique exception.\n  I think, if I could seek the answers to those questions from the \nmanager of the bill, I might have a better understanding of this \nconference report.\n  Mr. Gorton addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has raised \nlegitimate questions about several of these amendments. I will prepare \nanswers to them--we have two other Members waiting to speak--and try to \nanswer them properly after those two Members have had their \nopportunity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I do \nbelieve this bill is a significant improvement. I do not believe there \nis a great deal of the traditional earmarks and add-ons in conference. \nI wish there were none.\n  I realize the Senator from Washington and the ranking member have \nvery difficult decisions to make and that there are enormous pressures \non them in certain areas to sometimes clean up certain aspects of the \nlegislation that has not been brought up at the proper time. But I \nwould like, as I say for the benefit of my friend from Washington--\namendment No. 2, which is $2 million available for assessments of \nmineral potential of public lands in Alaska; amendment No. 47, all of \nthe long list of specific provisions which are associated with the \nclosure of the Bureau of Mines; amendment No. 84, about the Presidio; \nand amendments Nos. 101 and 104, which place across-the-board \nprohibition on the Forest Service, and then there is one specific \nexception.\n  I thank my colleague from the State of Washington. I understand it \nmay take some time. Since this is a very large piece of legislation, it \nmay take some time to adequately address those concerns.\n  Again, I congratulate the Senator from Washington on doing a very \nsincere and difficult job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be yielded such \ntime as I may consume from that of Senator Bumpers, who controls time \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the Senator from \nMissouri, the reason I stood before him is because we had a Democrat, \nSenator Feinstein, and then traditionally we are going back and forth. \nSo I waited for Senator McCain. That is the traditional way we have \ndone things for the last few days. I assume we would go back to a \nRepublican next.\n  Mr. President, I first want to say about the two managers of this \nbill, the senior Senator from Washington and the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, I have worked with them on this bill and other matters \nover the years. I have found them both to be the best.\n  Senator Byrd's history, of course, is replete with his knowledge of \nprocedures. Of course this bill is a bill that he has managed for many \nyears. But let me just say about the senior Senator from Washington, \nthe manager of the bill this year, he has spent a great deal of time on \nthis legislation. He has had tremendous difficulties. I participated \nwith him, trying to work out some of the differences. We have had the \nbill before the Senate, or the conference report, three times, as I \nunderstand it. So, I recognize the problems the manager has had, how \nhard it has been. It is not a perfect bill. I recognize that. My \ncriticism of the legislation does not go to the managers of the bill \nbut, rather, to the content of the legislation and the fact, in these \ntimes of very strict budget constraints, sometimes we disagree with the \npriorities.\n  Having said that, I say this bill is extremely important to the State \nof Nevada. The U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nthe Bureau of Land Management--there are many important aspects of this \nlegislation that have a direct impact on the State of Nevada. I am not \ngoing to spend a lot of time today talking about the things about which \nI just spoke, even though, with the Park Service, the busiest entity in \nthe entire Park Service is the Lake Mead Recreational Area. Last year, \nthere were almost 10 million visitors to that very fragile facility. It \nis an example of where we are not really taking care of our parks in \nthis country. Lake Mead needs tremendous renovation because of the \nmassive numbers of people who use that facility. The people who use \nLake Mead do not use it just during the daylight hours. It is a 24-hour \nrecreation facility. Because of the shift work that takes place \nthroughout southern Nevada, people are coming on that facility all \ntimes of the day and night. It needs a lot of work. That money, that \nwould lead to the work being done, the renovations being done, \nimprovements being done on that recreation area, is not in this bill.\n  I do not criticize anyone in particular, other than to say that our \npark system is really in a bad state of repair. It is no better \nillustrated than the Lake Mead Recreation Area.\n  Today I am going to spend my time talking about a part of this bill \nthat I think is really disturbing, and that is the Endangered Species \nAct and how it is dealt with. First of all, this conference report does \nnot adequately provide funding for effective implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act. That is important because, whether you are a \nproponent of the Endangered Species Act or whether you believe the act \nshould not be in existence, the fact of the matter is that if it is \ninadequately funded it does not work for anyone.\n  Second, this conference report maintains the moratorium on listing of \nthreatened and endangered species. I object to these provisions. I do \nit, not to be an obstructionist, but to enable the Fish and Wildlife \nService in preserving and protecting species that are in a state of \nimminent extinction. In sum, the Fish and Wildlife Service must be able \nto carry out the noble goals of saving species from extinction.\n\n  I am a ranking member of the authorizing committee that will, \nhopefully next year, participate in reauthorizing the Endangered \nSpecies Act. I have worked with the junior Senator from the State of \nIdaho in coming up with legislation. He has introduced a bill that I do \nnot support, but I am confident that we can come up with legislation \nthat meets the goals of both of us. If we cannot, I will introduce a \nbill sometime next spring, and, hopefully in the near future, we will \nbe able to stand in this Chamber and work out our difference. We need \nto reauthorize the Endangered Species Act.\n  What is taking place in this legislation, in this conference report, \nis not the appropriate way to do business. I remind this body, as a \nsignificant number of witnesses pointed out before our committee, \nextinction is irrevocable. Extinction is forever. It is important that \nwe understand that these are not problems that we can go back and deal \nwith later. Once there is an extinction it is over with. It is over \nwith for good. To deny the Department of Interior the funds needed to \nensure good science is to invoke a self-fulfilling prophecy of the \nfailure of this act.\n  Extinction cannot be altered. We cannot have second thoughts. It is \npermanent. That permanence should weigh heavily when we consider our \npriorities.\n  We must make no mistake about it, our priorities are reflected in \nthis budget, and I say respectfully that our priorities in regard to \nthis act are skewed. I acknowledge that there are some real problems \nwith the Endangered Species Act in its current state. We need to \nreauthorize the act, we need to change it, we need to make sure there \nis the ability for consultation with State and local government and \nwith the private sector. We have to make sure there are exemptions for \nsmall property owners. We have to make sure that there are incentives \nfor people complying with the Endangered Species Act. Those things are \nnot in the act at this time. We have to put them in the act.\n  But to simply defund it, or fund it inadequately and to place a \nmoratorium on listings, is not the way to do business. \n\n[[Page S18601]]\n\n  I acknowledge, I repeat, the problems with the Endangered Species \nAct. I talked about some of them. These problems we have talked about \nat long length before the authorizing committee, and they are going to \nbe addressed in the substantive legislation when it comes to this body \nand it is debated here on the floor.\n  That is why, Mr. President, a moratorium on listing species is wrong. \nThe moratorium removes flexibility of the Secretary of the Interior. It \ndelays action when action is critical. This moratorium in this \nconference report does, in fact, jeopardize the existence of species.\n  In this conference report, I think that we find a lot of impatience \nfor substantive, reasonable, and prudent reform. We should be patient. \nWe should recognize that this bill needs to be reauthorized. The \nmoratorium would, regretfully, in my estimation, remain in effect \ndespite the lack of logic, despite the damaging effects, and despite \nthe fact the committees of jurisdiction have and will continue to \naddress issues of concern.\n  The proponents of the Endangered Species Act reform argued for better \nscience throughout the process of specie preservation. I ask, how is \nbetter science provided for if the funding is not provided for? Many \nwho argue for reform of the Endangered Species Act assert the need to \ndo more than just list a species, but also to declassify and delist \nspecies. Let us make sure the agency has the ability to do that, and \nthey only have the ability to do that if there is sufficient funding.\n  But then what is the effect of failing to fund the act at an \neffective level? Mr. President, one of the effects of insufficient \nfunding would be a decline of the medicinal research and humanitarian \npurposes that have benefited from the preservation and study of species \nand plants. Indeed, there is a great hope, hope of thousands of people \nwho are fighting diseases that are anchored in the search for cures \nwithin the ecosystems and plant life that today may be on the verge of \nextinction.\n  More than 40 percent of prescriptions filled in our country, in the \nUnited States, each year derive from plants, animals, and microbes. \nThese include medicines to fight cancers, infections, contagious \ndisease, heart disease, childhood leukemia, to name just a few.\n  There is a lot of fun made of the Endangered Species Act. Why do we \nworry about this animal or that plant? The reason we worry about them \nis, I repeat, 40 percent of the prescriptions filled in our country are \nderived from plants, animals, and microbes.\n  Take, for example, the rosy periwinkle. It sounds funny, does it not, \nrosy periwinkle? In this little plant, two compounds were found that \nhave proved successful in treating Hodgkin's disease and childhood \nleukemia.\n  As far as childhood leukemia, it cures childhood leukemia except in \nrare cases. When the Presiding Officer and I were children, teenagers, \nyoung adults, children who got leukemia died. It is not that way \nanymore. Parents who have little children who have childhood leukemia \nare cured. Why? Because of something called the rosy periwinkle.\n  There is also a pupfish, an imperiled desert vertebrate, residing in \nisolated hot springs in the Southwest part of this country. The pupfish \ncan survive in very high salt concentrations, and this ability is being \nstudied as we speak by researchers in hopes of developing new \ntreatments for kidney disease.\n  This pupfish is extinct in many places. There are a variety of \npupfish. In the State of Nevada, we have an agricultural area that grew \ncotton. Because of the pupfish, the water that supplied the cotton was \ncurtailed, and that area is no longer a cotton farming area. That is \nthe sacrifice that was made for this little fish that will, all \nscientists say, lead to some dramatic changes in the way we treat renal \nfailure.\n\n  We do not know every plant and animal that exists and, consequently, \nwe do not know every cure, remedy, and healing that may exist for our \nbenefit.\n  I am not going to take the time of this body. There are Senators \nwishing to speak on this floor. I could list plant after plant that \nleads to helping relieve the pain and misery of disease and, in many \ninstances, cures disease. Of the 220,000 worldwide types of plants, \nonly 5,000 have been examined for medicinal compounds. We know, as a \nresult of an article within the past year in the Wall Street Journal \nthat talked about some of these plants that were deemed to be \nworthless, how they have brought about dramatic improvements in the way \nwe treat disease.\n  The black bear, which is a threatened bear in many parts of the \nUnited States, are now being studied because scientists believe they \nhave found definitive and definite clues to the prevention of \nosteoporosis. How? The bear loses no bone mass during its 5- to 6-month \nhibernation period, and scientists are wondering why. They are now \nbeginning to find out why.\n  What cures are we willing to risk losing with lack of funding of the \nEndangered Species Act? I do not think we should be willing to risk the \nloss of any cures. Recently, the American Society of Microbiology \ncalled for increased research in potential medicinal plants and other \nspecies, which takes on an urgency as known diseases grow resistant to \nknown antibiotics.\n  How can we justify underfunding such a vital work of preserving \nspecies? I know there are problems with the Endangered Species Act. I \nsay that on this floor for the second time today. I know that we have \nto reauthorize it and make some changes in the way the act has been \nadministered. But I tell each of my colleagues, we must trust the \nlegislative process of reauthorization and reform and fully fund the \nEndangered Species Act. It is not happening in this conference report, \nand that is too bad.\n  We ensure for ourselves the need for more emergency saving efforts. \nThis is a small price to pay when it comes to protecting and preserving \nspecies faced with imminent extinction.\n  I repeat, I recognize the difficulty of this legislation arriving at \nthe point where it is. I again extend my congratulations and applause \nto the managers of this legislation, the senior Senator from the State \nof Washington and the senior Senator from the State of West Virginia. \nBut I really feel that this conference report is lacking in a number of \ndifferent ways, not the least of which is the problem with the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND.

The \nSenator is recognized to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18595-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18601-S18602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VA, HUD, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the reason I asked for morning business at \nthis time was to bring my colleagues up to date and those who are very \nmuch interested in the appropriations process, particularly as it \nregards the Environmental Protection Agency, VA, and HUD, and what is \nhappening here.\n\n  We have had a bill that has been passed by the Senate, passed by the \nHouse, and a conference report passed by the House that is waiting \nhere. We have not passed it because the administration has promised \nclearly and unequivocally to veto it.\n  There are several things that are going to happen today. First, the \nmajority leader has scheduled the measure to be passed later on after \nthis bill, perhaps in wrapup tonight, and second, there is a major \nmedia effort to mischaracterize, I believe, what is going on with \nrespect to the environment.\n  Some of my colleagues may have seen an article in today's Washington \nPost: ``Temporary Reductions Halt `Environmental Cop.' '' It relates to \nconcerns expressed by EPA Administrator Carol Browner.\n  I am getting a little tired of the press conferences, press \nstatements, and grandstanding from the White House regarding how the \nmajority in the Congress is rolling back environmental protection and \nmaking deep cuts in the environment.\n  Ms. Browner is reported in the Post as saying, ``The environmental \ncop is not on the beat.'' She decries the fact \n\n[[Page S18602]]\nthat the temporary budget reductions resulting from the current \ncontinuing resolution are causing a reduction in inspections. I agree \nwith her. I would like to see a bill passed and signed into law.\n  Let me set the record straight. The EPA appropriations bill which \npassed the Senate earlier this year funded EPA's operating programs at \nthe fiscal year 1995 level, and the conference report on VA-HUD and \nindependent agencies provides a total funding level for EPA which is \n$48 million more than the Senate-passed bill, a reduction of only 4 \npercent below the postrescissions fiscal year 1995 funding level.\n  We have managed in a very, very tight budget to provide close to full \nfunding for EPA at a time when constraints on discretionary spending \nare extraordinarily tight. This subcommittee received an allocation \nwhich was 12 percent below last year's level, yet we managed to hold \nEPA at close to current funding levels. Despite the rhetoric from \ndowntown, this demonstrates, I believe, a Republican commitment to \ncontinue to improve the environment.\n  Now, I am the first to admit that the EPA has received some targeted \nbudget cuts in the appropriations process but the reductions came from \nareas which the National Academy of Public Administration and others \nidentified as being unnecessary, wasteful or duplicative. NAPA is a \nnonpartisan organization which was commissioned by my Democratic \ncolleague and predecessor, Senator Mikulski, then chair of the \ncommittee, to undertake a report on reforming EPA 2 years ago.\n  In this bill and the conference report, we followed the NAPA \nrecommendations presented to Congress almost a year ago to turn more \nresponsibility over to the States that have developed an enormous \ncapacity over the past 25 years to manage environmental programs, \nincluding inspections of facilities. According to NAPA, ``EPA should \nrevise its approach to oversight, providing high performing States with \ngrant flexibility, reduced oversight and greater autonomy.''\n  That is what we have tried to do for this appropriations bill, and we \nhave included authority for EPA to begin issuing block grants for \nmaximum flexibility. We have tried to focus on the areas of highest \nrisk to human health and the environment and reduce those programs \nwhich do not get the most bang for the buck in terms of environmental \nprotection.\n  But the administration and EPA, rather than spending time organizing \npress conferences and news events, should be following the \nrecommendations of NAPA to get its own house in order. Despite EPA's \nclaim to support NAPA's recommendations, we have seen little in terms \nof real change. And regarding today's article in the Post, let me point \nout to my colleagues that indeed EPA is operating under a constrained \nbudget because of the continuing resolution, and I am fully prepared to \nsend a bill to the President so they will not have to operate under a \ncontinuing resolution. The conference report on the EPA bill, that is, \nVA-HUD and independent agencies, would provide an increase of 11.5 \npercent over the current continuing resolution, yet the President wants \nto veto the bill. His agents have stated unequivocally that he will.\n  I have suggested to administration officials that I as chairman, the \nranking member, Senator Mikulski, and our colleagues in similar \npositions in the House, are more than willing to sit down to find \naccommodations within the 602(b) allocation to negotiate a reasonable \ncompromise.\n  Rather than negotiating with us, today I am told later on the Vice \nPresident will hold a press conference with Administrator Browner at a \nsuburban Maryland wastewater treatment plant where they will continue \nto attack Republican reductions in environmental improvements. Rather \nthan pointing to the successes achieved over the past years to improve \nour water quality, they will talk about how the budget will impair \nfuture water quality improvements.\n  Let me set the record straight, Mr. President. Funding for EPA \nwastewater treatment construction in this year's bill is $1.125 \nbillion. In addition, the conference report stipulates that if \nlegislation enacting a new drinking water State revolving fund is not \nauthorized by June 1, 1996, an additional $500 million will be \navailable for wastewater State revolving funds for a total of $1.625 \nbillion.\n\n  Mr. President, this would represent an increase of about $400 million \nover last year's level.\n  Now, in the last 2 weeks or more, I have repeatedly requested of top \nadministration officials that they tell us how they wish to reallocate \nspending within the 602(b) allocations. I have made that request among \nothers to Administrator Browner, to CEQ director, Ms. McGinty, to OMB \ndirector Dr. Rivlin, to the Vice President himself. I put in a call to \nthe President. Obviously, he has other things on his mind. But none of \nthese people has responded.\n  As a result, it appears that when this bill goes down, if the \nPresident carries through on his threat to veto it, it will be vetoed \nand EPA will fall back to the level of the continuing resolution. The \nonly word we have heard from the administration is they want to spend \nabout $2 billion more.\n  The White House talks the language of reducing spending to balance \nthe budget, but they do not have the music yet. They think the only way \nthey can live is to spend more money. We have done the very best we can \nto establish priorities within the context of achieving a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002.\n  I wish to say for the record that my ranking member, Senator \nMikulski, has gone out of her way to be helpful, to work with us, to \nmake as many accommodations and improvements in the bill as possible. \nShe too has sought the involvement of the administration. And even \nthough Senator Mikulski's top priority, national service, is not funded \nin this bill, other than for close-down, it cannot be funded unless and \nuntil the administration is willing to sit down with us and tell us \nwhere they wish to make cuts to generate the support to pass this bill \nin both Houses.\n  Senator Mikulski has been thoroughly cooperative throughout. I could \nnot ask for anyone who has been more willing to put the needs of the \nenvironment, of veterans, of housing, of space, and other important \nagencies ahead of partisan bickering. It is with great regret that I \ntell my colleagues that we are likely to see the measure, which is \nscheduled for passage later on tonight, vetoed by the President because \nsimply he wants to spend more money.\n  I make the point again for those interested in the environment that \nif the President were to sign this bill, or if the President were even \nto send his people to discuss with us how to make improvements to \nprotect their priorities, we would be more than willing to negotiate \nwith them. Absent any response--and there has been no response--this \nbill will be scheduled later on for passage this evening. I regret that \nwe will not receive the funding for environmental actions that are \nincluded in this conference report if the President chooses to veto it. \nBut make no mistake. If there is a reduction in funding for \nenvironmental efforts, it will be the President's decision. It will be \nthe President's veto. He is going to get a bill that is very close to \nlast year's funding, and it protects the top priority programs in EPA.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18601-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18602-S18616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                        1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I will be very brief. I rise to speak in opposition to \nthe conference report. I know there are others who want to speak, and I \nsimply want to make a few points.\n  I think it will be vetoed. I think it should be vetoed. I think that \nit continues the process of watering down our efforts to protect the \nenvironment, and it in my view should be rejected.\n  There are three areas that I believe need our special attention. The \nfirst is that under the conference report the protection of fish, \nwildlife and plant species awaiting endangered species listing would be \nblocked for another year, even if the species is on the brink of \nextinction. \n\n[[Page S18603]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have an Endangered Species Act in order to protect \nthose species that are on the brink of extinction. If we delay listing \nyear after year, we might as well not have a law. When you delay the \nimplementation of this law, you do not have one at all. We cannot \ndeclare any species in that period of time as endangered and the damage \nmay be permanent. This is of real concern in a number of areas, for \nexample, the marbled murrelet. I also know that the Mount Graham \nsquirrel is an important specie that is endangered and affected by this \nact. I am not sure that in the next year it is going to be all over for \neither one, but the general direction is clear. If we continue to \nprevent the law from functioning, we might as well not even have that \nlaw, which, of course, is the intention of some who will delay the \nimplementation of the law.\n  Second, Mr. President, is the rider on alternative P to the Tongass \nNational Forest timber plan in Alaska. The conference report locks into \nplace, through fiscal year 1997, the timber requirements of alternative \nP, which is a 4-year-old discredited draft forest plan. Alternative P \nmandates a logging target approximately 44 percent higher than the \naverage cutting level over the past decade. And it does so in an area \nwhere the largest number of jobs are in tourism and fishing and not in \ntimber cutting and in an area where unemployment is very low compared \nto the national average.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned about what we have done in this \nbill with regard to Tongass. I think that it allows for much more \ncutting than we had anticipated when we passed the 1990 Tongass Timber \nReform Act. And it is another example of Congress' changing things for \nthe worse after there has been an agreement because the votes are there \nto change those things. And I think, frankly, it will be one of the \nmajor reasons that the President will veto this bill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there are a series of cuts in vital programs. \nThis bill follows the pattern set in the VA-HUD appropriations bill \nwhich makes reductions in the Corps of Engineers wetland enforcement \nbudget and forbids the EPA from enforcing wetlands law, which in my \nState of New Jersey is a tremendously important thing.\n  This bill repeals protection for the newly created Mojave National \nPark and halts scientific studies needed to protect critical species in \nthe Columbia River basin.\n  It halts the Department of Energy's program to set energy appliance \nefficiency standards that have been developed jointly with the \nindustry, which will save consumers a lot of money and reduce the U.S. \ndependence on foreign oil. One might say you can save more oil from \nincreased conservation than you could from opening up the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. President, this bill has gotten better, but it still does not \nmeet what I think are the highest possible standards. The President's \nstatement on the report cites several additional shortcomings. For \nexample, there is $50 million in funding restored for the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and the Indian Health Service. This additional funding, \nhowever, falls short of levels needed to maintain these important \nprograms.\n  While the Bureau of Indian Affairs' budget has been increased $25 \nmillion above the previous conference level, that would still leave the \nprogram $111 million short of the House mark and $159 million below \nfiscal year 1995 enacted levels.\n  The most significant effect of this action remains the crippling \nreductions targeted at tribal priority allocation programs which \nsupport essential tribal government, law enforcement, housing \nimprovement, Indian child welfare, adult vocational training, road \nmaintenance, and other basic reservation services.\n  I believe that this funding should be restored. It is not in the \nreport. I think this will be another reason that the President will \nveto this proposal.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion, I think the report has gotten \nbetter, but it is not yet good enough. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe bill and the President to veto it because I do not think that the \nAmerican people in 1994 voted for an attack on environmental problems. \nI believe we should not be delivering to the American people an \nantienvironmental Christmas present. I do not think they asked for it, \nand I do not think they will welcome it. I hope that the President will \nveto the bill.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There are a lot of parts of this bill that I would like \nto address. I agree with the Senator from New Jersey that the bill is \ncertainly better than it was in its original version. Thanks to the \nHouse of Representatives, who refused to accept it and voted \noverwhelmingly to recommit it to the conference, it has been improved.\n  To tell you the truth, Mr. President, I am so sick of making this \nspeech I am about to make, I cannot tell you how tiresome it is, and \nyet until the Members of this body change their attitude about mining \non public lands, until the President and the press finally penetrate \nthe minds of the American people as to this, the greatest of all scams \nin the history of the Nation, I will come here every year, time after \ntime, to make my argument again.\n  My mother used to have an expression, ``Everybody's business is \nnobody's business.'' And I cannot think of a better application of that \nsaying than what we allow the biggest corporations in the world to pull \noff on us. It is just that it does not affect very many people.\n  There are about 10 to 12 States out West where the Federal Government \nhas extensive landholdings and where people file mineral claims to mine \ngold, silver, platinum, palladium, whatever, off the Federal lands, and \nit is very important to the mining companies and it is important to \nthose few States where it takes place. But because the other roughly 40 \nStates do not have a dog in the fight, they feel free, Senators of \nthose States feel free to vote however they chose in the certain \nknowledge that their constituents will never hold them accountable.\n  But let me recount the history of the issue of which I speak. In \n1872, Ulysses Grant signed his name to the bill called the mining law \nof 1872. And the idea was we would permit people to go west and file \nclaims on 20-acre parcels on the Federal lands there that the U.S. \nGovernment owned. Anybody could do it. And anybody can still do it. \nJust go out there and put four stakes down on a 20-acre tract, not just \none, do a dozen if you want, two dozen, whatever you want. Just file \nclaims on it. That started in 1872 as an incentive to get people to \nmove west.\n  When I first became involved in this issue there were about 1,200,000 \nclaims that had been filed. And they were required to either pay $100 a \nyear to maintain the claim or to certify that they had done $100 worth \nof work on their claim.\n  Well, everybody simply sent in a certification that said, ``I did \n$100 worth of work.'' Meanwhile, they had no intention of mining it. \nFinally, in 1993, I was able to get a bill passed through here to \nrequire them to put up $100--not a certificate that they had done $100 \nworth of work, but pay $100 cash. The number of claims dropped from 1.2 \nmillion to the present, roughly, 330,000.\n  So we have these 330,000 claims out there. If you own one of those \nclaims, what do you do next? If you are really serious about mining \nsomething, then you start digging around to see if that land has \nanything on it. Most of the time, Mr. President, the people who own \nthese claims never lay a glove on them. Some mining company comes in \nand says, ``We will pay you so much to let us work this claim, and if \nwe find anything there, we will give you a 5- or 10-percent override on \neverything we find.'' And, ordinarily, the person who owns the claim \nsays, ``That is fine with me, you are a big mining company. If anybody \ncan make this work, you can.'' The claimant gets a nice little override \nfor having simply put down four stakes on a claim.\n  But once the mining company finds something, gold, silver, whatever, \nthey go to the Bureau of Land Management and they file an application \nfor a deed. Now, this is really the most egregious part of this whole \nlaw. You think about somebody going out and putting down stakes on \nFederal land that belongs to the taxpayers of this country, finding \n\n[[Page S18604]]\ngold on it, and going to the BLM over at the Department of Interior and \nsaying, ``I want a deed to this land.'' Do you know what else? The \nSecretary of the Interior--if he can validate the claim that there is \nmineable hardrock minerals, has to give them a deed. It is not an \noption with him; he has to give them a deed. What do they pay for it? \nEither $2.50 an acre or $5.00 an acre--for billions of dollars' worth \nof gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. That is right, Mr. President. \nI am not making this up. I have made this speech every year for 7 \nyears. The Secretary of the Interior has to deed billions of dollars' \nworth of minerals that belongs to the taxpayers of this country to some \nhuge mining company for $2.50 an acre.\n  Now, the mining industry which promotes this scam recently felt some \nheat as the press has caught on to the issue. I can see the \nrepresentatives from the mining industry all sitting around the table \nsaying, ``What are we going to do? We cannot take this adverse \npublicity forever.'' And somebody says, ``I have a grand scheme. We \nwill say that we will give the Government not $2.50 an acre, but we \nwill pay them fair market value less the value of the minerals under \nthe surface. That way, we can go home and tell the Chamber of Commerce \nif they raise the issue with us, if there is a townhall meeting and \nthere are some of those people there who have been paying attention and \nwant to know why we are giving billions of dollars away to the biggest \ncorporations in the world, we will say that we will make them pay fair \nmarket value. That is where you cut it off. You do not say fair market \nvalue for the surface, which is $100 an acre. Just tell them it is fair \nmarket value.''\n  That is what the reconciliation bill says. If the bill were to become \nlaw, the mining companies would have to pay fair market value, which \nCBO says is $100 an acre, underneath which is billions of dollars' \nworth of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, for which they pay \nnothing.\n  Mr. President, there are not two Senators in this body that know \nthis. It costs the Government $250 an acre just to process patent \napplications. Think about that. Here they are going to pay fair market \nvalue of $100 an acre. They are going to pay $100 an acre for something \nthat just the processing of the claim costs the taxpayers $250. So we \nlose $150 per acre right on the front end.\n  Mr. President, see this chart right here. ``Value for the interest in \nthe land owned by the taxpayers exclusive of and without regard to the \nmineral deposits''--$2.50 an acre is the current price. The new price \nwill go to $100 an acre. In exchange for that, the biggest corporations \nin the world, many of which are foreign-owned, take billions of \ndollars' worth of taxpayers' gold and silver off the land and go home \nwith it.\n  When I first got into this, the price of gold was $330 an ounce; \nplatinum was selling for less than $400 an ounce. The argument was made \nthat ``If we have to pay a 3-percent royalty, we might be able to live \nwith that, but some of our mines might have to shut down and all these \npeople will be thrown out of work.''\n  Today, the price of gold is $390 an ounce, and platinum is $410 an \nounce. And what do you think the same argument is? ``We will have to \nshut down and put all these poor people out of work.'' You know why I \nknow personally? I am not a miner. Do you know why I know that is the \nmost specious argument of all? Because they pay an average of a 5-\npercent-net smelter return royalty to people who own private lands and \npay substantial royalties to States if they mine on State lands. It is \nonly when they mine on Federal lands they are going to go broke.\n  On December 1, 2 weeks ago, Secretary Babbitt at the Department of \nthe Interior gave ASARCO a deed for 349 acres in the Coronado National \nForest in Arizona near Tucson. What do you think the taxpayers of this \ncountry got? First of all, that 349 acres has underneath it 2.9 billion \ndollars' worth of copper and silver. What do the taxpayers get?\n  A whopping $1,745. Do you know something else? The Washington Post \nand the New York Times did not have one word about it. Not one line. I \nguarantee not one person in this body saw a news story anywhere that 2 \nweeks ago the taxpayers got shafted for $3 billion. Three months before \nthat, the Secretary of the Interior gave the Faxe Kalk Mine, a Danish \ncorporation, a deed to 110 acres of public land in Idaho. What was \nunder the 110 acres? Mr. President, $1 billion worth of travertine. \nWhat did the taxpayers get for their $1 billion? Mr. President, $275.\n  On May 16, 1994, the Secretary of the Interior gave Barrick \nResources, a subsidiary of a Canadian corporation, a deed for 1,700 \nacres of land. What did it have under it? Mr. President, $11 billion \nworth of gold. What did the taxpayers get for their $11 billion?--\n$9,000. I give the press credit; they did cover that one.\n  Stillwater Mining Co. in Montana, 2 days after I almost got a \nmoratorium put on the patenting process, filed a claim with the BLM for \ndeeds to 2,036 acres. They filed for their patent in 1990. They got \ntheir first half certificate and the Secretary of the Interior will \neventually be forced to give the Stillwater Mining Co. a deed for that \n2,036 acres. What is under that? Mr. President, $44 billion worth of \nplatinum and palladium--not my figures, their figures. Look at their \nprospectus. They are the ones who say there is 225 ounces of platinum \nand palladium on the land. We made the calculation. If that is correct, \nit is $44 billion worth of platinum and palladium. What did Uncle \nSucker get?--$10,000.\n  We talk about balancing the budget; how are we going to finance \nMedicaid, education, the environment, and all the rest of it while we \nare giving away billions and billions of dollars' worth of resources \nthat belong to the people of this country? There is not a Senator in \nthis body that has not gone home when he faced reelection and said, \n``If you elect me, I will balance the budget. I will treat your money \nas though it were mine. I will be tightfisted.'' You may be tightfisted \nwith some poor, pregnant, teenage girl, or you may elect to make \nMedicaid a block grant program so some children get health care and \nothers do not. But if things continue the way they are, you can rest \nassured those same people who are so concerned about that will continue \nto vote for this just as they have in the past. It is absolutely \nsickening. There is no other way to describe it.\n  This bill, thanks to the House of Representatives, contains a patent \nmoratorium. Let me tell you about that. There are presently 608 patent \napplications pending over at the BLM. Of the 608, 373 of the \napplications already have their first half certificate so they can go \nahead and get their deeds for $2.50 or $5 an acre. The rest of them, \n235, are frozen, subject to future legislation.\n  But do you know what was in the reconciliation bill? A royalty. My \nstaff came in and said, ``Senator So and So has put a royalty in the \nreconciliation bill--5 percent.'' Really? We started looking at it, and \nit is 5 percent of nothing after taking into account the deductions. \nWhen you look at the reconciliation bill and you see that whooping big \n5 percent royalty, and you say 5 percent of what? and you start seeing \nwhat you will deduct before you levy a royalty, there is nothing left \nto levy a royalty on. What is worse, what is even more cynical, is \nevery one of the 608 applications for patents would be exempt from the \nroyalty forever. That is billions of dollars' worth of minerals. Who \nelse is exempt? The 330,000 claims that are in existence.\n  So you cannot tax the lands for which patents have been applied and \nyou cannot tax any future claims on any applications for patent on the \n330,000 claims that are still existing. What do you wind up with? Less \nthan $1 million per year. People say, ``I wonder why President Clinton \nvetoed that reconciliation bill.'' That was only one reason.\n  Mr. President, I am still grateful to the House even though we had to \ngrandfather the 373 patent applications and will likely never get a \ndime out of it. It is a step in the right direction.\n\n  So, Mr. President, let me cover one other point. I have never \nunderstood why hard rock minerals get this exemption. We do not give it \nto anybody else.\n  When I first became involved in this issue, I could not believe it \nwas as egregious as it turned out to be. It turned out to be much worse \nthan I thought at first. At the time, people believed that somehow or \nother if you rubbed a quartz crystal a certain way it would cure your \nwarts and whatever else ails \n\n[[Page S18605]]\nyou. I did not know about it. But everybody else in America seemed to \nknow that these quartz crystals, people were being told, had healing \npowers.\n  Do you know where the biggest quartz crystal deposit in the United \nStates is? It is in the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas. People \nwere down there with picks and shovels tearing the forest up.\n  I went to Senator McClure, who was at that time vitally interested in \nthe subject. I said, ``Do you mind if I pass a bill eliminating quartz \ncrystals from the 1872 mining law?'' He said, ``No, I don't care.'' So \nI did, and in about a week's time. That is the fastest I have ever \ngotten anything done here since I have been here.\n  Every year we get a few thousand dollars in Arkansas as a royalty. I \nforget how much we charge on this. But we get a royalty on all of the \nquartz crystals taken off, and it goes to the Federal Treasury. I take \nfull credit for that. If I could have gotten this whole thing taken \ncare of by then we would not have nearly as much trouble today \nbalancing the budget as we have.\n  Why do we charge coal miners 12\\1/2\\ percent for all the coal they \nmine off Federal lands? And if you go underground to mine coal on \nFederal lands, you have to pay an 8 percent royalty. If you take \nnatural gas off Federal lands, you pay a 12\\1/2\\ percent royalty. And \nif you take oil off Federal lands, you pay a 12\\1/2\\ percent royalty. \nBut, if you take gold, silver, or platinum, or any other hardrock \nmineral, you pay nothing.\n  If I were the oil industry, I would be up in arms about this because \nwhen they go out and drill an oil well they do not know whether they \nare going to hit anything or not.\n  Mr. President, I come to the end of this little speech saying I am \ngoing to vote against the bill even though I must confess the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, who I know had a very \ndifficult time, did a tremendous job. I tried to pass an amendment in \nthe conference 2 days ago to put a 1.5 percent royalty on mining on \nFederal lands and to give half of the money to the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs. Many of the western Senators, who have a lot of Indians in \ntheir States, have convinced me that the Indians are really getting \nsavaged under this balanced budget thing. Even the President has \nallowed that the Bureau of Indian Affairs is getting shortchanged. I \nthought a 1.5 percent royalty on this with half of it going to the \nBureau of Indian Affairs might attract some people who have shed tears \non this floor about the plight of the poor native Americans--not one \nRepublican vote; 8 to 6 on a straight party-line vote.\n  What else is in this bill? I wanted to give the BLM 10 years to \nprocess the 373 patent applications that were grandfathered by bill. \nHowever, the Republicans--particularly the western Senators--were not \nhaving any of that.\n  Let me tell you something, Mr. President. If we have 373 claims that \nthe first half certificate has been issued on, and this bill says that \nthe BLM will process those claims within 5 years, do you know what that \nmeans? That means that about 75 claims a year will have to be \nprocessed. Do you know what else it means, Mr. President? That is an \nabject utter impossibility. Do you know the highest number of \napplications that have ever been processed in the history of the world \nin the BLM? Thirty-eight. Do you know who the Secretary of Interior \nwas? James Watt. The man the environmentalists loved to hate more than \nanybody else.\n  Do you know what the average has been over the past 10 years? Mr. \nPresident, 25.7 claims a year.\n  So why do we have a provision in here saying you have to do 75 a \nyear? It is utterly impossible. Why do we do that? I will tell you why \nthey want to do it. Because, if there is ever a change in the makeup of \nthis body, this nonsense is coming to a halt, and they want to get \ntheir deed before that happens. That is exactly why they want it all \ndone in 5 years.\n  I offered an amendment to say why do not we at least make these \nmining companies, who are worth billions, pay the charges the \nGovernment incurs to process their application, which is $250 an acre? \nIf you are going to give them a deed for $5 an acre, surely they would \nbe charitable enough to pay $250 to the taxpayers that they are putting \nout--8 to 6 vote; the same thing.\n  Mr. President, I do not know how it will all turn out. But I can tell \nyou one thing. The Bureau of Land Management will not, and cannot, \nprocess 75 claims a year when the 10-year average has been 25.7 claims.\n  Mr. President, there has been an awful lot written and said about \nlobby reform. The ethics manual of the U.S. Senate just gets thicker \nand thicker. The first thing you know you will not be able to drive \nhome. You will have to take a bus at the rate we deal with that around \nhere. I do not have any quarrel with that. I do not care what the \nethics requirements of this body are as long as I know what they are. \nThat is all most Senators ask for. I do not care whether the value of \nthe gift can be zero, $20, or $100 as long as I know and understand the \nrules that we are supposed to live by. But having said that, that is \nnot the problem. The problem is the money that flows into campaigns. \nYou tell me I cannot allow a lobbyist to buy my lunch but he can hand \nme a $5,000 check at lunch? What kind of palpable nonsense is that?\n  I am telling you, campaign financing is what drives this body. That \nis one of the reasons we have not been able to deal with the reform of \nthe 1872 mining law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArkansas for one incidental admission during this long speech which he \nhas given on the floor on mining patent claims, and that admission was \nthat is not a part of this bill. It is a subject that is not entrusted \nto the subcommittee which I chair, or to a debate over this bill. In \nfact, it is a subject that is entrusted to a committee on which the \nSenator from Arkansas serves, in which he was on this subcommittee in \nthe last Congress, when the political composition of this body was \ndifferent than it is now, and when no bill on mining claims or patents \nappeared or was debated on this floor.\n  But I think I particularly regret, in connection with the remarks of \nthe Senator from Arkansas, his statement that he intends to vote \nagainst the bill. As I reported earlier, this bill was passed by the \nSenate earlier this year in its original form by a vote of 92 to 6. The \nSenator from Arkansas voted for it. The mining patent provisions were \nless favorable to his position then than they are now.\n  He has pointed out that the House moratorium on new claims, which was \nnot included in the Senate bill, is now found in this bill with the \nsole exception of those claims which Congress cannot constitutionally \nterminate without compensating the claimants under the fifth amendment. \nThe only claims that will be processed are those so-called \ngrandfathered claims, and someday, whether it is 2 years or 5 years or \n10 years, they will all be disposed of. At that point, unless the \nCongress passes a significant reform in its mining patent laws, there \nwill not be any new claims subject to these provisions.\n  So I hope the Senator from Arkansas will reconsider and will support \na bill which does not move as far in his direction as he would like but \nwhich does move further in the direction of the policies he advocates \nthan did the bill he voted for just a few months ago.\n  That, I think, illustrates a larger point. Whatever the merits of the \nargument of the Senator from Arkansas, and, obviously, to toss about \nfigures in the tens of billions of dollars as if this were the \npotential profits in mining--it would be overwhelmingly the most \nprofitable business in the United States--of those billions of dollars, \nsomething between 90 and 99 percent, of course, will be paid to the \npeople who work to separate these minerals from the ground in which \nthey are found, which is a very expensive proposition.\n\n  While I am far from being an expert in this business, I do not find \nit to be a business in the United States which operates at a profit any \nlarger than any other business. Its costs are high. Those costs are, \ngenerally speaking, paid out in the form of wages to people who are \ncitizens of the United States. And that, of course, is the reason that \nSenators and Members of the House of Representatives from States in \nwhich these mineral deposits are located favor the continuation of a \npolicy which at least sees to it that there is \n\n[[Page S18606]]\nsome mining industry in the United States, declining though it may be.\n  Personally, I think we ought to reform these laws in such fashion \nthat the people of the United States do reap some portion of the profit \nfrom minerals taken from their lands. But many feel that if we adopted \nthe position of the Senator from Arkansas, there simply would not be \nany mining so there would be no value, no profit, and no jobs, no \nnothing. That is an appropriate debate, and it is appropriate for the \nSenator from Arkansas to state his position, just as it would be for \nthe now Presiding Officer to state his, representing a State with many \nmines, but it is not a debate we are having here today. It has \npractically nothing to do with an appropriations bill for the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  So I wish to pass on to other comments which have been made during \nthe course of this debate since I last spoke, that do relate directly \nto this bill. In that connection, with neither the Senator from Arizona \nnor the Senator from Nevada being here, I would like to share one of \nthe interesting paradoxes, sometimes frustrations, of dealing with a \nbill of this sort.\n  My friend and colleague from Arizona objected that there are items in \nthis bill which have not been subject to debate in authorizing \ncommittees, that are unauthorized expenditures, or expenditures for \nunauthorized matters. My friend, the Senator from Nevada, objected to \nthe fact that there is a moratorium on listings under the Endangered \nSpecies Act when no such appropriations are authorized. Authorizations \nfor the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act ran out several years \nago. Technically speaking, any money appropriated to enforce the \nEndangered Species Act is subject to a point of order on the floor here \nbecause the act has not been reauthorized.\n  The Senator from Nevada is the ranking minority member of the very \nsubcommittee that deals with that subject, and the moratorium expires, \nby its own terms, on the day that the act is reauthorized. So he has \nit, at least partly, in his power to see to it that moratorium is \nterminated.\n  There is a serious group of Senators--not a majority but a \nsignificant group of Senators, as there are Members of the House --who \ndo not believe that we should appropriate for any unauthorized project \nat all. I think the senior Senator from Arizona falls into that \ncategory, both by the remarks he made here somewhat earlier and by \nother quite similar questions that he has raised about new items being \nincluded in conference committee reports that were not included in the \nbill that passed either the House or the Senate together with \nappropriations for unauthorized projects.\n  I think I can say the Senator from Arizona has found fewer questions \nto ask in that connection of this Senator than he has of any other who \nis managing an appropriations bill on this floor, and I believe that I \nnow have answers, which I will state for the Record and for him or for \nhis staff, if they are listening, and which I hope will satisfy each \none of the questions that he has raised.\n\n  He raised questions concerning amendments Nos. 2, 47, 84, 101, and \n104, dealt with in the conference committee report.\n  Amendments Nos. 2 and 47 go together. The House appropriations bill \non this subject appropriated $87 million for the complete termination \nof the Bureau of Mines as one of those entities which, according to the \nHouse, was simply to be ended. The Senate did not agree with that \nposition and appropriated considerably more, $128 million, for the \ncontinued operation of the Bureau of Mines and nine of its field \nfacilities. That is a big difference between the two bills.\n  The conference committee came up with a compromise that will close at \nleast five of those Bureau of Mines facilities, but it will transfer \nsome of the functions for which there was strong support in the U.S. \nSenate to various other entities around the country. Those functions \nthe Senate wished to preserve, and continues to preserve as a result of \nthis conference committee, include health and safety research, minerals \ninformation, materials research, and minerals assessments on public \nlands in Alaska.\n  As a consequence, in reaching this compromise we had to outline \nexactly what was going to happen to various facilities and to various \nfunctions, and that is what we did. It is not new material. These are \nfunctions and facilities which would have been dealt with in one way in \nthe original House bill, a different way in the original Senate bill. \nThe compromise requires them to be listed.\n  The $2 million for particular assessments in Alaska, about which the \nSenator raised a question, is money that would have been included in \nthe normal operation of the Bureau of Mines under the Senate bill which \ncontinued it, but has to be stated separately in order to be continued \nas various facilities in the Bureau of Mines are closed.\n  A similar question was raised by the Senator from Arizona in \nconnection with amendments 101 and 104 with respect to Forest Service \nfunctions and facilities.\n  For a number of years, the Interior Subcommittee has required \napproval of boundary changes in national forests, the abolition of \nregional offices or the movement or closure of Forest Service offices. \nBoth the Appropriations Committees in the two Houses and the \nauthorizing committees have had to be notified and had to approve of \nsuch changes.\n  In this particular connection, there is such a proposed change. \nDuring the course of the conference committee, the Forest Service asked \nfor the move which is referred to here. That move and some of its \nconditions are outlined in the bill as a result of the historic \npractice of the Appropriations Committee and the desire of the Forest \nService itself.\n  Finally, by far the most significant amendment, about which a \nquestion was raised by the Senator from Arizona, has to do with the \nPresidio. The Senator points out that the Presidio, as a military \nreservation, has been closed under the Base Closure Commission \nactivities, and he asks, essentially, why it is that we are \nappropriating money for a closed military facility.\n  The answer, of course, is that whatever the merits and the beauty of \nWilliams Air Force Base in the State of Arizona, the Presidio in San \nFrancisco is a totally, completely unique national asset, a magnificent \nopen space in one of America's largest and most famous cities.\n  So some years ago, before I became chairman of this subcommittee, it \nwas determined that the Presidio, when it was to be closed as a \nmilitary base, would become, in large measure, a national park. And the \nappropriation in this bill is for the operation of the Presidio as a \nnational park.\n  I may say, Mr. President, that I have been bothered by this, at one \nlevel at least. The Presidio is the most expensive single national park \nin the National Park System as a result of these transfers.\n  So what has happened as a result of the fiscal pressure on the \nNational Park System in running the Presidio is that a group of \ncitizens in the city of San Francisco have gotten together and have \nproposed a Presidio trust to be created by the Congress. It has not \nbeen created by the Congress yet. The authorizing committee has not \ncompleted its work on it. The Senate has not debated it.\n  So this conference committee report says, ``Well, we are \nappropriating money now directly to the National Park Service.'' We \nwill have to help the Presidio trust with appropriations for at least a \nnumber of years until they have transferred this into a purely local \nfacility. So we are going to limit the amount of money that the \nNational Park Service can spend out of our appropriations to one-\ntwelfth of the appropriation for each month, with the hope that the \ntrust will succeed the Park Service sometime during the course of this \nfiscal year.\n  But the appropriation for the Presidio is because it is, in fact, a \npart of Golden Gate National Park and is something which the people of \nthe United States have determined is appropriate to maintain.\n  The Senator from Arizona also objected to the amount of money \nappropriated for various native American purposes, particularly to the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, noting, however, that it is larger by more \nthan $100 million in this bill than it was in the bill that originally \npassed the Senate.\n  I simply want to emphasize today, Mr. President, what I emphasized at \n\n\n[[Page S18607]]\nthe time of the original debate. The reductions for Indian activities \nin this bill are lower than the reductions for any other major purpose \ncovered by this bill. They are lower in the reductions than for any \nother purpose in this bill.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, in order to attempt to balance the \nbudget, we have $1.4 billion less for 1996 than we had for 1995. This \nmeans less money for our national endowments, for our museums, for our \nland management activities, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the National Park Service, the Department of Energy's \nnonnuclear research activities--right across the board.\n  The reductions for Indian activities are sharply less than the 10-\npercent average reductions for everything else, which means, of course, \nthat the reductions for everything else are greater.\n  I must confess, the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona and I \nhave a certain philosophical difference as to whether there is \nliterally an obligation in perpetuity for the taxpayers of the United \nStates to pay for activities, local governmental activities which \neveryone else in the United States pays for out of their own revenues, \nfor the operation of tribal governments, for police services, and the \nlike.\n  I am a strong believer in self-determination, but I think at some \npoint at least, the self-determination carries with it an obligation or \nduty of self-support, and we should be at least moving in that \ndirection.\n  That, however, is not the philosophy behind this appropriations bill. \nThis appropriations bill makes a modest but real contribution toward \nthe overriding necessity in this country of balancing the budget of the \nUnited States, of ceasing the practice of spending money we do not have \nand sending the bill to our children and our grandchildren. As a \nconsequence, all of the activities within the jurisdiction of this \nsubcommittee have less money for 1996 than they had for 1995.\n  Mr. President, they will have less money next year than they have \nthis year if we do not also reform the huge entitlement programs which \ngrow far more rapidly than our economy does. There is a relationship \nbetween these two.\n  In that connection, Indian activities are taking a smaller and more \nmodest hit than, for all practical purposes, every other activity in \nthis bill.\n  My own No. 1 priority was to try to see to it that we protected our \nNational Park System, which is an asset for every person in the United \nStates, and the cultural institutions here in Washington, DC, for which \nwe have either the sole or primary responsibility, like the National \nGallery of Art, the Smithsonian Institution, and the like. I think we \nhave done so reasonably well.\n\n  So I terminate these remarks with the views that I expressed earlier. \nI remind my colleagues that this bill was passed overwhelmingly by this \nbody by a vote of 92 to 6, and I point out at the same time that the \nobjections of a handful of Members who voted against it last time and \nthe reluctant assent of some of those who voted for it have to at least \nhave modestly been met.\n  I am sorry at this point we do not have the approval of the White \nHouse. It is impossible to meet the conditions the White House has laid \nout. The White House just wants to spend more money, as the Senator \nfrom Missouri said in respect to his appropriations money. They want to \nspend money on everything. They want to borrow it. They do not want to \npay for it themselves, but they want to spend it, and that is not going \nto happen. It is not going to happen now; it is not going to happen \nlater. In fact, the defeat or veto of this bill will sentence the money \nfunded by it to less money than they have in this bill, because the \ncontinuing resolution, under which we are operating today, has less \nmoney for most of these activities than does this bill.\n  So we hope that we can persuade the Executive to approve this bill to \nget it out of the battle of the overall budget. I hope my colleagues \nwill provide very strong support for it, because I am convinced that we \nhave done a responsible and a balanced job under very, very difficult \ncircumstances.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes under the time \nallocated to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to say I am glad this conference \nreport has finally made it to the Senate floor. I know the senior \nSenator from Washington, Chairman Gorton, has worked very hard to get \nit to this stage. I also wish to thank Senator Byrd and his staff for \ntheir assistance in keeping me informed and helping to move the process \nforward.\n  My primary concern with this conference report is its authorizing \nlanguage regarding the Columbia Basin ecosystem project. This important \nproject was instituted by former Speaker Tom Foley and Chairman \nHatfield to provide a scientific foundation to guide us in developing \nsound resource policies, especially regarding fisheries management. In \nmany areas of the Columbia Basin region, our forests are dying due to \npast timber harvest practices, fire suppression policies, and insect \ninfestation. Our salmon and other fisheries resources are endangered, \ndue in part to land-based activities that impact watersheds, like \ncattle grazing, forestry, recreation, and development.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report intentionally limits science. \nIt demands that the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management study \nonly ``landscape dynamics and conditions for forest and rangeland \nmanagement, specifically the management of forest and rangeland \nvegetation structure, composition, density, and related social and \neconomic effects.'' It goes on to say the scientific assessment must \nnot contain any other material than that quoted above.\n  During the second conference, I was unable to convince my colleagues \nto add a provision allowing for the study of fisheries and watersheds \nand deleting the clause limiting study. I truly believed my colleagues \nwould support this moderate attempt to allow scientists to provide us \ninformation to help guide us in making scientifically based resource \nmanagement decisions.\n  In this latest round of conference negotiations, Chairman Gorton, \ntoo, tried to convince the House to open up the scientific assessment \nfor fisheries and watershed studies. I want to thank him for his \nefforts, which were unfortunately unsuccessful.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I had offered only addressed one area of \nconcern for me in this bill regarding the Columbia Basin project: that \nof limiting science. However, I am also very concerned that this report \nprohibits the agencies from issuing a final environmental impact \nstatement or a record of decision and from selecting a preferred \nalternative in the draft environmental impact statement.\n  This bill also limits the ability of the Forest Service and BLM to \nconsult or conference as required under section 7 of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. The agencies may modify current policies for fish \nprotection and if they have consulted on these policies in the past, \nthey need not do so again--even if the amendment is a drastic \nmodification of current protections. Similarly, the agencies are \nprohibited from consultation for any projects, such as timber sales, if \nsales are based on the forest plan amendment.\n  The President has indicated that he intends to veto this bill. One of \nhis reasons for doing so is the authorizing language on the Columbia \nBasin project. I look forward to working with him and Chairman Gorton \nto make the necessary improvements in this language so that we can \npractice ecosystem-based stewardship and provide a steady stream of \ncommodities while also protecting our resources for this and future \ngenerations.\n  Let me also add that while I have focused the majority of my remarks \non the Columbia Basin project, I am also concerned with several other \nprovisions included in this bill. For example, while an additional $50 \nmillion were made available to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian \nHealth Service during the last conference, the level of funding for \nthese programs is still woefully inadequate.\n  The cuts to tribal priority allocations are particularly disturbing. \nTribal priority allocations represent an important component of Federal \nIndian policy. In addition to recognizing the \n\n[[Page S18608]]\nreduction in bureaucracy that self-governance allows and the shifting \nof decisionmaking from the Federal to the local level, TPA funds also \nrepresent a fundamental recognition of tribal sovereignty. I think it \nis important that the Federal Government recognize that Indian nations \nhave the capacity, the responsibility, and the right to govern \nthemselves. The Federal Government must also remember its historic \nobligations to the Indian nations as set out in the many treaties \nsigned by the United States and the sovereign tribes.\n  Furthermore, I continue to oppose the language preventing Washington \nState tribes, specifically the Lummi Nation, from exercising their \nwater rights. While I appreciate the willingness of Chairman Gorton to \nremove language that would likely have derailed the ongoing \nnegotiations--negotiations, I might add, that include all affected \nparties including the non-Indian landholders and appear to be going \nwell--the language still represents a threat to tribal sovereignty and \nsets an extremely poor precedent for government-to-government \nrelations.\n  Mr. President, to close, I would like to note quickly my concerns \nabout several other provisions contained in this bill, including: \nFirst, the severe funding cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts \nand the National Endowment for the Humanities; second, the attempts by \nthis Congress to thwart scientific protocol regarding the methods used \nto identify the threatened marbled murrelet's nests; and third, the \nprovisions related to the Tongass National Forest.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Gorton for the many improvements he \nhas made in this report. I encourage him to continue those efforts \nshould the President veto this appropriations bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many Vermonters are disappointed about a \npattern in this Congress to undermine environmental standards through \nappropriations and the budget process.\n  Unfortunately, Congress is doing it again in the Interior bill.\n  Let me list just a few of the measures that were added to this bill \nwhich are direct attacks on the environment using the indirect \nappropriations process. These are items which have not received \nhearings, authorizing committee deliberation, or open floor debate.\n  First, a group of Alaskans asked the Forest Service to update the \nenvironmental study for a large timber sale which was being reoffered \nfor a second time. The judge agreed with the Alaskans that an updated \nstudy would be worthwhile. This Congress overrules the judge.\n  Second, the Forest Service has been working on a forest plan for the \nTongass National Forest for several years amidst annual meddling from \nthe Appropriations Committee and Congress. In this bill, Congress \ndictates its choice for forest management, and forces it upon the \nresource professionals and people of the region.\n  Third, our country has an Endangered Species Act to protect our \nNation's fish and wildlife from extinction. This bill prohibits the \nFish and Wildlife Service from listing species as endangered species. \nWe can change our minds about this bill, but we cannot change our minds \nafter extinction.\n  Fourth, last year, Congress passed a bipartisan bill to create the \nCalifornia Desert National Park by a wide margin. One year later, \nCongress is trying to dismantle the National Park through funding \ngimmicks.\n  Fifth, our country's mining law is 123 years old. This Congress \nrefuses to update the law through the authorizing process, and instead \ntries to force as many giveaways through the Department of the Interior \nas they can. They know the American people want changes, but they are \nscrambling to get what they can while they hold back the will of the \nAmerican people.\n  Sixth, this Administration has an excellent record of creating new \njobs while protecting the environment, including endangered species. To \ncontinue this record of cutting through gridlock, finding flexible \nsolutions, and moving forward, the Administration was studying the \nColumbia River Basin. This bill says ``ignorance is bliss,'' and cuts \nfunding for science.\n  There are other problems with the bill as well, some with legislative \nissues, and some with funding.\n  One provision has to do with the National Endowment for the Arts. The \nSupreme Court has an established standard to judge pornography. This \nbill, however, includes a vague new definition based on the personal \nopinion of what a few members consider disgusting.\n  One of the most blatant funding problems is the energy cuts. The \nPresident's budget promotes national security, economic progress, and \nenvironmental responsibility by supporting voluntary incentives for \nenergy efficiency. This bill cuts energy efficiency funding by 38 \npercent, including critical programs like weatherization. \nWeatherization was cut by 50 percent. Vice President Gore pointed out \nthat with the President's budget we could save more energy than could \nbe drilled from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The pattern is clear and persistent. Environmental funding and \nenvironmental laws are the first to go. Our natural resources cannot \nendure this kind of abuse. Pollution, extinction, degradation, and \nabuse are not problems that we can easily fix, if at all.\n  The American people do not want this, and soon Congress will learn \nabout their opposition. But until then, and propelled by this bill, the \nabuse and neglect continues.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have spoken time and time again about \nthe cuts in this Republican budget to low-income heating, energy, and \nweatherization assistance programs that help the most needy in our \ncountry. Throughout this year we have seen horrible heat waves and \nhorrible cold snaps. Many citizens of our Nation have become ill and \nsome have even died from the heat and the cold. Yet, still we cut those \nprograms. In the Interior Appropriations bill, energy conservation \nprograms are funded at a level that is only 60 percent the President's \nrequest and only 73 percent of last year's funding level. That is just \nplain foolish.\n  Mr. President, I have also spoken time and time again about how this \nRepublican budget gives away our natural resources without measuring \nlong-term budget consideration and without designing a long-term energy \npolicy. Still, despite new information, numbers that just don't add up \nand many unexplored environmental concerns, the Republican budget still \ncontains provisions to open up the Arctic Refuge to drilling, to give \noil companies royalty relief for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and \npages and pages of other provisions that just don't make sense.\n  This is not energy policy, this is not environmental policy. This is \nshort-term gain without consideration of long-term loss and a jumbled-\nup mass of contradictions. It just don't make any sense.\n  Mr. President, why say that our country needs more oil and needs to \nrely less on foreign supply and then turn around and allow Alaska North \nSlope oil to be sold to foreign countries. Does that make sense? We \nneed more oil, but we can sell some anyway?\n  Mr. President, why say that our country needs more oil and needs to \nrely less on foreign supply and then turn around and slash funding for \nthe Weatherization Assistance Program and other conservation programs. \nWe need more oil, but we can afford to waste some?\n  Why say that our country needs more oil but not consider ways that we \ncould save oil, by beginning discussions on a long-term energy policy \nthat will benefit every citizen of this nation, not just the oil \ncompanies. We need more oil, but lets not worry about how we use it?\n  Mr. President, this is all just smoke and mirrors. This country needs \na long-term energy policy and this country needs to have policies and \nbudgets that are not a mass of contradictions. Our natural resources \nare the last thing we should play with. I will be voting against this \nbill.\n\n\n                externally fired combined cycle funding\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Senator Snowe and I would like to bring to the attention \nof the chairman an important Fossil Energy Program within the \nDepartment of Energy. The Department has initiated a demonstration \nproject to repower Pennsylvania Electric's Warren Station utilizing \nexternally fired combined cycle technology. The purpose of this program \nis to develop a commercially viable use for this technology. A 20-\nmember consortium, consisting of utilities, private industry, \n\n[[Page S18609]]\nState energy organization, foreign organizations, and the Department's \nMorgantown Energy Technology Center, has spent 8 years and $34 million \nto develop the EFCC technology.\n  This technology is based on a ceramic heat exchanger that can \ndramatically increase the amount of electricity generated from burning \ncoal. This ceramic technology produces 20 percent more electricity per \npound of coal than conventional steam power plants and, as a result, it \ncan significantly reduce pollution and the cost of power. It could be \nused to update aging power plants across the United States. According \nto the Washington Post, this technology ``appears to place the United \nStates in the forefront in developing high-temperature ceramics'' for \nindustrial applications, overtaking international competitors.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Earlier this year, the Department provided funding to \nbegin testing the technology, which is critical to demonstrate the \ncommercial viability of the project. However, $4.3 million is now \nneeded to complete these tests, which are currently suspended until \nfurther funding becomes available. Consortium members expect the \nprogram to be commercially viable after completion of the testing. I \nunderstand that in addition to coal, the heat exchange technology could \nbe applicable to other types of power production, such as bioenergy.\n  While some private money has been located to continue the tests, \nfunding from the Department is necessary to restart the testing. If the \ntesting cannot be completed, the $26.5 million already provided by the \nFederal Government and the $7.5 million contributed by the Consortium \nwill have been wasted.\n  Senator Cohen and I understand that the chairman of the Interior \nSubcommittee shares our interest in this project and believes that the \nDepartment should make an effort, within its budget constraints, to try \nto ensure that the testing is completed.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senators from Maine are correct. This promising \ntechnology could be very beneficial to improving electricity generation \nin this country.\n  Mr. COHEN. We thank the distinguished chairman for his assistance on \nthis important matter.\n\n\n                      twin cities research center\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, thank the managers of the bill for \ntheir help in providing the Twin Cities Research Center [TCRC] a smooth \ntransition from Bureau of Mines facility to non-Federal entity. The \nMinnesota congressional delegation and the TCRC have been working to \nfacilitate this transition, and would like to ask the chairman about \nthe following scenario.\n  The TCRC would be able to continue operations within the Department \nof the Interior until June 30, 1996 or until such time as a transfer of \nthe facility to a university or government entity is completed, \nwhichever is sooner. The responsibility for identifying funds to \nmaintain such operations would lie with the TCRC and/or the partners \ninterested in seeing this facility remain open. To the extent \nauthorities exist for the Department of the Interior to accept \ndonations or contributions that might be offered to keep the facility \nopen, they may be used. If the Department were to identify other funds \nthat might be available to assist in this, or similar efforts, they \nwould be subject to the normal reprogramming guidelines.\n  I would ask the chairman--if the authorities exist that would allow \nfunds to be made available for the purposes described, would the \ninterested parties be able to consider such a scenario?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator has identified a possible scenario. The \nDepartment is able to do whatever it can within existing authorities, \nsubject to the availability of funds. However, it should be understood \nthat any funds to be provided for this purpose must be from new \nagreements. Any funds remaining from prior or existing agreements with \nother parties and the Bureau of Mines are required for shutdown costs. \nThe Senator should also understand that to the extent similar scenarios \nmay apply at other Bureau facilities, this Senator expects the \nSecretary to give equal consideration to the needs of those facilities \nand the communities in which they are located.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this conference report, \nmany aspects of which I find deeply troubling. I am gratified that the \nPresident has stated that he will veto the conference report. At this \ntime, I would like to mention just a few of the most objectionable \nprovisions.\n\n\n                   the mojave national park preserve\n\n  The provisions in this bill on the Mojave National Park Preserve are \nan affront to the people of California and to the intent of Congress \nwhich was clearly stated when we passed the California Desert \nProtection Act last year. The management of this land as a park \npreserve is supported by 84 percent of Californians. Every major \nnewspaper in the State, including the San Francisco Chronicle, Los \nAngeles Times, San Diego Union Tribune, and San Bernadino Sun has \nvoiced its support for the preserve and its strong opposition to \nefforts to strangle the preserve out of existance.\n  I find this situation strange, in that it appears that there was only \none member of the conference who pushed to defund the preserve. The \nprevious conference report defunded the preserve and gave the Park \nService $1 to operate it--clearly just a back door attempt to close one \nof our largest national parks through the appropriations process. To \nadd injury to insult, this new conference report has added additional \nrestrictions on Park Service management of the new 1.4 million acre \npreserve that would prevent the Park Service from conducting planning \nactivities. It imposes a cap on Park Service planning expenditures at a \nfraction of typical planning costs for a new National Park, and imposes \nan unrealistic deadline for completion of a plan which will limit the \ncongressionally mandated public involvement in the planning process.\n  On these grounds along, Mr. President, this conference report should \nbe vetoed.\n\n\n                   endangered species act moratorium\n\n  This report prohibits adding new species to the endangered species \nlist and prohibits designation of critical habitat for listed species. \nIt also prohibits the monitoring of listed species which is an \nimportant part of the recovery process.\n  A moratorium will harm our Nation and my State of California. Of the \nmore than 100 species currently proposed for listing which would be \ndenied protection under this moratorium, more than half are from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, on average, endangered plant species have fewer than \n120 individuals left by the time they are listed; animal species are \nreduced to fewer than 1,200 individuals by the time of listing--a 6-\nmonth moratorium could see valuable species go extinct for no reason. I \ndon't see why should we wait months and months while we lose flora and \nfauna that may cure cancer and alzheimers. Why should we wait while \nspecies get closer to extinction, creating more complicated and \nexpensive problems that will have to be solved when the moratorium is \nlifted? The real agenda here is a piecemeal dismantling of the act. \nThis is one more back door move by Republicans to weaken the Endangered \nSpecies Act in the face of 77 percent of Americans who support \nmaintaining or strengthening the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\n                        tongass national forest\n\n  The Tongass National Forest is the last intact rainforest in North \nAmerica. This conference allows and promotes subsidized logging in \nextremely ecologically sensitive areas.\n  The Tongass provisions in the bill are unacceptable. They will \nrequire that an outdated and scientifically discredited timber \nharvesting can be implemented in the national forest for the next 2 \nyears. This will result in logging at a a rate that is 100 million \nboard feet over the historical average--that is logging at a rate of \n418 million board feet per year. The Forest Service has rejected this \nplan because it allows logging at unsustainable and environmentally \ndestructive levels.\n\n\n                                 mining\n\n  We have been trying to reform the 1872 Mining Law for many years and \nit is difficult to comprehend how year in and year out, the U.S. \nCongress continues to allow our taxpayers to lose thousands of acres of \nFederal lands and billions of dollars in Federal revenue--mostly to \nforeign-owned mining companies. My distinguished colleague Senator \nBumpers has led the debate in favor of reform for over 7 years, and \n\n[[Page S18610]]\nthis morning he again laid out his devastatingly effective critique of \nthe moratorium language in this conference report and the sham reform \nthat is included in the Republican budget reconciliation bill.\n  Since 1872, we have given away more than 3.2 million acres. For how \nmuch? For the price of $2.50 an acre or at a maximum $5 dollars an \nacre, and not a nickel in royalties. Over $250 billion worth of \nminerals have been taken off that land and the U.S. taxpayer has in \nreturn received a mining site clean up bill for between $30 and $70 \nbillion. This conference report will allow it to continue.\n\n\n                        bureau of indian affairs\n\n  Affairs some funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] has been \nrestored, the amount still falls short of the levels needed to maintain \nthese important programs. Critically important funding for the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs must be restored, and it must occur without pitting \nthese programs against other important Department of Interior programs. \nAdditional BIA funds are needed to support essential tribal government \nactivities, law enforcement, housing improvement, general assistance, \nIndian child welfare programs, adult vocation training, road \nmaintenance, and other basic reservation services. I urge my colleagues \nto pay special attention to this issue.\n\n\n               interior appropriations conference report\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am voting against the conference \nreport on the Interior appropriations bill and I would urge the \nPresident to veto this bill should it reach his desk.\n  This conference agreement is the third attempt by the conferees who \nhave been meeting on this bill since September. Despite their difficult \nchallenge and tremendous effort, regrettably, it is far from an \nacceptable compromise. I have particular problems with the funding \nlevel for the Department of Energy's energy conservation programs, the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities and numerous objectionable legislative riders.\n  Energy conservation, like pollution prevention, makes good business \nand economic sense. It saves production costs and conserves resources \nand it is clearly the best of all energy options. Unfortunately, the \nconferees have funded this important work at a level well below that \nwhich the President and others have requested, and which is $187 \nmillion below the 1995 enacted level. The $536 million budget is a 26-\npercent reduction from the 1995 enacted level and a 38-percent cut from \nthe President's request.\n  The conference committee added numerous legislative riders to the \nbill that have serious policy implications, yet these were added \nwithout the benefit of congressional hearings or public input.\n  One of the most egregious riders would set in stone the current \nTongass Forest management plan for an additional 2 years, thus \nprohibiting an update to the unsustainable timber sale levels it \nmandates. Additional riders would prove harmful to the environment by \nplacing a moratorium on future listings and critical habitat \ndesignations under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Another provision would require wasting energy by preventing the \nDepartment of Energy's implementation of new energy efficiency \nstandards for an additional year.\n  The ideological fervor of the Republicans who now control the \nCongress has manifest itself in heavy cuts to the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and the National endowment for the Humanities.\n  It is my hope that the President will veto this bill so that the \nconferees can work toward a package that provides sufficient funding \nfor environmentally beneficial programs and strips the environmentally \nharmful legislative riders.\n  We can and must do better than this. We must not and the President \nwill not capitulate to the tactic of the Republicans who now control \nthe Congress to hold hostage the funding for our national parks and \npublic lands until they are permitted to abolish or emasculate vital \nenvironmental protections that have withstood previous head-on \nchallenges.\n  I hope, after this bill is vetoed, the Congress will get down to \nserious, good faith negotiations to develop a reasonable interior \nappropriations bill which can be passed with broad support and signed \ninto law.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Acting for the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the \nvote on the adoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1977, \nthe Interior appropriations bill, occur at the hour of 2 p.m. today. I \nfurther ask that at 3 p.m., the Senate turn to S. 908. It is my \nunderstanding this has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I delete the last request with regard to \nS. 908, and I ask unanimous consent that it be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The vote on the pending legislation then is set at 2 p.m. this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. At 2 p.m., we will vote on the pending \nconference report.\n  Mr. President, with the consent of the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I yield myself such time as I need to \ncomment on this report.\n  Mr. President, I first want to start off by commending my good friend \nfrom Washington, my southern neighbor. I think Senator Gorton's task \nhas been a very difficult one this year. As he stated, he has had a \nsubstantial reduction in the amount of money available to him. He has \ndone a fantastic job. There are areas here where we have serious \nconcern. I think anyone in the Senate has serious concerns over areas \nthat affect their States directly. All of the agencies in the \nDepartment of Interior have substantial impact on Alaska, and we know \nthat funding is being restrictive. There is a general decline now in \nthe amount of taxpayers' funds available to run these entities, and I \nview that with great regret.\n\n  However, I also know that we are committed to a balanced budget, and \nsome of these steps have to be taken so we can eliminate the constant \ngrowth of interest on the national debt. That interest now, this next \nyear will be larger than the amount of money that is available to spend \nfor the national defense of this country.\n  I do manage that defense bill, and I am appalled we are spending more \nmoney next year on interest than we will spend on the defense of our \ncountry, but there is no alternative but to pay the interest on the \ndebt that is due. That is why we are laboring so hard to try and find a \nway to reverse that trend and hopefully reach the day when the interest \nstarts coming down, when we can start making funds available to these \nvery necessary functions such as those of the Department of Interior.\n  I am particularly concerned right now about the comments that have \nbeen made by the Senator from Arizona concerning the money that is \nearmarked here for the Bureau of Land Management to do mineral \nassessments that were formerly done by the Bureau of Mines. The \nsituation that we had, Mr. President, was this: When this bill was \nbefore the Senate, the Senate did not zero out the Bureau of Mines.\n  The House bill did mandate the closure of the Bureau of Mines. When \nwe got to conference and realized that the funding was so limited, we \nhad to take action suggested by the House--action I really regret. The \nBureau of Mines has been a very vital function for the Federal \nGovernment, but it has been agreed now to close that Bureau.\n  I pointed out to the conferees that under section 1010 of the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act--we call that ANILCA, an act \npassed by the Congress in 1980--over 100 million acres of Alaska lands \nwere set side. Congress recognized that there had to be an assessment \nof lands that were to be patented to the State and Federal governments, \nand an assessment of these lands were set aside to the extent possible. \nThat is required, as I said, under section 1010 of the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Act.\n  We have requested that this money be earmarked so that the people who \nformerly worked for the Bureau of Mines and were performing the \nassessments required by law that have to be made prior to the transfer \nof lands, \n\n[[Page S18611]]\nthat they will be made under the direction of the Bureau of Land \nManagement, which does in fact have the authority over the lands. This \nwas not behind closed doors. We had a provision in the Senate bill, had \nwe maintained it, that all of the people performing Bureau of Mines \nfunctions in Alaska would remain on the payroll. What we have done is \nmaintained the funds for the absolutely essential minimum requirement \nof the law, which is to do these mineral assessments formerly under the \nBureau of Mines, which will be done under the Bureau of Land Management \nuntil the job is completed.\n  I believe that that is a necessary function of the conference \ncommittee. Having acceded to the House provision, the Senate demanded \nthat the minimum function required in my State to be maintained is \nearmarked at $2 million in this bill to continue that. That will be a \nrequirement through coming years that we maintain those funds, and I \nintend to do every thing I can to see to it that the Senate will \nmaintain that constant.\n  Mr. President, there is another very vital matter in this bill that \npertains to my State, and that is under the administrative provisions \nfor the Forest Service, this bill retains language pertaining to the \nTongass forest in southeastern Alaska. I regret that it is necessary to \ncontinue doing this. I want the Senate to know that this is not the \nprovision that the Senate voted on; this is a provision that has been \nsubstantially modified in conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me claim time under the time reserved \nfor those in opposition to the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I listened with great interest today to the comments \nby Senator McCain. I find myself in a similar circumstance. I commend \nSenator Gorton and others who have worked on this legislation. I do not \ncome here with ill will toward those who have tried to put together a \ncompromise. But I do feel very strongly that we find ourselves with \nrespect to the appropriations available in some critical areas, dealing \nwith some very vulnerable people, short of what is needed. Again, I do \nnot intend to be critical of those who have worked on this compromise. \nI understand the competing needs involved, and they reached a different \nconclusion than I might have, a different conclusion than Senator \nMcCain said he would have reached. For that reason, he intends to \noppose the conference report. I am going to oppose the conference \nreport for the same reason.\n  Let me be more specific. I am very concerned about an area of \nspending dealing with Indian children. That concern stems from a \nsubstantial amount of observation by me of the Indian reservations in \nNorth Dakota and elsewhere, from hearings that I have held, from \nstories and concerns that I have related to the Senate previously.\n  I have, Mr. President, seen in offices folders containing reports of \nchild sexual abuse and physical abuse which were stacked on the floor \nand had not even been investigated because there was not enough money \nto investigate them. We are talking about 3-year-old, 5-year-old, 8-\nyear-old children who have been victims of alleged physical or sexual \nabuse. The cases had not even been investigated. You may ask why. Well, \nbecause the people in charge of investigating the reports simply do not \nhave the resources. They say, ``These reports are stacked up and we \nhave not been able to deal with them. We do not have the capability. We \nare overwhelmed.''\n  There are stories that break your heart when you hear them. I have \ntold the Senate the story that got me interested in this issue. It is a \nstory of a young girl named Tamara DeMaris. Tamara was 3 years old when \nshe was placed in a foster home. But the person who placed Tamara in \nher foster home was handling 150 different cases. And with few \nresources and one person handling 150 cases, guess what happened? A 3-\nyear-old child gets placed in a foster home that turns out to be an \nunsafe home for a 3-year-old. This is a foster home where they have a \ndrunken party, and during this drunken party, this little 3-year-old \nchild gets beaten up. Her nose is broken, her arm is broken, and her \nhair is pulled out by the roots. This is a 3-year-old child, who is our \nresponsibility, who was placed in a foster home, and the result is that \nshe is beaten because nobody checked to see whether this was a foster \nhome where a young child ought to be placed.\n  On that reservation, there are more people now doing the checking to \nsee what kind of foster homes are available and whether they are safe \nplaces to put young people. I am glad that this has happened. It \nhappened as a result of my intervention and the intervention of others \nto get additional resources.\n  But the experience of this young Tamara DeMaris is not all that \nunusual, regrettably. I will never forget when I met this little girl. \nYou look into her eyes and wonder whether the scars from the beating \nwill ever go away, and know that the beating occurred because we did \nnot make sure that we would have enough resources to provide for her \nprotection. Three year olds cannot take care of themselves. It is not \ntheir fault if they are born into poverty. It is not their fault if \nthey are born into a situation where there is no family structure. It \nis not their fault that they are going to be placed in a foster home by \nsomeone. It is not their fault that someone commits sexual abuse or \nviolence against them. But it is our responsibility to try to protect \nthose kids.\n  We are not doing enough about it. The resources do not exist in this \npiece of legislation to deal with it. We have an Indian boarding school \nin North Dakota. I visited that Indian boarding school about a month or \ntwo ago and saw the children, many of whom come from very troubled \nbackgrounds, and I read some of the letters they had written when they \ncame to school. One 13-year-old girl, her dream was a very simple \nthing, that maybe at Christmas, some Christmas, she would be able to \nhave a mother and a father and a sister and a brother together to \ncelebrate. Of course, in her circumstance, it will not happen. It has \nnever happened. It will not happen in the future. That was her dream. \nVery simple. A lot of kids dream for material things, but she wanted a \nhome where a mother, father, brother, and sister would be able to spend \nChristmas with her.\n  The point I make is that we suffer some very serious, troubling \nproblems on Indian reservations with respect to child abuse and with \nrespect to poverty, health challenges and other things. This piece of \nlegislation, Mr. President, simply does not adequately address those \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I remember touring a hospital some while ago and \nholding in my arms a little baby who had been born prematurely. A \nNative American had come to the hospital to give birth. Her blood \nalcohol content when she checked in was 0.23. The baby, upon birth, had \na blood alcohol content of 0.21. The mother wanted nothing to do with \nthe baby. She did not want to see the baby. Think about the \nconsequences of this: Someone showing up to deliver a baby with a 0.23 \nblood alcohol content and delivering a baby with 0.21 blood alcohol \ncontent. It is likely the baby will suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  The same hospital showed me just before I was at the nursery the \nspace where the carpenters had prepared for a new device. They were, I \nbelieve, getting an MRI, a device that is breathtaking. It can look \nthrough the human body to see what is inside. Here, 200 feet apart, is \nan example of the most breathtaking success in health care and the most \ntragic human failure.\n  How do we respond to all of these things? How do we deal with them \nall? Some say you cannot throw money at it. I do not disagree with \nthat. On the other hand, with respect to children, with respect to \nbabies and 3-year-olds and 5-year-olds and 13-year-olds, with respect \nto those kids who are born of circumstances that they did not create, \nwe must, it seems to me, in this legislation give them an opportunity, \ngive them a fighting chance, deal with their health care needs, provide \nprotection to make sure that foster homes are safe.\n  We must do that, and I regret to say this legislation simply falls \ntoo short. I voted for this bill when it left the Senate, hoping that \nmaybe when we got to conference we would still have an opportunity to \nwork out some approach that would provide enough resources to deal with \nthe needs of Indian children. I conclude, having looked at the \nconference report, pretty much the same \n\n[[Page S18612]]\nas the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, has concluded. It simply \nfalls short. We have to do better. I hope that, although I intend to \nvote against this conference report, when we approach this funding bill \nagain next spring, working in good faith with good people, that those \nwho put this kind of legislation together will understand that there \nreally is no higher priority for us than to meet our responsibility to \nchildren. Children cannot take care of themselves. We have certain \ntrust responsibilities to meet. In my judgment, we have not met them.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I remind the \nPresident that it is the holiday season and as the song goes--tis the \nseason to be jolly. Unfortunately, my good friend from Arkansas, as he \ndescribed the mining law provisions in the Interior bill, did not \nfollow the holiday spirit. I think he may have construed the holiday \nseason with the Grinch of Christmas, or something of that nature, but \nclearly his description of the legislation was not in the holiday \nspirit.\n  I think it is fair to say that his comments were hardly constructive \ntoward enacting mining law reform, and might even be construed to be \ndestructive. As the President is aware, today's 6-hour debate on the \nfiscal year 1996 DOI conference report is, in the opinion of the \nSenator from Alaska, a good deal about politics and very little about \npolicy. Many of our friends on the other side of the aisle see the \nenvironment as a political issue and are prepared to do just about \neverything to exploit the issue. Unfortunately, in their effort to win \npolitical points with the media they are destroying our natural \nresource industries. I think we should look at what has happened. A \nportion of our resource industry and the jobs that go with it are being \ndestroyed. We are driving those jobs overseas. We are increasing our \nbalance of payment deficit.\n  Take for example, the Department of the Interior's attitude toward \nresource development. They oppose it. Mining, coal, oil and gas, \ntimber, grazing, all of these resource activities on public lands are \nopposed by this administration. As a result, the administration is \nforcing us to import many of these resources from overseas.\n  The greatest portion of our balance of payments deficit, Mr. \nPresident, is the cost of imported oil. What is the administration \ndoing to encourage exploration in areas such as ANWR? In my State of \nAlaska, geologists tell us ANWR is the most likely prospect for a major \noil discovery. Unfortunately, this administration opposes any \nexploration in this area. As many of you know, my State of Alaska has \ncontributed 25 percent of the total domestic crude oil produced in the \nUnited States for the last 18 years.\n  The arguments prevailing in the early 1970's against opening Prudhoe \nBay are the same arguments prevailing today against opening ANWR. The \nonly difference is we have learned how to develop the Arctic in the \nlast quarter of a century, and, as a consequence, we can apply advance \ntechnology to do a better job, making a smaller footprint. That is not \nthe policy of this administration. The administration's policy is to \nconstrict resource development. Where have all our high-paying blue-\ncollar jobs gone? They have been exported overseas.\n  As I mentioned earlier, today's debate is about politics, not policy. \nI hope that my colleagues will see through this smokescreen.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider the DOI conference \nreport on its merits. An awful lot of effort and time has gone into the \nbill. Senator Gorton put together a good bill. There were problems with \nthe House, but ultimately he put together what I think is an acceptable \ncompromise.\n  Earlier today, my friend Senator Bumpers talked about the mining law \nprovisions in the budget reconciliation package. To hear his view, it \nis a giant sellout of American resources to a few mining companies. I \nwant to clear up a few misunderstandings, because you have to recognize \nthat this industry provides good-paying jobs which provide a solid tax \nbase.\n  Looking at the royalty provision under the proposal sent to the \nPresident, for the first time in history in this legislation, miners \nare required to pay a 5 percent net proceeds royalty. During good \nmarket conditions, if an operation is making a profit, they pay a \nroyalty. During bad market conditions, if an operation is losing money, \nthey do not pay a royalty. The significance of the mining industry--it \nis a world competitive market out there--you either compete with South \nAmerica, Brazil, Australia, on a world market price or you do not \ncompete at all.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we are trying to provide incentives \nfor operators to stay in production, to keep our U.S. jobs, these high-\npaying union jobs that keep people working and provide a local and \nFederal tax base.\n  And I would encourage the unions in this country that are dependent \nin the resource industry to look behind this smokescreen to what this \nadministration is really attempting to do with resource development \njobs--mining of any kind, hard-rock, coal, you name it. They do not \nwant anything to happen on public land. This attitude will not create \njobs.\n  Patents--for the first time in history miners would be required to \npay fair market value for patented land. There would be a reverter for \nthe first time in history--that patented land used for nonmining \npurposes reverts back to the Federal Government. So there is no \nspeculation. There are no ski resorts built under the idea that you get \na patent for mining and then use it for something else.\n  We protect property rights by allowing the pending patent \napplications at Interior to move forward under the existing law. The \nremaining 330,000 mining claims holders would have to prove that they \nhave a ``vested possessory property right.'' If they do not have that \nright, they are subject to the new law.\n  For the first time in history, we establish an abandoned mine land \nfund to start the process of cleaning up old abandoned mines. We \nmaintain the existing $100 per claim holding fee for 3 years and then \ndouble the fees to $200 per claim starting in 1999.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office's score over 7 years \nis approximately $157 million. As new mines come into production this \nfigure will significantly increase.\n  What is the administration's proposal? Mr. President, they have no \nproposal. Secretary Babbitt continues to demand mining law reform, yet \nhe offers no solution. The administration has failed to submit a \nproposal to Congress this year.\n  In fact, instead of supporting mining law reform legislation, the \nPresident's budget calls for the elimination of the percentage \ndepletion allowance for hard-rock mining--a multi-billion-dollar budget \nbombshell that will cost several billion dollars, and thousands of \njobs.\n  According to the administration, this would save roughly $954 million \nover 10 years--in effect, place a $1 billion-plus burden on the \nNation's miners. Once again, the White House has singled out the mining \nindustry for punishment. Why?\n  Its the latest assault in Secretary of Interior Babbitt's and the \nadministration's war on the West on hard-working people and their jobs. \nMake no mistake about it, they are singling out the hard-rock mining \nindustry for termination.\n  Oil, gas, and coal jobs are not put in jeopardy at this time, \nhowever, the camel's nose is under the tent. It is only a matter of \ntime until the administration uses the Tax Code to go after oil, gas, \nand the coal industry.\n  Mr. President, the hard-rock mining industry provides 120,000 direct \nand indirect jobs nationwide. This proposal could eliminate 60,000 to \n70,000 of those jobs.\n  The administration is using the environment as a political issue. The \ndebate is not about policy. It is about politics.\n  I urge my colleagues to see through this smokescreen and vote on the \nfacts. If we can send a man to the Moon, we can surely develop our \nnatural resources and protect our environment.\n  On the matter of the Tongass, Mr. President, I commend my good friend \nand senior colleague, Senator Stevens, and those who have worked so \nhard to get approval in the conference.\n  The conferees have significantly modified the provision dealing with \nthe management of the Tongass National Forest to fully respond to \nadministration concerns. In the original amendment, the administration \nobjected to: \n\n[[Page S18613]]\nFirst, sufficiency language; second, the dictate to follow a forest \nplan that the administration believes is superseded by more recent \ninformation; and third, imposing a permanent ban on the development of \nwildlife habitat conservation areas.\n  The new amendment agreed to by the conferees contains none of these \nthree requirements. It allows operations on the Tongass National Forest \nto continue under the current Tongass land management plan [TLMP]. \nFurther, it directs that revision and amendment of the TLMP continue.\n  The new amendment reaffirms the compromise embodied in the 1990 \nTongass Timber Reform Act [TTRA] by requiring that for the next 2 \nyears, any change to the TLMP shall maintain at least the number of \nsuitable available and suitable scheduled acres of timber land and \nallowable sale quantity as that identified in the preferred alternative \nof the October 1992 final TLMP (alternative P). The regional forester, \nat that time, developed alternative P as the best way to manage the \nTongass National Forest implementing the compromise of the 1990 \nlegislation. Subsequently, litigation from environmental groups has \nundermined the compromise.\n  Unfortunately, the ninth circuit court has ruled that the 1990 act's \nrequirement to seek to meet market demand for timber is merely \nhortatory and not binding on the Forest Service as are numerous other \nstatutory obligations. More recently, on October 19, Alaska District \nCourt Judge, James Singleton, ruled that based upon the ninth circuit's \nreasoning, the balancing mechanisms of the 1990 Act are not a binding \nduty. Rather they are merely a Congressional admonition to be factored \ninto the mix of Forest Service goals. Judge Singleton then held that \n``the absence of any enforceable duty'' denies plaintiffs (the State of \nAlaska and the Alaska Forest Association) standing to challenge Forest \nService decisions, and that plaintiffs will not receive relief ``unless \ncongress intervenes in a more forcefully way.''\n  The amendment meets this challenge from the courts by imposing a \nnondiscretionary obligation on the Forest Service to maintain a land \nbase suitable for timber production and resulting allowable sale \nquantity as indicated in alternative P, thus restoring the 1990 \ncompromise and establishing a binding duty to maintain the timber land \nbase. The Forest Service has flexibility to work within a number of \nadministrative land use designations to harmonize this duty with other \nstatutory obligations or agency goals.\n  The conference agreement makes it clear that any revision, amendment, \nor modification shall be based on the application of the scientific \nmethod and sound, verifiable scientific data. Data is sound, verifiable \nand scientific only when it is collected and analyzed using the \nscientific method. The scientific method requires the statement of a \nhypothesis capable of proof or disproof, preparation of a study plan \ndesigned to collect accurate data to test the hypothesis; collection \nand analysis of the data in conformance with the study plan; and \nconfirmation, modification or denial of the hypothesis based upon peer-\nreviewed analysis of the collected data. That the data used shall be \nfrom southeast Alaska ecosystem. The current TLMP revision process \nunderway does not meet these standards and should be modified in the 2-\nyear time period provided by this amendment.\n  The amendment also includes language to release timber enjoined by \nthe ninth circuit court because the Forest Service had not conducted an \nenvironmental analysis when allowing the transfer of sales from one \nlong-term timber contract holder (the Alaska Pulp Corp.) to another \n(Ketchikan Pulp Co.). Previously, Congress passed section 503 of Public \nLaw 104-14 which said that the transfer of sales should be authorized, \nnotwithstanding the requirements of the National Environmental Policy \nAct [NEPA] and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \n[ANILCA].\n  The ninth circuit subsequently determined on September 28, that \nsection 503 or the rescissions bill did not alter the legal basis for \nthe court's original decision. The court stated that section 503 \nreflected the ``mistaken view that the dispute involves the changing of \nparties to a contract.'' The court said that, since the alternatives \ndescribed in the environmental impact statement were driven by Alaska \nPulp Corporation's [APC] contract, NEPA and ANILCA required a new set \nof alternatives in order for the Forest Service to reoffer the timber \nto third parties (because the Forest Service was no longer under an \nobligation to sell the timber to anyone). Accordingly, the ninth \ncircuit held that section 503 failed to address the legal significance \nof the termination of APC's contract by focusing solely on the fact \nthat the sales were transferred from one party to another.\n  By saying that ``the change of purchasers for whatever reason shall \nnot be considered a significant new circumstance,'' the amendment in \nthis bill makes it clear that, even though the change of purchasers is \ndue to the termination of the long term sale, the transfer to third \nparties is covered by the language in the bill. The language says that \nit will not be legally significant no matter what reason the Forest \nService makes for the transfer.\n  I urge the administration to recognize the good faith negotiations \nthat resulted in this compromise, and to sign the Interior \nappropriations bill. To do otherwise would be to destroy the small \nkernel of hope that this provision will bring to the people of \nsoutheast Alaska who live in the forest. Because there is no State \nforest, there is no private land. These people live in the forest--\nKetchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Juneau, Sitka, Skagway. All of these \nareas are in the forest, and the people living in this area have hopes \nthat this legislation will maintain their industry at a modest level.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I urge that realism dictate the evaluation of \nthese matters by the Department of Interior. They suggest that the \nQueen Charlotte goshawk and the Alexander Archipelago wolf might be \nendangered as a consequence of logging. It is absolutely without any \nscientific fact of any kind, and is simply a bogus excuse. They have \nalready been ruled as not subject to the Endangered Species Act because \nthey are not threatened. But they keep bringing this matter up.\n  Mr. President, we have a season on wolves. We allow the taking of \nwolves. They are predators. If they were scarce, obviously, that would \nbe the first thing to go. But the Secretary of the Interior puts this \nsmokescreen up and suggests that the wolves and the timber do not mix, \nand it is absolutely based on no scientific fact.\n  Alaskans simply cannot understand it. And the only effort they are \nmaking in the evaluation of the goshawk is not to find out how many are \nin the forest. They simply look at the next proposed area to be logged \nand use the wolf or the goshawk to block development. There is no \nsubstantiation to suggest that the goshawk is endangered either.\n  But it just drives me crazy to see these false excuses coming out of \nthis department that knows better, and they admit they know better. But \nthey will use any excuse at any time to address an emotional argument.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I wish the President a good day.\n  I see my good friend from West Virginia seeks recognition. I wish him \na good day as well.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska. He is always \nmost generous in his comments concerning other Senators. He has always \nbeen very kind, and as is his characteristic way, he is always \ncooperative and courteous toward me. I appreciate his friendship. And I \nam glad to have him as my colleague.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is finally able to undertake its \nconsideration of the conference report on H.R. 1977, the FY 1996 \nDepartment of the Interior and Related Agencies appropriations bill. \nThis bill has been to conference on three occasions, as a result of two \ndifferent votes to recommit the conference report by the House. \nHowever, we now have a product that has passed the House and I hope \nthat the Senate will be able to provide its approval expeditiously. For \nthe information of Senators, this conference report and accompanying \nstatement of the managers appeared in the Congressional Record on \nDecember 12, 1995, on pages H14288 through H14309.\n  The agreements before the Senate today total $12.234 billion in \nbudget authority, and $13.210 billion in outlays, \n\n[[Page S18614]]\nas scored by the Congressional Budget Office. The Subcommittee has had \nits 602(b) allocation increased by the Full Committee in order to \nprovide an additional $50 million for Indian programs, which has been \nan area of concern to numerous Senators, as well as to the \nadministration.\n  The recommendations of this conference agreement represent a total \ndecrease below the amounts provided in fiscal year 1995 of \napproximately $1 billion in budget authority and $822 million in \noutlays. Thus, when all of the various scorekeeping adjustments are \nfactored in, this bill is about 8 percent below current levels.\n  This conference report reflects the very difficult choices imposed \nupon the Appropriations Committee this year as a result of the \nconstrained funding for domestic discretionary spending provided in the \nbudget resolution. Nearly every single agency in this bill is funded at \na level well below the fiscal year 1995 enacted level. Significant \npersonnel reductions will result due to various program terminations or \nrestructurings recommended in the Interior bill this year. The picture \nmight be prettier if we had more money, but we do not have more \nmoney. Further cuts in domestic discretionary spending contemplated by \nthe President in his most recent budget proposal make it likely that \nadditional cuts in the outyears for the programs in this bill will be \nnecessary. So next year will be slimmer than this year.\n\n  Given the constraints within which conferees had to work, as well as \nthe prospects for the future, I believe this conference report reflects \na balancing of the competing interests found in the Interior bill.\n  Now, Senator Gorton has already laid out the details, and laid them \nout well. I wish to extend my strongest commendation to Senator Gorton \nfor his leadership on the Interior appropriations bill this year. This \nis his first year as chairman of the subcommittee, and I am going to \nsay something about the chairman of the subcommittee that I have never \nsaid before in my almost 40 years in this body and 44 years on Capitol \nHill. I am going to say something that I have never heard another \nSenator say about a subcommittee chairman; that is that this \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton, is the best subcommittee \nchairman that this subcommittee has had in at least the last 8 years.\n  What am I saying when I say that? I was chairman of the subcommittee \nfor 6 years. So what I am saying is that Senator Gorton is a better \nchairman of this subcommittee, has mastered its details more, is better \nprepared, more knowledgeable concerning the bill than I ever was.\n  This is a Western Senator's bill, as a matter of fact. I am not a \nWestern Senator. Senator Gorton is a Western Senator. But I salute him, \nand I daresay there is not another Senator in this body that I have \never heard say that another chairman of the subcommittee has been a \nbetter chairman than he, the Senator speaking, has been. I say that \nungrudgingly. And, of course, it has to come from my heart. So I \ncongratulate Senator Gorton. I commend him.\n  The Bible says, ``Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall \nstand before kings.'' Senator Gorton is diligent in his business, and \nwe are fortunate to have him as our chairman.\n  Of course, I hope the day will come when I will again be chairman of \nthe subcommittee. I look forward to that day. I hope it is not too far \naway. But, in the meantime, my words stand as they have been spoken.\n  So he has mastered the complexities of the public lands and other \nissues that confound this bill year after year. He has been most \nconsiderate of me and of other Senators throughout this appropriations \nprocess. He cannot do everything for everybody. He cannot do everything \nfor anybody. He cannot do everything he would like for himself. But I \nthank him for his courtesies. He has been most deferential and generous \nto me.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will act to support this \nconference report. As I have already said, it is the third conference \nreport on the bill. While changes have been made from the earlier \nconferences, the administration continues to voice concerns about some \nof the provisions, particularly the legislative language in the bill, \nand it is possible that the bill will be vetoed. But I hope that the \nadministration will think carefully before reaching a decision about \nthe fate of this bill.\n  The controversial issues will not go away if the bill is vetoed. They \nwill not go away. The $50 million increase for Indian programs might be \ntaken away. Further restrictions on the Agencies funded in the bill \nmight be imposed. So, while the administration may not like everything \nabout the bill--and I do not like everything about the bill--while the \nadministration may not like everything about the bill, I urge the \nadministration to think carefully once, twice, three times, and then \nthink again. Think again before issuing a veto. If a veto is issued, I \nhope the administration will be prepared to negotiate constructively. A \nposition that the bill is signable only if the language items are \nremoved in their entirety is not helpful--or realistic.\n\n  There are many programs which were identified as a priority by the \nadministration, but our allocation constrained how far we could go in \nfunding all of the programs on their list. Given the environment in \nwhich we had to work, most programs fared relatively well in this \nconference agreement. It is unclear how some of these activities will \nbe treated if funding for the Interior bill agencies is folded into a \ncontinuing resolution. In addition, this bill begins a responsible \ndownward trend, which is absolutely necessary given where domestic \ndiscretionary spending appears headed in the coming years.\n  Mr. President, I would like to highlight some of the items in the \nconference agreement.\n  The subcommittee has attempted to protect the operational base of the \nagencies funded in the bill, while at the same time these agencies are \nhaving to take their share of administrative and personnel reductions. \nIn order to protect the operating accounts, more significant reductions \nwere taken in the land acquisition and construction accounts.\n  Funding for Indian programs under the jurisdiction of the Interior \nSubcommittee is reduced by 4 percent below the FY 1994 level. These \nreductions are taken primarily from the discretionary activities of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, in order to protect education and health care \nfor Indians, which also fall under the jurisdiction of this \nsubcommittee. The conference agreement restores $112 million to the \nBureau of Indian Affairs from the Senate-passed level.\n  Total funding in the bill for the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \n$140 million, a level 40 percent below the FY 1995 amount. No project \nspecific earmarks are included for land acquisition. The conferees \ndirect the administration to propose projects for consideration, \nsubject to the committee's reprogramming guidelines.\n  Total funding for construction in the land management agencies is \nreduced by nearly 20 percent below last year's level.\n  The National Biological Service is eliminated as an independent \nentity, and the conference agreement folds the natural resource \nresearch responsibilities of the Interior Department into the \njurisdiction of the Geological Survey. Efforts have been taken to \nprotect, as much as possible, the existing research facilities located \nin various states.\n  The Bureau of Mines is terminated, with its health and safety and \nmaterials partnership functions transferred to the Department of Energy \nand its non-Alaska mineral information responsibilities assigned to the \nGeological Survey. The Alaska minerals activities from the Bureau of \nMines are transferred to the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is reduced by about \n$63 million, to a level of $99.5 million. The National Endowment for \nthe Humanities is reduced by about $62 million, to a level of \n$110 million. The conferees agreed to disagree regarding future funding \nfor these two agencies.\n\n  As usual, Mr. President, the most controversial issues in the \nInterior bill involve legislative proposals. With respect to the most \nsignificant of these items:\n  The bill contains language continuing the moratorium on the issuance \nof mining patents. Provisions are included regarding a schedule for the \n\n\n[[Page S18615]]\nprocessing of those patent applications in the pipeline, as well as for \nthe use of third parties in the conduct of mineral examinations.\n  Legislative language is included regarding the management of the \nTongass National Forest in Alaska. While management direction is \nspecified for the next 2 years, the Forest Service will be able to \ncomplete the current planning process.\n  A moratorium on implementation of certain provisions of the \nEndangered Species Act is imposed until reauthorization of this \nlandmark legislation is enacted.\n  Language is included which changes the direction provided by Congress \nlast fall regarding the management of the California Desert. The latest \nconference agreement allows the National Park Service to engage in a \ncomprehensive planning effort during fiscal year 1996, but management \nin the Mojave Preserve remains the responsibility of the Bureau of Land \nManagement.\n  Legislative language is included which limits the types of grants \nthat can be funded using NEA dollars appropriated in this act. The \nlanguage offered to the Senate bill has been modified to address \nconcerns regarding potential legal challenges.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this conference report is not perfect. It \nis exactly what most conference reports are--a compromise. The House \ndid not get everything it wanted, and neither did the Senate. This bill \nmakes a significant downpayment toward deficit reduction, while trying \nto balance many competing needs and interests. I urge the Senate to \nadopt this conference report, and I hope the President will give it his \napproval.\n  Lastly, I would like to commend the staff who work on this \nappropriations bill. It is not an easy task, in part because of the \nvariety of issues involved, and also because of the extreme interest so \nmany Senators place on the programs and projects under the jurisdiction \nof the Interior Subcommittee. I wish to thank Senator Gorton's staff: \nCherie Cooper, Kathleen Wheeler, Bruce Evans, and Ginny James. On my \nstaff, Sue Masica handles the Interior bill, and is assisted by Carole \nGeagley. The staff works together as a team, and I think that is \nreflected in the quality of the product presented to the Senate today.\n  I thank all Senators and urge adoption of the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          INTERIOR PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss briefly with the \nchairman some of the funding included in this bill. Together we have \nmade an effort to eliminate earmarks within the bill. There is no way \nto accommodate the many projects that Senators requested. One way to \ntreat every State fairly is to provide no earmarks, and instead set \nprogrammatic budget priorities.\n  I have worked to improve the budget process by focusing on programs \nwithin the administration's budget rather than add-ons and earmarks. We \ncannot simultaneously address the deficit program and continue to add \nnew programs. I have worked with the agencies to craft budgets that \nmake sense to the State of Vermont and address national issues that are \nworthy of Federal support.\n  In that respect, I wish to clarify my understanding of the budget's \ntreatment of several programs and projects that are important to the \nagencies and important to the State of Vermont. At the time the budget \nwas presented, the Interior Department provided information to me which \nindicated that the Lake Champlain Basin initiative was continued in the \nbudgets of the Geological Survey and the National Park Service at \napproximately the fiscal year 1995 levels--$222,000 and $250,000 \nrespectively--and that there was approximately $600,000 in the Fish and \nWildlife Service Budget for these purposes. In addition, the \nConnecticut River Valley ecosystem project was slated to receive \napproximately $1,005,000 in the FWS budget for the Conte Refuge, and \nthat the Park Service intended to allocate $250,000 for this effort. \nThe Fish and Wildlife Service would also participate in efforts to \nprotect the resources of these ecosystems through investments in \nendangered species management and private lands wetlands restoration.\n  Mr. President, while no specific earmarks restating what was included \nin the budget were provided in the committee report, I hope the \nchairman would extend his agreement that the agencies should follow \nthrough on their commitment to continue these initiatives, roughly at \nthe levels assumed in the budget. The budget levels were essentially a \ncontinuation of the prior year level of effort, and my objective is to \nsee that the initiatives continue. Obviously, if there were reductions \nin any of the budget line items where these programs are funded, these \ninitiatives would have to bear their fair share of any such reductions. \nHowever, for the most part, under the leadership of the chairman, the \noperating accounts of the land management agencies have been pretty \nwell protected, and the agencies should be able to follow through on \nthe indications provided by the Department.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware of the Senator's concern for emphasizing these \ninitiatives. What he has presented seems reasonable, and I would expect \nthe Department to follow through with roughly the funding levels that \nhave been identified.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I join my fellow Senator from Vermont to express my \ninterest in these important community efforts in the State of Vermont. \nI am glad that the chairman concurs with our understanding.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senators from Vermont for highlighting these \nconcerns. I agree with the chairman. Since the accounts in which these \ninitiatives are funded are basically level with the budget request, the \nDepartment should be able to address these programs consistent with the \ninformation provided when the budget was submitted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement accompanying H.R. 1977, the fiscal year 1996 Interior and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill.\n  This bill has been a long time coming to the Senate. I commend the \ndistinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton, for his diligence \nin completing this bill.\n  The final bill provides $12.1 billion in budget authority and $8.2 \nbillion in new outlays to finance the operation of the Department of \nInterior agencies, the U.S. Forest Service, the Indian Health Service, \nthe energy conservation and fossil energy programs of the Department of \nEnergy, the Smithsonian Institution, and other arts-related agencies. \nMost of the funding in this bill is for nondefense discretionary \nprograms.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the final bill totals $12.3 billion in \nbudget authority and $13.3 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996. The \nbill is $0.5 million in budget authority and $0.25 million in outlays \nunder the subcommittee's revised 602(b) allocation.\n  Mr. President, the subcommittee had difficult decisions to make in \nsetting priorities for the funding in this bill. In revisiting the bill \nfor the third time, the conferees restored important funding for the \nnative American programs funded in the bill. I have fought for this \noutcome since the bill came before the Senate. While we have not made \nup all the funding I believe is necessary for the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs for tribal priority allocations, the restoration of $25 million \nfor this purpose is significant. I thank the chairman for his efforts \nin this regard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the conference agreement be printed in the \nRecord, and I urge the adoption of the conference report.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n        INTERIOR SUBCOMMITTEE, SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT       \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget            \n                                                    authority   Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................        146      5,001\n    H.R. 1977, conference report..................     12,089      8,208\n    Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n        Subtotal nondefense discretionary.........     12,234     13,210\n                                                   =====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                        \n     completed....................................  .........         24\n    H.R. 1977, conference report..................         59         25\n    Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                       \n     Budget Resolution assumptions................          6          6\n                                                   ---------------------\n        Subtotal mandatory........................         65         55\n                                                   ---------------------\n\n[[Page S18616]]\n                                                                        \n            Adjusted bill total...................     12,299     13,265\n                                                   =====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n    Defense discretionary.........................  .........  .........\n    Nondefense discretionary......................     12,235     13,210\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............  .........  .........\n    Mandatory.....................................         65         55\n        Total allocation..........................     12,300     13,265\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n    Defense discretionary.........................  .........  .........\n    Nondefense discretionary......................         -1         -0\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund............  .........  .........\n    Mandatory.....................................  .........  .........\n                                                   ---------------------\n        Total allocation..........................         -1         -0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute past the 2 o'clock time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe the Senator has 2 minutes under his \ncontrol, at any rate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Fine.\n  Mr. President, one of the finer customs of the Senate, one of the \ncustoms that makes it work in contentious times better than might \notherwise be the case, is the custom of Senators to treat kindly their \nfellow Members and to speak well of them. I think that is a wonderful \ncustom, and I have been its beneficiary on a number of occasions. But I \nmust say, I have never been its beneficiary in such fulsome terms as \nwere just applied to me by my friend and colleague, mentor, the senior \nSenator from West Virginia. I cannot claim to deserve all of those \ncompliments, but I may appreciate them even the more for that.\n  I learned what I have learned in the service of the Appropriations \nCommittee from him during his chairmanship, and the extent that I have \nhad a success this year has been largely due to the advice and the \nguidance which the senior Senator from West Virginia has provided.\n  He has stated very well the difficulties under which this bill is \npresented to this body, the great contribution it makes to deficit \nreduction and the difficulty that that created in attempting to \nproperly fund and instruct the agencies under its jurisdiction. I have \nalso made a statement to that effect.\n  I will simply solicit the support of my colleagues for the bill which \nI believe reaches its goals well, considering the challenges with which \nwe are faced, and I hope that the President will change his mind and \nsign it, as it will be much better than any alternative that he is \nlikely to receive through a continuing resolution.\n  The yeas and nays have not been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COVERDELL). They have not.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a critically \nimportant resolution. It will restore the honor of our country, and my \nState of Montana in particular, in the face of an impudent affront \nleveled against us by the Governor of West Virginia.\n  Let me begin with a question. What would possess as many as 5,000 \nMontanans to leave our beautiful State and travel to a small town in \nWest Virginia--of all places--for the weekend?\n  There is only one answer--and that is Grizzly fever.\n  As I have proudly told many of my colleagues, the University of \nMontana Grizzlies are traveling to Huntington, WV, to take on the \nThundering Herd of Marshall University in the NCAA, Division I-AA \nNational Championship. And on Saturday night, they will come home to \nMissoula as the national champions.\n  It takes a good football team to get that far. But the Grizzlies are \nnot just a good football team--they are a great football team.\n  How great are the Grizzlies, some may ask?\n  Great enough to have trounced their playoff opponents. During the \nthree playoff games, the Grizzlies scored a total of 156 points. Their \nthree opponents managed to score a paltry 14 points; and two out of the \nthree playoff games were Grizzly shutouts.\n  And the Grizzlies are great enough to have what I believe is the \nfinest quarterback in college football today. Dave Dickenson, from \nGreat Falls, is a three-time first team academic all-American, a first \nteam all-American quarterback, and Dave will probably receive the \nWalter Payton Award next week as the best Division I-AA player in \nAmerica.\n  Many West Virginians--including my friends Senator Byrd and \nRockefeller--may take pride in Marshall's winning record up to this \npoint. That is fine. I see nothing wrong with acknowledging the \naccomplishment of the second-best team. But Governor Caperton crossed \nthe line when he signed a proclamation naming December 16--the day of \nthe game--Marshall University Day.\n  Now, normally, I am a strong supporter of States rights. But Governor \nCaperton has gone too far. His proclamation is a slap in the face to me \nand every other self-respecting Montanan. And it is an insult to the \ngood sense of every American who follows college football.\n  Mr. President, sometimes State governments make mistakes. And on \noccasions like this one, they are whoppers. The time has come for \nCongress to step in and set things right.\n  That is why I am introducing my resolution today. It would recognize \nthe Montana Grizzlies as the new national champions by proclaiming all \nof next week Montana Grizzlies Appreciation Week. It would also declare \nthe unfortunate, unjust, and illegitimate proclamation by the Governor \nof West Virginia null and void.\n  If you still doubt the need for this resolution, tune in on Saturday. \nThe game starts at 10 Montana time--that's noon in Washington on ESPN. \nIt will be a great game.\n  Mr. HELMS. I can see why the Senator was eager to make a speech and \nmake a reference to Montana. I congratulate him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18617-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18617-S18637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FOREIGN RELATIONS REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Here we are, Mr. President. As I was saying a few minutes \nago, at long last, S. 908 is the pending business before the U.S. \nSenate--S. 908 being the plan to reorganize the State Department--a \nplan much maligned by all the bureaucrats who do not want to be folded \ninto the State Department. They do not want to save any money. To their \nchagrin, it looks to me like we are going to save some money, not as \nmuch as we would have liked, but that is an issue we can work on in \nconference with the House. S. 908 was reported to the Senate more than \n6 months ago, and I have never seen as many erroneous news reports \nabout a piece of legislation in all of my 23 years in the Senate. The \nadministration at every turn has vowed--and I use the administration's \nwords--vowed to ``delay, postpone, obfuscate and derail'' S. 908. They \nmade no bones about it. All of that was ignored by the great media of \nthis country. There was just one Senator who was holding up the whole \nworks--that fellow from North Carolina, Helms--and they went after \nHelms with a feverish attitude.\n  Our Democratic colleagues signed up and have refused to allow the \nSenate to work its will, but that did not make any difference to the \nnews media. They reported that it was Helms doing the holding up, when \nactually it was the administration and the Democrat Members of the \nSenate. Now, there was one Senator who was willing to negotiate and \nparticipate in the process, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, to whom I \nshall forever be grateful.\n  It needs to be made clear that the Senator from North Carolina has \nnever, never demanded that I get my way as press report after press \nreport after press report claimed. I have never demanded that the \nSenate accept this authorization bill or that the administration agree \nto downsize Government by eliminating a few Federal agencies. I have \nnever demanded that the Senate accept this authorization bill or that \nthe administration agree to downsize Government and abolish some \nFederal agencies. I had hoped all of that would happen, and the bill \nwas drafted for that purpose, but I never made any demand for \nanything--except that the Senate be allowed to vote on S. 908. I said \nfrom the very beginning, ``Let me have a vote and you will have your \nambassadors.'' I have asked only that the Senate be allowed to conduct \nits legislative responsibilities and vote. Not once did I stipulate \nthat S. 908 had to pass but just that it be voted upon. But the \nDemocrats were afraid that if it were put up for a vote, the Senate \nwould agree to abolish three Federal agencies--what a tragedy that \nwould have been.\n  Since this process began months ago, the Foreign Relations Committee \nhas acted on at least 58 of President Clinton's ambassadorial \nnominees--most of them political appointees, I might add. The committee \nhas acted on six tax treaties and assorted other international treaties \nin that same time period. I have asked myself many times, what have we \nreceived in return? Until this date, nothing; nothing. There goes that \nobfuscation, delay, postponement, derailment.\n\n  I take issue with those in the administration and with my colleagues, \nespecially the distinguished Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], who \nat one point asserted that it was the ``height of irresponsibility to \nhold up nearly all other committee business over one piece of \nlegislation.'' Chris Dodd knows better than that, Mr. President. He is \nin charge of the political wing of the Democratic Party. He is perhaps \nexperiencing a convenient amnesia, forgetting that as chairman of the \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere in 1992, Senator \nDodd himself refused to schedule any subcommittee ambassadorial \nnomination hearings for an entire year. So when Senator Dodd made his \nextravagant statement, I respond, ``Look who is talking.''\n  I could go on, but suffice it to say many of my Democrat colleagues \nhave engaged in a bit of injured innocence when they weep such copious \ntears about the delay in Senate confirmation of several nominees. Now, \nwere it not \n\n[[Page S18618]]\nfor Senator Kerry's commitment, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, his \ncommitment to negotiate common ground, we would still this very \nafternoon be at an impasse. Everybody knows that there needs to be \nstreamlining and consolidation of the whole Federal Government. It is \none of the big reasons we have a $5 trillion debt hanging over the \npeople of this country. Senator Kerry recognized early on and said, \n``Yes, one or more of the three agencies stipulated in this legislation \nhave outlived their usefulness.''\n  That is putting it the nice way. The truth of the matter is that all \nthree of the agencies, ACDA [U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency], \nAID [Agency for International Development], and the U.S. Information \nAgency [USIA] need serious pruning and, in my opinion, should be put on \nthe short list to be abolished. I note that in reference to USIA, it \nwas never our intention to undermine our international broadcasting \ncapability, such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. But I \nrepeat, the ancillary agencies that cost billions of dollars have got \nto be toned down. That is what this bill is all about.\n  I remind my colleagues that it was Secretary of State Christopher who \nproposed to Vice President Gore's much-publicized Reinventing \nGovernment Office that the United States was obliged to restructure the \nU.S. foreign affairs apparatus for the 21st century. Secretary of State \nChristopher himself advocated the elimination of the Agency for \nInternational Development, the U.S. Information Agency, and the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency. Mr. President, Secretary Christopher \nwent almost hat in hand down to Vice President Gore's office to plead \nthat our foreign affairs apparatus needed a serious rethinking for the \npost-cold-war era. I remind my colleagues that is was Vice President \nGore, the former U.S. Senator, who was chosen to be the No. 2 officer \nof this country and has spent much of his time in office proclaiming \nhis intent to reinvent Government, to downsize Government, and to save \nthe taxpayers money. I know of very few successful efforts of the Vice \nPresident in that regard, because somewhere along the line Vice \nPresident Gore, decided all of a sudden that the status quo was just \nfine, and Vice President Gore rejected out of hand Secretary of State \nChristopher's proposal. In doing so he became a captive of the very \nFederal bureaucracy he was supposed to reinvent.\n\n  By the way, this past January, it was the Vice President of the \nUnited States, Al Gore, who promised that he was going to save $5 \nbillion in 5 years by cutting the U.S. International Affairs budget. S. \n908, under the terms of the manager's amendment, mandates $1.7 billion \nin savings over 5 years. If $1.7 billion in savings ``jeopardizes the \nnational interest'', what are we to have said about $5 billion? The \nlocal press would call such a draconian cut the policy of an \nisolationist if it were made by anybody on this side. They all \napplauded when the Vice President said it. But look at the facts. How \ndid Mr. Gore come up with those figures? He yanked them out of thin \nair. Even Senate Democrats acknowledge that they cannot figure it out. \nThey have asked for months--all of us have been asking for months--for \nthe Vice President's proposals for all of these savings.\n  Finally, some of the more candid Senators on the other side of the \naisle confessed. They admitted that the Vice President's plan had no \nbasis in reality and it must have been the result of bad staff work \ndown at the White House. So the emperor had no clothes.\n  It is worthy of note that the Vice President's book entitled ``Common \nSense Government'' asserts that his recommendations on restructuring \nthe U.S. foreign affairs agencies would be announced in the fall of \n1995.\n  Mr. President, it is now the winter of 1995, and we are still \nwaiting.\n  The fact is, we are never going to hear from him. We are never going \nto hear from his associates. They just do not have a plan. They do not \nknow how to produce any savings. They do not have a clue. All they have \nare press releases, and those press releases, as it turns out, are \nnot--and were not--worth the paper they were printed on last January.\n  S. 908, the committee's plan to abolish three Federal agencies and \nsave $3 billion has been available to the administration in writing for \nmore than 6 months.\n  By the way, I stress that the largest of these agencies--the Agency \nfor International Development [AID]--is a temporary Federal agency, \neven though it was established a half century ago. Ronald Reagan used \nto say that ``There is nothing so near to eternal life as a temporary \nFederal agency.'' I think that is correct. The Clinton administration, \nthe State Department, and the Vice President of the United States have \nyet to provide an alternative to S. 908. The administration has not \neven bothered to submit an authorization bill to the Congress this \nyear.\n  So here we are. S. 908 is the pending business in the Senate. What \ngoes around, comes around. As I indicated at the outset, 6 months after \ncommittee consideration of the bill, no thanks to the administration, \nthe Senate Democrats have proposed an amendment to our bill.\n  Senator Kerry has just arrived on the floor. And I do not know \nwhether he knows that I paid my respects to him while he was on the way \nover here. But I have, and I meant it. And I am grateful to the \nSenator.\n  The Kerry amendment, as I said earlier, mandates cost savings of $1.7 \nbillion over 5 years. That is less than one-third of what Vice \nPresident Gore promised that he would save, and what S. 908 proposed to \nsave at the outset. We are not saving enough in my judgment. Senator \nKerry knows how I feel about that. We have been candid to each other. \nBut I want to get started on this business of saving the taxpayers' \nmoney, and I think John Kerry does as well.\n  I have had to console myself with the fact that saving the taxpayers \n$1.7 billion is better than saving the taxpayers nothing. Of course, it \nwould have been far better if Senator Kerry had been permitted to \nfulfill his original offer in committee to abolish one agency and save \n$2 billion over 4 years. In fact, at the markup of S. 908, the able \nSenator from Massachusetts strongly stated that he was prepared to move \nforward on the one agency abolition, and that he would not back down on \nthat proposal. I thinks it is too bad that he did.\n  Remember, Mr. President, the original intent of the pending bill, S. \n908, was to abolish three agencies. The Democrat's compromise proposal \nwas to maintain status quo--leave all three agencies fully functioning \nand just ask them to save a few billion dollars. The managers' \namendment requires the President of the United States within 6 months \nto send up a plan to downsize, consolidate, and streamline. And, if the \nPresident fails to do it, three Federal agencies will be abolished just \nas we proposed in the beginning. The ball is going to be in the \nPresident's court. The clock on that 6 months starts ticking when S. \n908 (or H.R. 1561) is enacted.\n\n  So as I said at the outset, Mr. President, here we are. While the \nmain focus of this managers' amendment is on reauthorization, it needs \nto be borne in mind that this is a 4-year authorization bill for the \nDepartment of State.\n  Also, the managers' amendment modifies several other sections of the \nbill. For example, we agreed to modify some provisions relating to the \nU.S. relationship with the United Nations. One in particular that has \nbothered me is the provision restricting the share of U.S. intelligence \nwith the United Nations. At the administration's insistence we have \nreplaced that provision with a much less stringent one.\n  I, for one, agree with Senator Snowe of Maine. The original provision \nwas proposed by Senator Snowe and it was much tougher. I agree with her \nthat the administration should be required to make the case to Congress \nas to why it is crucial for the United States to share intelligence \nwith the United Nations which includes in its membership countries such \nas Iraq and Cuba.\n  We also agreed to remove section 603 which is a provision dear and \nnear to my own heart. The provision would provide asylum for immigrants \nwho are fleeing the policies of their home countries that will force \nthem to abort their unborn children or force them to be sterilized, as \nthe case may be. The silver lining in this decision is that this \nprovision is included in the House bill and, therefore, I expect to \nstrongly support the House language in the House-Senate conference on \nthis bill. \n\n[[Page S18619]]\n\n  We modified section 604 to authorize payments from frozen Iraqi \nassets for United States claimants. A similar provision was approved in \ncommittee by a bipartisan vote of 10 to 8.\n  Section 168 restricting the issuance of visas to those who traffic in \nexpropriated property was deleted at the behest of Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut who has stated that he would prefer that issue be dealt \nwith in the conference on the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity Act, H.R. \n927.\n  Mr. President, another important aspect of this agreement is that the \nSenate will provide for the appointment of conferees upon final passage \nof this measure sending H.R. 1561--the House companion bill--to the \nHouse, and requesting a conference.\n  On Tuesday, the Foreign Relations Committee reported out--true to my \npromise--18 pending nominees, and the START II treaty.\n  The previous unanimous consent agreement provides for en bloc \nconsideration of the nominees upon final passage of S. 908. The \nmajority and minority leaders have agreed to make every effort to \nfinish START II as expeditiously as possible.\n  A few more thoughts and I will be through.\n  Early next year the Foreign Relations Committee will begin active \nconsideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention, including additional \nhearings and additional steps necessary to full committee consideration \nof this treaty by April 30. I feel obliged to assert that I remain \nopposed to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Until this administration \ncomes forward with a public explanation of precisely how this treaty \ncan be verified, which it cannot do and has not done yet, I cannot \nimagine that the Senate will be prepared to take action on the treaty. \nBut that remains to be seen.\n  The road to redemption was not traveled in one day. It began with one \nstep in the right direction, and that is where we find ourselves today. \nThe Democrats have taken this step by recognizing the necessity of \nconsolidating the U.S. foreign affairs agencies and agreeing to mandate \ncost savings and by concurring that the Secretary of State should be \nthe primary foreign policy adviser to the President of the United \nStates. Ultimately, the President and our Nation's foreign policy will \nbenefit from this reorganization which has been endorsed by five former \nSecretaries of State, who, in the process, one after another, conferred \nwith us and helped us in the drafting of the bill.\n  Let me say this, and I shall yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The world has changed dramatically during the past 10 years. The \nState Department has not. The issue of consolidation and restructuring \nis not going away this year, and it is not going away next year either. \nI pledge that. Brian Atwood, for example, will have to rethink his \njubilant declaration this past October when he said, ``AID has survived \na bruising political battle.'' That remains to be seen.\n  Down on the Archives building, not far from the Capitol, is a piece \nof marble that has the words, ``What is past is prologue.'' Somebody \nasked a friend of mine what that means, and he said, ``That means `You \nain't seen nothing yet.' '' So, Mr. Atwood, I would say, ``You ain't \nseen nothing yet.''\n  What has happened here is not the beginning of the end, it is the end \nof the beginning. Eventually--eventually--the American people are going \nto have their say. And to the length of my cable-tow, they also will \nhave their way.\n  I yield the floor, and I assume the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts wishes to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. I was \nnot here when he made some very generous comments about my \nparticipation in this, and I am appreciative of what I have been told \nthat he said.\n  As I said the other night, for myself I want to thank the Senator \nfrom North Carolina for his patience and for his forbearance in this \nprocess. It has been a difficult process, as many have said, but I will \nsay that in all of the dealings that he and I have had, there was never \nany rancor or any raising of voices. We argued and debated and pressed \nand pushed, both of us, for positions that we believed in. In the end, \nwhat we have here is a compromise, as it ought to be, and I think it is \na fair compromise. I think it is a sensible compromise. It is a \ncompromise that recognizes the changes that are sweeping over all of \nGovernment and Washington. It recognizes the imperative of that change, \nwhich no agency or entity of Government ought to be exempt from unless \nthey can prove, beyond all doubt, that they ought to be.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Helms and I have reached \nagreement on a manager's amendment and that the months-long impasse \nover this bill and the nominees and other issues linked to movement on \nthis bill has come to an end. The process has been long and at times \ntrying. In the eyes of many it was about politics, not policy, but that \nis not the case. From the very beginning there have been real \nsubstantive disagreements over the consolidation language in this bill \nand over many other policy provisions, such as those mentioned by the \ndistinguished ranking minority member, Senator Pell.\n  This managers' amendment is a compromise in every sense of the word. \nOn the key issue of consolidation, Senator Helms and his Republican \ncolleagues on the committee agreed to accept my proposal which \npreserves the President's prerogative to determine how the foreign \naffairs agencies--that is the State Department, AID, USIA, and ACDA--\nwill be reorganized. This proposal provides the President with \nflexibility. It does not abolish any agencies, unless the President \nfails to send a plan to Congress, but it does require the President to \nsave $1.7 billion over 5 years through reorganization and \nconsolidation. Recognizing that programmatic reductions are a byproduct \nof consolidation, it allows him to achieve up to 30 percent of that \nsavings from programmatic reductions.\n  I believe that this proposal will result in some serious and \nbeneficial streamlining and consolidation of our foreign affairs \napparatus. In my view this is necessary in light of the cuts that are \nbeing imposed on the budget in all areas including foreign affairs. I \nshare the concern of many of my Democratic colleagues about these cuts. \nThe international affairs budget is only 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget, and it is 1 percent well spent when one considers our needs and \ninterests abroad. But like it or not, funding for foreign affairs \nprograms has been declining over the last decade and will continue to \ndecline under whatever agreement is reached for balancing the budget in \nthe next 7 years. Against this reality, we must find a more efficient \nand cost-effective way to make and implement policy while still \npreserving critical programs. I think the approach we have in this bill \nwill enable us to do that.\n  I recognize that some are concerned that the Senate position on \nconsolidation, as reflected by this managers' amendment, will be \nreversed or changed in conference. Senator Helms and I have agreed that \nthe Senate conferees will operate under consensus with respect to the \nmain elements of my consolidation proposal, that is mandatory cost \nsavings, abolition of the agencies and the limitations as to where cost \nsavings may be achieved. It is imperative that any changes in the \nSenate position on consolidation reflect agreement among all the Senate \nconferees because this issue is at the heart of the bill.\n\n  Senator Helms and I have also agreed that we will work in conference \nto increase the authorization levels for the operating accounts of the \nagencies affected by this bill. We must ensure that the authorizations \nfor these accounts are in concert with the savings we are seeking \nthrough reorganization and consolidation and that we do not undermine \nthe President's ability to reorganize by decimating the operations of \nthese agencies through the authorization process.\n  As we are all aware disagreements over this bill resulted for many \nmonths in inaction by the committee on 18 ambassadorial nominations, 4 \nFSO promotion lists, and the START II treaty. On Tuesday the Foreign \nRelations Committee favorably reported these items to the Senate. Once \nwe act upon this bill, the nominees will be approved by the Senate en \nbloc pursuant to a \n\n[[Page S18620]]\nunanimous-consent agreement reached last Thursday. When the START II \nreport is filed, the Senate, pursuant to another unanimous-consent \nagreed to last Thursday, will begin consideration of the treaty. I \nbelieve there is overwhelming support in the Senate for this treaty and \nI hope that we will be able to complete action before the Senate \nrecesses. If we do not, however, the majority leader has given his \ncommitment that we will finish action on START II at the beginning of \nthe next session. I think these are positive developments, as is the \nprocedure we have worked out for committee consideration and action on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I am hopeful that with these positive steps, we can begin to restore \nthe bipartisanship traditionally characteristic of the operations of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. The chairman has assured us that the \ncommittee will resume normal activities including scheduling of \nhearings and action on all currently pending nominees and other \ncommittee business. I believe all of us on the committee, Democrat and \nRepublican alike, agree that this is in our joint interest and that of \nthe country.\n  Mr. President, I think most of us approached the issue of how to \ndeliver our foreign policy and how to implement the various missions of \nthe various agencies that do deliver that foreign policy. Most of us \napproached this with a sense that we can do it more efficiently, that \nwe have not patented perfection with respect to it. There are areas of \nwaste. There are areas of duplication. There are areas where we can do \nsome consolidating, possibly even some merging. But we also recognized \nthat within that framework it is important to acknowledge and honor the \nprerogatives of a separate branch of Government, the executive branch.\n  So, some of us pressed very hard for the Presidential prerogative of \nbeing able to line up their own ducks, of being able to make a decision \nas to which agencies to conceivably consolidate, or what the order \nought to be. I think most people feel, particularly in the arena of \nforeign policy, that is the fair prerogative of the President of the \nUnited States. We have preserved that prerogative in this compromise. \nSo the principle of consolidation, the principle of merger, the \nprinciple of efficiency is embraced in the compromise, but the \nprinciple of the separation of powers and the Presidential prerogative \nin foreign policy is also embraced in this compromise.\n  In addition to that, I believe the level of savings represents a \nrealistic beginning. I think the Senator is perfectly correct in saying \nthe ultimate goal here is for all of us to respect the desires of the \nAmerican people to have the most efficient expenditure of their tax \ndollar. This is their dollar and this is their Government, not ours. We \nrepresent them here.\n  So, there are many in this country who have second thoughts about \nsome of those expenditures in the foreign field, but there are also \nmany people who have enormous commitment to much of what we are trying \nto do abroad--for very little.\n  I always ask audiences when I am asked a question about foreign \npolicy when I go home and talk to people in Massachusetts how much \nmoney they think we spend in foreign policy. It is fascinating to \nlisten to the response. Many people have a quick response, 20 percent, \n20 percent of our budget. More often than not, it is in the low sort of \ndouble digits: 12 percent, 11 percent, or the high single digits. \nAlmost invariably, I would say 75 percent and higher of the number of \nhands that go up in an audience, will pick 4 percent, 5 percent, rarely \nless than 3.\n  I was at a teachers convention not long ago and only one teacher out \nof about 200 correctly picked the amount of money that we put into \nforeign policy in this country: 1 percent. Less than 1 percent of the \ntotal budget of the United States of America leverages our global \ninterests.\n\n  That is not a totally fair assessment because obviously we invest in \nthe Defense Department. That is a very big investment and that is a \nserious component of our projection of force abroad and our interests. \nBut in terms of assistance to other governments, in terms of \npopulation, environment, the kinds of things we try to do with respect \nto international narcotics through the State Department and a host of \nthose efforts, we are talking about 1 percent and less of the entire \nFederal budget.\n  Many of us on our side of the aisle are deeply concerned that in a \nworld that is more global, in a world that is less centralized in its \nconflicts, where we no longer have the kind of bipolar, easily \ndefinable East-West tension that defined most of the history of this \ncountry since 1945, in that world there may well be more need to think \nabout increasing things like the Foreign Commercial Service officers in \nvarious developing countries.\n  When I was in Hong Kong over a year ago, I was struck by the fact \nthat in the Foreign Commercial Service in Hong Kong, the several people \nthat we have there said to me, ``Senator, we are missing billions of \ndollars of contracts for our companies in America.'' Those billions of \ndollars of contracts translate into thousands of jobs. For every $1 \nbillion of exports, there are 20,000 jobs created in the United States \nof America. They said to me, ``Because we only have,'' I think--I \ncannot remember the exact number, it was in the single digits--\n``Because we only have this few number of people here in Hong Kong, we \ncannot keep up with the requests for proposals. We cannot keep up with \nthe meetings that we could be putting together for people to be able to \nbe married to a deal.''\n  ``If you people''--meaning us--he said, ``were to have enough \nforesight to just give us 10 more people, we would pay their salaries \nwithin 1 month.'' That seems to me to be a reasonable return on \ninvestment.\n  That seems to make sense, but that is not necessarily--and I \nunderscore necessarily--what will happen with this budget. Could it \nhappen? The answer is yes.\n  Under the consolidation, if the Secretary of State and the President \nwere to decide that is an imperative and we ought to put more people \ninto that than have some people on some other desk, we can make that \nhappen. But I think most people feel many of those other desks are also \ncompeting with things ranging from international environmental accords \nto international questions of refugees to international questions of \nimmigration to international questions of crime to international \nquestions of terrorism, all of which in this less bipolar world present \nus with a whole different set of choices.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to go on at great length. I think our \neffort is to try to expedite this this afternoon. There is no reason at \nthis point to speak at great length, but I do want to simply say, many \npeople on our side of the aisle were deeply concerned about the level \nof reductions, and that is why we are starting out at the $1.7 billion. \nIt may well prove that in the consolidation program that, hopefully, we \nwill set up within the timeframe within this bill--I am confident that \nwe may find there is rationale for doing more. And we may also find \nthere is a clash of reality that is impossible and that this is, in \nfact, too significant.\n  Let me say also that Senator Helms and I have agreed that we will \nwork in the conference committee to increase the authorized levels for \nthe operating accounts of the agencies that are affected by this bill. \nWe have to ensure that the authorizations for these accounts are in \nconcert with the savings that we are seeking through the reorganization \nand consolidation, and we do not want to undermine the President's \nability to reorganize by decimating the operations of these agencies \nthrough the authorization process itself.\n  We are also gratified that part of this agreement now sees the \nambassadors about to be eminently improved and the START II treaty to \ncome to the floor, hopefully, within the next day or so, certainly \nwithin the next days.\n  I am particularly grateful for the commitment of the chairman to \nguarantee that the committee will act on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, and it is obviously our hope that we will be able to either \nimprove it or change it, if it needs improvement, but ultimately the \nfull Senate will be able to act.\n  I share with my colleague from North Carolina concerns about it in \nits current form. There are issues of verification. There are \nlegitimate reasons for the committee to want to do its business over \nthe course of the next months. \n\n[[Page S18621]]\n\n  Moving at this point in time, Mr. President, to a consideration of \nthe START II agreement, for which I think there is extraordinarily \nsmall opposition within the Senate, if any, is very, very important in \nthe context of events in Russia, the elections, and also our own \ninterests in reducing some 4,000 strategic nuclear weapons from the \narsenals of both ourselves and the former Soviet Union, including the \nSS-18, which was always the most imposing weapon that was pointed at \nthe United States of America.\n  I think that moving forward on that treaty is enormously important, \nand it is one of the reasons why this compromise is so welcome.\n  I want to say, finally, that I think all of these steps are \nimportant, positive steps, which I believe, in the spirit that the \nchairman has described, can help to bring us back to a bipartisan, \njoint effort to try to utilize this committee to help address the major \nquestions that we have in the country with respect to foreign policy, \nand I am confident that with all of our good efforts it can, in fact, \ndo that.\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to yield to the distinguished former \nchairman, the ranking member of the committee, for his comments at this \ntime.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Senator very much indeed.\n  Mr. President, I support the Managers Amendment to S. 908 negotiated \nby Senators Kerry and Helms. I was opposed to S. 908 as reported by the \nForeign Relations Committee, and regretted at the time it was reported \nthat the committee appeared to have abandoned a long tradition of \nbipartisanship in crafting the State Department authorization bill.\n  Consequently, I am pleased with the results of the negotiations that \nare reflected in this managers amendment. I congratulate Senator Kerry, \nwho so ably managed this bill on behalf of the Democrats. He did this \nin a skilled, professional and brilliant way. I also congratulate \nSenator Helms for his willingness to work with Senator Kerry and \nDemocratic members of the committee to achieve this constructive \nresolution to many of the serious disagreements related to S. 908.\n  The managers' amendment makes significant improvements in the bill \nwith respect to two critical areas: the reorganization of the foreign \naffairs agencies and those provisions related to the United Nations and \nits specialized agencies.\n  As we all know, much of the opposition to this bill focused on the \nmandatory abolition of AID, USIA, and ACDA and the transfer of some of \ntheir functions and personnel to the Department of State. I was \nparticularly concerned that ACDA would be abolished because I feared \nthat it would eliminate the independent voice on arms control issues \nthat every President should have, and a concept which every President \nsince President Kennedy has supported.\n  I am pleased that the compromise takes a different approach. No \nagencies are abolished, except in the event that the President fails to \nsend a reorganization plan to the Congress. The driving force of \nreorganization is the requirement that the plan save $1.7 billion over \n5 years. In my view this is the correct approach as it encourages the \nPresident to reorganize while at the same time preserving his \nprerogative to determine how that reorganization is done.\n  As reported by the committee, S. 908 also contained a number of \ntroubling provisions designed to restrict U.S. participation in the \nU.N. system. For example, some placed conditions on the payment of our \nassessed contributions to the United Nations for membership and \npeacekeeping. The managers' amendment which Senators Helms and Kerry \nare offering improves a number of these provisions and deletes others. \nI applaud these changes because we cannot exert leverage at the United \nNations if we cannot fulfill our financial and other obligations in \nfull.\n  Finally, with the adoption of this managers' amendment and the \npassage of S. 908, the Senate will proceed to the confirmation of a \nlarge number of ambassadors and the consideration of Start II. I have \npreviously expressed my deep concern and regret over the holding up of \nthe important business of the Foreign Relations Committee and the \nnation because of significant differences of opinion over just one \npiece of legislation, particularly if that one piece is unrelated to \nthe main body of the legislation and other matters that are being held \nup.\n  In my 30 years of service on the committee and 8 years as chairman, \nthis was unprecedented. With this action today, however, I am very \noptimistic that the new year will bring a return to the committee's \ntraditional bipartisan approach to addressing the foreign policy issues \nbefore the Senate. We clearly will not agree on all these issues, but I \nhope we will agree to disagree and work where feasible to reflect the \nconcerns of all members in the committee's deliberations. This \nmanagers' amendment, and the committee's 18 to 0 vote on Tuesday, \nDecember 12, to report the Start II treaty to the Senate, are examples \nof our potential for the new year. As ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, I pledge to work with our chairman to \naddress the issues before our committee in the new year in a bipartisan \nand constructive manner. Although we have agreed to disagree on many \npolicy issues, we are friends and colleagues with a long-standing \nmutual respect for each other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to register my opposition to \nS. 908, the State Department authorization and reorganization bill. \nBefore I begin briefly to state my reasons, let me compliment both the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and the chairman of the full \ncommittee. I compliment the chairman, my friend from North Carolina, \nfor being a consummate legislative craftsman. He held us hostage very \neffectively for a long time. I do not think we would even be talking \nabout this compromise bill were it not for the fact that the START \nTreaty was held up, that all the ambassadorial nominations were held \nup, and that we asked Senator Kerry on our behalf to see if he could \nfree them up. It reminds me of those buttons we used to have around \nhere when we would have long sessions, ``Free The 89th Congress'' or \nfree this or free that.\n  Well, this was ``free the Ambassadors'' and ``free our national \nsecurity'' so we could have the ability to continue to destroy Soviet \nnuclear weapons and continue the rational arms control regime that was \nbegun with President Nixon and went straight through the administration \nof President Reagan.\n  This is not a backhanded compliment. I think one of the most fierce \nand effective legislative foes one could have in this body is the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina. I do think, however, that \nthe way my friend from North Carolina went about this one was \nunprecedented, and I hope it is not repeated.\n  On that score, I wish to make it clear to my friend from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry, why, after all his hard work, I am still \nopposed to this bill. He did a great job. We are going to have a START \nII Treaty, God willing and the creek not rising, and we are actually \ngoing to put ambassadors out there after the rest of the world wondered \nwhere the devil they were.\n  Let me say at the outset that I admire the skill of both the \ngentlemen who have brought us this agreement. I do not, however, admire \nthe product that has been brought.\n  No one disputes the need to constantly scrutinize our Federal \nbureaucracy to look for overlaps and redundancies and opportunities for \nstreamlining.\n  In this case, though, the three agencies that I will now mention \nwill, in my view, be emasculated by this bill. The Agency for \nInternational Development and the United States Information Agency \neffectively are mandated for closing. Most important in my view is the \nsupreme irony that just as we finally are allowed by the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee to free up the START II Treaty, this \nbill would severely cut the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n  All of the three agencies I have just mentioned have been \nstreamlining themselves and cutting overlapping functions. All three of \nthem have already been taking a good, hard look at their missions and \nhave been responding to changing circumstances.\n  The Agency for International Development, for example, has pioneered \nenterprise funds, which have created \n\n[[Page S18622]]\npartnerships between the private sector and the Government.\n  USIA has attempted to utilize modern information technologies to \nspread the message of the United States to the rest of the world. It \nhas also entered into local partnerships whenever possible to conserve \nfunds.\n  Perhaps the biggest mystery to me is why the advocates of this bill \nthink that the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has outlived its \nusefulness. In the confusion of the current post-cold-war era, the \ndanger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons has dramatically \nincreased, not decreased--I repeat, dramatically increased.\n  Now more than ever, the critical independence of ACDA is needed to \ncounter the natural tendency of the State Department to defer to \nbilateral relationships in sticky situations.\n  Another irony is that those proposing the cuts are the very ones who \nhave been most critical of the State Department for allegedly having an \ninstinct to become captives of the countries with which we deal.\n  ACDA has a proven track record of nonpolitical expertise, which we \ncan ill-afford to lose at this time.\n  The situation at the State Department, which would absorb the \nagencies whose independence is to be sacrificed, is hardly any better. \nMr. President, the Department of State, the principal vehicle for \ncarrying out American foreign policy, has already been forced into \ndebilitating reductions.\n  The international affairs budget is now 45 percent lower in real \nterms than it was in 1984. Altogether it represents only 1.3 percent of \nFederal spending. Over the past 3 years alone, the State Department's \nbudget has been decreased in real terms by 15 percent at the same time \nthe Department's responsibilities have increased with the emergence of \nnew countries in the wake of the breakup of the former Soviet Union. \nMoreover, since 1993 there has been a 30-percent increase in passport \nissuances to U.S. citizens to travel abroad.\n  What has the result been? The State Department has taken the \nfollowing actions to reduce the cost of conducting U.S. diplomatic and \nconsular relations.\n  First, it has cut its total work force by 1,700 persons.\n  It has downsized the Senior Foreign Service by 19 percent. And here, \nMr. President, I submit that we are wasting a precious national \nresource, the kind of expertise built up over the decades that in the \nshort term simply cannot be replicated.\n  It has also reduced overseas allowances.\n  It has cut its administrative expenses by almost $100 million.\n  It has reduced expenditures on diplomatic security by 15 percent. \nAnd, Mr. President, I doubt anyone would claim that we live in a safer \ninternational environment.\n  It has had to cancel, which I find astounding, the 1995 Foreign \nService examinations--I repeat, has had to cancel the 1995 Foreign \nService examinations. That means, of course, that our country is \ncutting off any chance of attracting the best and the brightest of our \ncollege and university graduates into the diplomatic service this year. \nTalk about being penny-wise and pound-foolish. My goodness.\n  The State Department has been forced to slate 19 overseas posts for \nclosure in fiscal year 1996. The list of these posts makes the hair of \nany internationally minded American stand on end. Permit me to \nelaborate a bit on this point, using Zurich, Switzerland, as an \nillustrative example of the folly that congressionally induced budget \nslashing has wrought. Zurich is, of course, Switzerland's largest city \nand its economic and financial center. In fact, it ranks as the world's \nfourth largest financial center. Many American multinational \ncorporations have their regional headquarters there, including Dow, \nKraft, General Motors, and many others. In the other direction, \nSwitzerland was the second largest foreign direct investor in the \nUnited States in 1994.\n  So, Mr. President, what do we do? We close the consulate in Zurich, \nSwitzerland, which does not make a lot of sense. I do not think it is a \nstretch to say that Zurich is a rather important city to American \nbusiness. Apparently other countries also perceive Zurich's central \nposition in international finance and trade; 59 other countries have \nconsulates there. As one might expect, all of the other leading powers \nin the world have representation in Zurich, but smaller nations also \nconsider it in their interest to be represented in Zurich--The Gambia, \nLesotho, Mongolia, Nepal, Rwanda, the Republic of the Seychelles, \nSwaziland, Vanuatu. The list goes on.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to our friends in The Gambia, \nLesotho, Mongolia, Nepal, Rwanda, and so on, I find it rather \nincredible to believe that their governments can somehow find the \nfunding that they need to keep consulates open in Zurich, and the \nUnited States of America, the world's only superpower and largest \neconomic engine in the world, cannot. We cannot find the money to keep \na consulate open in the vitally important city of Zurich, a consulate, \nI might add, that I have never visited.\n  But let me not be too Eurocentric, Mr. President. Another post slated \nfor closing, thanks to congressional budgetary wisdom, is Medan, \nIndonesia. As you know, Indonesia, with a population of over 200 \nmillion people, is the fourth largest country in the world.\n  It is also the largest Moslem-majority nation on Earth. Its economy \noffers numerous opportunities for foreign investment. And Medan, after \nthe capital Jakarta, is Indonesia's most important commercial center.\n  Other countries with consular offices in Medan include Belgium, \nGermany, Great Britain, India, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, \nNorway, the Russia Federation, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sweden, and \nThailand. Why are they there? To do business.\n  So, Mr. President, after we take down the Stars and Stripes and close \nour consulate in Medan, what will happen when an American corporation \neager to break into the Indonesian market goes to Medan? Our American \ncorporate representative can walk down to the the Japanese consulate \nwhere the nice Japanese attache will undoubtedly be happy to help out \nwith business contacts and other valuable information that the American \ncorporation needs.\n  Although this bill is largely a creation of the majority party, there \nis plenty of blame to spread around. I regret to say that the \nadministration, in its zeal to reinvent Government, has aided and \nabetted the feeding frenzy of the small Government ideologues.\n  To be fair, this bill can be viewed as but the logical culmination of \na decade of denigrating the nonmilitary component of American foreign \npolicy. Most of us, this Senator included, have voted for reductions in \none area of foreign policy or another to spare what we deem to be more \nimportant programs.\n  But, Mr. President, this goes overboard. This bill goes far beyond \nwhat we have seen before. Previous cuts in the budget for carrying out \nour foreign policy, whether they were proven correct or not, were at \nleast undertaken with a view toward strengthening the international \nrole of the United States of America.\n  As I have demonstrated earlier, the agencies charged with executing \nour foreign policy have not been ``fat cats'' of the Federal budget, \nunwilling to change. On the contrary, Mr. President, they have absorbed \nmassive cuts up to this point. I repeat, the international affairs \nbudget is already, before we pass this bill, 45 percent in real terms \nbelow what it was in 1984. And as I have said, the State Department, \nUSIA, ACDA, and AID have already implemented severe staff reductions. \nMoreover, we are talking about only 1.3 percent of Federal spending \nhere.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is totally false to assert either that \nour foreign policy agencies have not reformed themselves or that the \nvery carrying out of our foreign policy is a ``big ticket'' item in the \nFederal budget.\n  No, Mr. President, the impetus for this proposed legislation is not \nrooted in demonstrated need. On the contrary, I am sorry to say, the \nbill has its genesis in a strain of isolationist thought that harkens \nback to the 1920's and 1930's, which many of us thought was but an \nunpleasant memory.\n  By imposing crippling budget cuts on three foreign affairs agencies \nthat have served this country well for decades: the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency, the Agency for International Development, and the \nU.S. Information Agency, I think this bill virtually \n\n[[Page S18623]]\nassures their demise. That is part of the bill's purpose.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the State Department, which would inherit \nthe remains of those agencies, would itself be forced into yet another \nround of devastating cuts. Some of those consequences, as I have \nearlier indicated, would be absurdly funny were they not so tragic.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents backdoor isolationism pure and \nsimple. At a time when international affairs has become more complex, \nits passage would signal to the world an American desire to simplify \nwhat cannot be simplified.\n  Combined with Republican-mandated cuts in the already meager foreign \nassistance budget, this bill would lead ineluctably in a few years to a \nsituation in which the American President would have little choice in \nan international crisis between doing nothing and sending in the \nmilitary. This bill, I believe, is the worst kind of ideologically-\ndriven false economy. It is a dressed-up isolationist exercise. It is \nnot worthy of a country that claims the mantle of world leadership.\n  I know that many of my colleagues share my deep misgivings about this \nCongress' evident desire to shrink America's international role. \nOpposition to this bill offers an opportunity to reassert the \ncentrality of America's involvement in the world. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in voting against S. 908.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am not going to debate the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware. I will say, he has a very selective memory. And \nlike all of us, I suppose he remembers things that have not happened. \nBut that is all right. The Senator forgot, for example, to mention the \ncontinuous efforts on our part to persuade the administration to engage \nin negotiations.\n  On August 11 of this year I had persuaded, through a friend in the \nWhite House, the White House to have the President invite me and our \nstaff to the White House to brief the President on our legislative \nproposal. What it in fact proposed and what the critics of it said it \nwould propose were two different things.\n  President Clinton was entirely gracious when we arrived. We did not \nmeet him on the first floor. He took us up to the family quarters. And \nwe spent 1 hour and 20 minutes demonstrating the details of the \nproposal. Vice President Gore was there, as was the Secretary of State, \nthe White House Chief of Staff, and the Deputy National Security \nAdviser. I sat between the President and the Vice President, as a \nmatter of fact. Several times during the briefing the President leaned \nover to me and said, ``Who could be against that? Who could be against \nthat?'' disclosing clearly that he had not been informed about what the \nbill in fact proposed and now proposes.\n  Acting in his name had been a concert of the bureaucrats heading the \nthree agencies, the three agencies that five Secretaries of State, plus \nWarren Christopher, the President's Secretary of State, had stipulated \nought to be abolished and folded into the State Department because they \nhad become anachronisms of a bygone era.\n  Senator Biden is also wrong about this bill having anything to do \nwith the cancellation of the Foreign Service examination. The closing \nof diplomatic missions was not only a recommendation of the last two \nadministrations, as I said in my opening remarks, but also of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  So it is unfair--and I know that the Senator from Delaware does not \nintend to be unfair--but he is following the same line that the news \nmedia have followed from the very beginning.\n  Why did five former Secretaries of State help us draft this bill and \npublicly endorse it? Why did the present Secretary of State go down to \nthe White House and propose, in large measure or in some measure, what \nwe are proposing with this S. 908? Those are things that the Senator \nfrom Delaware just smooths over. And I know he does not intend to be \nunfair because he is a fair individual. He and I came to the Senate the \nsame day.\n  This bill is intended to strengthen the Secretary of State \norganizationally speaking. Warren Christopher wanted it done but he was \nrebuffed. Now, if you disagree with Mr. Christopher, that is your \nbusiness, I will say to the able Senator from Delaware. But the fact \nis, there have been changes in this world, as I tried to emphasize in \nmy own remarks. And the U.S. foreign policy apparatus must change with \nthe times.\n  Let me address a statement that is so often made by the State \nDepartment and various others and political operatives who support the \nstatus quo. Senator Kerry said over and over again in his remarks that \nspending on the U.S. foreign affairs budget takes up only 1 percent of \nthe Federal budget, I believe he said 1 percent. Well, the 1.3 is \ncorrect, but it is not incorrect to say that that is what is spent on \noperating the foreign policy apparatus because the foreign policy \napparatus reaches out and utilizes the rest of Government, and the cost \nof what they reach out and get greatly increases that figure because \nthe 1.3 does not include spending on foreign policy objectives from our \ndomestic accounts. That figure does not include the money usurped from \nthe Department of Defense. I mentioned the $2 billion spent on Somalia. \nI mentioned the nearly $2 billion that has been spent on Haiti, thus \nfar, and much more is going to be spent in Haiti before we are through.\n\n  The Lord only knows how much is going to be spent in and on Bosnia; \n$2 or $3 billion has been mentioned. It is going to be at least that \nmuch, and probably substantially more. Thirty-two Federal agencies run \nalmost $2 billion in international exchanges every year. The point is, \nthe American people must not be deceived or misled into believing that \nwe only spend 1.3 percent, or 1 percent, of the Federal budget on our \nforeign policy. It simply is not so, and that deception ought to be \nbrought to an end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I do not want to get into a debate with my \nfriend, and there is nothing personal about what I said. Let me \nreiterate what I actually said. My criticism and compliment to my \nfriend from North Carolina was not that he was original in what he has \ndone, in the sense that he had support from like-minded former \nSecretaries, or even, at one time, from the present Secretary, or \nperhaps even from the President. My comments related not to him--it is \nnot what he proposed but the fact that he denied us our ability to \ndispose of ambassadorial nominations and the START II Treaty.\n  My disagreement is not only with him on this legislation. I also \nmentioned the Secretary of State when we were referring to the State \nDepartment and the President of the United States. I think, with all \ndue respect, all the supporters of this effort are being shortsighted. \nSo the chairman is not alone in what I characterize as \n``shortsightedness'' as it relates to what our policy should be. My \nreference to him was explicitly for his unique ability to fashion a way \nto get his point across in this case, which was by denying us the \nability to dispose of the START II T treaty and dispose of \nambassadorial nominations, all of which were ready to go. I \ncomplimented him on his ingenuity.\n  I have tried to learn from him. We have been here together since \nJanuary 1973, and I have watched him, and Democratic predecessors, like \nthe deceased Senator Jim Allen, and others, use their great skills to \nbe able to get the results that they sought. I compliment him on it, \nbut I think it is the wrong way to do it. I think it was a high price \nto be paid in order to get agreement.\n  So I want to be clear. He was not original in his notion that we \nshould cut these consulates. He joined other, I think, wrong-headed \nproposals to close them. My reference to him was explicitly that I hope \nwe do not have a repetition of shutting down the business of the \ncommittee while we arrive at a conclusion that is satisfactory to \nwhoever the chairman is then.\n  The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island has announced his \nretirement. The Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from \nDelaware are seeking reelection. The Lord only knows, and our \nconstituents know, whether both of us will be back, and the odds are \nthat he may be back as chairman. But it is also possible that the \nSenator from Delaware may be back as chairman of the committee. \n\n[[Page S18624]]\n That is the only reference that I was making. It seems to me that what \nhe did was legal use, in a senatorial sense, of the power of \nchairmanship, but I think unprecedented and, I hope, not to be \nrepeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. It is not a violation of the rules, and it is not \nundesirable unless the other guy is doing it to you. I remember when \nthe other side was in the majority, with a different chairmanship. I \nmust say that Senator Pell has always been a thoroughbred gentlemen. I \nhave said that in many public forums, and I think he knows I mean it. I \nhope that some may later on think that I am a gentleman, too.\n  But I am interested in getting the job done. I reiterate, as I said \nat the very outset this afternoon, that this could have been handled \nmonths ago if the other side had been willing only to let the Senate \nspeak on the bill. But, no, no, the first day when it came up, they \nbrought out Mr. Kennedy from Massachusetts to speak for 1 hour and 20 \nminutes on the minimum wage. Some things are hard to understand. But I \nfigured out, after a while, that they were filibustering, that they did \nnot want the Senate to speak its mind on this bill. It began there. But \nif we had had a vote, no Ambassador would have been held up. And if we \nlet the Senate function as it is intended to function from now on, no \nAmbassador will be held up in the future.\n  I am going to use every technique that comes to my mind to try to do \nthe best I can for my country. Now, if the Senator wants to talk about \nwhat it costs to operate the foreign policy establishment, we can get \ninto details like, why did the United States State Department, or the \nforeign aid apparatus, have 600 people stationed in Cairo, Egypt, alone \nto give away money? Since I brought it up, they have reduced, somewhat, \nthe number of people in AID, the Agency for International Development, \nstationed in Cairo. It is something over 400 now. But they did not do a \ncotton-picking thing about it until I began talking about it in this \nbill. I am going to do the best I can for what I believe in, and I know \nthe Senator from Delaware feels the same way about it. We will do the \nbest we can together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me say that the way this situation \ndeveloped is, the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, reported from the committee a \nreorganization bill on a 10-8 vote, a straight party-line vote. There \nwas no bipartisanship on that issue. He then sought to bring that bill \nup on the floor and was not able to get 60 votes in order to invoke \ncloture. Now, pushing the other side to invoke cloture is not a tactic \nstrange or unfamiliar to the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. \nHe is one of its more avid practitioners here in the Senate.\n  So I am not moved by the fact that his measure, in effect, was \nblocked because they were unable to produce the 60-vote margin. They \ntried to do it and fell short on two occasions. Not having been able to \nget his way on this important substantive matter about which there were \ngreat divisions, a lot of strong feelings, and a lot of differing views \nabout what was appropriate, the Senator from North Carolina proceeded \nto take the ambassadorial nominees hostage. He shut down the work of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is the \nchairman, holding up such important matters as the START II treaty and \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  In other words, because he could not get his way on a substantive \nmatter, he then refused for 4 months to allow the committee to carry \nout its functions and responsibilities. We were not able to do any \nbusiness--no legislation, no nominations, no treaties. This is hostage-\ntaking par excellence.\n  Then we are being told, you have to negotiate. The United States says \nto the world, if you take our people hostage we will not negotiate \nunder those circumstances. We will not be coerced that way.\n  Now, I have never, in the time I have served here, encountered \nanything comparable to what has occurred in this instance, in terms of \ngrinding the whole range of work to a halt--particularly by the \nchairman of a committee, which, after all, carries with it certain \nimportant responsibilities.\n  I remember the former chairman of the committee was on the floor when \nthe Middle East Peace Facilitation Act was being subjected to this very \ntactic to which I made reference. It was like a rolling snowball. \nAnything that came along, the Senator from North Carolina encompassed \nwithin his rolling snowball and sought to hold hostage in order to \nincrease his leverage to get his way on the reorganization measure.\n  So we encountered this with respect to the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act, in addition to holding the ambassadors hostage, in \naddition to these treaties that were left to languish, in addition to \nwhatever legislation was in the committee. In fact, at that time the \nformer chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland, said, ``I absolutely agree it is inappropriate to link MEPFA to \nthe State Department legislation. I do not recall in the years I have \nbeen in the Senate, 35, or as chairman of the committee, any similar \naction being taken.''\n  I then said, ``Will the chairman yield on that point? When did the \nformer chairman, if I may say, the very distinguished former chairman, \ngo on the Foreign Relations Committee?'' Mr. Pell said, ``I think it \nwas 1964.'' And I asked, ``So the Senator has been on it more than \nthree decades?'' And Senator Pell said, ``Correct.'' And I inquired, \n``Has my colleague ever seen anything comparable to what is now taking \nplace?'' Senator Pell said, ``No, and that is the point that bothers \nme.'' I said, ``I thank the Senator,'' and Senator Pell went on to say:\n\n       I think we should deal with the question of extension of \n     MEPFA on its merits and the merits clearly lie with the quick \n     passage of the short-term extension. We should not, as \n     Senator Kerry noted, trifle with the peace process for the \n     sake of reorganizing our bureaucracy. We should pass the \n     MEPFA now with no linkage. In this regard, I am particularly \n     struck by the words of the Senator from Maryland. I know I am \n     correct in saying I am the only former Foreign Service \n     officer in the Senate. Because the Foreign Service was only \n     created in 1926 under the Rogers Act, I think I am the only \n     Foreign Service officer ever to have served in the Senate. I \n     would also point out this linkage that is being created by \n     the chairman of the committee not only sets a bad precedent \n     but is a linkage that should never have been made in the \n     first instance. It has not been done in the past, and it \n     would be a great sin to move this way now.\n\n  Now, I agree completely with those remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island. The Senator from North Carolina, unable to \nget the votes to invoke cloture--a process, as I indicated earlier, he \nhas used himself repeatedly on the floor of the Senate--then decided to \nuse that bill as leverage. He was saying, in effect, ``I will take \nevery other aspect of business of the committee hostage. No \nambassadors, no treaties, no legislation, no Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act. You will have to come to terms with me on this \nreorganization.''\n  Now, looking at the national interests of the United States, the fact \nof the matter is that ambassadors and treaties, which are important to \nour Nation's interests and upon which we should have been acting, were \ndelayed over the controversy with respect to this legislation.\n  Now, I understand the Senator wants his reorganization bill. A number \nof us disagree with that. Fine, I am ready to fight out that issue on \nthat legislation. But, to change the pressures, to increase the \nleverage, he decided instead to do a hostage-taking action, which is \nexactly what occurred here.\n  Over the past 6 months there has been a long and growing list of \nambassadorial nominees--currently 19--who had their hearings and were \nready to be reported. Many of them had their hearings in July and have \nbeen waiting since then--it is now December--to be approved by the \nSenate. Meanwhile, the countries to which they would go have no \nAmerican ambassadors on the scene, no heads of mission, no one \ncoordinating the American presence in that country. Now, most of these \nambassadors were career members of the Foreign Service, people who have \ncommitted themselves to serving our Nation in these very important \nways. Mr. President, 15 of the 19 are career officers. They included \nnominees for a number of major posts, including Malaysia, Cambodia, \nThailand, Indonesia, \n\n[[Page S18625]]\nPakistan, Oman, Lebanon, and South Africa. Our former distinguished \ncolleague, Jim Sasser, was nominated to go to China. Our relationships \nwith all these countries have been suffering because we have no U.S. \nambassadors there.\n  Why are the ambassadors not there? Not because questions are being \nraised about a particular ambassador and his or her qualifications, \nwhich of course is a legitimate reason. If someone is holding up an \nambassador on the floor of the Senate because they do not think that \nperson is qualified, or because of some other difficulty directly \nrelated to the nominee, that is a fight that ought to be fought with \nrespect to that ambassador. None of that has happened here. No one was \nasserting that any of these ambassadors had any deficiency. They were \nall being held as a pressure tactic on the reorganization bill.\n  Hundreds of Foreign Service officers recommended for promotion were \nalso being held up. These are career people. They have committed \nthemselves to the Foreign Service. There is an established process by \nwhich they move forward within the Foreign Service. The promotion list \ncomes to the Senate and we act on it. Yet all of them were being held \nup.\n  Obviously, this is an unfair situation to the individual nominees, \nwho have absolutely nothing to do with the reorganization proposal by \nthe Senator from North Carolina. In addition to being unfair to the \nnominees and their families, it is contrary to the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  We need to have our ambassadors out there in the field promoting U.S. \ninterests such as human rights, conflict resolution, antiterrorism, \ncounternarcotics cooperation, and increasing U.S. exports. We need them \nthere to respond to incidents before they become crises, to assist U.S. \ntourists and business people, to promote U.S. goodwill, and to spread \nAmerican values and ideals. The fact that they are not there and have \nnot been there for a number of months causes friction in our diplomatic \nrelations and erodes and undercuts the ability of the United States to \ninfluence developments around the world.\n  Mr. President, I am further concerned because I think that taking \npeople hostage this way is yet another attack on the career Foreign \nService, which is extremely unfortunate. In fact, we received a letter \nback in August from the American Academy of Diplomacy with respect to \nthe ambassadors that were being held up. Let me just quote that letter, \nwhich was written to Chairman Helms of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Academy has noted, according to \n     press reports of August 2, that following a deadlock in the \n     Senate on the State Department authorization bill, a hold \n     would be placed on 17 ambassadorial nominations and that \n     committee action was being canceled or postponed on 22 other \n     nominations subject to Senate confirmation.\n       The Academy has taken no position on the authorization bill \n     which is currently in contention. But it does not believe the \n     country's larger interests are served by linking action on \n     that bill to the ambassadorial nomination process. Doing so \n     would have the United States without appropriate \n     representation in these countries at a time of dramatic, \n     historic global change.\n       We believe that decisions on America's diplomatic \n     representation abroad, including both the timing of such \n     action and the qualifications of those nominated, should be \n     made strictly on the basis of our interests in the country \n     involved.\n\n  Frankly, I think this willingness to make pawns out of ambassadorial \nnominees, most of whom, as I indicated, are career people, is a \ndenigration of the career service.\n  I am increasingly concerned about the extent to which that is taking \nplace and is engaged in by some of my colleagues.\n  At an earlier time, the Senator from Texas asserted that he favored \ndeep cuts in spending for diplomatic activities to curb the \ndepartment's alleged penchant for ``building marble palaces and renting \nlong coats and high hats.''\n  Such an attack on our professionals is extremely unfair. They in fact \nare risking their lives. Some are losing their lives. Yet, we have \nMembers of this body who attack them for supposedly wearing long coats \nand high hats and living in marble houses.\n  Ambassador Robert Frasure, who had so much to do with moving the \nefforts toward peace forward in the Balkans, lost his life in Bosnia. \nAs the State Department spokesman put it, when Ambassador Frasure was \nkilled ``he was riding in an armored personnel carrier and wearing a \nflak jacket, not striped pants.''\n  Ambassador Frasure's widow wrote a very moving letter to the \nWashington Post, in the course of which she said, in defense of her \nhusband--it should have never been necessary for her to have to defend \nhim--but in the course of which she said:\n\n       Our diplomats are some of the finest, bravest, most \n     courageous people I have ever met. In the past 10 years \n     alone, my husband and I mourned the death of seven of our \n     friends and Embassy colleagues.\n\n  She then listed them, and went on to comment about the remarks about \nlong coats and high hats and marble palaces:\n\n       I am outraged also because I remember the dangers as well \n     as the many hardships our family endured in Bob's 20-year \n     career.\n\n  That is from a very moving letter by Katharina Frasure, the widow of \nambassador Robert Frasure who came to his untimely and much-grieved \ndeath in Bosnia.\n  In fact, over the past 25 years more American ambassadors than \ngenerals have been killed in the line of duty.\n  So I think we ought to treat the Foreign Service with a greater \nmeasure of respect. Holding up ambassadors for reasons unrelated to \ntheir qualifications or their mission is not the way we ought to be \ndoing business here. And I regret that these able men and women were \nheld hostage in order to increase the pressure and the leverage with \nrespect to an unrelated piece of legislation.\n  In addition to the ambassadors, he also held hostage some very \nimportant treaties--the START II treaty and the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. We passed amendments and resolutions right here on the \nSenate floor expressing our desire to see these treaties ratified and \nimplemented at the earliest possible date.\n  As Spurgeon Keeney, the head of the Arms Control Association, \nrecently wrote:\n\n       Failure to complete Senate action promptly could delay for \n     years the entry into force of these agreements with great \n     disadvantage to U.S. security.\n\n  U.S. security is being disadvantaged by this holdup. The START II \ntreaty, from all testimony and from all analysis, clearly serves our \nnational interest. It is a very important measure in terms of reducing \nthe nuclear arsenal, and bringing the nuclear danger under greater \ncontrol. Yet, that treaty has been held up over this reorganization \nissue.\n  Let me turn to the substance of this bill. I understand that the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, labored under \na very difficult assignment and under very trying circumstances. He has \nreceived a lot of unfair criticism, much of it from the other side. He \nwas praised today, but along the way he was sharply criticized, which I \nthink was very unfair to him.\n  The authorization levels in this legislation, in my judgment, impose \nsuch deep cuts in administrative expenses that we run the risk of \nhaving, as the American Foreign Service Association said, ``hollowed-\nout agencies''. They argued in a letter to the members of the committee \nthat actually what was happening was a shift from streamlining agencies \nto hollowing-out agencies. And they then make the point, and I quote:\n\n       It makes little sense to AFSA that at a time when American \n     leadership and ideas are needed and welcomed throughout the \n     world, we would undercut our ability to operate abroad. Lack \n     of adequate funds and staff to actively represent its \n     national interests abroad send the wrong message. The costs \n     of fighting totalitarianism during World War II and the Cold \n     War were extremely high. Having won those wars, we cannot now \n     afford to turn our back on the world or sacrifice our hard-\n     fought victories by failing to adequately fund diplomacy--our \n     country's first, most cost effective, and least risky line of \n     defense in these dangerous times.\n\n  The amount authorized here for diplomatic and consular programs at \nthe State Department is $30 million below the level in the Commerce-\nJustice-State appropriations conference report, $60 million below the \nadministration's request. These are funds needed to assist American \ntravelers abroad, to process visas, to keep open consulates, conduct \ndiplomatic affairs.\n  Funding for salaries and expenses at USIA is also cut drastically. \nThe same \n\n[[Page S18626]]\nis true at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and at the Agency \nfor International Development.\n  In my view, the cuts being proposed here are excessive and will \nresult in impeding our ability to carry out U.S. foreign policy \neffectively overseas. I agree with the American Foreign Service \nAssociation's assessment that these cuts will lead to hollowed out \nagencies at the very time, with the end of the cold war, that there is \nan opportunity for the skillful and effective use of diplomacy. At the \nvery time when American leadership and ideas are needed and welcomed \nthroughout the world, we would undercut our ability to operate abroad.\n  I think this is an important issue. People get up on the floor and \nthey make speeches about America's leadership in the world. Then they \nfail to provide the wherewithal, or the resources with which to \nexercise that leadership. Many seem to think that leadership only \nexists in the military sphere, not recognizing the important \naccomplishments that can be done in the political and diplomatic \nsphere, and the interaction between the political and diplomatic sphere \nand the military sphere.\n  In addition to these funding levels, which I think are a very basic \nfailing with this legislation, there are other substantive provisions \nthat remain deeply troubling. One section requires massive RIF's by \nUSIA and AID in 1996 and 1997; in one instance by more than 50 percent. \nThat, in effect, would finish the Agency. There has been no study of \nconsequence to support the effort to abolish these agencies that is at \nall comparable with the studies that were made in establishing the \nagencies to begin with. If one goes back and looks at the process of \nanalysis that was made when the decision was made to establish these \nagencies, and the rationale that was given--much of which I think \nremains valid, but if you want to argue that, fine--but there is no \ncomparable counterpresentation to support eliminating the agencies.\n  Actually, there was a commission that recommended AID be eliminated, \nand now the head of that commission is in favor of keeping it, \nparticularly on the basis of the very significant reforms that have \nbeen made at AID under its present administrator, Brian Atwood.\n  This legislation places onerous new conditions on our participation \nin the United Nations. It requires the withholding of 20 percent of our \ncontributions to the United Nations, 50 percent of our contributions \nfor assessed peacekeeping, and 100 percent of our contributions for \nvoluntary peacekeeping, until an extensive list of certifications is \nmade. The United States, unfortunately--I regret to say this--is now \nthe largest deadbeat at the United Nations in terms of meeting its \nobligations. Yet we repeatedly turn to the United Nations in order to \naccomplish important objectives, in Cambodia, Angola, El Salvador, and \non and on around the world. We should not forget that the United \nNations cannot take any significant action if the United States does \nnot concur with it because we can simply veto it in the Security \nCouncil.\n  There is a also very troubling provision in section 604 relating to \nIraqi claims. This is a complicated issue. It has been the source of \nintensive negotiations, but it has very serious national implications.\n  Briefly, the situation is as follows. When Iraq invaded Kuwait, the \nUnited States froze all Iraq's assets in United States banks. The \nnumber of claims on those assets from U.S. veterans and business people \nfar exceeds the amount of the frozen funds. Yet there is a provision in \nthis legislation to allow a small group of claimants to come in and get \n100 percent of their money, leaving less available for the veterans and \nother businesses who have equally valid claims. There will not be \nenough money left to go around for the rest of these people.\n  The Bankers Association for Foreign Trade wrote, calling the amended \nlanguage ``bad public policy.'' They oppose it ``not only because it \nwould give preference to a small, select group of unsecured creditors \nas against others similarly situated. More importantly, it would \ninevitably increase the cost of trade finance for U.S. exporters \nrelative to their foreign competitors.''\n  I close by again expressing my respects to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for his hard work. I think the managers' amendment is an \nimprovement to the bill itself. I do not for a moment contest that. But \nI still think that overall, this legislation is heading in the wrong \ndirection. It may be less bad, and a lot of very skillful work was done \nby the Senator from Massachusetts to bring that about. It was an \nassignment, in effect, handed to him, to which I think he responded \nwith great skill. But I do not think that this legislation warrants our \nsupport.\n  There is every expectation when it goes to conference it will only \nget worse. The House bill with which it will be conferenced includes a \nwhole host of objectionable provisions.\n  So, in closing, I have a number of letters, some of which I will have \nprinted in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. The various private voluntary organizations that are \nengaged in overseas development, Bread for the World, Oxfam, \nInterAction, and other similar groups, all indicate their opposition to \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Oxfam America Urges Rejection of S. 908\n\n       As a privately funded development agency, Oxfam America \n     supports self-help projects to combat hunger and poverty in \n     31 countries of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the \n     Caribbean. At the same time we believe it is very important \n     that the US Agency for International Development maintain its \n     ability to offer significant support for poverty alleviation, \n     basic infrastructure, demining and health programs which are \n     beyond the financial capacity of non-governmental \n     organizations and which can determine the long-term success \n     of smaller NGO efforts like those of our local partner \n     organizations.\n       For these reasons Oxfam America is seriously concerned that \n     under S. 908, the State Department authorization bill, USAID \n     will share a five-year budget cut of $935 million with the \n     State Department's other two independent agencies. Although \n     we understand that this budget formula was devised as an \n     alternative to a mandated merging of the three independent \n     agencies, we fear that such cuts, on top of current year \n     reductions, will destroy the US commitment to offer a \n     meaningful level of fundamental development assistance to the \n     poorest countries.\n       Further, we are aware that passage of S. 908 will result in \n     conference with H.R. 1561--a bill which incorporates a \n     foreign aid authorization for the first time since 1985. We \n     understand that in addition to a 30 percent across-the-board \n     cut in development assistance, H.R. 1561 includes many \n     regressive foreign aid authorization measures. With passage \n     of S. 908, the Senate would therefore face compromise with \n     such provisions without ever having debated and passed its \n     own foreign aid authorization legislation.\n       From Oxfam America's perspective, S. 908 poses an \n     unacceptable threat to the United States' ability to \n     significantly reduce hunger, misery and human \n     underdevelopment as the 21st century dawns.\n       Oxfam America urges senators to vote against the passage of \n     S. 908.\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n\n                                 National Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 1995.\n\n      Vote No to S. 908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act\n\n       National Wildlife Federation opposes S. 908, The Foreigns \n     Revitalization Act because:\n       The US cannot continue to call itself a world leader if it \n     passes this Bill. Humanitarian and environmental assistance \n     are investments in the future. They have consistently paid \n     off for the US in the past, and have been vital to \n     maintaining the US as the leader of the free world. As the US \n     withdraws from development assistance, its standing in the \n     international community, its influence in multilateral \n     organizations, its voice and vote will be worth less and \n     less. For altruistic and for self-interested reasons, we need \n     to stay engaged in the world. Foreign aid is a crucial part \n     of this engagement.\n       It would cripple the US Agency for International \n     Development. The latest compromise offered by Senator Helms \n     would necessitate such heavy cuts to programs and operating \n     expenses at the US Agency for International Development that \n     even if it continues in existence it will be unable to carry \n     out its mission. This will signal to the international \n     community that the US shrugs off its commitments to poverty \n     alleviation around the world, to building democracy and to \n     conserving natural resources. The US will be diminished by \n     this withdrawal from the developing world, and our long-term \n     interests will suffer.\n       The bill micro-manages US foreign policy. Although the \n     compromise version would not mandate a reorganization of \n     USAID, the savings goal of $1.7 billion in five years with \n     only 15% coming from State Department means that USAID will \n     have to be sacrificed. \n\n[[Page S18627]]\n     This sort of reorganization is the prerogative of the Executive branch.\n       The House companion Bill, HR 1561 is unacceptable for many \n     reasons, including draconian cuts to sustainable development \n     programs, the inclusion of the Mexico City Policy, and \n     elimination of funds for the InterAmerican and African \n     Development Foundations. The passage of S. 908 increases the \n     likelihood that provisions of HR 1561 would become law.\n       Vote ``No'' on S. 908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization \n     Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          Bread for the World,\n\n                             Silver Spring, MD, November 21, 1995.\n     Senator Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: As the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee proceeds in negotiations over a manager's amendment \n     to S 908, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995, \n     Bread for the World urges you not to make any deal that would \n     force the merger of the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development into the State Department or otherwise severely \n     weaken its capacity to carry out long-term development.\n       We are concerned that the committee has agreed to terms \n     which, even without directly eliminating USAID, might \n     indirectly accomplish this end by requiring a $1.7 billion \n     cut to administrative costs over five years. Because cuts to \n     the State Department would be limited to 15 percent, or $255 \n     million, the burden of the budget cuts will fall heavily on \n     USAID, the agency with the largest operating and program \n     budget among the three agencies in question. Such deep cuts \n     could cripple USAID's ability to manage programs, maintain an \n     overseas field presence, and exercise leadership in the donor \n     community. They would also yield greater authority on aid \n     decisions to the State Department, thus subordinating long-\n     term efforts to reduce hunger and poverty to short-term \n     political pressures. Furthermore, the agreement encourages \n     Senator Helms in his strategy to hold foreign policy matters, \n     however urgent, hostage to his demands.\n       We ask you to raise these concerns with Senator Kerry and \n     to vote against S 908 when it comes before the full Senate. \n     It is important to have a strong show of opposition to the \n     bill, even if it passes, since a large margin of victory \n     would eliminate the possibility of a Presidential veto.\n       Although Bread for the World adamantly opposes \n     reorganization proposals that compromise USAID's \n     independence, we have long supported reform that would \n     improve the quality and efficiency of U.S. development aid in \n     reducing poverty and promoting fair, democratic development. \n     The agency has made significant progress toward this goal \n     under current Administrator Brian Atwood. Yet the task is far \n     from complete. Thus, we urge the committee to exercise \n     greater oversight over USAID's internal reform initiatives.\n       Finally, we encourage the committee to return to the \n     critical task of redefining the broad purposes of U.S. \n     foreign aid for the post-Cold War world, rather than to focus \n     simply on slashing foreign aid budgets and eliminating aid \n     agencies. Last year, the committee, under your able \n     leadership, made significant headway in rewriting the 1961 \n     Foreign Assistance Act. Regrettably, the process was never \n     concluded. But far-reaching global economic and political \n     changes and recurring crises demand that it not be further \n     delayed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David Beckmann,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          Bankers' Association for\n\n\n                                                Foreign Trade,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 13, 1995.\n\n                Position Paper on Section 604 of S. 908\n\n       The Committee's final proposed version of Section 604 of S. \n     908 does not mitigate the threat to U.S. exports implicit in \n     this special interest legislation.\n       The current version of Section 604 continues to change \n     established letter of credit law and practice by proposing to \n     grant holders of advised letters of credit the status of \n     secured creditors, which under present letter of credit law \n     inures only to holders of confirmed letters of credit.\n       This outcome is bad public policy not only because it would \n     give preference to a small, select group of unsecured \n     creditors as against others similarly situated. More \n     importantly, it would inevitably increase the cost of trade \n     finance for U.S. exporters relative to their foreign \n     competitors.\n       This unfortunate result flows from the fact that even in \n     its final form, Section 604 sets the damaging precedent of \n     giving advised letters of credit holders the same security \n     status as holders of confirmed letters of credit.\n       If banks are forced by Section 604 to face unanticipated \n     risks by issuing advised letters of credit, they will have to \n     charge more for this method of trade finance to guard against \n     similar loss in the future. The increase in cost will be \n     substantial and would be an added burden for U.S. exporters \n     that their overseas competitors will not have to pay.\n       This is why the Treasury Department continues to oppose \n     Section 604 and has stated so for the record. It is also why \n     OMB has indicated its opposition on behalf of the \n     Administration.\n       Trying to find a compromise version on Section 604 is like \n     trying to compromise the difference between certified checks \n     and ordinary checks. The only solution is to delete the \n     provision from the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Wyoming is waiting, \nand I will just take a couple of quick moments, if I may.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Please.\n  Mr. KERRY. First of all, I thank the Senator from Maryland for his \nkind comments about the difficult task with respect to this. He has \nbeen there before many times on a number of pieces of legislation. \nThere is nobody more skilled than the Senator from Maryland at dealing \nwith that.\n  I think the comments from the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom Delaware are extremely important. As manager for this side, I in \nno way dismiss or diminish the concerns that they have expressed. Those \nconcerns underscore the difficulties that not only we faced in getting \nhere, but they also make very, very clear the limitations on where we \ncan travel in the course of the conference. I want to underscore that \nto my colleagues.\n  If this legislation moves in any way in the direction that the \nSenator from Maryland and Delaware have described, then this Senator is \ngoing to be disposed to find great difficulty in not only passing a \nconference report but, if a conference report comes to the Senate, in \nseeing this legislation pass the Senate. That is a very large hurdle \nindeed which it yet faces.\n  So it is my hope we will work to continue the process of improving \nit. I have that assurance from the Senator from North Carolina. It is \nwith that understanding and hope--``hope springs eternal,'' for at \nleast this Senator--it is my hope we will be able to continue improving \nthis legislation as we go forward from here, and I look forward to \ndoing that.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Does the Senator from North Carolina yield time to the Senator from \nWyoming?\n  Mr. HELMS. I certainly do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Carolina. I \nwill not transgress greatly on the time remaining to him.\n  Let me speak clearly, I hope, on an issue which is, I think, very \ncritical, and it comes up in the House version of this legislation and \nat this level with regard to the present legislation.\n  I call to my colleagues' attention a front-page article in the \nNovember 4 issue of the Washington Times, a piece by Michael Hedges \ndescribing a pattern of the most serious abuse in the admission of \nrefugees under the so-called Lautenberg amendment.\n  First, let me say my friend, Senator Frank Lautenberg, is a very able \nlegislator, a friend, a person I very much enjoy working with. I have \ntried to resist this legislation from its inception. But, nevertheless, \nthe Senate felt we should go forward. And now it has been for more than \n6 years since the so-called Lautenberg amendment first provided a very \ndramatic exception to the definition of a refugee in the Refugee Act of \n1980.\n  The Refugee Act of 1980 was sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy of \nMassachusetts. I was rather new on the scene in those years and found \nit to be a great learning experience to watch it crafted, to see what \noccurred as it was put on the statute books.\n  The provision of the law, the Lautenberg amendment, created a \npresumption--now, this may be inside baseball and I know how that works \nin this place, but this is big-time understanding. If we cannot get \nthis understood by the American people, we will not get it unraveled.\n  The provision provided a presumption of refugee status for certain \ngroups in the Soviet Union--this is the former Soviet Union--who \n``assert'' a claim of persecution or discrimination and that would make \nthem a ``refugee.'' That has been now extended three times since 1989 \nand is due to sunset at the end of this fiscal year, September 30, \n1996.\n  In the House-passed State Department reauthorization, there is yet a \nfurther 2-year extension of the so-called Lautenberg amendment. When I \nspeak of the amendment, I do not speak of its sponsor, I speak of its \nintent and what has happened with it. \n\n[[Page S18628]]\n\n  What we have now is the fact there is no longer any Soviet Union. \nThey are our finest friends, the former Soviet Union. So we are going \nto continue now, according to the House version, this rather \nembarrassing mockery of our refugee laws until the end of fiscal year \n1998.\n  The Soviet immigration program has become terribly distorted. There \nis even evidence that Russian mafia members and other criminals are now \nbeginning to use this system, and why would they not? It is in \ndisarray. But, most importantly, Mr. President, how in the world can we \nexplain our posturing around the world about our rare and wonderful \nfriendship and alliance with the present Russian Government and the \npresent independent states and the Commonwealth and the present \naffection between President Yeltsin and President Clinton--and we do \nthat everyday--while pretending in some cruel way that somehow people \ncoming out of there are still refugees? That cannot fit. It simply \nmakes absolutely no sense. But, of course, it would not be the first \ntime in this remarkable city.\n\n  I would not suggest in any possible way that we are forgetting the \nlessons of the past or the persecution of Jews in the former Soviet \nUnion and throughout the world or the lessons of the Holocaust, but \nplease know--and if we cannot understand this, we are all in trouble--\nplease know that each and every one of those people will be processed \non a case-by-case basis in an orderly way, all in accordance with the \n1980 Refugee Act, the creation of Senator Kennedy and other innovative \nlegislators, and a piece of very humane and responsible legislation.\n  What does it do? It provides that if one is a refugee--that is a \nperson fleeing persecution or having a well-founded fear of persecution \nbased on race, religion, national origin, membership in a political \norganization or social group--a very clear description; it is the U.S. \ndescription; it is the U.N. description. Such a person would then be \ndesignated as a refugee and that would be done on a case-by-case basis.\n  All of those in the former Soviet Union, whether they be Jews or \nPentecostals, Christians, Evangelicals, or persons persecuted for their \npolitical views, will have the same opportunity as all other true \nrefugees around this world to enter the United States as a refugee. But \nthe Lautenberg amendment and that program must end.\n  With absurdities like this being extended year after year, it is no \nwonder that people scoff at our immigration and refugee laws. Let us \nend it now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 4, 1995]\n\n    Vast Soviet Refugee Fraud Detailed--INS Memos Catalog Misuse of \n                          Lautenberg Amendment\n\n                          (By Michael Hedges)\n\n       A U.S. policy of granting refugee status to Jews, \n     Pentecostals and other religious minorities in the Soviet \n     Union and its successor states has been widely abused, \n     according to confidential government documents.\n       Internal Immigration and Naturalization Service memos \n     indicate that by 1993 only about 0.5 percent of those \n     entering the United States as refugees under the Lautenberg \n     Amendment met the classic persecution requirements.\n       As early as 1991, INS officials in Moscow detailed serious \n     problems with the amendment, which gave religious minorities \n     refugee status, putting them ahead of the millions seeking to \n     immigrate to the United States.\n       A ``cottage industry'' developed to defraud the United \n     States under the relaxed refugee standard, according to memos \n     obtained by Scripps Howard News Service. One says that by \n     1993 ``astronomical fraud'' was occurring.\n       About 300,000 refugees have entered the United States under \n     the amendment since 1989.\n       Law enforcement experts say they fear the lenient standards \n     have contributed to a burgeoning criminality in the United \n     States on the part of the immigrants.\n       A high-ranking INS official wrote in March 1992, ``There is \n     a tremendous sense of injustice adjudicating claims under the \n     Lautenberg amendment.''\n       Some standard immigration applicants have been waiting more \n     than 15 years, according to Richard Day, chief Republican \n     counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on \n     immigration and refugee affairs. For example, there are \n     Filipinos with family in the United States who were granted \n     immigrant visas in 1977 who are still waiting to enter the \n     country.\n       To be declared a refugee is to jump to the head of the line \n     and have taxpayers pay your air fare and resettlement costs--\n     an average of $7,000 per refugee.\n       The standard procedure for being declared a refugee \n     requires a well-documented fear of persecution--torture, \n     death or jail. Relatively few who met those requirements made \n     it into the United States after 1980 because a ceiling \n     limited the number each year to around 100,000.\n       In 1989, as the Soviet Union began to crumble, Sen. Frank \n     Lautenberg, New Jersey Democrat, proposed a change to protect \n     Jews, Pentecostals and other religious minorities by denoting \n     them refugees from religious persecution.\n       One high-ranking federal official involved says it was a \n     good policy in the beginning because there were deserving \n     refugees. That former administrator grew disillusioned.\n       ``Clearly, by 1991, fraud and abuse was rife, and our \n     policy had become a rubber stamp,'' he said.\n       Critics of the law say one clear sign that many receiving \n     such status are not genuine refugees fleeing imminent \n     persecution is that 27,000 given visas as ``persecuted \n     refugees'' haven't bothered to leave for the United States.\n       INS memos say the policy has blocked the escape of many who \n     are truly persecuted.\n       ``The irony is that there are plenty of cases from the \n     former Soviet Union which could qualify [as persecuted \n     refugees],'' noted a top INS official in Moscow in December \n     1993.\n       ``However, these cases stand little chance . . . as they do \n     not fit into one of the Lautenberg categories.''\n       The INS declined to discuss the memos. Requests for \n     additional information were referred to the agency's Freedom \n     of Information Act office. An FOIA request filed in August is \n     pending.\n       At one point in 1992, INS officials in Moscow tried to \n     toughen the standards.\n       ``The reality . . . was there were some category applicants \n     who were not able to assert a fear of persecution or a \n     credible basis for such fear,'' an INS official from Moscow \n     cabled Washington on March 31, 1992.\n       But, the memo noted, ``certain interest groups were not \n     able to tolerate even a small percentage of denials and \n     eventually INS succumbed to their demands.''\n       The standards were further relaxed, officials said.\n       Arnold Liebowitz, lobbyist for the Hebrew Immigration Aid \n     Society, said he believed the INS and Jewish lobby groups \n     just had an ``honest disagreement'' about the degree of \n     threat facing Jews in the Soviet Union.\n       ``I think there has always been in the INS a feeling that \n     the Jews in the Soviet Union really didn't have much of a \n     problem.'' he said.\n       Mr. Liebowitz denied his group or others pushed to have the \n     standards relaxed to guarantee that no Jews would be denied \n     refugee status. He said his group believes there is still a \n     need for the Lautenberg Amendment.\n       Roy Godson, a counterterrorism expert, said, ``There were \n     criminals entering the country and no one was doing anything \n     about it. Some of the gangsters were Jewish, and they took \n     advantage of [the amendment].''\n       Efforts to defraud the INS were widespread, officials said \n     in internal memos.\n       ``Category fraud is relatively easy to perpetrate,'' wrote \n     Leonard Kovensky, INS director in Moscow, in a memo sent \n     through Rome to Washington.\n       He said people showed up at INS offices with passports \n     clearly indicating their family ties were all ethnic Russian, \n     but by claiming ``one maternal grandmother was Jewish,'' they \n     had to be offered visas.\n       ``The leader of a Pentecostal group has informed INS that \n     many of those scheduled as Pentecostals are not Pentecostals \n     at all,'' Mr. Kovensky said. ``Many reliable sources have \n     told us of a cottage industry which has sprung up which gives \n     applicants classes on how to successfully pass their INS \n     interview.''\n       A 1991 INS study showed ``a continued decline, indeed \n     drastic decline, in the quality of refugee claims,'' \n     according to an agency memo sent to Washington. Another \n     study, in 1993, found that of 624 applying as refugees, \n     ``only three cases would have qualified under worldwide \n     standards, an approval rate of one half of one percent.''\n       Under the Lautenberg standards, ``ninety-one percent were \n     approved, 4 percent were placed on hold and only 5 percent \n     were denied.''\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this confirms the very serious concerns I \nhave always had about the program. According to the article, INS \nmemorandums and other communications describe the fraud and abuse in \nthe program which, after only 2 years, became a rubber stamp for \nadmission to the United States as a refugee of almost any person in the \nformer Soviet Union who ``claimed'' or asserted to be a Jew or \nPentecostal or persecuted Evangelical, Christian or other category.\n  The startling part of it is, the article notes, by 1993 only about \none-half of 1 percent of those entering the United States as refugees \nunder the Lautenberg amendment actually have a well-\n\n[[Page S18629]]\nfounded fear of persecution on account of their religion.\n  The problem is if the INS had the audacity, or perhaps the gumption, \nto deny even a small percentage of the applicants, the ``groups,'' the \ninterest groups would continue to demand an ever more lenient \nconsideration of these so-called refugee claims. The result of these \ndemands is that we see a lower standard being applied to applicants for \nthis very special program.\n  Mr. President, many of the persons being admitted under this \namendment are excellent immigrants. They bring diversity to our \nimmigrant flow, many are well educated, and will be productive members \nof our society. We all like to hear that. I do, too.\n  However, many others will require public assistance, some for the \nrest of their lives. We now know of situations where people will bring \naged parents here and immediately place them on the public support \nsystem.\n  Still others, according to Hedges' article, are frauds, complete \nfrauds who should not be here at all, or criminals. But the important \npoint I want to make for my colleagues is that all of these persons \nenter as refugees. This means, and there is a tremendous difference \nbetween a refugee and an immigrant, this means they can receive not \nonly Federal assistance with the costs of their airline tickets to come \nhere, they will also receive special refugee cash and medical \nassistance after they arrive.\n  Further, there are private agencies that receive them at the airport \nand are paid $670 per person for each of these 40,000 to 50,000 so-\ncalled refugees who arrive every year under this program. Those are \ncalled R grants. I do not think the people of America even understand \nthat there is $670 per person from the taxpayers to receive and place \nthese people. R: reception and placement. They do not understand at \nall.\n  Occasionaly it was not even all expended--take in the refugees, place \nthem, spend $150, $200 or $300, put the rest of the money in the \naccount of their group. Congressman Mazzoli and I broke up that \nplayhouse some years ago, and I would like to think that does not occur \nanymore. But they would stockpile refugee funds because they did not \nneed all that money.\n  People do not understand that part of it. This is, as I say, inside \nbaseball. But I would trust my colleagues, particularly those who are \nconferees on the State Department reauthorization and reorganization \nbill, will insist on the Senate position and strike any provisions \nwhich would further extend this now thoroughly discredited program. Its \noriginal intent may have been met. It surely does not serve us well \nnow.\n  And if you still do not believe it, then here is a figure for you. \nThere are 40,000 people in the former Soviet Union who have been \ndesignated as refugees, presumed to be so under the Lautenberg \namendment, who have not come yet. They are still there. They are \n``arranging things.'' They have been there for 6 months or a year or \nlonger because they are still searching for the best deal for \nthemselves to stay, or to come as a refugee. How do you come in a way \nwhere the Federal Government of the United States pays you the most \nmoney to get you here.\n  But, ladies and gentlemen, you cannot be a refugee and then hang \naround in your country. A refugee is a refugee is a refugee. It means a \nperson fleeing persecution, and it means immediate fear. It does not \nmean you wait around to decide whether to go to southern California at \nyour pleasure. That is not a refugee. And if Americans cannot \nunderstand that, we will have more such Proposition 187's and all that \ngoes with it.\n  Mr. President, I would certainly call upon the Attorney General to \ntake a very hard, close look at this program. I would like to have a \nreport from them, from the Attorney General, from the Justice \nDepartment, from the INS and from the State Department. And I know what \nit will likely be. Hopefully, we will be able to get some breath of \nreality into the situation. To ensure that, there is a very simple \nthing, and the simple thing is a screening program, a case-by-case \nscreening, just exactly what was called for in the 1980 Refugee Act, \nand put it in Moscow or elsewhere to ensure that persons with criminal \nrecords are not entering our country as refugees under this discredited \nprogram because if this article is at all accurate, it is well apparent \nthat this program requires the most careful scrutiny.\n  I will be speaking on it from time to time. It will rise apparently \nlike a Phoenix, as it does, and then you are not supposed to come and \nsay anything against it because then you are against refugees, and you \nare really quite a foul fellow, and that is not who I am. But we are \ngoing to deal with that. We are going to deal with it realistically \nbecause you either are a refugee or you are an immigrant. And if you \nare a refugee, it will be a case-by-case determination under the \nRefugee Act of 1980. And if you are really a refugee, can you really be \none from the present Commonwealth of the Newly Independent States, the \nformer Soviet Union, because these are our finest allies, our friends.\n  It is like someone said to me the other day: What are we going to do \nwith refugees from Mexico? I said if that is where the debate has gone, \nthen everybody has rocks in their head or wax in their ears. There are \nno refugees from Mexico. How can one be a refugee from Mexico, a \ndemocracy, our remarkable neighbor to our south.\n\n  So those are the twisted terms we get to play with in this particular \narena, and I hope that we can at least for the American public's \nedification and clarity try to describe what those terms are and what a \nrefugee really is. And it certainly cannot be presumed that there are \n40,000 of them coming per year from the former Soviet Union. That makes \nno sense whatsoever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to yield myself 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nbefore us. I have listened with some interest to the latest discussion \nhere, particularly to the Senator from Maryland decrying the decision \nof the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to withhold action \non several items prior to this, that have been before this committee.\n  I am fairly new at this thing, my first year on this committee. I \nhave, however, paid some attention to it, with years in the House \nwatching. And I guess I am a little surprised at the conversation. I \nrecall others talking about this idea of holding hostages. It seems to \nme that the other side of the aisle, apparently at the insistence of \nthe President, has made a conscious effort to avoid moving forward with \nthis State Department authorization bill that they promised to \nfilibuster to death.\n  Time and time again we have read internal memos from the \nadministration declaring their intent to stall the bill at any cost. I \nthink my colleagues will recall the phrases they have used--obfuscate, \nderail, delay. I certainly would have liked to have seen some of the \nAmbassadors in their posts. We have them before my subcommittee. I was \nanxious that they go forward, partly because I thought they were very \nexcellent candidates, partly because I think we ought to have someone \nthere.\n  Of the 18 nominations, the majority were designated to serve in \ncountries within the jurisdiction of my subcommittee, Eastern Asia and \nPacific Affairs. Indonesia, the People's Republic of China, and APEC \nwere without representation. But as important as these posts are, Mr. \nPresident, passing a State Department authorization was and is more \nimportant. Yet, the Senate was denied the opportunity to vote one way \nor another on the issue because it was held hostage by the Democrats.\n\n  I guess I was a little surprised at this last discussion that has \nbeen going on. Hostage takers, Mr. President? What about the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts who took over 2 hours to speak about the \nminimum wage debate during the course of considering this bill in an \neffort to stall it. What about the White House that refused to meet \nwith the chairman to discuss a compromise position? What about the \nofficials at AID who, rather than rationally discussing the bill and \noffering their alternatives, instead waged guerrilla warfare against \nany compromise?\n  These are the hostage takers, Mr. President, not the senior Senator \nfrom \n\n[[Page S18630]]\nNorth Carolina. The American people, who deserve a bureaucracy that is \ncost conscious and responsive to the times and streamlined, were held \nhostage.\n  I remind my Democrat friends that it is probably not useful to cast \nblame on who is holding whom hostage. As I mentioned, I am fairly new \nto this thing, but I have to observe that it appears many who are not \nnew are very, very resistant to change, to even considering change in \nthe way we have been doing things.\n  When you take a look at the results of some of the things we have \ndone in terms of reorganization of the State Department, in terms of \nthe operation of some of these units, we obviously need to make some \nchanges. If you do not make some changes, there is no reason to expect \ndifferent results.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very much in favor of this bill. I am very \nmuch in favor of the efforts that are being made here to assign some \nresponsibility, to assign more accountability, to make this State \nDepartment just like the rest of the departments --more responsive, \nmore efficient, more effective.\n  For the first time in almost everything we do here in the Federal \nGovernment, we are having an opportunity to analyze what they are doing \nand make some evaluations in terms of how these things are working in \nterms of some oversight. That is part of the job of this Congress.\n  But too often we get built in to what happened because it is what \nhappened 10 or 15 years ago; it has always been that way, so we cannot \nchange it. You know we cannot change it; just put some more money in, \nthat probably will do it. That has been the notion.\n  That is what is unique and exciting and different about this \nCongress. We are having an opportunity to do some evaluating, to set \nsome priorities, to make some changes, to cause things to be changed, \nto expect different results from what is happening.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly support this bill. I hope Members of \nthis Senate will vote affirmatively and we can move out of this \nhostage-taking mode that we have been in. You can assign the hostages \nto whomever you choose. I assign mine to the other side of the aisle in \nholding this bill hostage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield such time as the Senator may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina, \nand I congratulate him on obtaining floor time for this bill and \nfinally getting it to a point where it is going to pass. It really is \nan excellent initiative that deserves the support of the Senate and the \nHouse, and hopefully will end up being signed by the President. It has \nbeen a long time coming, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers, \nand it is long overdue.\n  We are, after all, almost 4 years into the post-cold-war period, and \nyet we still function with a State Department, an AID and ACDA \norganization, not to say anything of USAI and Voice of America, that \nare clearly creatures created and designed for responding to a \nworldwide ideological confrontation with the Soviet Union. As has been \nmentioned many times in this debate, that is no longer the case; and \nyet the momentum of those departments go forward as if it were the \ncase, in many instances.\n  I come to this debate because I have the great good fortune to be, \nthrough no cause of my own, but luck basically, chairman of the \nCommerce-State-Justice Appropriations Committee, which basically must \nfund the ideas which come from the Foreign Relations Committee, which \nis so ably chaired by the Senator from North Carolina and so ably by \nsuch an able ranking member as the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Therefore, as the person responsible for the appropriations \nactivities relative to the State Department, I take seriously the \nproposals of the Foreign Relations Committee because they are obviously \ngoing to guide the actions of the appropriating committee. It is our \nintention and has been our intention as the Appropriations Committee to \nessentially support and work with the Foreign Relations Committee as \nthey pursue and reform and reorganize the State Department.\n  I strongly support the basic concept which was created by, initiated \nby, and now has been instituted by the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee in his proposal as presented in this bill, which is \nessentially that the State Department, ACDA, and AID must rethink their \nroles, so that, hopefully, we will see a bringing together of these \nvarious agencies in a manner which will lead to a more efficient, \nfocused, and effective delivery of their mission.\n  I happen to strongly be of the view, as I know the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee is--really I am of this view in large \nmeasure because of the education which I received while being on the \nForeign Relations Committee, at the feet of the chairman and the \nranking member--I am of the view that we need to give the Secretary of \nState more control over these various agencies so that we have a more \ncoordinated policy.\n  It is not a unique view, actually, held by Republicans only. It \nhappens to be a view that at least initially was held by, I believe, \nthe Secretary of State, and, I suspect, in the quiet of his office when \nhe is not being confronted by the requirement of public policy \npositions pressed upon him by other members of the administration, he \nstill agrees with that view and agrees with it strongly.\n  It was a view which, initially at least, was supported by the Vice \nPresident in his proposals for reinventing government; that is, that we \nshould give the Secretary of State, the person who logically is the \nprime spokesman and policymaker on behalf of the President of the \nUnited States, the authority to manage the foreign policy of the \ncountry. That means the authority to manage two major agencies which \nnow function as independent satellites of the Department and, in some \ncases, extraordinary satellites.\n  But this bill does not go so far as to direct how it is done \nprecisely. Rather, I believe this bill takes the very logical approach \nof allowing the Department to report back and design a program which \naccomplishes the goals which I think are well set out, which is that \nmore focus be given through the Secretary of State in controlling and \nmanaging the various functions of our international policy. Also, it \nproposes that in this exercise of reorganization we save some money, \nnot a request which is illogical.\n  There is no question but that there is a great deal of overlap, there \nis a great deal of duplication, there is a great deal of atrophied \nagencies within these various departments which were produced and \ncreated for the purposes of addressing issues of the cold war and which \nare no longer serving a viable function and which, in many instances, \ncould easily be reduced or at least consolidated in a manner which \nwould deliver more efficiency and refocus them more effectively and \nwhich would save dollars.\n  The proposal which has come forward is to save, I think, $1.7 billion \nover, I believe, 7 years, if I am correct. And if I am not, I will be \nhappy to stand corrected. I guess it is 5 years. I would note that this \nis not a reach. In fact, in the appropriations bill which was just \nrecently passed by this Senate, we saved $500 million just in the year \n1996; $65 million through rescissions, $435 million by reducing \nspending activities within these various departments.\n  So we are clearly on the path to this level of savings. In fact, when \nit was reported at the initial proposal, which the Vice President's \ngroup, I believe, was dealing with and which had been put forward by \nvarious members of the administration, it would save, I think, \napproximately $5 billion during this same timeframe. I was supportive \nof that number and happened to believe that number is an attainable \nnumber, $5 billion rather than the $1.7 billion which is in this \nauthorization bill.\n  I hope as we move down the road toward this reorganization, that \nshould this $1.7 billion become the number that is focused on or \nsettled on, that the Department might even, in a gesture of good will, \ntry to exceed that number and go closer to the $5 billion which was \noriginally thought of.\n  I can tell you right now, at least at the appropriating level, we are \ngoing to be looking for numbers at a little higher level because we \nthink it is certainly doable. But I strongly congratulate the chairman \nof the committee for having gotten us on the road to what I think is a \nlong overdue, but very effective as presently proposed, attempt to \nreorganize departments which were designed \n\n[[Page S18631]]\nto address one issue, the cold war, and which now are not functioning \neffectively addressing a new issue, which is the world as we know it \ntoday.\n  Today when we think of the threats that confront this Nation and the \nissues of international policy, we should be thinking about things like \npopulation excesses and thinking about things like environmental \nconcerns. We should be thinking about things like availability of food. \nWe have to worry about ethnic conflicts, and we have to worry about \nreligious conflicts--totally different issues of philosophy, totally \ndifferent issues of real threat to our country or real threat to \nstability around the world than what we confronted under the regime of \nthe cold war. Thus, we need to reinvent the agencies which address \nthat, and in this bill the chairman and the Committee on Foreign \nRelations has taken a major stride toward doing just that.\n  So I congratulate the committee. I look forward to continuing to \nfollow the guidance of the committee as we move forward in the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I am grateful to the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on State-Commerce-Justice appropriations, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, for his kind remarks. And I \nam very grateful to the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, I had to take a telephone call on a very important \nmatter involving North Carolina. But while I was talking, I heard \nSenator Sarbanes. I like Senator Sarbanes. I do not like everything he \nsays. Sometimes he reminds me of a pregnant cobra, but I know he feels \ndeeply what he has said, and I know he thinks it is correct. But the \ntrouble is that it is not correct. I think Senator Sarbanes, if he will \nforgive me, forgets that at the close of the Bush administration, the \nDemocrats held up 12 ambassadors that President Bush had sent to the \nSenate. They were not given hearings. They were given no consideration \nfor 6 months--6 months. They, frankly, said, ``We do not want any \nambassadors appointed by a Republican President.''\n\n  So it is not exactly a novelty to hold up an ambassadorial \nnomination, or a group of them. But I know that Senator Sarbanes did \nthe best he could with his argument. But this business of fairness is \nin the eye of the beholder. You do the best you can in the Senate when \nyou have a strong and effective opposition, such as Senator Sarbanes. \nAnd, of course, it was Senator Sarbanes who was micromanaging, to a \ncertain extent, I believe, the negotiations between Senator Kerry and \nme. That is all right. I have no objection to that. Senator Sarbanes \nhas been around this Senate for a while, and he is entitled to be \nrecognized for his seniority.\n  Now, President Clinton, let me remind anybody who heard Senator \nSarbanes' criticism that, just last week, after Senator Kerry and I \nreached our final agreement--and we reached a ``final'' agreement a \nnumber of times during these negotiations, but last week, when it was \nthe final-final agreement, there came the White House saying, ``We have \none little thing more we want to do.'' It was the White House, do you \nnot see, Mr. President, that held the ambassadors hostage because they \ndelayed any action on negotiations because they wanted to include a \nguarantee that a nominee to the Environmental Protection Agency be \nconfirmed by the Senate in order for this agreement between Senator \nKerry and me to occur. Well, I said, ``I have nothing to do with that \nnomination, and I will defer to the majority leader.'' I think they \nworked it out with Mr. Daschle and others.\n  Now, let me say again that I was ready at any time--and I said so \nrepeatedly--to have a vote. I did not ask to be assured of this or \nthat; just let the Senate vote. Senator Sarbanes was unyielding on \nthat. He did not do so publicly, but he was unyielding that I was not \ngoing to get a vote because, as he has said, he does not like this \nbill. He thinks we are not spending enough money on the foreign policy \napparatus as it is. He is in contradiction of the opinion of the \nAmerican people, who pay the taxes. Senator Sarbanes and I only pay a \nsmall part. But the people who pay the bulk of it do not agree with \nhim, and maybe they do not agree with me. I do not have any pull one \nway or another.\n  I suppose it ought to be said, in all fairness, that there are good \nambassadors and there are some who are not so good. Various Senators \nhave had various experiences with how embassies are not run by the \nambassadors but are run by the ambassador's assistant. I have about \nreached the point that I wonder if having an Ambassador in Paris is \nessential, because is it not an anachronism in a day when we have such \ninstant communication. When we sent Benjamin Franklin and Thomas \nJefferson over to Paris, they had to go over on a ship, and they had to \nunderstand the administration's policy on this, that, and the other. \nBut I do not think that the relations with China went to pot because \nJim Sasser was held up. Somebody said that Jim Sasser is a nice guy and \nhe was a good Senator. I like him and all that. But U.S. relations with \nBeijing did not go to pot because Jim Sasser was not over there. As a \nmatter of fact, somebody commented that China was making a number of \nconcessions while we had no Ambassador.\n  So it is OK to take a hit at Helms. I am used to it, but those taking \nthe hit better look at the history of what both parties have done when \nthey have been in the majority.\n  Now, I confess that I may be the first chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee who does not really care what the editors of the \nNew York Times feels about foreign policy. I do not run to the \nWashington Post to say, ``Please, is this all right?'' I try to use my \nown instincts and try to base my judgments on what I think the American \npeople want in terms of decisions.\n  If Senator Sarbanes does not like that, that is fine. The Council on \nForeign Relations is not going to run the Foreign Relations Committee \nas long as I am chairman of it. I say that with all due respect to the \norganization.\n  As far as letters inserted in the Record, I could put 50 pages of \nletters into the Record right now, Mr. President, from people all over \nthe country, who have written to me and said, ``Jesse, hang in there.'' \nSo we can all play that game and insert letters from lots of \norganizations. I can insert letters from businessmen, who say, ``You \nare doing the right thing.'' So it is a matter of opinion. Some of it \nmay be partisan, some of it may not be.\n  I do not know that it is entirely useful to excoriate another Senator \nwith whom you disagree. I say again, I like Paul Sarbanes, and I \nthought our relationship was better than it apparently is. Foreign \nService officers and ambassadors are expressing strong, unequivocal \nsupport for this bill.\n  So I do not want to hear all this ``moaning and puking,'' as \nShakespeare put it, about how we are tromping on the Foreign Service. I \nhave not done it, and I am not going to do it. They have been some of \nthe loudest advocates of the reorganization of the State Department. \nFive former Secretaries of State have said this is a great piece of \nlegislation. They helped us with various points on it. Warren \nChristopher went down and tried to sell it to Al Gore, who was busily \nannouncing in press release after press release that he was going to \n``reinvent'' Government.\n  So it is time we stopped talking and start doing something. I am not \ngoing to go any further. I think enough has been said on that.\n\n\n                             end strengths\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, section 141 of the bill deals with end \nstrengths for the Foreign Service and the Senior Foreign Service in the \nState Department, USIA, and AID. We had similar language in the Foreign \nRelations Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994-95. However, the end \nstrengths in section 141 of this bill are based on the original \nconsolidation language which would have abolished AID, USIA, and ACDA, \nrather than the new language we have agreed upon. We addressed this \nproblem in part in the managers amendment by deleting subsections (c) \nand (d) of section 141. However, to be consistent with the new \nconsolidation approach, we need to revise the end strengths in \nsubsections (a) and (b).\n  Mr. President, I would ask the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee if he is willing to work with me to correct this \nproblem in conference?\n\n[[Page S18632]]\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am prepared to do that. So the numbers \nreflect the intent of the conference report.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand that a colloquy was entered \ninto earlier, which I believe misstates the legal status of a provision \nin this bill. May I inquire of the Democratic manager, who determines \nthe validity of a claim submitted under section 604(a) relating to Iraq \nclaims?\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding that the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission determines the validity of all claims submitted to it \nregardless of past litigation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, under section 604(b), I understand that the \nForeign Claims Settlement Commission is authorized to receive and \ndetermine the validity of claims of United States persons against the \nGovernment of Iraq and its instrumentalities. May I assume that claims \nwhich have been reduced to judgment in Federal district court are \nvalid?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, yes. A judgment obtained in Federal \ndistrict court will be considered a valid claim. Clearly there could be \nno more valid claim than a judgment received through the adjudication \nprocess.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, may I further assume that such judgments and \ntheir amounts, having been certified as valid, will receive expedited \nprocessing for payment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, yes. It is our expectation that the Foreign \nClaims Settlement Commission will establish an expedited procedure to \npay such claims, given that their validity is not in question.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina and \nappreciate his management of this bill.\n\n\n                expropriation in the dominican republic\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to discuss with the \ndistinguished manager, the senior Senator from North Carolina, section \n168 of S. 908. First, I want to commend the Senator for his leadership \non behalf of all U.S. citizens who have suffered expropriations \nthroughout the world. The Senator has been a great champion for these \nAmericans whose rights have been trampled by foreign governments.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her kind words, and I am happy to discuss section 168 of S. \n908 with her. Section 168 would exclude from the United States aliens \nwho have expropriated U.S. property or who traffick in such property. \nAs the Senator knows, this provision has been deleted from the pending \nbill at Senator Dodd's request because it is included in the House-\npassed version of H.R. 927, and he would prefer that it be addressed in \nthat bill. Senate conferees will be named for H.R. 927 immediately upon \nSenate passage of S. 908.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have been trying to help resolve an \negregious expropriation executed by the Dominican Republic's military \nagainst Western Energy, Inc. Western Energy is headquartered in my \nState and operated an important liquid petroleum gas facility in the \nDominican Republic until the military took over in April 1994.\n  Our Ambassador to the Dominican Republic should be commended for her \nefforts to resolve the expropriation suffered by Western Energy. The \nnames of the persons involved are well known because the case is \nprominent and, I am told, has caused great outrage and shame over the \nGovernment's action. Would my distinguished colleague join me in \nencouraging the U.S. Ambassador to inform the affected persons that \npromptly upon enactment of section 168 in H.R. 927 they will be \nexcluded from the United States until the Western Energy case is \nsatisfactorily resolved?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, section 168 reflects the frustration with \nthe lack of progress in resolving property claims, especially in the \nWestern Hemisphere. The Dominican Republic is among the worst \noffenders, and the distinguished Senator from Texas can count on my \nsupport.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the State \nDepartment authorization bill and I want to briefly explain why. But \nbefore I do, I want to commend the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, for the herculean efforts he made to resolve an impasse that has \nprevented confirmation of over a dozen American ambassadors as well as \nSenate ratification of the Start II treaty.\n  Senator Kerry believes, as I do, that the foreign policy apparatus of \nthis country needs reform. There is duplication, lack of coordination, \nand money has been wasted. I know the compromise we are voting on today \nreflects his best effort to address these problems, without doing \ngrievous damage to the agencies that administer foreign policy.\n  But while I commend Senator Kerry for the thankless job of bringing \nto closure the tedious and often acrimonious negotiations over this \nlegislation, I will vote against this bill because I do not believe \nthat blackmail should be rewarded in the U.S. Senate. I will also vote \nno because although this managers' amendment is a significant \nimprovement over the bill as reported by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I believe it will weaken U.S. diplomacy, not strengthen it.\n  Senator Sarbanes has spoken eloquently on this and I want to \nassociate myself with his remarks. What we have seen is the \nimmobilization of the Foreign Relations Committee for the better part \nof this year. The fact that there has not been a foreign aid \nauthorization bill since the mid-1980's has not made any difference. \nBut the committee does have certain important responsibilities, \nincluding ambassadorial nominations and reporting treaties for \nratification.\n  I could list any number of Foreign Service officers who serve this \ncountry every day with incredible professionalism and bravery. Yet \nbecause the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee could not force \nthe Senate to support his effort to eviscerate portions of the foreign \npolicy apparatus of the U.S. Government, he refused to permit the \ncommittee to carry out functions that are crucial to this country. It \nhas caused countless problems for both American foreign policy, and \nAmerican citizens who have needed assistance overseas.\n  There are other problems with this bill which do not merit our \nsupport. It contains authorization levels that will cause grave \nproblems for U.S. leadership and U.S. representation overseas. It \nrequires deep cuts in the operating expenses of the foreign policy \nagencies, including U.S. AID, in our contributions to the United \nNations, and in our foreign exchange programs.\n  In conference, it is a virtual certainty that the bill will get \nworse, not better. Senator Sarbanes has already pointed out that the \nsame people who favor slashing resources for diplomacy voted to add $7 \nbillion to the defense budget, over and above the quarter of a trillion \ndollars requested. This entire bill authorizes less than that increase \nto the defense bill.\n  Senator Kerry's efforts resulted in significant improvements in the \nbill that was originally reported by the committee. I also want to say \nthat I do not question the motives of the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I agree with his goal to cut the cost of these \nagencies, and to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. They need \nstreamlining. But I cannot agree with these methods.\n  I vote to reject them, not reward them.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as chair of the International Operations \nSubcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the issues contained in the \nlegislation, I rise in support of this bill.\n  It is regrettable that this bill is coming up today with a managers' \namendment drafted by Senate Democrats that will have the effect of \nundoing the Foreign Relations Committee's main work on this \nlegislation. Lacking a sufficent level of support to actually make \nthese changes by a majority vote, the Senate minority has insisted in \nchanges in this bill that could not pass under normal legislative \nprocedures.\n  Although a freshman Senator, I have more than a decade of experience \nwith these issues. I have worked on the State Department authorization \nbill \n\n[[Page S18633]]\nsince 1985, when I became ranking member of the House International \nOperations Subcommittee. Continuing this role in the Senate, this is \nthe sixth State Department authorization process in which I have served \nas a Republican manager of the legislation.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator \nHelms, for his perseverance with this legislation. That we have this \nbill back before the Senate today is in large part due to his stalwart \nsupport of the legislative process.\n  I would like to also thank the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Pell, for his graciousness, comity, and \nbelief in the legislative process. I would note that Senator Pell--the \nformer chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee--was the only member \nof the other party to support cloture when this bill was last before \nthe Senate on August 1. This kind of steadfast support for the role of \nthe authorizing committees will be sorely missed in the Senate after \nhis retirement next year.\n  I would also like to thank the majority leader for his strong support \nfor this bill, and the other Republican members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for their votes and their support when it was most \ncritically needed.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the work of the staff, \nparticularly the committee's staff director, Adm. Bud Nance. He has \nbrought dedication and integrity to every aspect of his efforts, and he \nhas greatly assisted the work of the committee.\n  The bill before us today authorizes the budget and operations of the \nforeign affairs agencies, establishes policies for our participation in \ninternational organizations, and strengthens U.S. standards for our \nparticipation in U.N. peacekeeping operations.\n  As reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee, this bill would \nhave implemented an innovative restructuring plan first proposed at the \nbeginning of this year by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I note \nwith regret that this is no longer the case. The original version of \nthis bill would have terminated three independent foreign affairs \nagencies, and achieved $3 billion in savings over four years by \nconsolidating the functions carried out by those agencies into the \nDepartment of State. The three independent foreign affairs agencies \nare: the U.S. Information Agency, which deals with the public relations \naspects of our foreign policy; the Agency for International \nDevelopment, which runs our foreign assistance programs; and the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency, which conducts diplomatic activities \nrelated to arms control and nonproliferation.\n  This bill no longer explicitly requires bringing under the direct \ncontrol of the Secretary of State the activities of these three \nexisting independent agencies. The bill, however, does mandate to the \nPresident that he achieve over five years $1.7 billion in savings at \nleast 70% of which must come from the elimination of duplication and \nbureaucratic downsizing.\n  This is less than half of the savings contained in the committee \nbill, and about $500 million less in savings from Senator Kerry's own \namendment that failed to pass during committee mark-up. I would also \nnote that at committee Senator Kerry proposed the mandatory elimination \nof at least one agency, at the President's discretion. As I mentioned, \nthis bill, with passage of the Kerry managers' amendment, no longer \nrequires the consolidation of any agencies into the Department of \nState.\n  To any who believe that the bill's original $3 billion in savings \nover four years is excessive, or even the current $1.7 billion in \nsavings over five years, I would to point out that on January 26 Vice \nPresident Gore issued a press release announcing the second phase of \nthe ``National Performance Review.'' That press release announced, and \nI quote:\n\n       It is anticipated that the overall review of international \n     affairs programs and agencies will result in savings of at \n     least $5 billion over 5 years and a substantially enhanced \n     capacity to deliver more effective programs overseas and \n     provide value to the American taxpayer.\n\n  The problem is that now, 11 months later, the Vice President still \nhas not presented his plan for saving $5 billion over 5 years through \nrestructuring and consolidation of our foreign affairs agencies. In \nfact, the Administration has refused to even present to Congress its \nnormal legislative request for the foreign affairs agencies. And that \nis the first time this has happened in the 10 years I have worked on \nthis legislation.\n  So in the absence of any positive Administration proposal, all we are \nmandating in this bill is that the Administration develop and implement \na proposal for saving $1.7 billion over 5 years, not the $5 billion \nover 5 years that the Vice President promised at the beginning of this \nyear. Frankly, I believe that we can do more, and the original bill did \ndo more. But at least this is a first step toward that goal.\n  I hope that once the President is forced to begin looking at even \nthis modest level of bureaucratic downsizing, even this Administration \nwill recognize the wisdom of Secretary Christopher's original plan for \nconsolidating the functions of all three independent foreign affairs \nagencies into the Department of State. Let me just give a small example \nof the reasons why the original consolidation would improve the \nformulation and conduct of American foreign policy.\n  On October 12 my office received a State Department inspector general \nreport that reviewed the activities of the Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs. That report discusses efforts to identify and eliminate \nredundancies between this State Department bureau and ACDA.\n  This is an effort that we should certainly all applaud, but without a \nformal consolidation between the two entities, a total elimination of \nduplication would either deprive the Secretary of State of any \nexpertise over arms control issues, or rob ACDA of any diplomatic \ncapabilities to conduct sensitive arms control negotiations. It would \nfurther isolate important arms control and nonproliferation \nconsiderations from the formulation of American foreign policy. Or, in \nthe words of the State Department inspector general:\n\n       If [the State Department] were to relinquish a significant \n     portion of its nonproliferation functions, the overall \n     effects could be counterproductive.\n  This is a perfect illustration why merging the functions of these \nthree independent agencies into the Department of State is needed not \njust to save money, but to improve the flexibility and coordination of \nAmerican foreign policy in the post-cold-war era.\n  And this is not just my own opinion, the opinion of Chairman Helms, \nor the collective opinion of the other body, which has included \nChristopher's consolidation plan in its own State Department \nauthorization bill. This consolidation proposal is also supported by \nfive former Secretaries of State and two former National Security \nAdvisers.\n  Mr. President, I would like to now discuss the reason for their \nsupport.\n  The world has changed dramatically in the last decade, and with it \nthe demands on our foreign policy structure. Gone is the cold war--and \nthe certainty of a single opposing force in our foreign relations. \nGone, too, is the highly focused foreign policy we once waged against \nan expansionist and authoritarian Soviet Union and its satellites.\n  We face a new imperative: to maintain a strong and aggressive foreign \npolicy, while streamlining our operations, achieving cost savings, and \nmeeting the new criteria of a changing world. Consolidation among our \nforeign affairs agencies is an idea whose time has come.\n  In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the \nreigniting of ethnic strife that had been kept bottled up by the cold \nwar, we live in a new world. But it is not necessarily a safer world. \nThe reason five former Secretaries of State support this concept is the \nneed to integrate the important public diplomacy, arms control, and \nforeign assistance aspects of American foreign policy into our basic \npolicy formulation process.\n  For example, currently the independent Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency is primarily responsible for nonproliferation policy. But \nconcerns about nuclear proliferation frame our relations with a range \nof countries around the world, from North Korea, to Pakistan, to Iran. \nIt would enhance, not detract, from this important goal of American \nforeign policy for it to be integrated into the policy formulation \n\n[[Page S18634]]\nprocess at State. It is far too important to be an afterthought \nconsidered only later in the interagency process.\n  And by better coordinating public diplomacy with policy, we can \ndirectly benefit the conduct of our Nation's foreign relations. Public \nrelations play an increasingly important role in a world that is \nincreasingly democratic. But currently, our public diplomacy expertise \nrests in the independent U.S. Information Agency. Does it enhance the \nformulation of American foreign policy to consider its impact on world \npublic opinion only after the fact?\n  Similarly, there is a great need to more closely tie our foreign \nassistance programs to policy goals intended to directly advance our \nnational interests. And there is a desperate need to cut back on AID's \nhuge administrative structure that today consumes vast amounts of our \nhumanitarian and developmental aid funds.\n  Out of a $2.3 billion developmental aid account, AID spends $600 \nmillion on its formal operating expenses account. This is 25 cents for \nevery developmental dollar. But in reality, AID's administrative costs \nare much higher because AID's formal operating expenses only count \n5,000 out of its 9,000 employees worldwide. The missing 4,000 are AID \ncontract employees who are paid out of program funds, not operating \nexpenses.\n  There are other important aspects to this legislation. The bill \ncontains many management improvements sought by the administration. I \nregret that what State Department initiatives are included in this bill \nhad to come to us informally, as the administration even to this day \nhas refused to submit a formal legislative request.\n  The bill also puts into permanent law many of the international \npeacekeeping reforms that were first enacted in our last bill.\n  Let me also briefly mention a few of the initiatives I have included \nin this bill.\n  I have included the text of the Terrorist Exclusion Act, which I \nfirst introduced in the House 2 years ago, and which I have \nreintroduced this year with Senator Brown as my original cosponsor. \nThis provision will restore the pre-1990 standard allowing denial of a \nU.S. visa for membership in a terrorist group.\n  Another provision would codify existing embassy visa terrorist \nlookout committees. These committees were established by the State \nDepartment in 1993 under the Visas Viper Program. However, recent GAO \nand IG reports indicate that these committees have become moribund. My \nprovision would require the terrorist lookout committees to meet \nregularly and become more active.\n  I have also included the requirement for two GAO studies. One would \nlook at the extent to which the activities of four long-standing \ngrantees duplicate activities carried out by the U.S. Government. These \ngroups are the Asia Foundation, the East-West Center, the North-South \nCenter, and the National Endowment for Democracy.\n  A second study would look at the question of whether the North-South \nCenter used U.S. funds to engage in improper lobbying effort in support \nof the North American Free Trade Agreement. I am particularly concerned \nabout a publication the Center sent to Members of Congress during the \nNAFTA debate, entitled ``Assessment of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement.''\n  Mr. President, as I have expressed in the past, I know that there has \nbeen a great deal of anxiety among the dedicated, hard-working \nemployees of our foreign affairs agencies. That concern comes not just \nover this bill, but over the generally recognized need to downsize our \nFederal work force as we move to a balanced budget. I believe that all \nof us need to do everything we can to remember the human dimension of \nwhat we are trying to achieve.\n  This bill contains broad early retirement and buyout authorities, and \nwe have taken every step we know how to take to make the transition as \neasy as possible to a streamlined foreign policy structure. This bill \nalso gives the President extraordinary authority to formulate his own \ntransition plan, limited only by the bill's mandated savings target.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us is an important bill, and I hope \nthat in conference it will become even better. The Foreign Relations \nRevitalization Act gives credit to our Chairman, to our committee, and \nto all of the Senators who have supported it since its inception.\n  I urge its adoption, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to lend my support to the \ncompromise version of S. 908, the State Department Authorization bill.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and their \nstaffs, for the many hours they devoted to the long, hard negotiations \nthat were necessary to reach this compromise.\n  In particular, I want to recognize the efforts of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. He inherited a difficult, perhaps even thankless, task, \nand pursued it with his usual diligence, dedication, and wisdom. He had \nto balance the concerns of many of his colleagues, and of the \nAdministration, while negotiating a very controversial bill. I believe \nthe consolidation compromise he has struck with the Chairman is a good \none, a workable one, and a fair one. I want to thank him for his \nefforts and commend him for his work.\n  The plan that emerged from the negotiations is a reasonable one. It \nrequires the Administration to submit a plan to consolidate the foreign \naffairs agencies, but it gives them flexibility to decide how to do so \neffectively and responsibly.\n  They are tough standards that the Administration must meet. Within \nsix months they must submit a reorganization plan to the Congress which \nachieves $1.7 billion in savings over five years. If Congress deems the \nplan to be unsatisfactory, we can pass a resolution of disapproval and \nforce the Administration to submit a more acceptable plan.\n  But most importantly, the compromise does not require the \nAdministration to eliminate USAID, USIA, or ACDA. They may decide to do \nso. But this bill gives the Administration an opportunity to figure out \na way to achieve real savings and reform, without necessarily \nabolishing three valuable agencies that do important work: development \nand disaster assistance, negotiating and monitoring of arms control \nagreements, and international broadcasting and exchanges. This \nflexibility is the key.\n  The passage of this bill today will produce some other positive \ndevelopments, many of them long overdue. With the disposition of S. \n908, the Senate will be able to confirm 18 ambassadorial nominations \nand hundreds of foreign service officer promotions. We will also be \nable to consider the START II treaty before the end of this session, \nand the Chemical Weapons Convention in the spring.\n  Of all embassies that are waiting for ambassadors, I think none is \nmore important than the one in Beijing, China, where our former \ncolleague, James Sasser, will become United States Ambassador. I am \nconfident that our country will be well served by the job that he, and \nthe other nominees, will do in their new posts.\n  Finally, I do want to note that even with the consolidation \ncompromise, there remain a number of provisions in S. 908 that I find \ndeeply troubling. Several of them have to do with China.\n\n       Section 606 declares that the Taiwan Relations Act should \n     supersede the three U.S.-China joint communiques as the basis \n     of U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan.\n       Section 608 calls Tibet an ``occupied sovereign country, \n     and Section 609 requires that the President appoint a Special \n     Envoy for Tibet.\n       Section 415 requires USIA to submit a plan to create a \n     Radio Free Asia.\n       Section 611 erects an unnecessarily labyrinthine procedure \n     for screening products that may have been produced by forced \n     labor in China.\n\n  These provisions and others combine to create an unnecessary \nprovocation in our relationship with China, at a time when the \nrelationship is still recovering from a recent crisis. They threaten to \nundermine our One China Policy, which is the basis of the relationship, \nand to exacerbate tensions when we should be trying to ease tensions.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues who will serve on the \nHouse-Senate conference on this bill, with the goal of removing or \nrewriting these provisions. I consider the successful resolution of \nthese matters to be critical to my consideration of whether or \n\n[[Page S18635]]\nnot to support the conference report on this bill.\n  I am also hopeful that the consolidation plan will not be modified in \nconference. I am aware that the plan in the House bill does require the \nelimination of USAID, USIA, and ACDA. If the Senate compromise \nagreement is substantially altered in conference to reflect the more \ndraconian House plan, it will be difficult, if not impossible for me to \nsupport the conference report.\n  Having said that, I believe it is important to get the State \nDepartment Authorization bill to conference, and I intend to support \nthe bill today.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have just been informed that the Acting \nSecretary of State has taken an action that seemed to me to be a direct \naffront to the Foreign Relations Committee and to the future of \nrelations between the United States and Taiwan, the Republic of China. \nThe Acting Secretary has just named three men to sit on the board of \nthe American Institute in Taiwan, under a procedure that is not normal. \nUnder a longstanding agreement between the Department of State and the \ncommittee, specifically between the then-chairman of the committee, Mr. \nChurch, and then-Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, the Department of \nState is to notify the committee of appointments to the board. Under \nthe terms of the agreement, the committee is to be able to voice its \nconcerns about any of these appointments and these concerns are to be \nsatisfied before the Department proceeds with the appointments. Today, \nthe Acting Secretary of State abrogated that agreement, in my judgment. \nNow, since 1979, the committee's role in the appointment process was \nthat the committee could have an opportunity to voice its concerns \nabout any individuals appointed to the board of the American Institute \nin Taiwan, our de facto embassy. We do not recognize Taiwan as a \nnation. I think we should, speaking as one Senator, but we do not. The \nAmerican Institute in Taiwan is our de facto embassy.\n  These concerns were to have been worked out through the department \nbefore the appointees are identified. I have just been informed that \nthe department has proceeded with three appointments the day before the \ncommittee was scheduled to meet these gentlemen, for the first time. \nMr. President, this action, I believe, is an especially strong affront \nin light of the fact that this very week the Department of State is \nreceiving confirmation of 18 of its ambassadorial appointees and four \nForeign Service officer promotion lists.\n  I am astounded by this decision and have determined that the \ncommittee will hold a hearing on the role of the American Institute in \nTaiwan at which we will compare its role today to the role agreed to \npreviously when it was established in the late 1970's or early 1980's, \nwhenever it was.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3100\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize the transmittal of a reorganization plan or \n plans streamlining and consolidating the Department of State and the \n independent foreign affairs agencies, to make technical amendments to \n                   the bill, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] for himself and \n     Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 3100.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The text \nof the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just clarify with the Senator, it is \nmy understanding the amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. With the amendment pending, once accepted, the order of \nbusiness will be to pass the bill and immediately subsequent to the \nbill being passed we will proceed to the Ambassadors, is that correct?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 54 minutes \nand 45 seconds, and the Senator from North Carolina has 39 minutes and \n44 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I see two Senators on my side who are on \ntheir feet. We would like to yield back some time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask that 5 minutes be yielded to me.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I listened with interest in the Cloakroom \nto my friend from North Carolina and what he had to say in response to \nthe Senator from Maryland. The Senator from Maryland can surely take \ncare of himself and respond in any way he thinks is appropriate, but at \none point we all say things that we sort of slip and say and do not \nmean.\n  He made reference to our nominee to China, former Senator Sasser as \n``needing a job.'' I inform the Senator that not only does Senator \nSasser not need a job, he is doing financially much better now than he \ndid when he was here. He needs no job. This is a public service to \nwhich he has agreed to return, and I am sure the Senator did not mean \nto imply anything by what he said, but I want the Record to make it \nclear. Senator Sasser does not need a job--it is for those of us, \nincluding the President, who think we need Senator Sasser to come back \nto public service. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I listened with a great deal of interest to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  First of all, let me say that in the last 6 months of the Bush \nadministration we confirmed 63 ambassadorial nominees. The Senator said \nthere were 12 that were not confirmed. So that would be 63 out of 75, \nwhich is 84 percent.\n  The Senator has allowed no ambassadors to be confirmed--not 10 \npercent, not 20 percent, not 40 percent, not 60 percent, not 80 \npercent, not 84 percent. None. None at all.\n  Some of the nominees that were not confirmed at the end of the Bush \nadministration were not ambassadorial nominees, but nominees to \ncommissions and boards. In any event, the Senator said there were 12 \nthat were not confirmed. Sixty-three were confirmed over the last 6 \nmonths of the Bush administration, 84 percent.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has held everyone hostage. He will \nnot allow any of them to go through, even though we have very important \nnational interests with respect thereto.\n  The Senator was given two votes in the Senate in trying to get to his \nreorganization bill--votes of 54 to 45. The Senate refused to invoke \ncloture and to go to that legislation. Having been thwarted in that \nsense, the Senator then set out on his hostage strategy and held up the \nambassadors and held up the treaties, in my view putting at risk very \nimportant national security interests.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na column from the Arms Control Association newsletter following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in that newsletter it says:\n\n       Prompt Senate approval of START II--the treaty that would \n     reduce the Russian strategic threat to the United States from \n     some 8,000 to 3,500 nuclear warheads--is becoming \n     increasingly doubtful despite overwhelming bipartisan \n     congressional support. Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), asserting \n     his power as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee, is holding this important treaty, as well as the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, hostage to passage of unrelated \n     legislation. Failure to complete Senate action promptly could \n     delay for years the entry into force of these agreements with \n     great disadvantage to U.S. security.\n     \n[[Page S18636]]\n\n  And I underscore that concluding phrase ``with great disadvantage to \nU.S. security.''\n  Finally, I say to my colleague from North Carolina that, as chairman \nof the committee, it seems to me, the Senator has certain \nresponsibilities. To hold the balance of the work of a committee \nhostage because the Senator has not been able to get his way on a \nparticular piece of legislation is not a very efficient way to carry \nout the work of the committee.\n  Obviously, it was a tactic used to heighten pressure, in a sense, a \ncoercive tactic. And I very much regret that it occurred.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From Arms Control Today, Oct. 1995]\n\n                     Holding U.S. Security Hostage\n\n                      (By Spurgeon M. Keeny, Jr.)\n\n       Prompt Senate approval of START II--the treaty that would \n     reduce the Russian strategic threat to the United States from \n     some 8,000 to 3,500 nuclear warheads--is becoming \n     increasingly doubtful despite overwhelming bipartisan \n     congressional support. Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), asserting \n     his power as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee, is holding this important treaty, as well as the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), hostage to passage of \n     unrelated legislation. Failure to complete Senate action \n     promptly could delay for years the entry into force of these \n     agreements with great disadvantage to U.S. security.\n       By refusing to schedule any meetings, Helms has stopped all \n     action before his committee in an effort to force the \n     administration to accept his plan to integrate into the State \n     Department three independent agencies, the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency (ACDA), the Agency for International \n     Development and the U.S. Information Agency. Senate approval \n     of START II, which Helms has not opposed, could be obtained \n     with little or no opposition as soon as a formal committee \n     markup of the resolution of approval can be scheduled. But \n     until Helms relents, the United States cannot demonstrate to \n     Russia and the world its support for reductions in strategic \n     nuclear forces.\n       The multilateral CWC, which will ban development, \n     production and stockpiling of chemical warfare agents as well \n     as their use, may require a final hearing to resolve some \n     questions. But, under the able leadership of Senator Richard \n     Lugar (R-IN), the necessary resolution of approval should be \n     easily obtained. Because many countries are awaiting U.S. \n     ratification, Senate inaction prevents the early entry into \n     force of this agreement, which universally bans possession \n     and use of the ``poor man's nuclear weapon.''\n       Senator Helms is reportedly willing to reduce the ransom to \n     only two of the three threatened agencies with the choice \n     left to the administration. The White House has properly \n     declined to bargain with hostage-takers and vowed not to \n     yield on this issue. However, the longer this standoff lasts, \n     the less likely any action will occur in time to influence \n     favorable Russian action on either treaty.\n       The prospects for START II ratification in the Russian \n     Parliament are much more precarious than in the U.S. Senate, \n     notwithstanding Helms' maneuvering. A narrow window of \n     opportunity for action appears to exist for the next month or \n     two before the Russian Parliament adjourns to prepare for \n     mid-December elections. While the makeup of the next \n     Parliament cannot be predicted, it may well be even more \n     nationalistic and more hostile than the present body to \n     proposed NATO expansion, military action against the Bosnian \n     Serbs and reduced U.S. economic support.\n       President Boris Yeltsin has strongly endorsed START II, \n     subject only to the condition that the ABM Treaty remain in \n     force. Although members of the Russian Parliament have \n     attacked the agreement as biased against Russia, support for \n     the agreement from the Russian military has helped counter \n     much of the criticism. The military recognizes that it does \n     not need and cannot afford its current strategic force \n     structure and appreciates the value of maintaining strategic \n     parity with the United States. Faced with a more \n     nationalistic Parliament and U.S. endorsement of a national \n     ABM system, the Russian military cannot be expected to carry \n     the torch for START II into the post-Yeltsin era.\n       Delay invites unanticipated, disruptive events to \n     intervene. Progress on a comprehensive test ban was \n     interrupted by external events in the Eisenhower, Kennedy and \n     Carter administrations. START I was signed by President \n     George Bush in July 1991, but entry into force was delayed \n     until December 1994. START II, signed by Bush in January \n     1993, has been delayed first by the problem of resolving the \n     nuclear status of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and now by \n     the actions of a single cantankerous senator. A future \n     Russian Parliament may be the next barrier. But Russia's \n     uncertain future is all the more reason to move promptly to \n     pin down these gains for U.S. and international security \n     before unanticipated events make START II's entry into force \n     impossible.\n       These truly bipartisan treaties, which were negotiated and \n     signed by former President Bush and nurtured by the Clinton \n     administration, must not be casually sacrificed as hostages \n     in guerilla political warfare. The Senate Republican \n     leadership has a clear obligation to persuade Helms to \n     release them without further delay so the Senate can perform \n     its constitutional role in foreign policy. If the Republican \n     leadership acquiesces in this exhibition of irresponsible \n     personal politics, it will not only have relinquished its \n     deserved share of credit for the treaties, but it will have \n     to accept responsibility for this blow to U.S. security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time if \nSenator Kerry could yield back his.\n  This back and forth like two sore-tailed cats in a room full of \nrocking chairs is not serving the Senate well, and I do not intend to \nparticipate in it any further. And I am a little bit sorry that I did \nat all.\n  But I accept the Senator's criticism. I know how he feels, and he \nknows how I feel, too.\n  So, tentatively, I yield the remainder of my time pending whether \nSenator Kerry yields his back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Helms \nyielded back his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has indicated that he is prepared \nto yield back the remainder of his time pending the decision on the \npart of the Senator from Massachusetts to do so as well.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe the business before the Senate is \nthe amendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I believe it is understood between us that this will be \napproved on a voice vote. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask the Chair to put the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The amendment (No. 3100) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thought I had yielded mine back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is now yielded back.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Foreign Relations \nCommittee is discharged from the consideration of the House companion \nbill, H.R. 1561.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1561) to consolidate the foreign affairs \n     agencies of the United States; to authorize appropriations \n     for the Department of State and related agencies for fiscal \n     years 1996 and 1997; to responsibly reduce authorization for \n     appropriations for United States foreign assistance programs \n     for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause is stricken, the text of S. 908, as amended, is \ninserted in lieu thereof, and the bill is considered read a third time.\n  The question now occurs on passage of H.R. 1561, as amended. \n  \n[[Page S18637]]\n\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nconfirmation of Senator James R. Sasser to be the next United States \nAmbassador to the People's Republic of China. In my opinion President \nClinton could not have made a better choice.\n  During the last few months, relations between the United States and \nChina have stumbled along a very rocky road. With increased tensions \nand frustrations between our two governments, we have sorely missed the \npresence of a U.S. Ambassador in Beijing to represent our policy and to \nfacilitate much-needed communications. Unfortunately, the nominations \nprocess was held up here in our own Chambers. However, recent \ndevelopments have encouraged me to believe that Senator Sasser will \nsoon be able to take his post in Beijing.\n  I am anxious to reassure the Chinese Government that the delay here \nin the Senate is in no respect reflective of the sentiment of the \nSenate about the capabilities of Jim Sasser. In fact, I could not speak \nmore highly of this nominee and his outstanding capacity to serve both \nof our countries well. The Chinese are very fortunate to receive a \nrepresentative of the United States who is close to the President and \ncan communicate directly with him on important issues. In addition to \nhis valuable ties to the White House, Senator Sasser is a highly \neducated, articulate, and thoughtful man. He has approached this \nposition with enthusiasm and a dedication to learning about his new \nhost country. I have know Jim Sasser since I first arrived in this \nSenate body 15 years ago. Over the years, I have admired his \noutstanding commitment to public service and appreciate the efforts he \nhas made to improve the lives of his constituents and the citizens of \nthis country. I know that, in his new capacity as Ambassador to China, \nJim Sasser will once again display this commitment with dignity and \nstrength.\n  The Clinton administration has chosen wisely by nominating Senator \nSasser to the important post of Ambassador to China. The People's \nRepublic of China is an increasingly significant player in the \ninternational arena and in United States foreign policy. While our \neconomic, political, and security ties with China have multiplied over \nthe last decade, we are still facing many areas of disagreement. We \nshould move quickly to install our Ambassador in Beijing, to \ndemonstrate our good intentions to the Chinese. Swift Senate approval \nof Jim Sasser will offer new opportunities for communication and \ncooperation between our two countries.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senate has just acquitted itself very \nwell by approving a list of ambassadors, particularly that of our \nformer colleague, Jim Sasser.\n  Jim Sasser came to the U.S. Senate in 1978. He acquitted himself \nimmediately with his colleagues in a most admirable manner. We all knew \nshortly that Jim Sasser had a very keen mind and quick wit. He \ningratiated himself very well with his colleagues and almost instantly \nbecame one of the most popular Senators; by the time he left here, in \nmy opinion, he was the very best Senator in the U.S. Senate.\n  His tenure as chairman of the Budget Committee was exemplary. Hour \nafter hour after hour he sat there in the manager's chair, dealing with \nthe most complex and difficult legislation of the year, and that was \nthe budget.\n  It is a real travesty that the confirmation of a man of his talents \nhas been held up for so very long, at a time when American-Chinese \nrelations need a good, strong Ambassador more than ever. I promise my \ncolleagues--and of course most of you know this--that Jim Sasser will \nrepresent this country with great distinction. He will do it with \ndignity and with integrity.\n  The Chinese will find very quickly what all of us found very quickly, \nthat he is a quick learner. His integrity is absolutely unimpeachable.\n  This is a great day for him and his family. His lovely wife Mary and \ntheir beautiful daughter Elizabeth will be accompanying him to China. \nThey have waited a long time. They have been hanging by their thumbs, \nwondering whether they would be able to go to Beijing, for almost a \nyear now.\n  So this is a great day for the Sasser family. It is a great day for \nthe Chinese. Above all, it is a great day for America, that we can \nappoint somebody of his talent and his skills.\n  Finally, I want to personally, and I know I speak for almost all of \nmy colleagues, wish him Godspeed and much luck. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the Senator for \nyielding me this time, because a few moments ago the Senate voted to \nconfirm 19 ambassadorial nominees. I am very pleased, as I know my \ncolleagues are, that these nominations are finally moving forward. I am \nespecially happy to note that my friend, and I should certainly say our \nfriend and former colleague, Jim Sasser, will soon be allowed to take \nhis post as United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.\n  As we enter a new century, it is my belief no other international \nrelationship is filled with more potential, or fraught with more \ndangers than the United States relationship with China. In recent \nyears, China has become one of the world's fastest-growing economic and \nmilitary powers. China is already a major player in Asia, and in the \ncoming years we will likely see it assert itself as a full-fledged \ninternational power.\n  The Clinton administration has rightly concluded that it is in \nAmerica's best interest to stay actively engaged with the Chinese. \nAlthough our two countries often have sharp differences on both \neconomic and human rights issues, it is very important to maintain a \nconstant dialogue between Beijing and Washington. Put simply, the \nfuture stability and prosperity of the Pacific rim are largely \ndependent on a cooperative U.S. relationship.\n  Mr. President, this administration has also rightly concluded that \nthe best person, the very best person, to represent America in China at \nthis moment, the right person to guide our foreign policy in China \nduring this critical time, is our good friend and former colleague, \nJames R. Sasser of Tennessee.\n  I want to congratulate Jim Sasser today. I recognize how fortunate \nour country is that he has agreed to accept this enormous challenge.\n  I also want to commend President Clinton for choosing such an \noutstanding person to represent our interests in Beijing. Like many of \nmy colleagues, I had the pleasure of working with him during a large \nportion of his 18 years of service to the people of Tennessee and \nAmerica.\n  During his time in this body, Jim Sasser earned a reputation as one \nof the Senate's most thoughtful and skillful Members. As my colleagues \nknow, the dynamics of the Senate require that Members often put \npartisanship aside in order to get things done. Jim Sasser was someone \nwhom Senators on both sides of the aisle could count on to roll up his \nsleeves and do the job right.\n  Mr. President, a prominent example of Senator Sasser's skill and \ndedication can be found in his work as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. As my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, will tell \nyou, leadership of the Budget Committee can be one of the Senate's most \nthankless tasks. It is a difficult job, requiring an ability to balance \nthe priorities of colleagues from both parties. I think all of my \ncolleagues will agree that Senator Sasser's chairmanship was notable \nfor its honesty, patience, and above all, fairness. It is the \ncharacteristic of that fairness that is the hallmark in Jim Sasser's \nlife.\n  In the coming days, Senator Sasser will begin to put his considerable \ntalents to work as Ambassador to China. As he no doubt realizes, there \nis much work to be done. During the past year, United States-Chinese \nrelations have been strained by continuing trade disputes and the \nTaiwan issue. The United States needs someone who can improve the \ndialog with China while at the same time holding firm to American \nprinciples. Jim Sasser is more than up to this challenge.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by wishing our firend Jim Sasser and \nhis family the best of luck as he continues to serve his Nation as \nAmbassador to China. I have every confidence that his tenure will be \nmarked by distinction and success. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S18639]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to join both Senators from \nArkansas in stating what an excellent choice Jim Sasser is for \nAmbassador to China.\n  I had the good fortune to be in Beijing this summer and to see \nfirsthand the importance of that post which the President has chosen \nSenator Sasser to fill. I had the good fortune to serve here in the \nSenate for 12 years with Jim Sasser. I know of his great negotiating \nskills, his great leadership ability, and I believe his great advocacy \nskills, which will serve him well and serve this country well in this \nnew position which he is about to take on.\n  So I think the Senate has acted very appropriately, the President has \nacted appropriately, and I look forward to the day when Jim Sasser is \nour representative, very soon, in Beijing. I again commend all Senators \nfor voting for his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18637-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my distinguished \nranking member. We have before us the VA-HUD appropriations conference \nreport. As I understand it, there is to be 30 minutes equally divided \nbetween the two managers, 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nBumpers, 10 minutes under the control of Senator Boxer, 10 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Hutchison, 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Lautenberg, and 10 minutes under the control of Senator McCain.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate will come \nto order. The Senator from Missouri has the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is with some pride, some relief, and some \nfrustration, I now present to the Senate the conference report on the \nappropriations bill for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, and \nHousing and Urban Development, and independent agencies for fiscal year \n1996. Consideration of this bill has been a long, difficult process. \nWhile we should have been able to complete our work long before now, I \ndo believe we have wasted little of this time in producing the best \npossible measure for consideration by the Senate.\n  Work on this measure began over a year ago, beginning with analyses \nof budgetary trends and programmatic needs for activities under the \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction. It was obvious at that time, that our \nFederal low-income housing programs were out of budgetary control. \nConcerted policy reform was critical to avoid a disaster of \nunprecedented magnitude.\n  In January of this year, as the newly selected chairman of this \nsubcommittee, I convened a series of special hearings on the budgetary \nand management crisis at HUD. We detailed the magnitude of our \nbudgetary shortfall to maintain the existing multifamily subsidized \nhousing inventory of the Department. We explored urgently needed \nreforms in the housing preservation program to reduce cost, avoid \nwindfall payments, and reduce long- term rental subsidies. We also \ndelineated policy changes in public housing to reduce bureaucratic \noverregulation and micromanagement, to increase local flexibility, \ndecisionmaking, and efficiencies.\n  From these hearings we developed a strategy to begin these \ncomprehensive changes in Federal housing programs. First, in the \nDisaster Supplemental and Rescission Act we initiated the first round \nof deregulation, and rescinded $6.5 billion of previously appropriated \nHUD funds to turn-off the spigot of unsustainable housing subsidy \ncommitments. At that time we noted the urgency of comprehensive housing \nauthorization legislation to complete this reform effort during fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation has been delayed, although we remain \nhopeful that early next year the measures reported by both the House \nand Senate authorizing committees will pass the Congress. In the \nabsence of such legislation, however, we have used the appropriations \nprocess to establish a strong foundation in beginning the major reform \nand overhaul of HUD. The measure before us today reflects almost all of \nthe reform proposals which passed the Senate in September. They include \npublic housing and assisted housing rent reforms, including a minimum \nrent, repeal for onerous Federal resident selection criteria, free-\nmarket decontrol of section 8 lease terms, and flexibility in resident \nincome mix and funds utilization.\n  This measure maintains the Senate-passed public housing demonstration \ninitiative which will allow up to 30 public housing authorities to \ncombine public housing and section 8 subsidies into a locally \ndetermined low-income housing assistance block grant. In addition, the \nbill also includes the Senate proposed multifamily mark-to-market \ndemonstration, which is discretionary authority for the Department, and \nwilling apartment development owners, the opportunity to explore work-\nout strategies which reduce dependence on rental subsidies while \npreserving affordable housing. Coupled with the one-time, 1-year \nextension of expiring project-based subsidy contracts, the multifamily \nhousing demonstration authority sets the stage for consideration and \nenactment of needed comprehensive reform legislation next year.\n  Mr. President, the measure before us also maintains the effort \nrecommended \n\n[[Page S18640]]\nby the Senate to fund a reformed housing preservation program. As I \nnoted earlier, the committee identified a number of very troubling \ndefects and problems in the previously enacted Low Income Housing \nPreservation and Resident Homeownership Act [LIHPRHA]. In fact, the HUD \ninspector general labeled this program as a ``rip-off'' and urged \nreform or termination. But with as many as 150,000 affordable housing \nunits at risk, the committee chose the more difficult task of \nidentifying less costly and more efficient means of preserving this \nvaluable housing resource. Working with residents, owners, nonprofit \norganizations, and the Department, a strategy to prioritize sales to \nnon-profits and tenant-sponsored organizations utilizing capital grants \nwas developed and is provided for in this conference agreement. This \nprovides the best means of assuring long-term preservation of this \nhousing without encumbering the government with expensive and \ncontinuing rental subsidy obligations.\n  It was our intent that the Department cut off any further use of \nsection 8 assistance to finance these preservation arrangements. The \nDepartment has already initiated the use of capital grants to finance \nsales of these developments, and we expect that similar authority will \nbe identified or enacted to utilize similar capital loans for \nrefinancing preservation agreements when such projects become eligible \nfor funding in July.\n  Because of technical budgetary rules, the committee was not able to \ndelineate fully these program changes within the conference agreement. \nMoreover, in connection with the larger issue of maintaining the \ninventory of the newer-assisted section 8 new construction-substantial \nrehabilitation multifamily projects, Congress will be required to \naddress these complex and difficult housing finance issues in a \ncomprehensive authorization measure next year. At that time, we hope to \nenact a carefully targeted and efficient housing preservation program. \nPending that action, the conference agreement provides the Department \nthe authority and resources to minimize potential displacement of low-\nincome families.\n  Mr. President, the housing preservation program included in this \nconference agreement also recognizes that the severe budgetary \nconstraints on these housing activities will not permit preservation of \nall units under all circumstances. This measure will permit owners to \nprepay their existing mortgages, as was provided for in their original \nsubsidy contracts, because we cannot afford to compensate every owner \nto maintain these developments as low-income housing. In those cases, \nhowever, existing law, and the conference agreement does provide for \nsection 8 assistance to avoid involuntary displacement of families due \nto increased rent burdens, and moving expenses if these developments \nare converted to other uses.\n\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement affords the highest priority \nto veterans programs. The largest increase in the conference \nagreement--$400 million--goes to veterans medical care, for a total of \n$16.564 billion. The amount provided ensures that all veterans \ncurrently receiving care in VA medical facilities will continue to \nreceive high-quality medical care. The conference agreement makes no \nreductions to patient care at the VA. It requires administrative \nimprovements--which have been recommended by VA's own inspector general \nand the General Accounting Office--to make budgetary savings so that \nVA's medical dollars are spent on veterans, not on bureaucracy and \nadministrative waste.\n  The conference agreement provides the full budget request for VA's \nresearch program, a program critical to ensuring VA recruits and \nretains top quality medical personnel. In addition the bill also \nprovides full funding for the staff needed to process compensation and \npensions claims, so that VA's claims backlog can be eliminated and \nveterans won't have to wait 6 months or longer to receive an answer on \ntheir claim. It provides funding for a study of VA's claims processing \nsystem by the National Academy of Public Administration, which we \nexpect will provide specific recommendations for improving and \nexpediting VA's antiquated system.\n  The conference agreement provides $136,155,000 for VA major \nconstruction, an increase of approximately $100 million over the \nSenate-passed level. The agreement provides funding for authorized \nconstruction projects only. No new hospital construction is funded, \nfollowing the recommendations of the General Accounting Office, and in \nview of the need to curtail future budgetary commitments.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement provides $9 million for the \nCourt of Veterans Appeals, the same amount recommended by both the \nHouse and Senate for fiscal year 1996. As with all agencies and \nactivities under this subcommittee's jurisdiction, the court is being \nrequired to absorb a reduction in funding in fiscal year 1996 in an \neffort to reach a balanced budget. While less than the amount \nrequested, the amount provided should be adequate for the court's \noperations in fiscal year 1996.\n  Despite the fact that the court's budget has been reduced, I believe \nthat the pro bono representation program should receive full funding in \nfiscal year 1996. This program has proven very successful in helping \nthe court to address adequately the very large number of pro se cases.\n  I am troubled by reports that the chief judge does not intend to \nprovide any funds for the pro bono program this year in view of \nbudgetary reductions. I wish to remind the court of the Congress' \nsupport for this program, and the fact that the Senate committee report \naccompanying H.R. 2099 indicated that the program was to receive the \nfull budget request. Any changes will be made only upon the \nnotification and approval of the Committees on Appropriations.\n  While I certainly do not oppose private sector funding for this \nprogram, to my knowledge such funding sources have not been identified, \nand until there is adequate private sector funding, I do not believe it \nis prudent to withdraw Federal support.\n  Mr. President, for the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nconference agreement provides $5.7 billion, an increase of $48 million \nover the Senate-passed level and a reduction of just $235 million--4 \npercent--below the fiscal year 1995 post rescission level.\n  The largest reductions below fiscal year 1995 come from earmarked \nwater and sewer projects--a reduction of $500 million below last year, \nand from Superfund, a program which everyone agrees simply is not \nworking as it should, and one which desperately needs reforms before we \nprovide significant additional funding.\n  Despite substantial reservations about funding a program which is as \nflawed as Superfund, the conferees found an additional $160 million for \nSuperfund above the House- and Senate-passed levels, for a total of \n$1.163 billion. This is a reduction of $172 million below current \nspending, most of which is taken from management and support costs and \nlower priority activities. All Superfund sites posing an immediate risk \nto human health and the environment will be funded under the conference \nagreement.\n  The conferees funded EPA's drinking water State revolving fund \nprogram, which is not yet authorized, at the President's request of \n$500 million, of which $225 million is from previous year's \nappropriations. The Senate recently passed the legislation authorizing \nthis important program, and I hope the House will pass similar \nlegislation shortly so that the States may spend these funds in fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  For clean water State revolving funds, the conferees provided $1.125 \nbillion. In addition, if drinking water legislation is not enacted by \nJune 1, 1996, the conference report stipulates that the $500 million in \ndrinking water State revolving funds will become immediately available \nfor clean water State revolving funds, for a total of $1.625 billion. \nThis ensures that the States will be able to spend these funds in \nfiscal year 1996, regardless of whether drinking water legislation is \nenacted.\n  EPA's science and technology account is funded at $525 million, the \nsame level of funding as fiscal year 1995. The conferees recognized the \nimportance of ensuring adequate funding for the research activities \nwhich support EPA policy and decisionmaking. Additional funds are \nprovided for research into the health effects of arsenic, so that we \nhave the best science for a new standard for arsenic in drinking water. \n\n\n[[Page S18641]]\n\n  EPA's environmental programs and management are funded at $1.55 \nbillion, a reduction of approximately 7 percent below current levels. \nReductions are taken from lower priority activities such as the \nenvironmental technology initiative, which has received substantial \nfunding to date with very little to show for it.\n  As to the so-called EPA riders, the conference agreement does not \ninclude any of the 17 House riders. Instead, the conference agreement \nincludes only six legislative provisions for EPA--most of which are \ncompletely non-controversial and several of which were included in \nprevious VA-HUD bills.\n\n  Mr. President, while the statement of the managers accompanying the \nconference report includes some language on legislative issues which \nhad been included as riders in the House bill, in no case does the \nstatement of the managers limit spending or direct that a specific \nrulemaking or activity be discontinued. The conferees simply urge EPA \nto consider reviewing these issues.\n  It should be noted, that this conference agreement will provide the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency an 11\\1/2\\ percent increase over the \nfunding levels currently stipulated by the continuing resolution. \nAnyone who is concerned about potential cutbacks in EPA enforcement \nactivities should understand, in clear and unmistakable terms, that \nfailure to enact this conference agreement means deeper and more \ndevastating cut-backs in that Agency's activities.\n  Mr. President, the House, 2 weeks ago, recommitted our conference \nagreement on this bill. The second conference on the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Bill adopted a package of technical amendments and \ncorrections. In addition it included an amendment to the National \nService appropriation to reflect the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate of close-out costs. Finally, conferees amended the previous \nagreement to freeze administrative fees of the HUD section 8 program \nand thereby address concerns over the unintended consequences of \nattempting to institute a two-tiered reimbursement system.\n  As noted earlier, further increases for VA Medical Care would only \nmean much deeper cuts in the other agencies funded in this bill. No \nconferee advocated such an adjustment. Furthermore, I believe we must \ninsist that the VA implement improvements and reforms before providing \nfurther funding increases. We all support the best possible medical \ncare for those who have been injured or wounded in defense of our \nNation. Unfortunately, even with all the money in the world, there is \nno assurance that VA's existing bureaucratic structure could deliver \nsuch services, and we must demand these corrections.\n  Mr. President, this is a good conference agreement which, within our \nvery severe budgetary and legislative constraints, goes a long way \ntoward needed reforms in HUD, VA, and EPA. It addresses the highest \npriority needs served by agencies within the subcommittee's \njurisdiction, and it is fully in compliance with our fundamental goal \nof bringing the Government's budget into balance.\n  I hope that this bill will be enacted. It needs to be enacted soon, \nif only to begin the process of reforming HUD housing programs which \nwill permit future year cost savings and efficiencies, to improve the \nquality of EPA regulatory decisionmaking so that it is based on sound \nscience, and to infuse modern medical practices into the archaic and \nbureaucratic veterans health care system.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately I must report that despite our best \nefforts and repeated attempts, we have been unsuccessful in gaining the \nattention of the White House to negotiate a reasonable compromise on \ntheir demands for more spending, far more than what any balanced budget \nplan can accommodate. That is the source of my very deep frustration \nover this bill.\n  I have stated repeatedly that while some White House priorities are \nvery different from my own and that of a majority of the Congress, we \nare prepared to sit down and seek a reasonable compromise on these \nissues. Matters such as the national service program, one of this \nadministration's highest priorities, is an activity which I believe is \nvery flawed in its approach and rife with misuse in its current \nmanagement. I don't disagree with the fundamental goal of this program, \nbut I cannot recommend more funding for the current program. \nTermination of this program is proposed in this conference agreement, \nbut we have offered to consider additional funding if necessary reforms \ncould be negotiated. Unfortunately, these offers have fallen on deaf \nears in the White House, and only further threats of a veto have been \ncommunicated back to us.\n  Mr. President, this is no way to run a government. It certainly is no \nway to consider and enact legislation to assure the taxpayers that the \nsums we propose to spend are being devoted only to the most critical \nneeds and in the most efficient manner possible. Unfortunately, unless \nthe White House changes its tune, we have no alternative but to proceed \nwith the agreement before us, despite the veto threats. We can only \nhope that by the end of this session some agreement with the \nadministration can be struck, and the many critically needed reforms \nincluded in this bill will be enacted into law.\n  I think we were very successful in the conference. With the very able \nassistance of our ranking member, we prevailed on many of the issues. \nThis measure is not an easy one because we took a 12-percent cut this \nyear from the appropriated level last year. Nevertheless, we have tried \nto accommodate the various needs of the many agencies under the control \nof this subcommittee. I think this is a good measure. We have been \nadvised by the President's representative that he does plan on vetoing \nit.\n  Earlier today, I made a very strong plea that the administration \nreconsider that decision. There has been a great deal of objection from \nthe administration to the very low level of funding available for \ncertain vital EPA functions, particularly in the enforcement area. \nUnder the continuing resolution, there is only $320 million available \nfor EPA enforcement in the current year, if the continuing resolution \nis in effect. Under this measure, we have raised that amount to $449 \nmillion.\n  I have also previously stated that we tried on numerous occasions to \nenlist the representatives of the administration in constructive \nnegotiations with us as to how we might reallocate the funds within the \nbudget allocation. The response has been solely that they want $2 \nbillion more. It is beyond the ability of this committee to grant them \nthat money. I would suggest very strongly that if the administration \ndoes not like the CR funding level for EPA and the other agencies, they \ncan sign this bill and get about an 11.5 percent increase in funding \nfor EPA. If at a later date in the process of negotiations between the \ncongressional leadership and the White House a decision is made at that \nlevel to make available more dollars for the functions in this bill, \nthen they could at that time add it in a continuing resolution.\n  There are certain measures that I know are very important to the \nadministration. The ranking member has argued very strongly to continue \nfunding of the national service. We were unable to find that money in \nthe very narrow allocation that we had, although had the administration \nbeen willing to negotiate with us and support the bill, I am confident \nwe could have. We would have not been able, however, to pass the \nmeasure with majority party support if we had put in a large amount for \nnational service.\n  I remain hopeful that this measure can be signed, and at such \nappropriate time as the administration, the congressional leadership \nreach agreement on additional funding which may be available to these \nfunctions, they would include it in a continuing resolution.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is the toughest year I have ever \nfaced as a member of the Appropriations Committee. I would like to \nthank Senator Bond and his staff, who worked very hard, under difficult \nconditions, to bring this bill to the floor. I also want to thank my \nown staff for the hard work that they put in and their effort to try to \ncreate a VA-HUD appropriations bill that would pass the Senate and be \napproved by the President.\n  However, I believe that this bill will be vetoed, and I believe that \nthe bill will be vetoed not because of the hard work of the chairman, \nnot because of \n\n[[Page S18642]]\nour attempt to strategize on an effective allocation of funds, but this \nyear was so tough simply because of the modest allocation we received, \nand that was due to the issues related to the budget.\n  The amount that this subcommittee was allowed to devote to so many \nimportant priorities is indeed skimpy. Under these conditions I believe \nSenator Bond has done a commendable job. I chaired this committee for 6 \nyears and brought six bills to the floor. I know how much work it is, \nand, again, I am going to thank him for his cooperative effort. He \ntried very hard to bring about change. I believe this bill reflects \nthis change.\n  I believe that this bill begins to reform HUD. It puts into action \nthe recommendations of the National Academy of Public Administration to \nreform the structure of HUD and consolidate its maze of programs so we \nget a dollar's worth of services for the poor and homeownership instead \nof dollars going to a bureaucracy.\n  This bill also streamlines the EPA. It follows the National Academy \nof Public Administration's recommendations to streamline EPA management \nand get started on a strategy to put EPA's resources where they are \nmost needed, to be based on the risk to human health and safety.\n  There are other things about this bill that I like. First is Mission \nto Planet Earth. The funding cut was limited to only $75 million. \nOrdinarily I would say, ``Wow, cutting $75 million,'' but given the \nfact that we faced a $300 million cut, I believe we preserved the \nMission to Planet Earth. The House bill cut much of the crucial space \nscience programs, and the House language was to close NASA space flight \ncenters, and those things have been removed from the conference report.\n  Second, veterans medical research is fully funded at the President's \nrequest of $257 million, and a provision to deny benefits to vets who \nbecome mentally incapacitated has been removed.\n  Third, this bill will help those who want to help themselves. It \ncontains a moving-to-work demonstration project for public housing \nresidents, and rent ceilings and income disregards to help support the \nworking poor.\n\n  Fourth, Federal housing preferences were moved, which I believe led \nto the ZIP codes of pathology in public housing. And I am pleased they, \ntoo, have been removed.\n  Lastly, the conference report removes House language to prevent HUD \nfrom enforcing fair housing laws on property insurance red lining.\n  But, Mr. President, unfortunately, serious problems remain in this \nbill. If these problems are not worked out, the President will veto \nthis bill.\n  The first problem is that this bill contains no funding to continue \nnational service. National service creates an opportunity structure in \nwhich young people can earn credit for higher education while serving \ntheir communities. It gives help to those who practice self-help and \ngives low- and middle-income young people access to the American dream.\n  National service makes voluntarism a fact of life and rekindles the \nhabits of the heart. It fosters the spirit of neighbor helping neighbor \nthat has made our country great.\n  The second concern that I have is in the area of veterans medical \ncare. The bill reduces veterans medical care by $400 million below the \nPresident's request. With the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid that loom \non the horizon, many vets will turn to the VA for medical care but will \nbe turned away because there is not enough money. This, I know, the \nPresident cannot support.\n  Our Nation's veterans did not hesitate to risk their lives for our \nfreedom. There should be no hesitation to fund their health care. When \nthey went to war, we told them we would provide health care. I believe \npromises made should be promises kept.\n  The third serious problem is EPA funding. EPA must be funded to \nprotect health and environment. This bill funds EPA $1.5 billion below \nthe President's request, and it will hinder the EPA's ability to do its \njob in enforcement and in Superfund legislation.\n  Finally, this bill will transfer HUD's authority to enforce fair \nhousing to the Department of Justice. On this side of the aisle we are \nopposed to this. Removing this authority from HUD is a step backward in \ntime, and the transfer to Justice will hollow out fair housing \nenforcement efforts. This flies in the face of civil rights progress we \nhave made over the last 25 years.\n  It is for these reasons that I oppose this bill. I know my colleagues \non this side of the aisle will oppose it. It is regrettable that a \nbudget agreement could not be arrived at so that Senator Bond and I, \nwith the new allocation, could have moved forward to avoid a veto. I \nknow that Senator Bond, and I must say Chairman Jerry Lewis on the \nHouse side, have worked very hard and been open to further negotiations \nwith the White House to avoid a veto. I thank them for that. I want to \nagain thank Senator Bond for his willingness to listen to our concerns.\n  I think a better allocation would produce a better bill. I regret \nthat we are heading for a veto. With these remarks, though, we could \ntalk long into the night. I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield myself just 1 minute, and then I would like to \nyield. But first, let me point out that occasionally we do get some \nhumor in these proceedings, these very serious matters we are dealing \nwith. I got this statement of administration policy. At the end of it, \nit said, ``The administration would like to work with the Congress to \naddress the issues discussed above.''\n  Well, they have done a pretty good job of preventing working with us \nafter spending 3 frustrating weeks trying to hear from them. I find out \nnow in their written statement that they want to work with me. I have a \ntelephone number. It is listed. I can be reached. Nobody called.\n  Let me just say that all of the items you can make an argument we \nneed more money for. Nobody is willing to come forward and say where \nthe cuts are made. We cut low-priority EPA items, useless funds in \nSuperfund, earmarked or pork projects in waste-water treatment. I think \nwe have done as good a job as we can under the circumstances.\n  Mr. President, if I may, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the \nSenator from North Carolina. I know that the Senator from Arizona is \nhere. He has the longer statement. The Senator from North Carolina had \nasked for 3 minutes. I yield 3 minutes to him.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank Senator Bond.\n  Mr. President, the conference report provides $19 billion for the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. Since HUD was created in \n1965, spending for HUD has increased every single year. HUD's spending \nis increasing so rapidly that by the year 2000, spending on housing \nwill be our largest domestic discretionary spending item. In fact, HUD \nhas unused budget authority of over $190 billion--unused budget \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is significant because, for the \nfirst time, it begins to reverse the spending trend at HUD. For the \nfirst time in a long time, spending at HUD will decline, and the \nAmerican people will be better off for it.\n  While I appreciate what the Appropriations Committee has done for the \nshort term, I think the long-term future of HUD has to be decided and \nwhat direction we are going to move it in.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senator Dole and Senator Abraham \nthat eliminates HUD.\n  The legislation we have introduced also provides a clear roadmap as \nto how HUD can be eliminated. Regrettably, HUD has become a mammoth \nbureaucracy with over 11,000 employees. It has 240 housing programs--so \nmany that Secretary Cisneros did not even know he had that number. HUD \nhas entangled the American taxpayers in 23,000 long-term housing \nassistance contracts that will not expire until well past the year \n2000.\n  In short, HUD as it is currently constructed, cannot continue. We \nneed to begin working on how it can be replaced.\n  Mr. President, let me also add that while there are significant cuts \nin this bill, there are still some that can be cut a lot more. For \nexample, this bill provides $15 million for the Tenant Opportunity \nProgram--whatever that is. Recently, the Washington Times reported that \nat least $70,000 from the Tenant Opportunity Program was used to \nessentially pay for a vacation to \n\n[[Page S18643]]\nPuerto Rico for public housing tenants from Detroit. Mr. President, \nthat is taxpayers' money that people worked for that is paying for \nvacations for tenants. In all, we do not know how many people used \ntaxpayers' money, the bookkeeping is so confused. But if one used it, \nthat is one too many.\n  Mr. President, I support the bill, but we need to do a lot more to \ncut HUD. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield to the Senator from Arizona 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first let me praise the managers of this \nbill for all their hard work. Although I have concerns about this \nmeasure, it contains many good, worthwhile provisions.\n  Mr. President, as always I remain very concerned about items added in \nconference that were never considered in either the House or the \nSenate. It is wrong when pork barrel projects are added in the dark of \nnight to the benefit of certain States and districts. The American \npublic as a whole will benefit most when as distribution of \ndiscretionary funds are allocated through competitive bidding and on \nthe basis of need as prioritized on a national level. I would hope we \ncan move more in that direction in the future.\n  I want to raise two specific matters contained in the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Conference report.\n  Section 218 calls for debt forgiveness for the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development to cancel the indebtedness of the Hubbard \nHospital Authority of Hubbard, TX, the Groveton, Texas Hospital \nAuthority, and the Hepzibah Public Service in Hepzibah, WV.\n  I am very concerned about this mandate. The report that explains this \naction merely states: ``These loans were previously written off as \nuncollectible and will not increase the Federal debt.''\n  Unfortunately, this sheds little light on the subject. I would hope \nthat the distinguished managers of the bill--who deserve praise for \ndoing a great deal of good work--would explain why this language will \nadded to the bill in conference and give a rationale for its apparent \nurgency.\n  I would also like to know why are we mandating this action. Might it \nnot be more appropriate to authorized to the Secretary to take such \naction in a manner that treats all other similarly situated entities \nand localities in a fair and equitable manner?\n  I am sure there are other localities around this Nation that would \nlike to have their indebtedness forgiven and doing so in conference \ngreatly concerns me.\n  Mr. President, I am also interested in section 221 of the bill. \nSection 221 allows for funds to be used in California and Ohio for \ndifferent purposes than they were originally proscribed. I would \ninquire of the managers why this language is necessary?\n  Mr. President, is this not the exact argument why earmarking does not \ntruly serve the public interest. When we earmark and ignore national or \nregional priorities and then those priorities change, we are forced to \nchange the law or further earmark funds. This clearly demonstrates \nmicromanagement at its worst.\n  And it is this micromanagement, this endemic earmarking, that has \ncaused us to waste billions of dollars. Are these projects I mentioned \ntoday costing the taxpayers millions of dollars? Maybe. But we must \nchange our way of thinking. We must pass a truly balanced budget. We \nmust pass this year the line item veto. And we must stop earmarking.\n  Unfortunately, it is entirely too easy to say ``yes'' around here and \nlittle courage demonstrated to say ``no''. It is much easier to say yes \nto a colleague who wants to bring home a little piece of pork. But we \nwere not sent here to go along to get along. As Senator Gramm noted \nearlier today on the floor in an outstanding statement regarding the \nbudget, the American people sent us here in 1994 to change the way \nthings are done. We were not sent here so that there would be new faces \nbefore the cameras voicing the same old fiscal practices of the past.\n  I am hopeful we will send the President line item veto legislation in \nthe upcoming weeks. It will serve as further notice that the changes \ncalled for in 1994 are indeed becoming a reality. I would hope that we \nwill continue to act in a manner that reflects this new thinking.\n  I congratulate the managers on a fine job, and it is my understanding \nthat the distinguished manager will supply the responses to my concerns \nfor the Record.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me take a minute and thank the Senator \nfrom Arizona. Basically, as he indicated, the debt forgiveness was \ndesigned to clear the books. There is no prospect of recovery. We will \nprovide a fuller answer for the Record. The two provisions relating to \nTexas were included in the House. The one with respect to West Virginia \nwas added in the conference. We will provide the full information on \nthat.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, am I recognized for 10 minutes under the \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will not vote for the bill before us \nprincipally because it has the space station in it, $2.114 billion, \nwhile we cut EPA by about $1.5 billion and veterans medical services by \nsomewhere between $300 and $600 million. The space station, which is \nnow calculated by the General Accounting Office to cost $94 billion, \nstill does not have one single redeeming value. Of the $94 billion it \nis going to cost, $90 billion of that is going to come from the United \nStates. You hear the argument made this is now an international \nundertaking. That is some undertaking when we are putting up $90 \nbillion of the $94 billion it is going to cost.\n  Now, for the past several days, we have been reading that even though \nNASA is giving the Russians $200 million a year to participate in this \nprogram--so much for international participation because they are \nparticipating and we are giving them the money to participate--they are \nsaying they cannot afford to fulfil their part of the program because \nwe are not giving them enough. So now they are proposing that we allow \nthem to use a part of their existing Mir space station, hang it onto \nour space station and let that count as a contributory share.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take up much time on that. I intend \nto vote against the bill. I am just saying what I have been saying on \nthis floor for about 6 years now. The space station is going to be one \ndisaster after another. This year it is the Russians. Next year, it \nwill be something else.\n  My staff brought me a little squib on some company that said they had \nbeen able to use protein crystals that had been grown on one of the \nshuttles to develop a flu vaccine, which they hope to finish and \nperfect by the year 2000. I read the story closely since NASA keeps \nsaying that we will cure all kinds of diseases if only we spend $94 \nbillion on the space station. Well, what the president of the company \nsaid was that it was nice to have the space shuttle to develop these \ncrystals, but they could do it on the ground, and they were going to do \nit anyway. The space shuttle happened to be handy so they used it at \ntaxpayer expense.\n  None of the pharmaceutical companies in this country is willing to \npay for any share of the shuttle or the space station as of this date. \nYet, you keep hearing that the space station is going to cure warts, \ncancer, emphysema, and everything else.\n  So I am going to vote ``no'' on that.\n  As far as cuts to the environment, I think this body makes a very bad \nmistake. We act as if all environmental regulation is somehow bad. \nNobody defends environmental regulations that are out of order and \nexcessive. But many environmental regulations are absolutely necessary.\n  This morning, I picked up the paper and saw that the Washington, DC, \nsewage system is going kerplunk. It is dilapidated, worn out, and no \none has the money to repair it. You are reading more and more stories \nabout that all the time. Bear in mind, colleagues, that the environment \ndetermines our very existence, and to build a space station that is \ngoing to cost $94 billion while we have sewage running up and down the \nstreets of this country is an absolute outrage.\n  So I repeat that I won't vote for this bill because the priorities it \nrepresents are all skewed-up.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to commend the tireless efforts of \nthe chairman and ranking member of the \n\n[[Page S18644]]\nVA/HUD Appropriations Committee, Senators Bond and Mikulski, in \nbringing this 1996 VA/HUD conference report to the Senate. As Senators \nmay recall, this is the second iteration of the VA/HUD conference \nreport. The House recommitted the first conference agreement and \nseveral technical changes were made, resulting in a second conference \nreport, which is now before the Senate.\n  This has been a most difficult year for many, if not all, of the \nthirteen appropriation subcommittees. The VA/HUD Subcommittee, for \nexample, has had to make deep cuts in many critical areas totalling \nsome $9.3 billion below the President's 1996 requests. Cuts in funding \nfor veterans, public housing, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nNASA, and in a number of other independent Federal agencies, have been \nnecessary.\n  I greatly appreciate the outstanding work of Senators Bond and \nMikulski over many months in conducting the numerous hearings, the \nsubcommittee and full committee markups, Senate floor consideration, \nand the conference on this very important and complex appropriation \nbill.\n  This is the first year of Senator Bond's chairmanship of the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee and he has carried out his responsibilities admirably, \nunder extreme budgetary constraints. I recognize and compliment his \nefforts.\n  As for the ranking member of the VA/HUD Subcommittee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], I am a great \nadmirer. Senator Mikulski joined the Appropriations Committee in 1987 \nand chaired the VA/HUD Subcommittee from 1989 through 1994. She \nimmediately took charge of this most complex subcommittee and never \nmissed a beat. Each and every year, Senator Mikulski was able to \naccommodate whatever came her way in the form of subcommittee \nallocations which were clearly too small to adequately address the many \ncritical needs under the subcommittee jurisdiction.\n  She never complained; instead, she went about the difficult task of \nmaking the hard decisions of where to cut in the most fair and \nequitable manner. I am certain that her experience and expertise have \nbeen most helpful to the new chairman, Senator Bond, on the bill that \nis now before the Senate.\n  I also thank the very capable and dedicated subcommittee staff: \nStephen Kohashi, Carrier Apostolou, and Lashawnda Leftwich for the \nmajority; and Rusty Mathews and Steve Crane for the minority. Their \nefforts are greatly appreciated.\n  Although this bill may be vetoed by the President, it is in no way a \nreflection upon the admirable work of the subcommittee members and \nstaff.\n\n\n                                 lihpp\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to recognize the chairman's \nsuccessful efforts to not only continue the Low-Income Housing \nPreservation Program in fiscal year 1996, but provide $624 million in \nfunding. This program is extremely important to my state and to many \nacross the country. Thousands of Massachusetts tenants are threatened \nwith displacement if the owners prepay their HUD-assisted mortgages and \nconvert the property to uses other than affordable housing.\n  I am also generally supportive of the reforms to the program that are \nincorporated in the appropriations language. There is significant \nconcern that the program may provide excessive incentives. I am hopeful \nthat the authorizing committee on which I serve will take another look \nat the preservation program next year--with a particularly thorough \nreview of the proposed capital grant approach--and make further \nrefinements with the objective of preserving affordable housing and \npreventing displacement--without unnecessary costs to the taxpayer.\n  Unfortunately, the funding levels and program changes also mean that \nsome owners will now choose to prepay. This raises the concern about \nthe adequacy of protections for the residents of buildings in those \ncircumstances where owners decide to prepay and convert their buildings \nto other uses.\n  The conference report language protects residents by preventing \nowners from prepaying their mortgage unless they agree not to raise \nrents for 60 days following prepayment. The language also raises the \nvalue of vouchers to a rent level necessary to allow the residents to \nstay in the buildings. These are appropriate protections.\n  Section 223 of the current Low Income Housing Preservation and \nResident Homeownership Act [LIHPRHA] provides significant protections \nto residents who are faced with a prepayment action by an owner. It is \nmy interpretation that nothing in the appropriations language would \noverride the protections provided to residents under section 223 of \nLIHPRHA, and that these protections would still apply to residents in \nthose buildings where the owners decide to prepay their mortgages. Is \nthat also the understanding of the distinguished Senator from Missouri?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts' \ninterpretation--particularly as it relates to eligibility for voucher \nassistance and moving expenses of residents who are involuntarily \ndisplaced. The appropriations bill is intended to restore the right of \nowners to prepay their mortgages. At the same time, I have argued \nthroughout this process that it is important to retain a preservation \nprogram that preserves as much of the affordable housing as possible \nand protects the residents of the buildings from involuntary \ndisplacement.\n  The appropriations language does not override the protections in \nsection 223. I must add, however, that section 223 may provide benefits \nto residents that may be inconsistent with the decision by Congress to \nrestore the owner's right to prepay and to the degree that the nature \nof the section 8 assistance has been modified by the appropriations \nlanguage. It is my view that the authorizing committee should review \nall of LIHPRHA--including section 223--over the next year in light of \nthe new funding levels and the changes in the appropriations bill. I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts for raising this concern.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD \nSubcommittee for his remarks and I look forward to working with him on \nthe preservation program in the Banking Committee in the coming year.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to commend the \nefforts made by Senators Bond and Mikulski to improve the fiscal year \n1996 VA-HUD appropriations bill. Given the budget constraints, they \nhave done an admirable job of trying to craft appropriate and \nacceptable language.\n  Unfortunately, I am still frustrated by what this legislation does to \nthis Nation's veterans programs, housing assistance priorities, and \nenvironmental protection policies. This bill not only compromises \nsuccessful programs like AmeriCorps and Youthbuild, it cuts our housing \nbudget by more than 20 percent.\n  Mr. President, we have an obligation to improve each and every \nAmerican's access to safe and affordable housing. Unfortunately, as I \nwarned last spring, the bill before us weakens our ability to provide \nadequate housing, and it ultimately cuts valuable programs that work.\n  Mr. President, the HOPE VI Program is designed to replace this \nNation's most desperate and distressed housing stock with new, \nsustainable housing communities that will instill a sense of pride and \ncommunity. The fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill cuts the HOPE VI \nProgram from $500 million to $280 million. Mr. President, this cut will \nmake it very difficult for current HOPE VI projects to complete their \nwork. Because of this, I want to emphasize how important it will be for \nthe Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \ncomply with the Senate report language that expresses the Senate's \nintent to give priority funding to already-approved HOPE VI sites.\n  The Senate language allows us to follow through on our commitment to \nimproving housing conditions and opportunities in a time of severe \nfunding constraints.\n  Mr. President, I am also deeply concerned about the funding cuts the \nconference bill has imposed on the Environmental Protection Agency. \nWhile the conference opted to stay with the higher funding levels urged \nby the Senate, this level of $5.7 billion still results in a 22.5 \npercent reduction from the President's budget request and a 14 percent \ncut from 1995. However, I am most worried about the reductions in \nseveral important programs, including environmental and public health \nstandards enforcement, drinking water and \n\n[[Page S18645]]\nwastewater treatment infrastructure projects for States, and hazardous \nwaste site cleanup.\n  Mr. President, we are finally making real progress in environmental \nprotection. Our rivers and lakes are cleaner, our air is more \nbreathable, and our drinking water is safer. Now is not the time to \nslow that progress. Instead, we should move forward so that we leave \nour world a safer, healthier place for our children.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I must vote against this \nlegislation. But, should the President veto this bill, I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to improve the bill.\n\n\n                        spelman college outreach\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to commend the chairman for his skillful \nwork in shepherding this bill through the Senate and Conference \nCommittee. There are certainly more enviable jobs than having to direct \na major portion of spending reductions necessary to reach our ultimate \ngoal of a balanced budget.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Recognizing his accomplishment in this regard, I would \nlike to bring to the chairman's attention the fine work of many like my \nconstituents at Spelman College in Atlanta in the arena of public \nhousing assistance.\n  Located near urban Atlanta, Spelman College has established a quality \noutreach program for public housing residents that seeks to address \nmany of the housing needs and problems in Atlanta and other large \ncities throughout our country.\n  Mr. BOND. I am indeed aware of the fine work performed at Spelman and \nam interested in their progress.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The distinguished chairman's comments are appreciated. \nI would ask the Senator if the committee recognizes the role \ninstitutions of higher education play in revitalizing economically \ndistressed urban and rural communities.\n  Mr. BOND. The committee certainly recognizes the vital role that \ncolleges and universities can play in alleviating many of our problems \nin these areas, particularly with housing.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Recognizing the disproportionate representation of \nminority women in public housing, would the chairman be willing to \nconsider funding for minority institutions in their efforts to assist \nwith these programs.\n  Mr. BOND. The committee recognizes the indelible role minority \ninstitutions can play in providing outreach and supportive services for \nresidents of public housing. Therefore, of the funds provided, HUD \nshould consider giving to support qualified minority institutions, like \nSpelman College, that have established outreach programs for public \nhousing residents.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report on the VA, HUD-independent agencies appropriations \nbill for fiscal your 1996. While this agreement is an improvement over \nthe bill that passed the Senate earlier this fall, it still fails to \nprovide adequately for a number of programs which are essential to the \nfulfillment of many of our national priorities.\n  First, the agreement before us today represents a major step \nbackwards for the environment. This legislation proposes to cut the \nbudget for the Environmental Protection Agency by $1.7 billion, fully \n21 percent below the levels enacted in fiscal year 1995. This would \nsignificantly undermine the agency's ability to administer and enforce \nenvironmental laws and perform its critical mission of protecting \npublic health and the environment. Although most of the harmful House \nriders in the bill have been stricken, language with similar intent \nremains in the conference report, including language which would \nattempt to undermine the Community right to Know Act of 1986.\n  Under this conference report, Maryland alone, would lose over $14 \nmillion in funding required for substantial upgrades to long outdated \nsewage treatment facilities--projects which will have a direct impact \non the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay, our coastal beaches and \nbays, and other local waters.\n  Provisions in the underlying measure would cut EPA's enforcement and \ncompliance assurance by 25 percent which would severely impact upon the \nagency's ability to inspect industrial and Federal facilities in \nMaryland and prosecute violations. Mr. President, it is my view that \nthis bill unfairly singles our EPA to bear a disproportionate share of \nthe deficit reduction burden. It will not just decrease the rate of \nincreases, but will also severely reduce EPA's funding.\n  I am also very concerned that this legislation would terminate \nfunding for the national service program. Signed into law on September \n21, 1993, the National Service Act has helped to renew the ethic of \ncivic responsibility and the spirit of community service while also \nproviding critical assistance to needy communities throughout the \nNation. The measure has encouraged and provided the opportunity for \nthousands of Americans to give of themselves for the greater good while \nearning money to further their education. In my view, the legislation \neffectively merges education and service, two critical components of a \nhealthy society. Eliminating funding for this successful program \nreneges on our commitment and our responsibility to provide leadership \nand opportunity in national service.\n  AmeriCorps, the centerpiece of the national service program, is not \none large Federal program, but a network of locally developed and \nlocally managed service corps which gives thousands of young people the \nopportunity to serve their country while improving their own lives and \nthose of their neighbors. Moreover, the initial investment we have made \nhas encouraged increased private sector involvement in community \nservice programs, including AmeriCorps.\n  It is my view that those who participate in national service \nrepresent the best of our Nation. At a time when we, as a society, are \nsearching for ways in which to strengthen our families and our \ncommunities, it would be foolhardy to abandon the national service \ninitiative. AmeriCorps volunteers are taking part in the oldest and \nbest of America's traditions--the spirit of service--and they deserve \nour support.\n  Mr. President, this legislation also includes large cuts in Federal \nhousing programs. The VA-HUD appropriations conference report before us \ncontains significant reductions in public housing modernization, public \nhousing operating subsidies, severely distressed public housing \nprograms, homeless assistance programs, incremental housing assistance, \nprograms for distressed multifamily housing, and salaries and expenses.\n  The funding levels for housing programs included in this bill are \ninadequate given the housing needs of low-income Americans and the \ncommunity development needs of our Nation's communities. There is no \nevidence that the number of homeless people in our society is \ndeclining. In fact, available evidence suggests that the number of \nhomeless families with children are increasing. Waiting lists for \npublic and assisted housing remain years long in many places around the \ncountry. Too many of our neighborhoods are plagued with vacant homes, \naging and decaying infrastructure, and high levels of social distress. \nHUD's programs, which are being cut severely in this conference report, \naddress these important national needs.\n  The funding cuts included in this bill will make it that much harder \nto resolve some of HUD's problems and may, in fact, exacerbate these \nproblems. HUD will need sufficient funds to rebuild the management \ncapacity of the troubled public housing authorities, tear down and \nreplace the aging stock, and address the housing needs of those who \ncurrently live in the buildings. Likewise, in order to address the \nembedded losses in the insured multifamily housing portfolio, the \nFederal Government should invest resources now in order to save money \nin the future. If the Federal Government walks away from its \nlongstanding involvement in these buildings, there will be negative \nconsequences for the residents, for the buildings, and for the \nsurrounding neighborhood.\n  Finally, I am concerned that this bill provides nearly $55 million \nless than the funding level requested by the administration for \nstaffing and management resources--even though HUD currently has severe \nstaffing shortages. I am deeply concerned that these cuts will harm \nHUD's ability to meet its mission and, at the same time, resolve some \nof the management problems that confront them. Significant cuts in \n\n[[Page S18646]]\nstaffing and management resources in advance of restructuring the \nDepartment's programs and reducing its workload are, at best, unwise \nwhen HUD employees are attempting to manage Government commitments of \nnearly $1 trillion on behalf of American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, with respect to funding for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, while I am pleased that the conference report eliminated a \nprovision that would have limited the service-connected compensation \npaid to certain incompetent veterans who have no dependents, I remain \ndeeply concerned about the overall funding levels provided in this \nlegislation for veterans programs.\n  Although this measure provides an increase in funding for VA medical \ncare above the fiscal year 1995 level, the $400 million increase does \nnot come close to the level necessary to provide current services. Put \nsimply, this would translate into a drastic cutback in services \nprovided by VA and substantially fewer veterans being treated. We owe a \nconsiderable debt to our Nation's veterans and, in my view, the medical \ncare funding in this measure reflects an abandonment of the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to them.\n  I also am concerned with the appropriation in the conference report \nfor the general operating expenses [GOE] account which funds the \nadministration of all VA benefits other than medical care, such as \ncompensation, pension, and educational assistance. The funding level \nfor GOE in this measure represents a reduction of more than $42 million \nfrom fiscal year 1995. This decrease in funding will seriously impair \nVA's ability to make progress in reducing the current backlog of \npending claims and, in fact, may result in a reversal of the progress \nthe VA has made already in this important area.\n  Finally, I note the discontinuation of the U.S. Court of Veterans \nAppeals pro bono representation program. For the past several years, \nthis program has fulfilled a critical need, providing representation \nfor hundreds of veterans who have appealed the denial of their benefit \nclaims to the Court of Veterans Appeals, and who otherwise would have \nbeen without counsel. The elimination of this program would be a severe \nloss, leaving low-income veterans, the majority of all veterans who \nfile appeals, to handle their cases without legal assistance.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the conference report before us fails \nto provide adequate funding for many programs critical to the future of \nour Nation and the health and well-being of its citizenry. I would urge \nmy colleagues to join me in opposition to this legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport accompanying the VA, HUD, and independent agencies \nappropriations bill. This legislation would cut funding at the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development by more than one-fifth, and \nis yet another clear reflection of the misguided priorities that have \ndriven the budget process this year.\n  Mr. President, HUD today provides housing assistance to over 4 \nmillion households, including working families, seniors, and people \nwith disabilities. Yet this only makes a dent in the housing needs of \nlower income Americans. Millions of our citizens are living in \nsubstandard conditions or are paying more than half of their incomes \nfor housing. Countless others are homeless entirely.\n  Unfortunately, this conference report not only fails to meet these \npressing needs, but it is a step backward. And its proposed cuts will \nhave a real impact on needy Americans throughout our Nation.\n  This legislation virtually eliminates funding for incremental housing \nassistance, and slashes funding for homeless programs by a quarter. As \na result, hundreds of thousands of families will continue to languish \non public housing waiting lists. Many will be forced to live in \nsubstandard housing or on the streets. Meanwhile, Congress is about to \npull the safety net out from under them, with cuts in nutrition, health \ncare, education and other critical programs.\n  The cuts in this legislation also will lead to the continued \ndeterioration of our Nation's public housing stock, by cutting the \nmodernization budget by one-third. Mr. President, this stock represents \na $90 billion investment by our taxpayers. To allow it to deteriorate \nfurther is short-sighted. It also will mean that tens-of-thousands of \nour citizens will continue to live in substandard housing, as major \nrepairs and renovations are canceled due to lack of funds.\n  The conference report also includes a nearly 50-percent cut in \nfunding for severely distressed public housing. This will inhibit \nefforts to revitalize our Nation's most troubled and most dangerous \npublic housing developments.\n  If there is one bright spot in the conference report, Mr. President, \nit is the inclusion of $290 million for the Public and Assisted Housing \nDrug Elimination Program, which I developed several years ago. This \nprogram has had great success in reducing crime in housing developments \naround the Nation. And I am encouraged that we are maintaining our \ncommitment to this initiative in this legislation.\n  Still, Mr. President, the cuts in housing proposed in this \nlegislation are deeply troubling. Not only because of their impact on \nordinary Americans. But because they are being proposed as part of a \nRepublican budget with seriously misplaced priorities.\n  Mr. President, the new majority in the Congress is committed to \nproviding huge tax breaks for millionaires, $7 billion for the Pentagon \nthat the generals don't even want, large subsidies for western ranchers \nand mining companies, and various other special interest giveaways. \nMeanwhile, they are slashing programs that provide assistance to the \nmost vulnerable Americans, especially those in our cities.\n  In my view, Mr. President, this reverse Robin Hood approach is \ninconsistent with true American values. I am sympathetic to calls for a \nbalanced budget, Mr. President. But the pain must be shared, not \ntargeted at our cities and the poor.\n  Mr. President, the median income of households receiving Federal \nhousing assistance is $8,000. This happens to be about the same amount \nthat the Republicans want to provide in tax breaks to those with \nincomes over $350,000. What does this say about our priorities, Mr. \nPresident?\n  In the 1960's, our Government declared war on poverty. In 1995, it \nseems that our Government has declared war on poor people.\n  Mr. President, the millions of Americans with severe housing needs \ndeserve better. And it is not enough to say that we don't have the \nmoney. If we have the money to provide huge tax breaks for \nmillionaires, if we have the money to provide $7 billion to the \nPentagon that our military does not even want, if we have the money to \nsubsidize large mining and agricultural corporations, how can we say \nthat we lack the money to ensure that ordinary Americans have a decent \nplace to live?\n  So, Mr President, I cannot support this bill and will vote against \nit. I call on President Clinton to veto the legislation, and continue \nto stand firm until Congress agrees to provide adequate funding for \nhousing programs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to express my admiration to a number \nof Senators who have struggled valiantly to produce a bill acceptable \nto the great majority of Senators and to the administration, that \nappropriates funds for the vital services provided to American citizens \nby the Veterans Affairs Department, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies.\n  The challenge this posed, in a time when it seems too many in both \nparties have as their objective scoring political points off the other \nparty rather than reaching reasonable middle ground on contentious \nissues, proved unfortunately to be an insurmountable challenge at least \nto this point. And despite the great and perhaps even herculean effort \ninvested in this bill by the chairman of the subcommittee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], and the ranking member, \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], I regret very \nmuch I have concluded I have no choice but to oppose the bill, and urge \nthe President to veto it, assuming as I do that it will reach his desk \nfor his action. Its shortcomings are numerous, and they are not minor. \n\n[[Page S18647]]\n\n  With regard to the budget for the environmental Protection Agency, \nthe severe cuts of 22 percent from the President's request threaten \npublic health and the environment. Of particular concern are the \nsignificant cuts to the enforcement budget, the Superfund Program and \nthe State revolving funds that finance clean water and safe drinking \nwater remedial action.\n  The conference agreement cuts the EPA's enforcement program by 25 \npercent--in effect allowing more polluters the freedom to continue to \npollute our land and water without challenge. The bill also slashes the \nSuperfund budget by 25 percent, which would slow existing cleanups and \nprevent new cleanup starts. That means that at least four cities in \nMassachusetts will have to live with continued exposure of thousands of \ntheir citizens to dangerous chemicals.\n  The agreement also reduces by $762 million from the President's \nbudget the funding provided for water infrastructure improvements to \nStates and needy cities across the country. For the past several \nyears--under both the Bush and Clinton administrations--Congress has \nappropriated at least $100 million for Boston Harbor cleanup alone. \nHowever, this bill provides just a fraction of that amount--$25 \nmillion, thus neglecting to recognize the dire straits of communities \nsuch as those of the Greater Boston area which are grappling with the \nenormous water rate increases which result from Federal mandates.\n  In addition to inadequate funding levels for vital EPA efforts to \nensure that public's health and safety, also of grave concern to me are \nlegislative riders that eviscerate existing environmental safeguards, \nwithout the benefit of congressional hearings or any input from the \ngeneral public. We as a nation have struggled valiantly over the past \nquarter century to identify and eliminate threats to our environment \nwhich directly or indirectly threaten our health, safety or well-being, \nand to begin to clean up the existing mess. I will not willingly \nparticipate in the thoughtless and hurried abandonment of these \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, I am also voting against this bill because it includes \nexcessive cuts in our Federal housing programs. I am concerned that \ncutbacks of the magnitude visited on the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development in this bill and some of the changes it makes in \nhousing policy represent a retreat from our Nation's goal to provide \nall Americans with decent, safe, and affordable housing, and undercut \nefforts we have been making to reform the agency and its programs.\n  The conference agreement contains significant cuts in HUD's overall \nbudget and particularly deep cuts in public housing programs, \nincremental assistance, and homeless assistance. Yet, HUD's purpose has \nnot gone away, and this bill provides no roadmap to meeting the \npressing needs in our Nation that agency was established to meet. The \nunmet housing needs of our people are significant. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are homeless every night. Millions of Americans \nare still living in substandard housing or paying a painfully heavy \nportion of their income for rent. Too many young families find the \nbarriers to homeownership insurmountable. The goal of a decent, safe, \nand affordable home for all Americans is still a valid goal for this \ncountry. The needs of our cities--large and small--are national in \nscope. The distressed neighborhoods around the country--like those in \nLowell, Lawrence, Fall River, Springfield, Boston, and other \nMassachusetts cities and towns--rely on Federal community development \nassistance to battle the declines that face all of our older urban \nareas.\n\n  We also need to be concerned that the cuts in the bill will have \nserious consequences by making it much more difficult to resolve some \nof HUD's management problems. The bill, in fact, may exacerbate rather \nthan ameliorate these problems by reducing funding levels for programs \nthat maintain and operate public housing or prevent defaults on HUD-\ninsured multifamily properties. Fixing some of HUD's programs, quite \nfrankly, will require us to invest more resources, not less--because \nthe the small percentage of public housing authorities that are \ntroubled will require strong intervention by the Federal Government. It \nwill require large sums to rebuild the management capacity of these \nauthorities, tear down and replace the aging stock, and address the \nhousing needs of those who currently live in the buildings. The \nseverely distressed housing program--HOPE VI--is providing funding for \ninnovative approaches to remedying distressed public housing around the \ncountry--including efforts to revitalize Mission Main and Orchard Park \ndevelopments in Boston. The conference agreement, unfortunately, cuts \nthis program just as we are showing signs of making progress.\n  I am also concerned that the bill before us establishes a policy \nthat, beginning in 1997, we will only renew expiring section 8 \ncontracts at fair market rents. At the same time, the bill codifies a \ncut in fair market rents from the 45th to the 40th percentile. Without \nquestion, Mr. President, we need to enact changes in the section 8 \nprogram that reduce rents where they are excessive and address the \nburgeoning long-term costs of the section 8 program. We must be \ncareful, however, that a blanket approach does not undermine the \nviability of existing affordable housing projects. We are responsible \nfor what happens to both the public and assisted housing inventory: the \nFederal Government walking away from its long-standing involvement in \nthese buildings will have negative consequences for the residents, for \nthe buildings, and for the neighborhoods that surround them.\n  Mr. President, I know the appropriators struggled with a wholly \ninsufficient allocation from the 1996 Congressional budget. Their \nmission arguably was impossible from the outset. In my judgment, it is \nsimply imperative that the overall budget negotiations provide a higher \nallocation to the VA/HUD subcommittee. Nonetheless, I do want to \nacknowledge the chairman's, ranking member's, and subcommittee's \nactions to help several key programs--and there are some example of \ntheir efforts that deserve mention. The subcommittee was able to find \n$20 million for the Youthbuild Program, though I am extremely \ndisappointed that this level represents a significant cut, realitive to \nlast year, in the resources for this valuable and successful program. I \nam pleased that the conference agreement preserves the funding levels \nfor the HOME and CDBG Programs at 1995 levels. And finally, the \nagreement provides $624 million for the preservation of low-income \nhousing; continuing this program is very important if we are to prevent \nthe loss of affordable housing and the displacement of thousands of \nfamilies across Massachusetts and the entire Nation.\n  There are other deficiencies--serious deficiencies--in this bill--for \nexample, in provisions pertaining to veterans programs and services, \nabout which others have eloquently remarked in this debate, remarks I \nwill not take the Senate's time to replicate. The sum is a bill that is \nfatally flawed.\n  Mr. President, it disturbs me that this has occurred on yet another \nbill. It disturbs me greatly that, less than 3 weeks before the end of \nthe calendar year, and nearly 3 months after the beginning of the \ncurrent fiscal year, the Republican leadership of this Congress still \nis engaged in the political game of sending the President a bill he \nalready has announced emphatically he must and will veto on the basis \nof deeply-held, principled conviction--before there have been any \ndefinitive negotiations to reach real middle ground. The American \npeople don't understand what is going on, here, Mr. President, and with \ngood reason. It defies rational explanation.\n  But, at the insistence of the intemperate Speaker of the House, the \nPresident and the Congress will be required to play out this charade. I \nthank the President for his courage and steadfastness to vital \nprinciples which will be the foundation for the veto he will cast. I \nremain very hopeful that all parties to the budget negotiations will \nengage in them diligently and in good faith, that one of the outcomes \nwill be to provide a more realistic allocation of discretionary funding \nto this bill, and that in the near future we will be debating in this \nchamber a reasonable bill behind which Senators of good will from both \nparties can unite and which we can send to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there are many aspects of this \nappropriations bill which I find deeply troubling. I am thankful we \nhave a President who has \n\n[[Page S18648]]\nclearly said that he will veto this bill if presented to him in its \ncurrent form.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to focus on two areas of the \nbill which are of particular concern to me--the unacceptable cuts to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], and the lack of funding for \nthe VA medical center at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, CA.\n\n\n                    environmental protection agency\n\n  The EPA is the agency responsible for the implementation of our most \nfundamental environmental protection laws: The Clean Air Act, the Clean \nWater Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, laws that protect us from \nimproper hazardous waste disposal, laws that protect us from exposure \nto radiation and toxic substances, laws that regulate the clean-up of \nhazardous waste sites all over the country, laws that ensure that every \ncitizen in this country has a right to know about what kinds of toxics \nare being released into their environment.\n  And how much does it cost us to run the EPA? In 1995 we appropriated \nabout $6.6 billion for the EPA. Let me put this into context. The whole \nEPA budget is the same as the cost of about three B-2 bombers. In the \n1995 budget we appropriated over 40 times this amount--$241 billion--\nfor the Department of Defense. The fiscal year 1996 defense \nappropriations bill that recently passed the Senate included $7 billion \nmore than the Department of Defense says it needs. We are throwing an \nextra $7 billion at the Pentagon and the same time we are taking away \nvital funds that protect our health and safety. It simply does not make \nsense.\n  The cuts made in this bill to the EPA budget are unacceptable. This \nbill appropriates $5.7 billion for EPA--that is a 14-percent cut--or \nnearly $1 billion from the fiscal year 1995 level. It is a 22.5-percent \ncut--or $1.7 billion--from the President's fiscal year 1996 request.\n  Republicans seem to take great pride in their efforts to dismantle \nkey social programs that Americans hold dear, but they have chosen to \ntake their war against the environment underground. The cuts to the EPA \nbudget show us the covert war that is being waged by Republicans \nagainst our environment.\n  It has to be covert because they have seen the results of poll after \npoll showing that the vast majority of Americans feel that our \nenvironmental laws should be strengthened, not stripped away. In my \nmany years in public office not once has anyone told me, ``Senator, our \nair is too clean,'' or ''our water is too safe.''\n\n  The back door attack on our environmental laws seen here is cuts in \nEPA's budget that will cripple EPA's ability to set and enforce \nenvironmental standards.\n  This bill cuts enforcement of all environmental programs by 22 \npercent--$128 million--from the President's request and 14.6 percent--\n$77 million--from fiscal year 1995.\n  It hits at the heart of EPA administration and management in EPA's \nability to set and enforce environmental and public health standards \nwith a 17-percent cut--$310 million--below the President's request, and \na 7-percent cut--$115 million--from fiscal year 1995.\n  Mr. President, these cuts mean that an already stretched EPA will not \nbe able to carry out critically important work that ensures the health \nand safety of all Americans, and will result in a setback of national \nefforts to ensure that every American citizen breaths clear air, drinks \nclean water and is safe from the dangers of hazardous waste.\n  These are the EPA funds that are spent working with States and \nmunicipalities in the development of our air quality, water quality, \nlead abatement, and food safety standards; the funds that allow EPA to \nkeep track of the levels of pollution in our air, our water, our food, \nour environment; that allow the EPA to work with States and with \nindustries to help them discover the sources of pollution problems and \nhelp them comply with Federal safety standards; that allow the EPA to \ngive technical assistance to State pollution control agencies and \ncounty air and water quality boards; that allow the EPA to carry out \nenvironmental impact statements on industry actions that may hurt the \nenvironment; that allow EPA to work all over this country to educate \nindustry and small business and help them comply with the law so that \nenforcement actions are avoided.\n  In the long run this will mean more water pollution, more smog in our \ncities and countryside, more toxic waste problems.\n  EPA's budget is cut in many other areas to levels that are \nunacceptable.\n  A 30 percent--$462 million--cut from the President's request and a 9 \npercent--$110 million--cut from fiscal year 1995 in funds that go \nstraight to the States to help cities all over the country build sewage \ntreatment plants that keep raw sewage from flowing into our coastal \nwaters, rivers, lakes and streams.\n  A 45 percent--$225 million--cut from the President's request and a 79 \npercent--$1 billion--cut from the pre-rescissions fiscal year 1995 \nlevel in funds that go to States to protect our drinking water \nnationwide.\n\n  A 25 percent--$400 million--cut from the President's request and 13 \npercent--$168 million--cut from fiscal year 1995 in funds that go \ntoward cleaning up hazardous waste sites.\n  But, Mr. President, I would like to close my statement with a comment \nabout the presence of riders in this conference report--in the face of \nthe House vote to instruct conferees to omit riders that would limit \nEPA enforcement of existing environmental protections.\n  This conference report includes a rider that strips away EPA's veto \nauthority over U.S. Corps of Engineers wetlands permits decisions. \nAlthough the EPA has only vetoed 11 permit requests since 1972, the \npower of EPA's veto has played a very important and constructive role \nin the reaching of compromises on innumerable proposed development \nplans to fill wetlands. I believe that EPA's vet power is absolutely \nessential in maintaining a balanced approach to making environmental \npermit decisions. Without this veto authority, we are opening the door \nto very serious potential losses of wetlands.\n  We have lost approximately 53 percent of our historic wetlands in the \ncontinental United States--and in my State of California, the loss is \nover 90 percent. We continue to lose wetlands at the alarming rate of \nabout 300,000 acres per year, and there still seems to be a general \nlack of appreciation for the vital role that wetlands play in \nprotecting our people's health, sustaining our Nation's natural systems \nand supporting America's economy.\n  Wetlands preservation is often seen as incompatible with economic \ngrowth. I believe that not only does wetlands conservation make good \nenvironmental sense, it makes good economic sense. The value of \nwetlands in flood control, groundwater storage, water purification and \ncommercial and recreational uses has been estimated to be $1.4 trillion \nannually.\n  An economic analysis of the value of wetlands was prepared in 1993 \nunder the direction of the School of Public Policy at the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley. Using my State of California as an example, the \nstudy showed that the total annual benefit of wetlands to the State \nranges from a low of $6 billion to almost $23 billion. Those are the \namounts the State would lose annually if 100 percent of our wetlands \nwere lost to filling and development.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, over 48,000 Americans sought approval to fill \nwetlands. The number of permit requests has increased by 27 percent \nsince 1990. If this rider goes into law, every request will be \nsubmitted with the knowledge that the EPA has no veto authority. Old \nprojects will be dusted off and resubmitted--we will lose wetlands that \nour Nation cannot afford to lose--we will lose wetlands that our Nation \ncannot afford to lose.\n\n\n                        travis va medical center\n\n  I am deeply disappointed that the bill does not including funding to \ncomplete construction on the proposed VA hospital at Travis Air Force \nBase, in Fairfield, CA.\n  In 1991, a severe earthquake damaged northern California's only VA \nhospital in Martinez. That facility served over 400,000 veterans, and \nits closure forced many to drive up to 8 hours to receive medical care. \nThe Bush administration recognized the tremendous need created by the \nMartinez closure and promised the community that a replacement facility \nwould be constructed in Fairfield, at Travis Air Force Base. The \nconferees' action breaks that 4-year-old promise to the veterans of \nnorthern California.\n  Last year, Congress appropriated $7 million to complete design and \nbegin \n\n[[Page S18649]]\nconstruction on the Tavis-VA medical center. Nearly $20 million has \nbeen spent on the project to date, and more than a year ago, Vice \nPresident Gore broke ground. Construction is now underway.\n  For fiscal year 1996, President Clinton requested the funds needed to \ncomplete construction, $188 million. Congress' refusal to fund the \nproject seriously jeopardizes the prospect that the hospital will ever \nbe built. The outpatient clinic proposed as an alternative by the \nconferees is entirely unacceptable to the veterans of northern \nCalifornia.\n  The decision not to fund the Travis-VA medical center breaks faith \nwith California's veterans, and violates promises made by the past two \nPresidential administrations.\n  For the reasons I have stated above and many others, I have no choice \nbut to oppose this conference report, and I will urge the President to \nveto this bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am voting for this legislation with a \nnumber of reservations. This bill provides funding for important \nprograms at the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA], Department of \nHousing and Urban Development [HUD] and the Environmental Protection \nAgency [EPA]. I supported this legislation when it passed the Senate in \nSeptember, with the understanding that Senate negotiators would \nmaintain funding for our Nation's veterans, maintain adequate levels \nfor housing, protect funding for the EPA and oppose the 17 anti-\nenvironment legislative riders included in the House version of this \nbill.\n  After the most recent conference on this legislation between the \nSenate and House, it is my belief that the bill has emerged better than \nboth the original House and Senate passed versions. Funding for \nveterans' health is now higher than last year's levels. EPA spending \nlevels, originally slated for a 33 percent cut in the House bill, have \nbeen increased, resulting in only a 14 percent reduction. A number of \nother important programs and agencies received a similar reduction this \nyear. Finally, almost all of the environmental legislative riders I \nfound most objectionable have been dropped.\n  Mr. President, I believe the managers hands were tied in this \nsituation. The allocation for this entire account was reduced to such \nan extent that they were forced to make some difficult choices. The \noverall allocation was reduced by close to 10 percent from fiscal year \n1995. The fact that EPA received a 14 percent cut is very unfortunate \nbut understandable considering the overall reduction for this bill. I \nhope that the ongoing budget negotiations will yield more funding for \nenvironmental protection.\n  I agree that Congress must reduce Federal spending in order to gain \ncontrol of our growing budget deficit. We must reorder our spending \npriorities and makes every effort to cut wasteful expenditures \nthroughout the Federal budget. Although savings can be found in the \nDepartment of Energy, Department of Interior and EPA budgets, I will \nstrongly oppose a complete gutting of the funding for important \nenvironmental programs.\n  Finally, included in this legislation is an amendment which will \nremove EPA from the process of protecting many of our Nation's wetlands \nand rivers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Last year, under \nthis section of the Clean Water Act, EPA assisted the State of Vermont \nin protecting one of our State's most valuable river ecosystems. I \nremain hopeful that during future consideration of funding for EPA we \nnot further weaken EPA's ability to protect our Nation's rivers and \nwetlands.\n  Mr. President, I am voting for this legislation in order to move the \nprocess forward. In the event that the legislation is vetoed by the \nPresident, I would hope my colleagues would seriously consider some the \nfew concerns I have raised here.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, this appropriation is a very good one for \nveterans. It fully funds veterans' benefits payments. And, unlike many \nof the non-veteran programs funded by this bill, veterans' health care \nfunding would actually increase.\n  Mr. President, there is one provision in this conference report which \naffects a small sum of dollars, but which is important to VA and to \nAmerica's veterans. Funding for staffing and travel in the office of \nthe Secretary has been reduced.\n   Mr. President. I support that reduction.\n  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has left no tub unpounded, no stump \nwithout a speech, in a campaign of propaganda misrepresenting the \nactions of this Congress. I tire of that.\n  He has continued to talk about budget ``cuts.'' Even when he knows so \nwell that the budget is actually being increased.\n  He continues to talk about declines in VA health care services even \nafter personally sitting through a hearing where the increases were \nquantified and illustrated by charts.\n  He took a discredited advocacy ``study'' from a liberal lobby group \nand tried to give it the stature of a ``government'' report. That \naction was an attempt to ``use''--yes that is the term--veterans as the \npoint men in a political campaign to defeat reforms needed to preserve \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n  In short, Secretary Brown has confused the responsibilities of a \nCabinet Secretary with the role of a political lobbyist.\n  He has assumed the zealous mission of a political advocate without \nremembering the requirement to led and administer his Department.\n  And, as an article in today's Washington Post makes clear, he is \nwholly unrepentant in his course.\n  Yes, the conference report will restrict his political activities. \nBut, and hear this, and hear clearly, it will not restrict his ability \nto lead his Department. In fact, if it causes him to stay right here in \nWashington and focus hard on the many heretofore unaddressed challenges \nfacing the Department of Veterans Affairs, the reduced funding level \ncould actually improve his stewardship over the Department.\n  The issue is not ``freedom of speech.'' That is pure bunkum. Those \nwho make that argument are not really arguing that the Secretary has a \nright to speak. They are instead arguing that the taxpayers have an \nobligation to pay for whatever he wants to say. That is, or course, \nsurely not the case.\n  Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. No bill is. But the \nmembers of the subcommittee have done a very good job in protecting \nfunding for veterans' programs.\n  I think it would be tragic if the President were to use funding \nlevels for nonveteran programs as an excuse to veto a bill that \nincreases veterans' medical spending and fully funds their benefits.\n  I am sure that my friend from Missouri will confirm that it will be \nvery hard to craft a bill as favorable to veterans as this one and \nwhich also increases funding for other programs.\n  I commend Senators Bond and Mikulski. They work well together as \nmanagers of the bill. I thank them for their yeoman work and I do hope \nthe Senate will join me in support of the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nH.R. 2099, the VA--HUD appropriations conference report. I want to \ncommend the distinguished ranking member and the distinguished manager \nof the bill for their efforts in reaching an agreement on this measure.\n  The conferees had to make some tough choices, and I am pleased that \nthey listened to the American people and decided to drop the \ncontroversial environmental riders in the House-passed bill. I am also \ndelighted that the conference report provides the Environmental \nProtection Agency [EPA] with a higher level of funding than either the \nHouse or Senate bills.\n  Although the conferees eliminated most of the objectionable \nlegislative riders, I am still troubled by two key provisions in the \nconference report. First of all, the conferees have decided to maintain \nthe rider in the Senate bill that bars EPA from using any fiscal year \n1996 funds to implement section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.\n  Since its enactment in 1972, section 404 of the Clean Water Act has \nplayed an integral role in the progress we have made toward achieving \nthe act's central objective, which is ``to restore and maintain the \nchemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.'' \nSection 404(c) authorizes EPA to prohibit a disposal of dredged or fill \n\n\n[[Page S18650]]\nmaterial into U.S. waters, including wetlands, if such a disposal would \nhave an unacceptable adverse effect on certain especially important \nresources.\n  The rider in the conference report would preclude EPA from ensuring \nagainst unacceptable adverse effects on these valuable resources for a \nfull year. An article written by John Cushman in Tuesday's edition of \nthe New York Times is especially instructive: It points out the many of \nthe unknown adverse consequences this rider could have for our most \nvaluable wetlands resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article printed in \nthe December 12, 1995, New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 12, 1995]\n\n     Brief Clause in Bill Would Curb U.S. Power to Protect Wetlands\n\n                       (By John H. Cushman, Jr.)\n\n       Washington, Dec. 11.--Buried deep in a spending bill now \n     before Congress are two sentences that could give clear \n     sailing to a highway project in New Hampshire, harbor \n     dredging in South Carolina, a mine in Montana and many other \n     projects around the country that have been threatened by the \n     Government's environmental objections.\n       The terse provision would take away one of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's major tools for protecting \n     the country's wetlands: the veto that the agency is allowed \n     to cast against permits that the Army Corps of Engineers \n     issues to developers for wetlands projects.\n       The change is set forth in one obscure passage in a vast \n     $80 billion appropriations bill paying for veterans, housing, \n     environmental and other programs in the current fiscal year. \n     The bill passed the House on Thursday and is expected to come \n     to the Senate floor shortly. President Clinton, objecting to \n     many of its provisions, has said he will veto it.\n       Although it is hard to predict whether the wetlands clause \n     will become law, the prospect worries conservationists, who \n     call the continuing loss of wetlands a threat to water \n     quality and wildlife. The provision would prohibit the E.P.A. \n     from spending anything in the current fiscal year to exercise \n     its power under the Clean Water Act to review and veto \n     wetlands permits. Any vetoes that are pending would be \n     nullified, giving the Corps of Engineers the final say.\n       The bill's 73 words on wetlands have rated only the \n     briefest mention during a raging Congressional debate over \n     Federal environmental priorities. But the effect of the \n     provision could be felt nationwide.\n       Most immediately, the change may resurrect plans for a $200 \n     million highway sweeping around Nashua, N.H. Last August, the \n     state reluctantly agreed to scale back the project when \n     threatened with a veto by the E.P.A. The reduced plans spare \n     more than 40 acres of wetlands and other undeveloped wildlife \n     habitat near the Merrimack River. James Rivers, a spokesman \n     for Gov. Stephen Merrill, said that although the state plans \n     to proceed with the scaled-back project for now, it would \n     consider expanding it in the future if the Federal law is \n     changed.\n       In Charleston, S.C., E.P.A. officials have warned the corps \n     against dredging shipping channels near a paper plant because \n     of possible dioxin contamination. But if the new law is \n     passed, the E.P.A. would lose its legal leverage to persuade \n     the corps to adopt an alternative for clearing shipping \n     channels.\n       Similarly, the corps alone would rule on wetlands permits \n     for the New World Mine in Montana, a disputed project that \n     conservationist say would endanger the ecosystem in and \n     around Yellowstone National Park, just two and a half miles \n     away.\n       The wetlands review process has its roots in the 1970's, \n     when lawmakers believed the corps, whose approval is needed \n     for any construction that can affect navigable waters, was \n     more interested in protecting navigation than the \n     environment. But today it is the E.P.A. that is out of favor \n     on Capitol Hill, where preserving wetlands is among the most \n     unpopular of causes.\n       Although the E.P.A. has vetoed wetlands permits only 11 \n     times, both sides in the dispute agree that the agency can \n     greatly influence the scale of development projects by merely \n     threatening a veto. Environmental groups cited case after \n     case in which projects were scaled back to meet the agency's \n     demands. Many of those projects were shelved indefinitely, \n     raising the possibility that some might be revived if the \n     legislation is enacted.\n       Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the E.P.A., said her \n     agency, not the corps, has both the expertise and the \n     statutory authority to protect wetlands, which play a crucial \n     role in minimizing floods, filtering water and providing \n     wildlife habitat.\n       ``The E.P.A. is the body that Congress has given the \n     authority to deal with clean water issues,'' she said. ``The \n     role we play is associated with the broader role of \n     protecting the water quality of the people of this country.''\n       Despite the importance of this legislation, there has \n     scarcely been any testimony or comment on the House or Senate \n     floor about how it would affect specific construction \n     projects or wetlands.\n       Even the provision's author, Senator Christopher S. Bond, a \n     Missouri Republican, said in an interview that he had ``no \n     idea'' what projects might be affected.\n       He said his objective was not to affect one project or \n     another, but to make the Government more efficient by \n     consolidating power over wetlands permits in a single agency.\n       ``If there is one thing that constituents in my state are \n     fed up with, it is being told two different things by two \n     different Federal agencies,'' Senator Bond said on the Senate \n     floor in September. ``They expect the Federal agencies who \n     serve them to give them one answer and to give them the right \n     answer.''\n       Administration officials and environmental groups say the \n     E.P.A'S authority is essential to the protection of wetlands, \n     especially since many projects affecting those areas are \n     carried out by the corps itself.\n       ``The Army Corps of Engineers authorizes itself to \n     discharge millions of cubic yards of dredge or fill material \n     into the waters of the United States each year,'' said John \n     Flicker, president of the National Audubon Society, in a \n     letter urging President Clinton not to sign the bill. \n     ``Absent E.P.A.'s involvement in the review of the corps' \n     water development projects, the corps would be in the \n     untenable position of exercising sole regulatory review of \n     its own development projects.''\n       Senator Bond and his staff respond that their proposal \n     leaves much of the E.P.A.'s authority intact. The agency \n     would continue to write the environmental guidelines for the \n     corps.\n       But the E.P.A's questions about the dredging of navigation \n     channels proposed by the corps around Georgetown Harbor near \n     Charleston, one of the biggest commercial ports on the East \n     Coast, show why the E.P.A. is fighting to keep its authority. \n     The corps would extensively dredge sediments from the harbor \n     bottom, including near the private berth of the International \n     Paper Company, and then dump that refuse on shore and in \n     nearby shallows.\n       Local E.P.A. officials, according to an agency document, \n     are concerned that the project carries environmental risks. \n     They fear that the sediment at the paper plant could be \n     contaminated with dioxin, a toxin that could be spread in the \n     Sampit River and the Upper Winyah Bay.\n       Sediments at the paper company's berth have not been tested \n     for dioxin, but several years ago the paper plant's waste \n     water was found to have among the highest dioxin levels of \n     more than a hundred plants surveyed, and the state detected \n     dioxins in sediment and fish tissues in the nearby Sampit \n     River in 1989, leading to advisories against eating locally \n     caught fish.\n       The agency is urging the corps to consider less damaging \n     alternatives and better impoundments of the dredged wastes.\n       There are many other cases, like the Nashua highway, where \n     the E.P.A.'s views prevailed over those of the corps and of \n     local officials. The E.P.A. fought that project for 10 years, \n     but the corps and the state approved it anyway. Only after \n     the E.P.A. regional administrator, John DeVillars, warned of \n     a veto did New Hampshire agree to a scaled-back highway.\n       New Hampshire's top environmental official said in an \n     interview this week that he was pleased with the E.P.A.'s \n     rule in the highway project and with other wetlands reviews \n     by the Federal agency.\n       ``My experience with the process has been that the concerns \n     that have been raised have been reasonable concerns, that \n     they are asking the right questions and forcing analysis of \n     alternatives that otherwise would not be done,'' said Robert \n     Varnum, the state's Environment Commissioner. He was \n     appointed twice by Republican Governors, both of whom \n     strongly favored the highway project that the E.P.A. blocked.\n       ``I feel that E.P.A.'s mission is to protect the \n     environment, and in this case to avoid unnecessary impacts to \n     our wetlands resources,'' he said. ``They take that job very \n     seriously, and have put in a great deal of time and effort, \n     and stuck their necks out, to protect the environment, and I \n     think that is a role they need to play. I think the general \n     public expects nothing else.''\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, to those who say that EPA's 404(c) \nauthority reflects a significant waste of government resources, I point \nto the fact that the agency has used this authority only 12 times \nduring the past 23 years.\n  One of these instances occurred in Attleboro, MA. A developer's plan \nto build a large shopping mall at a site called Sweeden's Swamp in \nAttleboro would have destroyed 45 acres of wetlands. Had EPA not \nstepped in to prevent the permit from going forward, the area would \nhave lost a rich habitat for many birds, mammals, and amphibians. Mr. \nPresident, we simply cannot afford to relinquish the protection of \ncritical natural resources afforded by 404(c).\n  I am also deeply concerned with the conferees' decision to provide \nonly $12 million for the Montreal Protocol Facilitation Fund--a full 50 \npercent less than both the administration's request and the House \napproved figure of $24 million.\n  The Montreal Protocol, approved in 1987 during the Reagan \nadministration, \n\n[[Page S18651]]\naddresses the damaging effect of chlorofluorocarbons--of CFC's--on the \nozone layer. A statement made by President Reagan on April 5, 1988, \ndemonstrates the significance of the program:\n\n       The Montreal Protocol is a model of cooperation. It is a \n     product of the recognition and international consensus that \n     ozone depletion is a global problem, both in terms of its \n     causes and effects. The protocol is the result of an \n     extraordinary process of scientific study, negotiations among \n     representatives of the business and environmental \n     communities, and international diplomacy. It is a monumental \n     achievement.\n\n  The treaty, now ratified by 150 nations, represents a consensus on \nthe dangers of ozone depletion and provides for the eventual ban of CFC \nproduction. We later agreed to amendments to strengthen the ban in \n1990, as part of the Clean Air Act, and again, in 1992, under the terms \nof the Montreal Protocol.\n  Throughout this effort there were those who called the ozone hole and \nthe destruction of the ozone by CFC's a myth. However, several weeks \nago, our actions were vindicated beyond question when the three \nscientists who first alerted us to the possibility that CFC's were \ndestroying the ozone layer were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry.\n  During the debate on the VA-HUD appropriations bill, I sponsored an \namendment, along with Senator Jeffords and Senator Bingaman, that would \nhave given the Administrator the discretion to spend more than the $12 \nmillion now available under the conference report for the Montreal \nProtocol Fund. Although the amendment was approved by the Senate, it \nwas not retained in conference. I must say I am disappointed. If our \ngoal here is to encourage EPA to be mindful of good science, risk \nassessment, and management of scarce resources, then I cannot think of \na more necessary endeavor than their efforts to reverse the destruction \nof the stratospheric ozone layer.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to speak in opposition to the \nVA/HUD appropriations conference report. There are many reasons why I \nbelieve that the report we have before us represents unhealthy \npriorities for the American public, and I am pleased that the President \nhas expressed his intention to veto this bill should it pass the \nSenate.\n  First, this report provides $400 million less than the President's \nbudget request for the VA medical care account. This will have a \nserious impact on veterans' access to quality health care. While there \nmay be some doubt as to the validity of VA projections of the precise \nimpact of such a cut on veterans health care, there is no question that \nit would result in some combination of substantial reductions in the \nnumber of veterans treated both as outpatients and inpatients as the \nnumber of VA health care personnel shrink. The impact, according to the \nVA, would be equivalent to closing three VA medical centers with an \naverage of 300 beds each.\n  When these cuts are coupled with slashes in Medicare and Medicaid, \nmany veterans could be faced with a triple whammy--forced out of \nMedicare and Medicaid while VA is unable to handle a large influx of \nnew patients as the VA health care budget shrinks in real dollars. This \nwill particularly have an impact on the soaring population of veterans \nover age 65 and veterans unable to afford private health insurance.\n  In the process of cutting funding for major medical construction \nprojects, vital projects for renovating VA hospitals that do not meet \ncommunity standards and are deteriorating are scrapped. How can we \ntreat veterans who made sacrifices defending this country in facilities \nthat do not meet fire and other safety standards? What a travesty this \nis. At a time when we are honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of \nWorld War II and the veterans who risked their lives defending our \nfreedom, the least we can do is to ensure that they receive the health \ncare they are entitled to in a safe and dignified setting.\n  This report also eliminates funding for the Corporation for National \nService [CNS], which was established by the bipartisan National \nCommunity Service and Trust Act of 1993. The Corporation for National \nService administers such programs as AmeriCorps, the National Civilian \nCommunity Corps, and even former President Bush's Points of Light \nFoundation. President Clinton has requested $817,476 million for CNS \nfor fiscal year 1996. However, the report we have before us gives the \nNational Corporation $15 million for necessary expenses to terminate \nprograms, activities, and initiatives under the National Community \nService Act.\n  In order to understand the severity of this action, I would like to \nuse the AmeriCorps program as an example. AmeriCorps, which is funded \nand run by CNS, helps students pay for college in exchange for their \nservice to American communities. AmeriCorps is a program which needs to \nbe preserved. National Service addresses beliefs we all share: getting \nthings done, strengthening communities, encouraging personal \nresponsibility, and expanding opportunity. Despite the ideals realized \nby AmeriCorps, both the House and Senate individually denied funds to \nthe program in their VA/HUD appropriations bills, and now \nthe conference report kills the program outright. Fiscal year 1995 \npost/rescission funding was $219,000 million for AmeriCorps grants. The \nPresident requested $429,800 million for fiscal year 1996.\n\n  AmeriCorps has been a huge success. Members of law enforcement from \npolice chiefs Willie Williams of Los Angeles to Carol Mehrling of \nMontgomery County, MD, (and many departments in between, have been \nunwavering in their support for the AmeriCorps Program. And this is a \nprogram which Republicans and Democrats alike support. Members of \nCongress, Governors, mayors, and businesses such as IBM, General \nElectric and American Express know the value of AmeriCorps, and of the \nCorporation for National Service.\n  AmeriCorps has exceeded expectations about its efficiency. One study, \nvalidated by the GAO, found AmeriCorps produced $1.60 to $2.60 in \nbenefits for every invested Federal dollar. And the AmeriCorps is not \nsolely dependent on Federal dollars. During AmeriCorps first year it \nwas directed by Congress to raise $32 million. It actually raise three \ntimes that amount--$91 million, 41 million of which came from the \nprivate sector. We should not be misled by its success, however. \nAmeriCorps cannot raise private and foundation funds without Federal \nseed support.\n  AmeriCorps provides a large bang for education dollars while \nsimultaneously getting results for real needs, strengthening \ncommunities, and encouraging responsibility. Education. Public Safety. \nHuman Needs. The Environment. AmeriCorps is a program designed to do \nwhat we in Congress talk about all the time: bringing people from all \nbackgrounds together to solve problems at the local level.\n  In Minnesota, AmeriCorps members are extremely valuable. AmeriCorps \nmembers serving within the Minneapolis Public School provide activities \nto support the education of special needs youth. Members tutor, provide \nafter school education activities, and recruit volunteers for support \nprogramming. Members work to secure affordable housing for low-income \nfamilies, assist domestic violence victims, and coordinate projects to \nprevent and lessen homeless. Minnesota has AmeriCorps members doing \nmore different things than I have time to list here. Older Minnesotans \nwork as foster grandparents, serving over 80,000 children statewide. \nRural members teach pesticide safety. People work to restore our parks \nand trying to provide places for our children to play. Of course, \nMinnesota is not alone in its utilization of AmeriCorps volunteers. All \nof my colleagues come from States which benefit from them. All of us \nshould continue to support their efforts, not tear them down.\n  I am also opposed to this conference report because of the \ndevastating blow it delivers to funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  This conference report cuts EPA by 14 percent overall from what we \nappropriated last year. The conference report continues to contain a \nnumber of riders that aid special interests at the expense of the \nhealth and safety of the American people. These riders include one \nwhich would halt EPA efforts to expand one of our country's most \nsuccessful Right-to-Know programs, the Toxic Release Inventory.\n  Already this fiscal year, temporary continuing resolutions have \nresulted in a drastic cut in EPA's funding. As a result, EPA has been \nforced to cancel a \n\n[[Page S18652]]\nnumber of inspections involving all sorts of environmental hazards. As \nCarol Browner said today in the Washington Post, ``The environmental \ncop is not on the beat.'' The lack of inspections will only get worse \nunder this conference report that cuts enforcement funding by 14.6 \npercent.\n\n  These funding cuts will make it impossible for EPA to carry out work \nthat helps protect the health and safety of every American. This bill \nwill make it more difficult, if not impossible, for EPA to carry out \nits responsibilities under the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. We \ncannot allow this to happen and I don't believe the American people \nwant it to happen. At least, no Minnesotan has ever approached me to \nask for dirtier air and water, and that is exactly what slashing EPA's \nbudget this way will yield.\n  There are other reasons to oppose this conference report. While I \nsupport the President's commitment to streamline HUD's programs and I \nunderstand the importance of cutting funding for wasteful programs, I \nbelieve that the housing cuts in the VA-HUD conference report have gone \ntoo far.\n  Cuts to the section 8 program mean that homeless families or \nindividuals will be without the assistance they need to move to either \ntransitional or permanent housing.\n  Cuts to public housing modernization will mean that fewer housing \nunits will receive necessary repairs and maintenance. This maintenance \nis essential to ensure the quality of life of public housing residents \nand its neighbors.\n  This bill also cuts funding for the Homeless Assistance Grant \nProgram, Indian housing development, and the Housing Counseling Grant \nProgram.\n  All of these housing cuts will disproportionately harm low-income \npersons, the elderly, native Americans, and persons with AIDS. This \nfunding is a safety net and cuts in housing programs will mean only one \nthing--more people will be living on the streets. I think we are making \na mistake if we pass this package.\n  Given all these reasons--the irresponsible cuts to veterans programs, \nthe decimation of the Corporation for National Service, the damage done \nto environmental programs, and the attack on housing programs for the \nworking poor, I will oppose the VA-HUD Conference Report, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n\n           community development financial institutions fund\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment that funding for the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions [CDFI] fund has been eliminated in the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  The CDFI fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support several years ago. The program is \na key priority for President Clinton, and an important investment tool \nfor economically distressed communities. Unfortunately, partisan \ngamesmanship and shortsighted budget cutting will deny organizations \naround the country the opportunity to use this tool to better their own \ncommunities.\n  In a time of dwindling Federal resources, programs like CDFI that \nleverage private investment and stretch every Federal dollar, are more \nimportant than ever. The Fund is a small but very innovative program. \nFor a modest $50 million budget, the fund could make a significant \nimpact in communities struggling with unemployment and structural \ndecline.\n  Investments from the fund would create new jobs, promote small \nbusiness, restore neighborhoods, and generate tax revenues in towns \ndesperate for community development. It is estimated that every $1 of \nfund resources would leverage $10 in non-Federal resources.\n  Equally important, is the fact that these dollars are controlled at \nthe local level by financial institutions in the community which \nunderstand area needs and resources. Local control stimulates local \ninvestment as well. Area banks and local private donors are more \nwilling to contribute to economic development when they can see the \nresults in their own communities.\n  The CDFI fund has caught the interest of many community development \norganizations across the Nation. Already, over 1,500 groups have \nrequested information about the fund, and informational seminars that \nhave been held or are planned are expected to attract over 600 \npotential applicants. This bill leaves those organizations out in the \ncold.\n  Slashing investment in jobs and infrastructure is no way to balance \nthe budget. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this \nbill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 2099, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for \n1996.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $80.4 billion and new \noutlays of $46.2 billion to finance operations of the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat is within the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. When outlays from \nprior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into account, the bill \ntotals $80.4 billion in BA and $92.1 billion in outlays. The total bill \nis under the Senate subcommittee's 602(b) non- defense allocation by \n$420 million for budget authority and by $7 million for outlays. The \nsubcommittee is also at its defense allocation for BA and is under its \noutlay allocation by less than $500,000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference \nagreement on H.R. 2099.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         VA-HUD SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT         \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Budget              \n                                                   authority    Outlays \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed....................................  ..........          78\n  H.R. 2099, Conference report..................         153          92\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal defense discretionary............         153         170\n                                                 =======================\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed....................................  ..........      45,550\n  H.R. 2099, conference report..................      61,113      28,603\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.......................  ..........  ..........\n                                                                        \n    Subtotal nondefense discretionary...........      61,113      74,264\n                                                 =======================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed....................................  ..........         133\n  H.R. 2099, conference report..................      19,362      17,213\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget:                                                              \n    Resolution assumptions......................        -224         341\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory........................      19,138      17,688\n                                                 =======================\n      Adjusted bill total.......................      80,404      92,121\n                                                 =======================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Subtotal defense discretionary................         153         170\n  Nondefense discretionary......................      61,533      74,270\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund............  ..........  ..........\n  Mandatory.....................................      19,138      17,688\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total allocation..........................      80,824      92,128\n                                                 =======================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary.........................           0          -0\n  Nondefense discretionary......................        -420          -6\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund............  ..........  ..........\n  Mandatory.....................................  ..........  ..........\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total allocation..........................        -420          -7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I wish to comment on title I of the \nconference report on H.R. 2099, the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD \nappropriation bill.\n  Mr. President, I realize that this has been a very difficult year for \nfunding actions. I also know that, when compared to other agencies \ncovered by this bill, VA is treated relatively well. Having said that, \nI have to say that this appropriation conference report is bad news for \nVA which, in turn, means bad news for America's veterans, their \ndependents, and their survivors.\n  The medical care appropriation is $16.56 billion. This is better than \nthe level passed by the Senate, but nearly $400 million below the \namount proposed by the President. That amount is what VA needs to \nsupport the current level of health care services.\n  At the funding level in the conference report, VA will be forced to \ncut back on the level of services carried out in fiscal year 1995. In \nhuman terms, nearly 90,000 eligible veterans will be denied inpatient \nand outpatient care this year. The equivalent of three VA hospitals \nwill have to be shut down, and 5,000 VA health care professionals will \nlose their jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to focus on these repercussions. \nToo often we become numb when we just hear \n\n[[Page S18653]]\nsuch numbers and we lose sight of the human element in what we are \ndoing. These are real people that will be affected--veterans who \nanswered our country's call in her times of need, who now need real \nhealth care. They will be turned away from care or will be made to wait \nan inordinate period of time to receive the care they need--the care \nthey deserve--the care they have earned.\n  In my State there are four VA medical centers. Each plays an \nimportant role in its community. Each furnishes vital care to veterans \nin the geographic region served. Funding cuts at the level contained in \nthe conference report will lead to cuts in that service, and to a \ndenial of service to my constituents who are veterans--some with \ndisabilities from their service, others who managed to complete their \nservice without injury, but who are now unable to afford health care. \nSuch a result is wrongheaded. I deeply regret that we are about to \naccept and approve it.\n  I also find it disturbing that we are cutting VA below current \nservices at the very time that cutbacks are being proposed in Medicare \nand Medicaid. There is every reason to suspect that, as individuals are \npushed out of those programs by the changes being contemplated, \nveterans who have relied on either Medicare or Medicaid will turn to VA \nfor needed care.\n  VA health care is at a crossroads, and many innovative and dynamic \nchanges are happening within the system. It is possible--indeed \nlikely--that some of the changes about to be enacted will yield some \nsignificant efficiencies in how VA furnishes health care in the years \nto come. I am deeply concerned, however, that these cuts in the funding \nneeded by VA to furnish care in the coming fiscal year will actually \nundercut efforts that could allow VA to function more effectively in \nthe future. This is the worst time to be making blind cuts in VA \nfunding, with no appreciation of how such cuts can affect VA's future.\n  I have heard the suggestion that, since the number of veterans is \ndeclining, these cutbacks in VA health care are justified. While it is \ntrue that the overall veterans population is coming down--it is now \njust over 26 million--demand for VA care continues to increase, a \nphenomenon that is easy to understand when one realizes that, as the \nveterans population continues to age, the demand for health care \nservices actually is on the rise. As our veterans age, we should not be \nallowing the promises a grateful Nation made to be undone in our \nheadlong rush to balance the budget.\n  I am also deeply concerned about the cuts in the level of general \noperating expenses which fund the administration of the nonmedical \nactivities of VA. While the Senate-passed level of $880 million was \nover $35 million below the President's request, it was significantly \nabove the House-passed level and promised some opportunity for VA to \ncontinue to reduce the terrible backlog of claims in the Veterans \nBenefits Administration. Unfortunately, the level of GOE funding in the \nconference report, $843 million, will almost certainly mean that not \nonly will VA fail to improve, the recent trend will be reversed and the \nbacklog will grow.\n  I readily acknowledge that there are many problems that cannot be \ncorrected by a simple infusion of funding. It is also true that VA's \nclaims backlog is the result of far more than a simple lack of \nresources. However, it cannot be denied that the backlog problem can \nonly worsen when there is insufficient funding to allow VA to meet the \ndemand for services. The funding for GOE in the conference report is \nclearly insufficient, and I deeply regret that result.\n  I am very disappointed that the conference report includes onerous \nrestrictions on overall funding and travel funding for the Office of \nthe Secretary. I fear that this is little more than a petty assault on \nthe person of the current secretary, Secretary Brown, and does not \nrepresent any reasoned policy decision. I think such an action in the \ncontext of an appropriations bill is unworthy of the Congress, and I \ndeeply regret that conferees felt compelled to stoop to such a level.\n\n  The conference report includes funding for some construction projects \nwhich have not been authorized by the two Veterans' Affairs Committees. \nThese include clinics at two sites--Brevard County, Florida, and \nFairfield, California--where the Administration proposed to build \nmedical centers, but the Appropriations Committees refused to fund \nthem.\n  While the two medical centers were authorized, the freestanding \nclinics are not, and, pursuant to section 8104 of title 38, United \nStates Code, VA cannot spend funds for these unauthorized projects. I \nam not clear what the intention of the conferees is on this issue, but \nI am confident that, without specific action by the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittees to authorize these projects, VA will not be able to spend \nthe funds appropriated in this bill.\n  I also note that, during a markup in the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nearlier this year, I offered an amendment which would have authorized \nall of the construction projects proposed in the President's budget, \nbut my amendment was defeated.\n  I would be remiss if I failed to note one positive item in the \nconference report, namely, the absence of a provision passed by both \nHouses which would have limited compensation benefits to certain \nveterans disabled by mental illness. I fought very hard to have that \nprovision dropped during Senate debate, and I am truly delighted that \nmy goal was achieved in the conference.\n  As I noted at the outset, this is not a good bill for veterans. I am \ndeeply concerned about its ramifications as we move forward in this \nfiscal year, and I intend to monitor closely the effects of the limited \nfunding on VA's ability to meet the needs of our Nation's veterans. I \nwill not hesitate to seek additional funding for various VA activities \nas the need arises in the coming year. We have tough choices to make as \nwe seek to balance the budget. Veterans must be accorded special \nattention and protection in that effort.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I express my deepest gratitude to my \nesteemed colleague, Senator Mikulski, the ranking Democrat on the \nSenate VA-HUD Subcommittee, for her continued efforts with respect to \nveterans' programs. I truly appreciate the extraordinary spirit of \ncooperation between us, during the appropriations process and \nthroughout the year. Consistently over the years, Senator Mikulski has \nshown strong, unwavering support for veterans' programs. Although she \nwas not as successful as I know she wished to be this year, her \nadvocacy never wavered. She is a true friend and champion of veterans.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I find a number of ironies this week as we consider the \nconference report on the appropriations bill for veterans programs.\n  As I speak, American troops are being deployed in Bosnia. They \nrepresent us in seeking to help secure the peace and put an end to the \natrocities that have for too long plagued the people of that region. \nThey serve to defend our national interest and to protect our liberties \nin a troubled part of the world.\n  Every Senator who came to this floor during our marathon session \nyesterday debating the deployment of our troops pledged support for \nthem. That support should not end when they return out of harms' way. \nThey deserve our continuing support and appreciation, just as the \nveterans of World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, and those \nwho have been deployed on our behalf in conflicts and missions around \nthe world deserve our respect and support. The troops being deployed in \nBosnia will be tomorrow's veterans.\n  I am also struck by the fact that we are only now proceeding with our \nwork on the funding for veterans' programs. Although we are now in \nDecember, well past all statutory deadlines for appropriations bills, \ntwo months' past the beginning of the fiscal year, and fast approaching \nthe expiration of our second continuing resolution, we are still \nwithout an appropriations bill for veterans' programs.\n  I must note that when we considered that bill initially in the \nSenate, Senator Rockefeller offered an amendment, which I cosponsored, \nto restore more than $500 million that had been cut from the Veteran \nAdministration's medical care account. The Senate rejected our effort. \nWe tried, unsuccessfully, to protect exempt service-connected veterans \nbenefits from further cuts to balance the budget. We wanted to preserve \nand protect the benefits we provide our veterans, who were there \n\n[[Page S18654]]\nwhen this Nation asked for their service.\n  We could not get support from enough of our Senate colleagues. If my \ncolleagues are truly interested in our veterans, let them join us in \nour efforts to increase funding for veterans medical research. Let us \nprovide the quality physicians needed in the veterans health care \nsystem. Let us fund the work that is so desperately needed in digestive \ndiseases, prosthetics, lung cancer, diabetes and geriatrics. Last year, \nthe President answered our call when, in response to a letter from me \ncosigned by 41 of my Senate colleagues, he increased his request for \nfunds for veterans medical research to $257 million.\n  Join us by restoring the two new Veteran Administration hospitals \nthat are so needed in California and Florida, but that are eliminated \nin this conference report. Join us by melting the ``freeze'' on \nveterans programs that the Republican budget would enact and that would \nresult in the closing of 35 veterans hospitals nationwide.\n  We all want to be patriotic and show respect for our veterans. Let us \nremember the words of Abraham Lincoln that are chiseled on a plaque at \nthe Veterans Administration building just a few blocks from the \nCapitol: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his \nwidow, and his orphan.'' Let us use our votes when they really count on \nbehalf of our veterans by restoring their benefits and protecting their \nmedical services.\n  The final irony is that this is the week that we debated and voted \nupon a proposed constitutional amendment that would have restricted the \nBill of Rights for the first time in our history. That effort failed \nand I detailed the reasons for my vote in a prior statement. For all \nthose who voted in favor of the constitutional amendment on flag \ndesecration and said that they did so in order to respond to the wishes \nof our veterans, I hope that they will show the respect and support \nthat our veterans deserve by raising their voices and using their votes \non behalf of our veterans by restoring their benefits and protecting \ntheir medical services.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand, by previous order, that \nI have 10 minutes available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I doubt I will use all the time but I \ndo want to take some minutes to discuss the VA/HUD conference report \nand some of the problems that I have with this bill.\n  The Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, the chairman, and the \ndistinguished ranking member from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, deserve \ncommendation for their hard work on this legislation. It is a \ncomplicated bill, this one, because it contains several programs that \ncould be described as critical by virtue of the respect and support \nthat these programs have. When you talk about the Veterans \nAdministration you talk environmental protection, you talk about \nhousing--these are very, very important programs; FEMA, the disaster \nrelief agency, and NASA. So, there is a lot of review. There is a lot \nof support for each one of the programs and the advocates fight hard \nfor the programs that strike them as being the most important.\n  But it just does not do the job. It is not the fault of the chairman \nor the ranking member. They have done their best in a very tough \nsituation, but they just do not have enough funding to do these \nimportant tasks. They also had to contend with demands from the House \nof Representatives which continues to insist on deep cuts in \nenvironmental programs and housing and other high-priority programs.\n  In the end, with regret, I am going to strongly oppose this \nconference report. It would cut funding at EPA by more than 20 percent. \nIt is an area that I have done a lot of work in. Before the last \nelection I was chairman of the Superfund committee, working on the \nenvironment, and I worked very hard on issues of clean air and clean \nwater and various other environmental programs. The final bill reflects \nwhat, in my view, are skewed, grossly skewed priorities.\n  The majority has repeatedly argued that the balanced budget in some \naccounts, like Medicare and Medicaid, are not actually being cut. What \nis being cut, they say, is the rate of increase. In the case of EPA, \nthese are real cuts that are being proposed, real decreases, real \nattempts to turn back the clock on environmental protection. This \nlegislation would slash the budget of the Environmental Protection \nAgency by 21 percent. One-fifth of its budget just taken away. To me, \nit is very simple. The effects are dirtier air, dirtier water, fewer \ntoxic waste sites being cleaned up.\n\n  I view the quality of our environment as a critical legacy for the \ngenerations that follow us: For my children, my grandchildren. If there \nis one thing I can do for them that will leave them a better America it \nis to help clear up the environment, to permit them to breathe the air \nthat we take for granted and not be worried about contracting some \nrespiratory condition; or drink the water and not jeopardize their \nhealth. To be able to fish in the streams and be able to swim in the \nocean without debris floating all over the place. That is the way I see \nour environmental requirements. So, these are deep cuts that hurt.\n  And I also point out this legislation is just the tip of the iceberg. \nThe Republican long-term budget plan would have a devastating impact on \nenvironmental protection over the next several years. It would destroy \nEPA's ability to protect our environment and the public health. It \nwould cripple enforcement of environmental laws. The one criticism that \nwe hear constantly: Oh, that bureaucracy, they are all over us. They \nare all over business and they are all over citizens and they are all \nover communities.\n  The fact of the matter is that environmental laws have worked \nsurprisingly well for us. In a period of roughly 20 years, from 1973-\n1974 until now, instead of 40 percent of our streams and tributaries \nbeing fishable and swimmable, we have gone up to 60 percent. And even \nin places like the Hudson River, which separates New York from New \nJersey, we have begun to see some salmon coming back. We see some \nstriped bass coming up the river. I do not know whether they are ready \nfor eating, but they are there, and the populations are growing because \nthe water is cleaner.\n  Given half a chance, nature fights back, and very vigorously. But it \ndoes not take a lot of neglect for nature to return to a decrepit \ncondition. So, if you do not have enforcement to make sure that \ncompliance is honest, then the laws that are on the books as we all \nknow here are worthless.\n  The long-term budget plan would destroy EPA's ability to protect our \nenvironment and public health. It would severely set back the progress \nI just indicated we have made in recent decades, to protect and \npreserve our natural resources.\n  The bill before us cuts EPA's enforcement function so deeply that it \nwill give polluters a holiday from complying with the law. We have seen \nstories in the newspapers about EPA's inability to conduct the surveys \nthat they have to, to see whether people are complying with the rules, \nor with the laws. We have seen situations where Superfund programs, \nSuperfund cleanups are going to stop dead in their tracks. Enforcement \nprograms are targeted for a cut of 27 percent.\n  Mr. President, EPA is the environmental cop on the beat, and we would \nnot cut law enforcement by a quarter, thank goodness. We would not cut \nFBI by a quarter, thank goodness. But this bill will cut the resources \nprovided to stop environmental crimes by 27 percent. The question \nraised is how many children's health will be jeopardized as a result of \nthose pollution laws not being enforced?\n  Mr. President, some Members of the other body seem to believe that \nEPA's enforcement office does nothing more than sue innocent \nlandowners. But if these cuts are enacted, those Members are going to \ncome in for a rude surprise because EPA's enforcement office performs \nmany functions that are important--not only for environmental \nprotection, but for the efficient operation of many businesses. Beyond \ninvestigating allegations of violations in carrying out inspections, \nenforcement funding is used to approve permits for companies to take \nparticular actions and that cut in enforcement funding is \n\n[[Page S18655]]\ngoing to cause severe dislocations in the private sector as they wait \nand wait for permits to take up a new product or a new location.\n  When companies change the way they produce products, their pollution \nemissions often change as well. And, if so, they have to obtain a \npermit from EPA.\n  Mr. President, what is going to happen when EPA's enforcement staff \nis cut by 27 percent? We can easily tell what is going to happen. There \nare going to be major delays in issuing permits. That is going to have \na negative impact on many companies' balance sheets.\n  Mr. President, if this kind of cut is enacted, it can almost be \nguaranteed that next year Senators will come to the floor and blame \nthis problem on an inefficient EPA. But EPA is not going to be the \nculprit. The culprit will be the Congress and the resource that it \nsupplied for these functions.\n  To get some feel for what a 27-percent cut will mean in terms of \nweakened environmental enforcement, consider what happened at EPA since \nthe recently enacted continuing resolution reduced funding temporarily \nby a comparable amount. No new criminal investigations were started, \nand some of the ongoing investigations into criminal activity were \ndelayed because the staff from EPA could not travel to these locations.\n  EPA stopped a major investigation into the fraudulent sale of \nadulterated gasoline in Texas, and will be forced to halt all mobile \nsource inspections and investigations.\n  EPA canceled all inspections of laboratories designed to ensure the \nintegrity of health effects data.\n  There is just no getting around the fact that cutting the enforcement \nbudget will have serious negative impacts. It will mean more pollution. \nIt will mean responsible companies that comply with the laws will be at \na competitive disadvantage with their less honorable competitors. It \nwill mean a less healthy environment for our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the manager whether there are a couple more \nminutes available.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 8 additional minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is very kind. I appreciate it. I will try to \nwrap up quicker than that because I also want to point out that this \nlegislation will force State and local governments to bear extra \nburdens. The States will lose money that they badly need to protect the \nenvironment, and to comply with Federal requirements. Grants to clean \nup municipal sewage and industrial waste water emissions will be over \n$665 million less than the President requested. The administration's \nrequest for funding of safe drinking water initiatives will be cut by \n$225 million.\n\n  This bill also will make devastating cuts in programs that protect \nour citizens from the hazards of abandoned toxic waste. It would reduce \nfunds for hazardous waste cleanups by 20 percent.\n  No new Superfund project starts would be allowed. Under this bill, \ntoxic waste sites will be fenced and forgotten.\n  Cleanups are complete or underway at nearly 800 sites across this \ncountry, and the rate of site remediation has increased significantly \nover the last 3 years. This bill will halt this progress in its tracks, \nthreatening the health of communities and increasing long-term cleanup \ncosts. And surely this is not what the public wants.\n  Mr. President, when the House of Representatives initially approved \nthis bill, it included 18 provisions designed to reverse or gut \nexisting environmental law. The House has voted three times on these \nriders, ultimately reversing itself and removing these riders. It did \nso in the wake of a public outcry over the hijacking of this bill by \nspecial interests intent on weakening antipollution laws.\n  Yet, like the genie out of the bottle, some riders live on. They are \nback. There are eight of them in this bill, one that attempts to limit \nthe reach of the community right-to-know law. Another reverses the \nlanguage of the Clean Water Act to remove EPA's authority to protect \nwetlands. This wetlands amendment was the subject of a New York Times \nfront page story on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, our country has made enormous progress since the \nenvironmental movement was ignited by Earth Day in 1970.\n  It is with considerable regret that I urge my colleagues to reject \nthis conference report, and if it is sent to the President and he \nvetoes it, as he said he would, I hope that we can muster enough votes \nto sustain his veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \nadoption of the conference report occur at 6:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--but if we reach the point, if I may ask this question of the \ndistinguished manager through the Chair, where all time is not being \nrequested, is it possible to even vote before the 6:45 period?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the setting of a time certain was \nnecessary to accommodate Members who had other commitments. While it \nmay not be efficient, I think it may be easier to schedule other \nactivities than to have to go on at this time of the evening. That is \nwhy I would suggest we stay with the 6:45 time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Texas has been \nwaiting to be recognized. She has 10 minutes under her control.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I do not intend to take 10 \nminutes. I just wanted to respond to some of the things that were said \nby the distinguished Senator from Arkansas who has not supported the \nspace station, and who raised a question about the Russian \nparticipation using some of the Mir hardware.\n  I think it is very important that we look at the importance of space \nresearch and the space station, and look at the contribution that it \nhas made to our economy.\n  The Senator said that out of $94 billion, $90 billion is going to be \nput forward by America. In fact, the costs we are talking about are the \ndevelopment costs. That is what we are in now. The development costs \nare right at $30 billion of which $9 billion is being contributed by \nEurope, Japan, and Canada. Our Russian partners are contributing \nhardware for the Mir that works into the space station.\n  It is certainly true that they are looking at other proposals which, \nof course, we all want to look at to see if they are going to save \nmoney, and if it is going to be in everyone's best interest to do it. I \nthink that is what NASA is certainly going to do, and it is the right \nthing for them to do. But I think it is important that we look at what \nthe space station has contributed for our country.\n  First, it has been cut 35 percent from its original target budget. \nThat has saved the taxpayers of America $40 billion. They are working \nin an efficient way to do this space research that is so important for \nour future technology, and our future jobs in a way that the taxpayers \ncan afford.\n  In fact, aerospace is the single strongest export sector of the \nUnited States economy. In 1993, exports topped $40 billion. When we \nlook at exactly what the space station is going to do, there are \ncertain things that can only be done in microgravity conditions. You \ncannot duplicate microgravity conditions on Earth. You must be in \nspace.\n  Senator Mikulski and I have been working on women's health issues, \nand it is women's health issues that will get the greatest gain from \nthe microgravity research. They are going to be able to look into \nosteoporosis, bone mass loss, which particularly attacks women. And \nbreast cancer cells are able to be duplicated and grown in the \nmicrogravity conditions. They find that is the very best way they are \nable to study breast cancer cells.\n  So I think we are looking at tremendous contributions to women's \nhealth \n\n[[Page S18656]]\ncare by the use of the microgravity conditions that can only be done in \nspace and not on Earth. You cannot duplicate microgravity on Earth no \nmatter what you do. So this is a unique capability that is very \nimportant for our future.\n  This is the largest cooperative science program in history. We have \n13 nations now participating in this science project. I think that is \nthe wave of the future. If we are going to go into the big science \ntechnology and research, we should have other countries able to \ncontribute, not only because it saves our taxpayer dollars, but these \nare things that should be shared with other countries so that we can \nget the most benefit from this kind of research.\n  So I think it is very important, as we close this debate, to say that \nspace research produces $2 for every $1 invested--$2 into our economy. \nThat means 40,000 direct and indirect jobs that come from this. But \nmost of all, Mr. President, it is a commitment to the future. It is a \ncommitment that was made by President Kennedy because he could see that \nthere was so much more technology and science available if we had the \nvehicle to go into space and collect it. In fact, he would never even \nhave dreamed of the successes that we have had because he was willing \nto take that chance and put America in the forefront and leadership of \ntechnological research.\n  We cannot step back from that. It would not be in our best interest \nto do so. It would not allow us to stay at the forefront of creating \njobs and creating new industries and new products that will keep our \neconomy thriving and able to bring in people who are going to be \ngrowing into the job market.\n  So I am very pleased to support this project. I am pleased to support \nthis conference report. I have worked with Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski to try to make sure that the space station does have what it \nneeds to do the job that it must do. I am very impressed with the \nproblems they had. Having VA and HUD and space, NASA research and all \nof the independent agencies and making the difficult choices was \nsomething to behold, and they did an excellent job.\n  This is probably going to be a close vote. I cannot imagine that they \ncould have divided up a bill any more fairly than they did on this one.\n  So I commend them for their hard work. It was hard to get a consensus \non these difficult issues. They did a terrific job, and I am pleased to \nsupport them.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincere thanks to the Senator \nfrom Texas. She has been a very articulate, very forceful spokesperson \nfor space exploration.\n  Mr. President, I do not wish to prolong this debate, but I feel that \nit should be pointed out that the appropriation for the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] represents a $352 million \nreduction from the level provided in fiscal year 1995. This is an \noverall cut of 2.5 percent. The conference agreement, however, provides \nthe full amount of the budget request to continue development of the \nspace station: $2.1 billion.\n  Despite the overall reduction in the NASA budget, and full funding of \nthe space station, the committee was able to restore funding for a \nnumber of important space science programs, fully fund the space \nshuttle program, maintain the X-33 next generation launch vehicle \ndevelopment, and continue the Earth Observing System Program to study \nglobal climate change.\n  In addition, the conference agreement removed the fence on space \nstation obligations which assures that there will be no funding \ndisruptions during developmental activities during the balance of this \nfiscal year. The space station program is on track, on budget, and on \ntime. Fabrication of large components of actual flight equipment have \nbeen completed. Each week more equipment is being produced, and is \nundergoing final engineering testing in preparation for launch and \ndeployment beginning in November 1997.\n  No one should be confused on this point: We can and will proceed with \ndevelopment, and operation of this international space station. Through \ncareful management, intense budgetary review, and hard-nosed priority \nsetting, we will do it without impairing other vital science missions \nof NASA and other Federal agencies. And we will succeed in this bold \ninitiative, despite our commitment and efforts to bring the Federal \nbudget into balance.\n  This conference agreement is a clear and unequivocal demonstration \nthat each of these important goals can and will be accomplished. \nDespite all the naysayers and doubters, the international space station \nprogram is succeeding, and shows that the United States is committed to \nmaintaining its leadership in space.\n  I am pleased to yield the Senator from Alaska 2 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Bond and the \nranking member of the committee, Senator Mikulski, for their support on \nthis bill. I come to the floor because a member of the Alaska State \nSenate has told me there is a rumor in Alaska that this bill is cutting \nthe VA very severely and is going to cause reductions in the VA offices \nin Alaska.\n  I want to reassure him and other veterans that that is not the case. \nThe truth is, as I understand this bill, it increases VA funding, it \ndoes not cut it. This is disturbing news that the VA is contemplating a \nmajor reorganization which would eliminate pension and benefits \npersonnel in Alaska. That would mean that our people would have to \nwrite or call or go to Reno, NV, or Phoenix, AZ, when trying to seek \nhelp on their pensions or their benefits. That is like asking the \npeople of Maine to go down to Dallas, TX.\n  I think sometimes people forget the vast distances we deal with in my \nState. The bill does not require the elimination of VA offices in \nAlaska. I do hope to get more details on this plan, and I hope the \nSenate will join us in opposing moving functions from Alaska to what we \ncall the lower 48 States, thousands of miles away from our veterans.\n  I want to congratulate my two friends, who managed this bill for, \nonce again, including money for the rural water and sewer programs in \nAlaska. This is a program to eliminate the honey buckets in the \nvillages of our State. There are 132 villages that lack modern \nfacilities. We want to bring water and sewage facilities to them. This \nbill will help EPA continue to participate in that.\n  We have a provision in this bill that also prohibits the EPA from \nrequiring the city of Fairbanks to use MTBE, the substance that goes \ninto gasoline, to meet clean air targets under the Clean Air Act for \nthe period of this bill.\n  It also includes $2 million to initiate a new program to clean up \nleaking above-ground bulk-fuel storage tanks in rural Alaska. Most of \nthose tanks, Mr. President, cannot be buried because of the permafrost, \nand people in the area do need a new system. We have to devise a new \nplan. This bill will start that plan.\n  I thank my friend and again congratulate the two managers of this \nbill. It is a good bill, and I hope the President will sign it. I thank \nmy friend, Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in wrapping up discussions on this measure, \nI just have to say, for my colleagues, I will be submitting for the \nRecord the information on how this bill does meet our environmental \nneeds.\n  As I predicted when I spoke earlier today, there has been a lot of \nvocal pollution about what this bill does. The Vice President and the \nAdministrator of the EPA had a big news conference, and they cited \nthese outlandish figures of a 27-percent cut in enforcement of \nenvironmental programs. Mr. President, that is 20 percent off of the \npie-in-the-sky budget that the President proposed when he was asking \nfor a $300 billion deficit.\n  This is the biggest spending binge that the President could conceive \nof. And when we cut back to reach a balance, which the President now \nsays he is willing to join us in reaching, there is no way that you can \nincrease funding for everything as he wished. Let me make clear that \nthe final amount in this bill for EPA is $5.7 billion, a reduction of \njust about 4 percent from the \n\n[[Page S18657]]\nfiscal year 1995 postrescission funding level, just about $235 million. \nThe reductions which came about came from two areas: Superfund, a \nprogram mired in litigation, and bureaucracy, which must be fixed. \nThere is money to start cleanups where human health is involved, and we \ndirected them to do that.\n  Sewer treatment construction earmarks were reduced. That was the pork \nin last year's bill. This committee has followed the nonpartisan \nNational Academy of Public Administration's directions to move more \nresponsibility to the States, and 40 percent of the appropriation, $2.3 \nbillion, goes directly to the States for grants to meet environmental \nmandates.\n  The press release and the Senator from New Jersey say that this \nthreatens the safety of water quality because it cuts by 45 percent \nState loan funds. That is just simply wrong, as were most of the other \nstatements made about this bill.\n  It provides $500 million for drinking water State revolving funds. \nNot a penny of the funds appropriated last year were spent. We \nstipulated that the remaining funds, $225 million from last year, in \naddition to the new funds, totaling $275 million go to the drinking \nwater State revolving funds. If the fund is not authorized, the money \nwill be used for waste water revolving funds. This is an insurance \npolicy that the money appropriated will be utilized to ensure the \nhealth of our Nation's water bodies.\n  There are tremendous misstatements about this measure. I will correct \nthose in the material I submit for the Record. I point out that if this \nbill is vetoed, as some on the other side wish, it will be an 11.5 \npercent cut below this bill under the continuing resolution. \nEnvironment will be much worse off if this bill is vetoed. For that \nreason, I would urge my colleagues, all of my colleagues on this side, \nto support the bill.\n  I hope that we can work together and have the support of some of our \ncolleagues on the other side because, if additional funds are made \navailable above our current 602(b) allocation, they may be added by a \ncontinuing resolution which I hope would be agreeable on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. President, I express my greatest thanks to my ranking member, the \ndistinguished former chair of this committee, for her invaluable \nassistance. She and I wish that we had had more money available. But \nshe has been extremely helpful and very capable and a great asset in \nmoving this process forward.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken once today on how well we have treated \nEPA in this year's appropriation, despite overall budget reductions, \nand I will not repeat my entire statement. But I will say once again \nthat the conference agreement makes clear that Republicans support \nprotecting and cleaning up the environment--but that we do not support \nduplicative, wasteful spending and micromanaging States' environmental \nefforts.\n  Despite the fact that the House had reduced EPA by one-third in its \noriginal VA-HUD bill, in conference we were able to find an additional \n$49 million above the Senate-passed bill which had $770 million more \nthan the House for EPA.\n  The final amount for EPA is $5.7 billion, a reduction of just $235 \nmillion or 4 percent below the fiscal year 1995 post-rescission funding \nlevel.\n  The largest reductions below last year come from two key areas--\nSuperfund--a program mired in litigation and bureaucracy which must be \nfixed, and sewer treatment construction earmarks, which were reduced by \n$500 million below last year's level.\n  The committee's recommendation closely parallels recommendations made \nto this committee by the National Academy of Public Administration, and \nare intended to streamline the agency, eliminate duplication, ensure a \nflexible approach to working with industry, and full support to the \nStates.\n  More than 40 percent of the appropriation--$2.3 billion--goes \ndirectly to the States for grants to meet environmental mandates. This \nis an increase of approximately $300 million over last year.\n  The largest programmatic reduction in the bill is from Superfund--a \nreduction of $170 million below fiscal year 1995. There is no need to \nthrow money at a program which virtually everyone agrees does not work. \nHowever, despite serious concerns about the program, we found $160 \nmillion in conference above the House and Senate-passed spending levels \nfor this program. This amount ensures that all projects in the pipeline \nreceive funding and that risks to human health and the environment will \nbe addressed.\n  Mr. President, compared to the current continuing resolution, this \nconference agreement provides a 11.5-percent increase. So I cannot \nunderstand why the President wants to veto this bill. I imagine a full \nyear CR would be even tighter than the current one. Unfortunately, the \nWhite House has indicated an unwillingness to negotiate a reasonable \ncompromise on the VA-HUD bill.\n  I made reference in this morning's floor statement about the press \nconference the Vice President and Ms. Browner would be holding later in \nthe day. I have just received the press release from EPA and I am very \ntroubled by the factual inaccuracies contained in it. Let me provide \none example of how this administration is misrepresenting what this \nbudget does.\n  The press release says the Republican budget threatens the safety of \nwater quality because it cuts by 45 percent State loan funds that would \nhelp communities protect their drinking water. Mr. President, this just \nis not true.\n  This bill provides $500 million for drinking water State revolving \nfunds--the President's full budget request. There were no dollars spent \non this program last year because it was not authorized. Not a penny of \nthe funds appropriated last year has been spent. We have stipulated in \nthe bill that the amount remaining from last year's appropriation, $225 \nmillion, in addition to new funds totaling $275 million, go to drinking \nwater State revolving funds if there is an authorization by June 1. And \nif not, those funds would be provided for wastewater State revolving \nfunds. We've provided an insurance policy that if no authorization \noccurs, the States will still be able to spend these funds on water \ninfrastructure to ensure the health of our Nation's water bodies.\n  In the previous two appropriations for drinking water State revolving \nfunds, those funds were not available unless a drinking water bill was \nenacted.\n  Finally, let me mention the so-called riders. The conference \nagreement includes only six legislative riders for pertaining EPA, most \nof which are completely noncontroversial and several of which were \nincluded in previous VA-HUD bills authored by Democrats. In fact, the \nSenator from New Jersey was a supporter, I am told, of one of the so-\ncalled rider pertaining to radon in drinking water in previous years.\n  I think it is time we start talking straight and fairly about what \nthis bill does and does not do to the environment. I urge those on the \nother side of the aisle once again to quit the grandstanding and \nfactual inaccuracies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have nothing to add to all that has \nbeen said. My opening statement summarized everything. I yield back \nsuch time that I might have. Our side of the aisle is ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 6:45 having arrived, the Senate \nwill proceed to vote on agreeing to the conference report accompanying \nH.R. 2099. The yeas and nays having been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate concurs \nin the House amendment to Senate amendment No. 63.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I want to thank those Members who supported \nus in this very difficult measure. I have already mentioned the \nabsolutely vital assistance and support of the distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. She has been most \nhelpful.\n  I would say also that I am most appreciative of her staff, Rusty \nMathews and Steve Crane, who have been of great assistance to us in \nthis measure.\n  On my side, Stephen Kohashi, who is the lead clerk, Carrie Apostolou. \nWe had the help of Steve Isakowitz on NASA matters, and of course \nLashawnda Leftwich has worked with us. This was not a bill. This seemed \nto be more like a multiyear protect.\n  I express my sincere thanks to all of the people, the staff, who \nworked so hard on it. I express particular thanks to the people in the \nadministration, particularly Dan Golden, James Lee Witt, and Henry \nCisneros, who worked very cooperatively with us to help implement the \nvery difficult decisions we had to make.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a tremendous amount of \nmisinformation and disinformation put out about this bill. I will be \npreparing a full explanation of some of the misstatements that were \nissued in the news conference held earlier today. It is regrettable \nthat we cannot have an honest debate, using figures that are actual \nfigures from last year and actual figures in this bill, but that, \nunfortunately, does not seem to be the rule.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is a remaining amendment which we need \nto dispose of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no further amendment. It has been \nadopted.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there seems to be no further comments from \nmy ranking member.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18639-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, last night I voted in support of the \nBosnia resolution offered by our distinguished majority leader, Senator \nDole. and President Clinton for putting their principles above \npolitics. We have a great national tradition of bipartisanship in \nforeign policy. The world must know that, when it comes to America's \nrole in the world, we stand together--Republicans, Democrats, and \nindependents alike--as Americans. In that regard, Senator Dole and \nPresident Clinton have served us very well.\n  While I have deep concerns about this country's Bosnia policy, I also \nbelieve it is our moral and patriotic duty to stand by our troops \nalready on the ground in Bosnia. These brave men and women deserve a \nstrong showing of support for their work and their mission. And that is \nexactly what an overwhelming and bipartisan majority of the Senate gave \nthem last night. We owed them nothing less.\n  Yet I remain deeply concerned about the wording of Senator Dole's \nresolution and our mission in the former Yugoslavia. First and \nforemost, our troops are being sent to Bosnia as peacekeepers. They are \nthere to enforce the terms of the peace agreement negotiated in Dayton, \nOH. And I firmly believe--for their own safety and the success of this \nmission--they must remain neutral. They must not be perceived as taking \nsides in the regional and ethnic conflict that has torn the former \nYugoslavia apart.\n  Unfortunately, I fear the resolution we voted on last night sends a \nmessage that our troops will not be neutral; that they will be called \nupon to help train and rearm the Bosnian Moslems; that they will be \nengaged in enterprise of nation building that failed so badly in \nSomalia. And if that happens--if our troops are anything more than \nneutral peacekeepers--this mission is destined to failure. We must not \nlet that happen.\n  In closing, I urge the President and our military leaders to do \neverything possible to assure the safety, neutrality, and success of \nour troops and their mission in Bosnia. And I urge everyone to say a \nprayer that they make it home soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18658-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18658-S18659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday I did not speak on the pending \nBosnia resolutions in order to permit the Senate to finish its \nconsideration of this important matter prior to the formal signing of \nthe Dayton Agreement in Paris early this morning.\n  However, I wanted to take this opportunity to express my thoughts on \nwhat transpired yesterday.\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, the Senate went on record as to whether \nthis institution supports the President's decision to participate in \nthe Bosnian peace initiative. In fact, I believe that we went on record \non matters much broader and more significant than that. We went on \nrecord as to whether we in the United States Senate support peace in \nBosnia or war? Whether we support the continuation of American \nleadership in the world or the abdication of that leadership? Whether \nwe support a post-cold-war international order that is governed by the \nrule of law or the force of arms?\n  To some, this may seem a rather simplistic summary of what the debate \nover the last several days was all about. But, I would say to my \ncolleagues, when you boil it all down, that is what we were really \ntalking about.\n  The war that has raged in Bosnia for nearly 4 years has been one of \nunspeakable atrocities; of torture, internment, rape, execution, of \nethnic cleansing and genocide. More than a quarter of a million people \nhave lost their lives. Millions more have been made refugees--many \nwithin the borders of their own country. Once stable multiethnic towns \nand villages have become flaming infernos as opposing Moslem, Serb, and \nBosnian forces have sought revenge against one other.\n  Regardless of one's views on the various resolutions we will vote on, \nI know that our shared hopes and prayers are that the Dayton peace \naccord--brokered by the United States, and agreed to by all the warring \nfactions--will once and for all bring to a close this bloody chapter of \nBosnia's history.\n  I believe that the Dayton peace agreement contains the essential \ningredients to facilitate the writing of a new, hopefully brighter \nchapter for the people of Bosnia.\n  These elements include: Bosnia preserved as a single State, within \nits present internationally recognized borders; the country subdivided \ninto two juridical entities--the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nand the Republic of Srpska; an agreed cease-fire line, the separation \nof opposing forces on either side of this line, and the establishment \nof a demilitarization zone; the creation of a 60,000-person peace \nimplementation force, under NATO command, to monitor and enforce the \nmilitary aspects of the agreement; internationally supervised \ndemocratic elections for President and Parliament to be conducted \nwithin a year; freedom of movement of all Bosnian citizens; independent \nmonitoring of human rights of all Bosnians; the establishment of an \ninternationally trained civilian police force; and a commitment by all \nparties \n\n[[Page S18659]]\nto cooperate with the activities of the War Crimes Tribunal.\n  Clearly the implementation of the military aspects of this agreement \nare critical to the success or failure of the other elements of the \npeace plan. And, U.S. participation in the implementation force is \npivotal in that regard. But, it is important to keep in mind that \nwhile U.S. participation is essential, we will not be alone in the \neffort to implement the agreement--more than 25 countries have pledged \nto participate as well and will provide two-thirds of the 60,000-person \nimplementing force.\n\n  While the Dayton Agreement has been well crafted, it is by no means \n100-percent guaranteed to be successful--no agreement of this kind \nfalls into that category. However, every effort has been made to \nminimize the chance of failure. Each and every American soldier who \ngoes to Bosnia will be well trained and well armed to face any \neventuality. The leaders of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia have also \npledged to ensure the safety and security of the implementing force.\n  However, Mr. President, I think it would be unrealistic to promise \nthe American people that there will be no casualties incurred during \nOperation Joint Endeavor. That is a promise that is not, unfortunately, \ntotally within our power to fulfill.\n  Ultimately the success or failure of the Bosnian peace agreement will \ndepend upon the willingness of the governments of Bosnia, Croatia, and \nSerbia to live up to their commitments to each other and to the \ninternational community. Without question, U.S. involvement will \nheighten the prospects for compliance by all parties and lessen the \npossibility that the Balkans will once again become engulfed in war. On \nthe other hand, if the United States stands on the sidelines at this \ncrucial moment, the renewal of armed conflict is all but assured.\n  Many of my colleagues have mentioned in the course of this debate \nthat public opinion polls suggest that the American people do not \ncurrently support the deployment of United States troops to Bosnia. To \nthem I would say, there is nothing novel about that. The public was \ninitially quite negative about U.S. participation in the Persian Gulf \nwar and only when Operation Desert Storm was up and running did the \npublic mood shift.\n  It is no secret that the American people have always cared more about \nwhat happens at home than abroad and have sometimes been slow to \nappreciate the ramifications of international events on their own \ndomestic security and prosperity. It is the responsibility of the \nPresident and other political leaders to explain to our citizens why a \nparticular course of action is ultimately in the interest of this \ncountry.\n  President Clinton has endeavored to explain the various United States \ninterests at stake in the Bosnian peace process. I believe he has done \na very credible job of making the case for the difficult decision he \nhas made. On November 27, President Clinton went directly to the \nAmerican people to explain why he is prepared to participate in the \nquest for peace in Bosnia.\n  During that address he put the matter very succinctly:\n\n       In Bosnia, a terrible war has challenged our interests and \n     troubled our souls. Our interests are plain. The cause is \n     right. Our mission will be clear, limited and achievable. The \n     people of Bosnia, our NATO allies and people around the world \n     are looking to America for leadership. Let us lead. That is \n     our responsibility as Americans.\n\n  I agree with the President that the rest of the world looks to the \nUnited States for leadership. We cannot and should not answer every \ncall for U.S. assistance. It is up to us, of course, to decide whether \nit is in our national interest to assume a leadership role in any \nparticular situation. In the case of Bosnia, the situation is clear--\nUnited States leadership is essential.\n  I commend this body for taking the action that it did yesterday, in \nvoting in support of the Dole/McCain resolution. We did what was \ncritical--we sent a clear signal to the world that we are united as a \nnation in our resolve to support peace in Bosnia, and that we stand \nfull square behind the men and women of our Armed Forces as they \ncommence their mission of peace in the coming days.\n  With that affirmative vote we did not simply give peace a chance in \nBosnia. We did far more. We reaffirmed our position as a world leader \nand strengthened the rule of law in the post-cold-war era. I am proud \nof what the Senate accomplished last night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18658-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18659-S18660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HAITI--A MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR FOREIGN POLICY FAILURE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, U.S. policy regarding Haiti is another \nexample of throwing good money after bad. In order to keep a sinking \nforeign policy ship afloat, the Clinton administration has handed over, \nin less than a year and a half, more than $2 billion of the American \ntaxpayers' money in propping up the regime of President Jean-Bertrand \nAristide.\n  This enormous sum of money has gone to a tiny, corrupt country \nrepresenting less than 1 percent of this hemisphere's population.\n  Within the past month, I have received new requests from the \nadministration to send additional millions of dollars to Haiti.\n  President Clinton's enormous spending spree in Haiti has not produced \nthe stability, security, and democracy promised by the Clinton \nadministration. I possess no crystal ball but it was apparent to me \nthen, and still is, that politically motivated assassinations and \nincreased mob violence would result if Aristide were reinstated as \nPresident to be propped up by American soldiers. But, just as was the \ncase early in the 20th century when the United States Marines occupied \nHaiti for 19 years and did not bring democracy to Haiti, the present \nmilitary occupation has not transformed Aristide into a leader who \nbelieves in and practices democratic ideals.\n  Mr. President, whatever Aristide and his cronies are committed to, it \ncertainly isn't democracy. Their primary interest is U.S. dollars.\n  Aristide has flatly refused to implement free market reforms, and has \nwarned that the first person who ``dares sell the state's possessions \non behalf of privatization'' will be ``arrested immediately.'' In fact, \nAristide's hostility toward free market economic reform resulted in a \npolitical crisis which led to the resignation of his Prime Minister in \nOctober and the suspension of all World Bank programs.\n  In June's legislative elections, fraud was rampant, and several \nopposition candidates were threatened and intimidated. Poll workers \nwere largely untrained, voting secrecy was rare, ballots were burned or \ndumped, and tally sheets were widely doctored.\n  Even with 6,000 international troops and a new U.S.-trained police \nforce in place, dozens of politically motivated murders have occurred \nsince the Clinton administration restored Aristide to power last \nOctober. In March, a woman was gunned down in retaliation for \ncriticizing President Aristide.\n  Another Port-au-Prince murder is remindful of the Old Testament \naccount of King Abel who coveted the property of his subject, Naboth. \nWhen Naboth refused to sell, King Abel had him poisoned and took the \nproperty.\n  History is repeating itself in Haiti. Michel Gonzalez and his \nAmerican wife were Aristide's neighbors in the Port-au-Prince suburbs. \nWhen Aristide wanted to add on to his villa, several neighbors accepted \nhis offer to buy their property. However, despite several offers from \nAristide, Mr. Gonzalez declined to sell his home. So, on May 22, as Mr. \nGonzalez entered his driveway with his teenage daughter, he was gunned \ndown. Sources in Haiti assert that soon after the assassination, the \nwall dividing the properties was knocked down. Aristide got his way.\n  On November 11, President Aristide incited mobs to violence at a \nfuneral of a political crony and relative. His bloodthirsty syncophants \nresponded immediately, and across Haiti, buildings were burned, houses \nwere ransacked, and dozens were murdered. Yet violence has not abated. \nRecently, the bodies of seven men and women were found in a dump near \nPort-au-Prince, gagged and shot in the head.\n  Mr. President, not one person has been prosecuted and sentenced for \nany of at least 22 politically motivated murders committed between \nJanuary and October of this year. In fact, I am unaware of any serious \ninvestigation into these assassinations, much less into the more recent \nmurders last month.\n  When asked by a Creole newspaper about killings sparked by his \nspeech, \n\n[[Page S18660]]\nAristide said that ``If Jesus was so angry when he entered the temple \nthat he took up a whip, turned over the tables and talked harshly to \nthe hypocrites, all the more reason for us to do so who are Jesus' \nservants.'' For this man to compare himself to Jesus is disgustingly \nblasphemous.\n  Aristide opposes every principle for which our country stands. For \nthe United States to spend over $2 billion in taxpayer dollars to prop \nup this man is unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, Aristide threatened to send a flood of refugees to the \nUnited States if additional millions of the American citizens' dollars \nare denied him. And the Clinton administration has capitulated to this \nblackmail. But this Senator, for one, cannot stomach using U.S. tax \nmoney to sponsor a tyrant who has demonstrated no concern for justice \nor democracy.\n  If the December 17 elections proceed, Aristide's hand-picked \nsuccessor, Rene Preval, will almost certainly win, inasmuch as 10 of \nthe 12 largest political parties are boycotting the election. Aristide \ndeclares that he and Preval are twins--an allusion to their ideological \nsimilarity. It is, to be sure, an indication of what a Preval president \nwill be.\n  The deteriorating situation in Haiti is clear: Unless Aristide and \nhis successor fulfill their promises to the Haitian people, to the \nUnited States Government, and to the international community, neither \nUnited States troops nor additional billions of United States \ntaxpayers' dollars can ever bring democracy to Haiti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18659-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The \npermanent Record will be changed to reflect the following correct \nstatement.)\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I have lamented on a number of occasions \nthe erosion of civility in our public discourse. This is a trend that \nhas had a negative impact on our politics and on the relationship \nbetween the government and the citizenry. The heightened level of \nrhetoric, the slash-and-burn tactics, and the accusations of bad faith, \nhave made it more difficult for politicians to communicate with each \nother and to communicate with those we represent. It has made it more \ndifficult for reasonable people to reach agreement and far too easy for \nunreasonable voices to dominate the debate.\n  The breakdown in the tone of our discourse is symptomatic of a wider \nproblem which many have described as a deterioration of civil society. \nOur civil society is the collection of public and private institutions, \nand accepted moral principles, that bind us together as a community of \ncitizens. Civil society is what makes us a nation of community, rather \nthan merely a group with common voting rights.\n  There is abundant evidence that our civil society is fraying around \nthe edges. People lack faith in the capacity of government to act in \nthe interest of the people. There is a growing lack of confidence in \nour public schools--one of the great unifying forces in our country. \nAmericans are less engaged in fewer communal activities than we once \nwere. We are much more apt to stay at home to rent a video, communicate \non the faceless Internet, or channel-surf on cable TV, than we are to \nattend a PTA meeting, march in a parade--or even join a bowling league, \nas one Harvard professor's study revealed.\n  It is against this background that today we consider the \nconstitutional amendment to prohibit desecration of the U.S. flag. The \nargument for protecting the flag is a weighty one: The U.S. flag is a \nunique symbol of our nationhood. When our troops go to battle to fight \nfor our Nation, they march under the banner of the flag; each day when \nour children go to school, they pledge allegiance to the flag; when a \nnational leader or world dignitary dies, the flag is flown at half \nmast; when one of our athletes wins a gold medal at the Olympic Games, \nthe flag of the United States is raised; when a soldier or police \nofficer dies, his or her coffin is draped with the flag; when \nimmigrants are naturalized, they salute to the flag.\n  In this diverse Nation, respect for the flag is a common bond that \nbrings us together as a nation. Our common reverence for the flag is \npart of what makes us citizens of a country, not just individuals that \nhappen to live in the same geographic area.\n  There is also no denying that when the flag is burned, desecrated, \ndespoiled, or trampled upon, the potency of the flag as a symbol is \ndenigrated. When the flag is burned, whether by Iranian fundamentalists \nduring the hostage crisis or by American protestors here at home, we \nare rightly outraged because these acts represent a direct affront to \nour Nation. By tolerating flag desecration, we are condoning actions \nthat undermine the fabric of our national life.\n  Critics of the flag amendment have reminded us that because flags \nowned by the Government are still protected under current law, this \namendment will only restrict what individuals can do with flags that \nthey own personally. But the flag is not a mere piece of property like \na car or television, it is more than the fabric and dye and stitching \nthat make it up. The design of the American flag and the values it \nrepresents belong to all of us; in a sense, it is community property. \nWe the people maintain part ownership of that flag and should be able \nto control how our property may be treated.\n  This is not a very radical principle. Federal law already controls \nwhat we can or cannot do with our own money. Anyone that mutilates, \ncuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates a dollar bill can be fined or \nput in jail for 6 months. Similarly, in O'Brien versus United States \nthe Supreme Court upheld the \n\n[[Page S18661]]\nconviction of a protestor that burned his draft card on the ground that \nthe Government had a substantial interest in protecting a document \nnecessary for the efficient functioning of the selective service \nsystem. Why is our interest in protecting currency or Government \ndocuments any stronger than protecting our greatest national symbol?\n  Opponents of the flag amendment also maintain that it trivializes the \nBill of Rights by carving out an exception to the first amendment. This \nargument is based on the classic libertarian belief that truth can only \nemerge from complete freedom of expression and that the Government \ncannot be trusted to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable \nforms of action or speech.\n  This first amendment absolutism, however, is contrary to our \nconstitutional tradition. The list of types of speech that may be \nregulated or banned by the Government according to our Supreme Court \nprecedents is lengthy: libel, obscenity, fighting words, child \npornography, deceptive advertising, inciteful speech, speech that \nbreaches personal privacy, speech that undermines national security, \nnude dancing, speech by public employees, infringements of copyright, \nand speech on public property, to name a few.\n  And consider how narrow the flag amendment's restriction of speech \nreally is and how little it limits our ability to protest against the \nGovernment. Even if the amendment is enacted one could still write or \nsay anything about the Government; one could still burn a copy of the \nConstitution or effigies of political leaders; indeed, one could put a \npicture of a flag being burned on the Internet and circulate it to \nmillions of people across the world with the push of a button.\n  Recall the words the protestors chanted while Gregory Lee Johnson set \na flag on fire and gave rise to this entire controversy:\n\n       Reagan and Mondale, which will it be? Either one means \n     World War III. Ronald Reagan, killer of the hour, perfect \n     example of U.S. power. America, the red, white, and blue, we \n     spit on you, you stand for plunder, you will go under.\n\n  So regardless of whether we have a flag amendment, there are a \nmultitude of ways to heap contempt on the Government, should one choose \nto do so. The effect of the amendment on free expression would be \nnegligible.\n  But if the impact of the restriction is so minimal, why do we need to \nraise this issue to such a level of importance? The answer is because \nthe flag remains the most powerful symbol capable of unifying a \ndiverse, disparate nation. It is a centrifugal, galvanizing force in \nour lives--and it will remain so only as long as it is not trashed, \ndespoiled, or debauched by those who insist that one is free to indulge \nin any act to give expression to his or her thoughts.\n  I also want to take issue with the contention that our liberal \ntradition prohibits us from ever making substantive value judgments \nabout what is good speech and what is not or that we must always remain \nindifferent or neutral with respect to the ideas and images that \nbombard us over the airwaves or through the media. For when freedom is \ndefined by the absence of all restraint, then liberty descends to \nlicense and license yields to disorder and dysfunction. As someone once \nobserved, a river without its banks is not a river, but a flood.\n  Senator Dole touched on this theme in a speech he gave earlier this \nyear criticizing the violent movies being produced in Hollywood these \ndays. It isn't inconsistent with the first amendment to speak out \nagainst movies that contain dozens of shootings, or gruesome acts of \nviolence that are then copied in real life only days after the initial \nscreening. It isn't an act of Government censorship for politicians to \ncriticize music containing lyrics that denigrate women, glorify cop-\nkillers as role models, and promote racial divisiveness.\n  Likewise, it is not Government censorship when the people amend the \nConstitution to prohibit one narrow, repulsive form of expression. The \nprocess of amending the Constitution does not consist of a dictatorial \ntyrant or imperial monarch exercising its power over enslaved subjects; \nrather it is the act of free people exercising their sovereign power to \nimpose rules upon themselves. By enacting this amendment through the \nprocess set forth in article V of the Constitution, ``We the people'' \nwill be determining that the message being expressed by those who burn \nthe flag is not worthy of legal protection. The amendment represents a \nsubjective, value-laden judgment by ``the people'' that our interest in \npreventing the damage that flag desecration inflicts upon our national \ncharacter outweighs the meager contribution that flag burning makes to \nthe advancement of knowledge and understanding of ideas. The Supreme \nCourt balances interests in this manner in almost every constitutional \ncase it decides. Why is it that we have no qualms about deferring to \nthe value-judgments made by unelected jurists but we become squeamish \nwhen making such judgments through our most solemn act of self-\ngovernment--amending the Constitution?\n  I do not believe this flag amendment sets a bad precedent by carving \nout an exception to the first amendment or that ``the people'' will act \nirresponsibly by amending the Constitution in a frequent or cavalier \nfashion. For one thing, the Constitution, in its wisdom, makes that too \ndifficult to do. Also, I trust the people. They understand the value of \nliberty. I am confident that it will be the rare occasion that the \npeople make an exception to our general tolerance for free expression \nby targeting a form of expressive activity for special treatment. And I \nam confident that our national character will be improved, not \nweakened, by the protection of our unique symbol of nationhood.\n  I agree with Justice Stevens' opinion in Texas versus Johnson. He \nsaid:\n\n       The value of the flag as a symbol cannot be measured. Even \n     so, I have no doubt that the interest in preserving that \n     value for the future is both significant and legitimate.\n       Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanctioning the \n     public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value, both \n     those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those \n     who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it. That \n     tarnish is not justified by the trivial burden on free \n     expression occasioned by requiring an available, alternative \n     mode of expression, including words critical of the flag, be \n     employed.\n\n  So I support this resolution to send the flag protection amendment to \nthe States for ratification.

A bill to facilitate the ability of a private consortium to \nsite, design, license, construct, operate, and decommission a private \nfacility for the interim storage of commercial spent nuclear fuel, \nsubject to licensing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Energy to contract with the consortium for storage \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n      THE PRIVATE INTERIM STORAGE FACILITY AUTHORIZING ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on the heels of today's Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on legislation to amend \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act, I am introducing legislation to privatize \nthe Federal spent fuel interim storage program. It is my understanding \nthat the House plans to act on similar legislation before the Christmas \nrecess. Today's hearing, coupled with the introduction of my bill \nshould provide the impetus for timely action in the full Senate.\n  When the Energy Committee held a hearing on various nuclear waste \npolicy proposals earlier this year, all of our witnesses agreed that \nthe ``1998'' date is critical in this debate. With 1996 only a few \nweeks away, the deadline is rapidly approaching and we are no closer to \nresolving this issue than the last time Congress enacted nuclear waste \nlegislation [1987].\n  But it is not like we haven't seen this deadline coming. For 16 \nyears, the Department of Energy has been charged with the \nresponsibility of our civilian spent fuel. In that time, DOE has spent \nnearly $5 billion of ratepayers' money--including over $250 million \nfrom Minnesota's electric customers. And yet here we sit, debating the \nissue of exactly what to do with America's civilian nuclear waste.\n  But the Department of Energy just continues to go round in circles. \nFirst, they said we can store waste at Yucca Mountain; then they tell \nus we can't force it on Nevada. Then DOE says they can't meet the 1998 \ndeadline--and even claim they aren't legally bound to do so; then they \ntell us they can, if only Congress would ``untie'' their hands. The \nlatest was that an interim facility couldn't be complete for 7 years at \na cost of nearly $400 million; then their testimony says it could be \n\n[[Page S18663]]\ndone in 4 at a third of the cost. It is hard to tell what is truth and \nwhat is fiction for the DOE anymore. It is my hope that today's hearing \nwill help us find out.\n  For the past few months, I have met with and carefully reviewed \nreports and studies by the General Accounting Office, independent \ngroups, former DOE employees, and even former Energy Secretary Watkins \non this issue. I found there is strong support for removing the \ncivilian waste program from DOE--and that support grows even stronger \nwhen we focus specifically on privatizing the interim storage program.\n  After years of working on this issue with Minnesota's ratepayers, \nutilities and State officials, I am convinced that privatizing the \ninterim storage program remains our last, best hope for getting waste \nout of Minnesota and the other 30 plus States which are struggling with \nthis issue.\n  Later today, I will be introducing the Private Interim Storage \nFacility Authorizing Act of 1995. My legislation targets one small--but \nkey--component of the overall Federal nuclear waste program.\n  Privatizing the interim waste storage program offers three key \nbenefits--it saves money, it provides relief to States such as \nMinnesota that are faced with on-site storage restrictions, and it \nprotects the environment.\n  And as with most initiatives, privatizing the interim storage program \nwould improve efficiency and lower costs to the taxpayers. Based upon \nthe business plan for the Mescalero private initiative, a private \ninterim facility could be completed for approximately $135 million and \ndone in time to meet the 1998 deadline.\n  That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than what the Office of \nCivilian Radioactive Waste Management originally quoted earlier this \nsummer. And while DOE has revised its estimates downward in recent \nweeks, it is only because of the undisputable cost data for the \nMescalero project.\n  Competition always reduces costs, particularly when it is with the \nFederal Government--the Mescalero project is proof of that. With the \nMescalero initiative moving forward while congressional action has \nstalled--some have asked if this venture could resolve the interim \nissue. The short answer would be ``yes,'' in fact, 20 utilities are now \nparticipating in this private venture.\n  But Congress and the DOE have the legal responsibility to resolve \nthis issue. And we have the responsibility of ensuring it is done by \n1998.\n  Mr. President, I believe focusing on the interim storage \nprivatization not only represents a workable option, but it also \nprovides a ``win-win'' for ratepayers, for States, and for the \nenvironment. Therefore, I would encourage my colleagues to join with me \nin cosponsoring the Private Interim Storage Facility Authorizing Act of \n1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1479. A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to improve control of acid mine drainage, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the acid mine drainage abatement act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleague, Senator Mikulski, to help address a serious \npollution problem--acidic runoff from abandoned coal mines--which \ncontinues to degrade the water quality of our Nation's rivers and \nstreams. My legislation would provide States with increased flexibility \nto utilize their allocations under the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund \nfor environmental remediation activities.\n  Abandoned mine drainage is the unfortunate legacy of coal mining in \nthe years before environmental laws were enacted requiring coal \ncompanies to reclaim mined land. After the coal was extracted, the land \nwas left riddled with coal waste, known as gob piles, and pock-marked \nwith holes. The mining activity also unearthed sulfur compounds and \nmetals such as aluminum, manganese and iron. When exposed to the \nelements, the sulfur compounds produce sulfuric acid which in turn \nleaches metal loads into the streams, poisoning the water and killing \nfish and plant life. There are in excess of 7,600 miles of streams in \n11 States that are adversely affected by abandoned mine drainage.\n  In the Appalachian region, which suffers the most serious mine \ndrainage problems, the acidic runoff has left a major segment of our \nNation's river, the Potomac River, virtually devoid of life. Much of \nthe North Branch of the Potomac, from its headwaters near Kempton, MD, \nto the Jennings Randolph Lake, is biologically dead. Nearly 700 miles \nof the North Branch's streams are currently incapable of supporting \nfish and other aquatic life because of the drainage. Along this stretch \nof the Potomac there are over 4,000 acres of abandoned mine lands, \nincluding the worst offender, Kempton Mines, which discharges \napproximately 3 million gallons of abandoned mine drainage each day.\n  The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA] \nestablished a regulatory program for current mining activities \nrequiring land reclamation and control of acid drainage at active mine \nsites to assure that today's mines do not become tomorrow's abandoned \nmines. It also established an abandoned mine land reclamation [AML] \nfund, paid for by a fee imposed on current mining production, to \naddress problems caused by abandoned coal mines. Current law and \nregulations require that priority be placed on alleviating public \nhealth and safety problems posed by abandoned mine lands. However, \nStates are authorized to set aside up to 10 percent of their \nallocations under the AML fund annually into a special account for \naddressing adverse environmental effects caused by abandoned mine acid \ndrainage. These funds are insufficient to clean up the acid mine \ndrainage problems.\n  My bill would provide greater flexibility for States to use existing \nabandoned mine reclamation funds for acid mine drainage, as well as \nhealth and safety problems. Specifically, it would increase from 10 to \n30 percent, or $1 million, whichever is greater, the portion of a \nState's AML funds that could be set aside for addressing environmental \nproblems caused by acid drainage.\n  Mr. President, great progress has been made in restoring the health \nof America's rivers in the 3 decades since President Lyndon Johnson \nvowed to make the Potomac a national model for restoring the Nation's \nwaters. Today, much of the Potomac is a haven for fish and wildlife and \nprovides tremendous recreational and economic opportunities. However, \nthe North Branch of the Potomac remains in marked contrast to these \nimprovements. The States of Maryland and West Virginia and the \nInterstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin have been working \ntogether in a cooperative effort to restore the North Branch's health, \nthereby improving the quality of life and opening new opportunities for \neconomic development, tourism and outdoor recreation. Unfortunately, \nthe job cannot be accomplished without the assistance made available \nunder this legislation. The North Branch of the Potomac is only one of \nmany areas that could greatly benefit from improved environmental \nconditions made possible by this measure.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill in order to \nprovide States with the flexibility and additional resources needed to \nbetter address environmental problems associated with acid mine \ndrainage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1479\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the \nupcoming 75th anniversary of Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged in \nClifton, NJ, a much beloved and honored institution that provides \nimportant health care services to New Jersey's elderly.\n  Mr. President, Daughters of Miriam Center was founded as a shelter \nfor aged persons and orphaned children in the city of Paterson, where I \ngrew up. Since its establishment in 1921, DMC has been inspired by its \nfounder, Nathan Barnert, a former mayor of Paterson, whose public \nspiritedness and concern for the most vulnerable in society shaped the \nphilosophy that has long guided DMC's programs.\n  Over 700 New Jersey residents each day benefit from the center's \nservices. In addition to providing high quality medical care, Daughters \nof Miriam Center provides patients with a sense of community. The \ncenter's programs, such as medical day care for Alzheimer patients, \ncongregate services, a respite program, and a sheltered workshop, bring \nwarmth and purpose to participants' lives.\n  On a personal note, I would note that my own mother, as a nursing \nhome resident, benefited greatly from the friendship and care offered \nat the center.\n  Mr. President, the anniversary of Daughters of Miriam Center is more \nthan anything an opportunity to celebrate the people who have shaped \nthis great institution--the doctors, nurses, staff, friends, and \npatients who have made the center what it is today. Their energy and \ncommitment have helped make the center a leading facility for the care \nof the elderly on the east coast.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Daughters of \nMiriam center for reaching an important milestone, and I wish the \nCenter continued success in its valuable service to New Jersey and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/14/senate-section/article/S18668-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMENDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND.
