Mr. President, on the heels of welfare and lobby reform, \nCongress is just beginning to address the issue of welfare for \nlobbyists.\n  Both Houses of Congress have passed legislation aimed at curbing the \nabusive practice of forcing taxpayers to subsidize lobbying activity. \nEven so, we are coming dangerously close to returning to business as \nusual in Washington.\n  The Treasury-Postal appropriations conferees have been debating the \nwelfare for lobbyists issue for weeks. The only agreement so far has \nbeen an agreement to disagree.\n  Mr. President, each year, the American taxpayers give more than $39 \nbillion--that is ``billion,'' with a ``B''--to organizations which turn \naround and use those dollars to lobby Congress for more taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Over the past several months, we have seen those 39 billion tax \ndollars hard at work here in Washington.\n  During this summer's Medicare debate, one of the most vocal \ncontributors to the Medi-Scare campaign of misinformation was AARP, an \norganization which received more than 70 million taxpayer dollars \nduring a 1-year period between July 1993 and June 1994--70 million \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Here are just a few other examples of American's hard-earned tax \ndollars at work: $250,000 went to the Child Welfare League of America, \nwhich turned around and launched a vicious ad campaign aimed at \nincreasing welfare spending; its ad against the Contract With America's \nwelfare reform proposal screamed, ``More children will be \n\n[[Page S 16638]]\nkilled. More children will be raped;'' another $1 million went to the \nAmerican Nurses Association, which proudly announces their mission to \n``lobby Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues;'' \n$150,000 went to AFSCME, which denounced the recent welfare plan, \nclaiming it ``will drive more families into poverty and turn its back \non hard-working Americans who fall on hard times;'' $2 million went to \nthe AFL-CIO, which, over the Memorial Day congressional recess, used \nthat $2 million to pressure Members of Congress on labor issues. The \nunion's ``Stand Up'' campaign included radio ads and direct mail.\n  Now, Mr. President, I recognize that not all of the tax dollars used \nto subsidize these groups goes directly to political advocacy. And not \nall of these dollars go to organizations with a political agenda--many \nare directed to worthwhile charities that are doing the right thing in \ntheir communities.\n  But many of these organizations are really lobbying and political \nfront groups that are taking taxpayer dollars and spending them on \npolitical activities.\n  All Americans are guaranteed the first amendment right to speak out, \nbut they do not have the right to speak out at taxpayer's expense.\n  Thomas Jefferson made this point nearly two centuries ago when he \nsaid, ``To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas \nhe disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.''\n  Not only are we compelling taxpayers to pay for the propagation of \nideas they do not believe in, we are doing it behind their back, and we \nare adding to the Nation's enormous deficit to do it.\n  Mr. President, Americans work too hard for their money to see it \nspent for them promoting political causes they oppose. And they work \ntoo hard for their money to give it to lobbyists in the form of \nwelfare.\n  Now the evidence that this welfare for lobbyists really does exist \nwas never more obvious than earlier this year, during the lobbying \nreform debate.\n  When we came close to passing a strong provision in Treasury-Postal \nappropriations limiting taxpayer-financed lobbying--the compromise \nprovision reached between Senator Simpson and our colleague in the \nHouse, Representative Istook--our offices came under siege from groups \nlobbying to protect their special interest.\n  Now, this is not going to effect the efforts of many major groups \nsuch as the American Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the United Way, and the hundreds of other \norganizations which still manage to lobby effectively without financial \nassistance from the taxpayers will attest.\n  Mr. President, all the Simpson-Istook compromise does is require \nFederal grantees to act like true charities.\n  It is important to understand that there is not an absolute \nprohibition on lobbying. The Simpson-Istook compromise recognizes that \nthere are gray lines between activities such as providing information \nto Congress, and actually lobbying Congress.\n  For this reason, no organization will be capped at less than $25,000 \nand many organizations will still be able to spend up to $1 million for \ntheir lobbying activities here in Washington.\n  Yet even with these generous limits, opponents have cranked up a \npropaganda machine unequaled in any debate this year. They have even \nformed the so-called Let America Speak Coalition, whose members have \nbeen quoted as saying that, ``If Istook passes, nonprofits will no \nlonger draft [regulations]. * * *''\n  Mr. President, why are nonprofits that receive taxpayer funding \nwriting Federal regulations in the first place?\n  These groups go even further by calling this legislation a gag rule \nthat is unfair and un-American. But I would suggest to them that free \nspeech is not free at all if Uncle Sam's taxpayers are footing the bill \nfor it.\n  The amount of disinformation being spread by these groups has been \nastounding.\n  We have all heard how those who rely on Government assistance such as \nstudents, farmers, and welfare recipients will supposedly lose their \nright to lobby.\n  The House language specifically exempts this type of Government \nassistance--yet the untruths continue.\n  The Senate needs to pass strict reforms that will require full \ndisclosure of all Federal money spent by grantees, reforms that will \ntruly eliminate all Federal funding of political advocacy.\n  We also need to stop the political games in which a grantee supports \nan affiliate who does the lobbying for them. And there needs to be \ntough penalties for organizations that knowingly violate the rules.\n  Mr. President, I have no desire to limit the ability of people to \nexercise their right to free speech--as long as its with their own \nresources and their own money. But there is no place for taxpayer-\nsubsidized political advocacy in a truly free society.\n  The hard-earned tax dollars that we ask working Americans to send to \nWashington should be reserved for those who truly need them, and not to \nprovide welfare for these lobbying groups.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the tyranny Thomas Jefferson warned \nagainst and support real reform that will put money in the pockets of \ntaxpayers and keep those taxpayer dollars basically out of the pockets \nof lobbyists.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Alaska is recognized to speak up to 20 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16637-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 1833\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, yesterday I had an opportunity to take \nsome of the Senate's time in the morning to discuss the issue of the \nArctic oil reserve and ANWR, which are, in effect, one in the minds of \nmost people, but in reality there is a significant difference. Let me \njust very briefly review the significance of this area and put it in a \nperspective that I think can perhaps be more easily understood.\n  First of all, we have the area in green and the area in yellow and \nthe small area in red, representing, in the minds of most Americans, \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This is a very, very small piece \nof Alaska, up near the Canadian border that overlooks the Arctic Ocean.\n  The significance of this, of course, is that in 1980, Congress acted \nand designated specific land uses. The uses included putting 8 million \nacres in a permanent wilderness. That is the area in green with the \nblack slashes. At the same time, they put approximately 9.5 million \nacres in a refuge. This is represented by the green area. These were \nplaced in a permanent status.\n  However, they left 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain for \ndesignation in the future because of the promise of oil and gas \ndiscoveries in those particular areas.\n  The red area is native land, primarily occupied by a few hundred \nEskimos in the village of Kaktovik.\n  What we have before us is a decision by the Congress on whether or \nnot to allow a sale of approximately 300,000 acres in the coastal plain \nto take place. In both the House and Senate reconciliation package, we \nhave included the \n\n[[Page S 16639]]\nauthorization for the sale. The anticipated lease sale is about $2.6 \nbillion. That would be split between the Federal Government and the \nState of Alaska on a 50-50 basis.\n\n  What I would like to point out in my description is that the entire \n19 million acres is not in question by any means. It is that 1.5 \nmillion acres would be authorized for the lease sale, and that portion \nthat would be utilized in the actual sale would be 300,000 acres.\n  What is the footprint? With the advanced technology that we have seen \nin the development of the Prudhoe Bay field, which has been \ncontributing about 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in the \nUnited States for the last 18 years, we have seen significant \ndevelopment in lessening the footprint. We had a field called Endicott \nabout 7 years ago which came in as the 10th-largest producing field. \nThe footprint was 56 acres. Industry tells us that, if we are lucky \nenough to find a major discovery in this area, footprint can be \nproduced dramatically. The first comparison was about 12,500 acres, \nwhich equates to the size of the Dulles International Airport, assuming \nthe rest of Virginia were a wilderness. Now they say they can do it in \nabout 2,000 acres.\n  So what we have here is clearly a manageable footprint. We have the \ntechnical expertise and the American engineering commitment to do it \nsafely.\n  So clearly it is good for America. It is good for our national \nsecurity interests. If one concludes for a moment that in 1973 when we \nhad the Arab oil embargo we were about 36 percent dependent on foreign \nimports, today we are 50\\1/2\\ percent dependent on oil exports.\n  What about jobs, and what about the economy? If the oil is there, \nthis would be the largest single construction activity in North \nAmerica. Probably 80 percent would be union jobs because the skills \nrequired to develop an oil-field and provide a pipeline over to the \nexisting pipeline are such that it would provide a tremendous \nopportunity for skilled workers, and the unions are the only ones that \nhave that abundance of skilled workers.\n  So from the standpoint of jobs it is estimated that there would be \nsomewhere between 250,000 and 735,000 jobs, and virtually every State \nwould be affected. So it does have a dramatic impact on the economy. \nFurthermore, it would not require $1 of Federal funding. This lease \nsale would take place with private capital coming from the purchasers \nof the lands, and development would occur from private sector financing \nover an extended period of time.\n  There is some suggestion that there are environmental problems. And I \nwould be the first to acknowledge that there is a concern over the \nenvironment--a valid concern. But we have the technical expertise to \novercome that as evidenced by the development of Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe \nBay is the best oilfield in the world. You might not like oilfields. \nBut the technology, the application, the permitting, and so forth that \nare mandated there clearly point out that it is the exception to all \noilfields throughout the world relative to its compatibility with the \necology and the environment.\n  As far as the congressional interest in this sale, the idea of \ngenerating $1.3 trillion into the Federal Treasury is a significant \ninducement. And as a consequence of that, that in itself merits the \nconsideration and support of this body. However, the real value is to \nlessen our dependence on imported oil because Prudhoe Bay is in \ndecline. It has been producing about 2 million barrels a day. It is \ndown to about 1.5 million barrels a day. As a consequence, by the time \nPrudhoe Bay is in further decline, we will either be importing more oil \nor we will be able to develop some of our domestic reserves. And the \nmost promising one in North America is in this 1002 area which I refer \nto as the Arctic oil reserve.\n  Where is the base of support for this? I think it is interesting to \nnote that we have a letter from former President Bush that I think \ncites very explicitly the concern, and I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record at this time, Mr. President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Houston, TX,\n\n                                                  October 6, 1995.\n     Senator Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Frank: I write in enthusiastic support of opening up \n     ANWR for oil exploration and production.\n       My support is based on the conviction that we must not \n     continue to become increasingly dependent on foreign oil. A \n     major lesson from Saddam Hussein's brutal invasion of Kuwait \n     is that we must not become totally dependent on foreign oil. \n     Right now we have good and reliable friends in the Middle \n     East, but it is only prudent that we find and develop our own \n     petroleum reserves.\n       I am totally convinced that ANWR oil can be developed in an \n     environmentally sound way, and that there will be no damage \n     to the caribou indigenous to the area. I understand that some \n     of the same extreme voices that were heard in the 1970s, \n     voices that predicted the extinction of the caribou, refuse \n     to admit that they were wrong. Indeed, not only are the \n     caribou not extinct, but they have proliferated.\n       In addition, as you know better than anyone, the \n     development of ANWR means jobs for American workers. That in \n     itself is a worthy objective. I hope Congress will promptly \n     remove all barriers to ANWR development.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      George Bush.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, to highlight the letter dated October \n16 from President Bush, it reads:\n\n       I write in enthusiastic support of opening up ANWR for oil \n     exploration and production.\n       My support is based on the conviction that we must not \n     continue to become increasingly dependent on foreign oil. A \n     major lesson from Saddam Hussein's brutal invasion of Kuwait \n     is that we must not become totally dependent on foreign oil. \n     Right now we have good and reliable friends in the Middle \n     East, but it is only prudent that we find and develop our own \n     petroleum reserves.\n\n  The President further states:\n\n       I am totally convinced that ANWR oil can be developed in an \n     environmentally sound way, and that there will be no damage \n     to the caribou indigenous to the area. I understand that some \n     of the same extreme voices that we heard in the 1970's, \n     voices that predicted the extinction of the caribou, refuse \n     to admit that they were wrong. Indeed, not only are the \n     caribou not extinct, but they have proliferated.\n       In addition, as you know better than anyone, the \n     development of ANWR means jobs for American workers. That in \n     itself is a worthy objective. I hope Congress will promptly \n     remove all barriers to ANWR development.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      George Bush.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to show very briefly the picture of the \narea that is currently producing near Prudhoe Bay. This gives you some \nidea of the number of caribou which just happen to be in this \nparticular shot. You see the pipeline. You see an oil well being \ndrilled. That oil well and that derrick will be removed. But clearly \nthere is an abundance of caribou. To suggest that the caribou in the \narea of ANWR will be damaged, or depleted, or reduced as a consequence \nof activity just does not bear the essence of reality in the comparison \nthat we have had with the central Arctic herd. And as a consequence, \nMr. President, it is pretty hard to buy the argument that the caribou \nindeed are endangered by this.\n  We have had statements and testimony from former Secretary of State \nLarry Eagleburger who indicates that it is in the national security \ninterests of our Nation to lessen our dependence on imported oil. He \npoints out the reality that we have seen in the Mideast, Iran, Iraq, \nSaddam Hussein, Libya--a situation that is very volatile. It actually \naffects the national security interests of Israel as well, and, if the \nUnited States becomes more and more dependent on the Mideast sources, \nwe are exporting our jobs, exporting our dollars, and it is contrary to \nour national energy security interests.\n  I point out, as the Presiding Officer is well aware, that in 1990 we \nfought a war in the Persian Gulf. That, Mr. President, was a war over \noil. Make no mistake about it. We have had Secretaries of Energy--\nSchlesinger, Watkins, Hodel--all very, very concerned about our \nincreased dependence on imported oil. As late as just 7 months ago our \nSecretary of Commerce, Secretary Brown, put out a very, very \ninteresting and challenging statement that indeed the national energy \nsecurity interests of our Nation are at stake because of our increased \ndependence on imported oil.\n  So it is just a matter of time before we are held hostage by the \nsituation in the Mideast, a situation that will be advanced as a \nconsequence of our increased dependence. \n\n[[Page S 16640]]\n\n  As far as support for this, I think it is paramount to note that in \nmy State of Alaska--I think we have a larger chart here of the State.\n  The people of the Arctic are primarily the Eskimo people, and they \nfrequent the area of Barrow, Wainwright, Kaktovik. They are nomadic in \na sense traditionally. They live a subsistence lifestyle, but as a \nconsequence of the development of Prudhoe Bay, an alternative lifestyle \nhas been available to the people of the Arctic, and that lifestyle has \nprovided them with a tax base. That tax base has provided them with \nadditional necessities of life that you and I take for granted: running \nwater and sewage disposal, as compared to the honey buckets which they \npreviously had--an indoor bucket, and as a consequence the honey bucket \nman comes around once in a while.\n  Here is a map of the State of Alaska. Where we are talking about is \nthese areas in the very, very far north. If you look at the map, you \nwill see the Arctic Circle moving across here, so we are north of the \nArctic Circle. It is truly a hostile environment. It has its own unique \nbeauty, but living there in a land of permafrost where it is virtually \nimpossible to dig because of the frozen ground, the opportunity for \nutilities as we know them, running water and sewage, simply do not \nexist. By providing the opportunity for jobs, for a tax base, these \npeople now have a standard of living that is much superior to what they \npreviously had. They have an opportunity for jobs if they want them. \nThere is job training available. There is transportation available to \nthe Prudhoe oilfields.\n  So my point is that the Alaska Federation of Natives, which is the \norganization that speaks with virtually one voice for Alaska's Native \ncommunity, has come out in support of opening up the Arctic oil reserve \nfor competitive lease sale. There is one group of Natives, the \nGwich'ins, that continue to object to opening that up. And this is a \nrelatively small group. Most of the Gwich'ins are in Canada, the area \nof the Arctic villages of Venetie and Fort Yukon. There are 300 to 400.\n  Unfortunately, efforts to try to address their concerns of the \nPorcupine caribou herd have been offset by extreme efforts by America's \nenvironmental community focused on the argument that, indeed, in their \nopinion their livelihood--the Porcupine caribou--is at risk. The \nproposal is to mandate that no exploration occur during the time that \nthose caribou migrate from Canada into the area. They calve in the \ngeneral area, calve in an 8-million-acre area, but there would be \nactivity to ensure that there would be no harm to the caribou occurring \nat that time.\n  As the picture that I showed you earlier shows, we have a very, very \nhealthy herd in the Central Arctic. What happens to the caribou herds \nis rather interesting. We have 34 herds in Alaska, about 990,000 \ncaribou. About three-quarters of them are increasing, about 10 percent \nare in decline, another 15, 20 percent are stagnant. But as anyone \nknows who observes the tendency of animals that graze, if some of them \novergraze the area, they decline. If there are too many predators, they \ndecline. If there are hard winters, they decline. So they are \ncontinually going up and down. But we have had an excellent experience \nwith our caribou, and to suggest that the Porcupine herd would be in \njeopardy is just not based on any sound scientific fact.\n  There is opposition to this by others than the Gwich'ins. We \ncontinually see rhetoric by the environmental communities. We have \nrecently seen the USGS develop some new figures relative to what the \nreserves might be. Nobody knows what the reserves are going to be until \nyou drill, because when you look for oil, you do not usually find it. \nWe had an oil sale out here off Prudhoe Bay called Mukluk. The oil \nindustry assumed that there was going to be a great reserve found \nthere. The bids went up over $1 billion. Several companies, one of \nwhich is no longer in business, bet the farm on the lease sale. They \ndrilled. They did not find oil. The oil had been there eons ago, but it \nis gone now.\n  So the Secretary of the Interior has come up with figures that show a \nsubstantial reduction in reserves over the figures that were previously \nput together by USGS showing a higher reserve. The point is nobody \nknows.\n  Then there has been suggestion that the State of Alaska is not going \nto share this revenue. Well, we can reflect on the rhetoric. We can \ndiscuss the merits of whether or not a major portion of this area of \nANWR will be damaged, and clearly, as I have pointed out, it will not.\n  Some people say that ANWR would only produce 3.5 billion barrels of \noil. Somebody has equated that to a 6-month supply so why open this \narea for such a small amount. In reality, Prudhoe Bay was a supply that \nwas anticipated to be, what, 200 days or thereabouts? The significance \nof that comparison is that Prudhoe Bay has been supplying the Nation \nwith 25 percent of its total crude oil production for the last 18 \nyears. So when you put forth an example that suggests it is only going \nto be a 6-month supply, you are assuming that there is going to be no \nfurther oil development anywhere in the United States as far as \nproduction; you are going to shut them all down, and therefore this \nbecomes a 600-day supply. That is a bogus argument.\n  We have seen from the USGS a quick turnaround on a study that was \nrequested by the Secretary of the Interior. The rather interesting \nthing was that that study was done by the California USGS people. They \ndid not include the extended experience that was accumulated over many, \nmany years by USGS personnel in Alaska. These were people who were \ntrained in Arctic evaluation. Why they were not included is something \nthat we are all a little concerned about. The Secretary of the Interior \nhas yet to explain it. As a matter of fact, we anticipate having a \nhearing into that because it is inexcusable that the Secretary would \nnot use his best expertise to get an evaluation, the best evaluation \navailable.\n  The rhetoric concerning the habitat is rather interesting to reflect \non. As I have said very briefly, there is no evidence that the wildlife \nwould be harmed. That means we do not have any scientific justification \nto suggest we cannot open the area safely. I have indicated that the \nPorcupine caribou herd, which is the herd in question, has experienced \na vast movement in numbers. In 1972, there were about 100,000 in the \nherd; in 1989, 178,000; I think today about 160,000 or thereabouts.\n  Some suggest, well, what about the polar bear in this area? They den \nin this area. People who know the polar bear know that they do not den \non land; they den at sea. If you are a caucasian U.S. citizen, you \ncannot hunt polar bear. If you are a Native, you can take polar bear \nfor subsistence. Very few of them are taken. But you can go over to \nCanada and hire a guide and go out and shoot a polar bear. It might \ncost you $10,000.\n  So when you talk about conservation of the polar bear, why, charity \nbegins at home. We do not allow in the United States the taking of \npolar bear by caucasians. You can take them if you are a Native for \nsubsistence only. So I get a little frustrated by my Canadian friends \nwhen they give their opinion relative to protecting the caribou. They \nare very happy to take a $10,000 bill from a hunter to go out and get a \npolar bear trophy.\n  We talk about wolves. We talk about bear. We talk about geese. There \nare increasing numbers. There is no suggestion that there is any \ndecline in the wild animal population of the area, nor would there be \nany significant reduction as a consequence of any development.\n  Some say that this is the only place in the United States where the \nArctic is protected. Well, there are 450,000 acres of the coastal \nplain--this area up here. It is already set aside in wilderness. There \nare over 1,000 miles of Arctic coastline in Alaska. Very, very little \nof that area is disturbed. And the production would be concentrated in \none area, I think Kaktovik, where there is a small village, a few \nhundred Eskimos.\n  There is a radar site. There are two other abandoned radar sites. You \nwould not know, Mr. President, one area from the other along that \ncoast, that plain, because it is so flat and it is so much the same.\n  Some suggest there is no need for the oil, we have a lot of oil in \nthe world, we can rely further on Russia. Well, as I have said earlier, \nwe have heard from President Bush, Secretary Eagleburger, Secretary \nSchlesinger. We are now \n\n[[Page S 16641]]\nmoving toward a 60- to 70-percent dependence on the Middle East. Too \nmuch dependence lets others manipulate us.\n  What about Russian oil? Well, we have seen in Russia a series of \nenvironmental disasters, the Komi oilspill. The environmental record is \nabsolutely unacceptable and in an unstable political situation. We have \nseen American companies go over there, and the infrastructure is so \ndifficult to penetrate many of them are wondering if they made good \ninvestments.\n  Let me go back to USGS, which is the agency that has the obligation \nto make forecast predictions with regard to oil and gas in areas \nthroughout the United States on public land.\n  As I indicated, we are going to have a hearing on November 8. But in \n1987 the Interior Department took several years to complete the \nevaluation based on its estimate of what the reserves were. And we saw \na few weeks ago the Department of the Interior come out in 3 days, \nalmost with a back-of-the-envelope study, a study, as I have indicated, \nwhere it did not involve the arctic experts they had in Alaska. It was \ndone in California. It was timed to coincide with the committee, the \nEnergy Committee's ANWR votes.\n  Let me tell you what some of the career scientists over at the USGS \nhave to say about the Interior study.\n  This came from a lifelong Federal geology professional.\n\n       It is all too obvious that this latest ANWR reevaluation is \n     a rather blatantly self-serving exercise in politically \n     directed pseudoscience, a disgrace to the agency and the \n     personnel involved.\n\n  And from a current USGS employee in Alaska:\n\n       Who is ever going to believe our numbers anymore if we \n     start producing back-of-the-envelope assessments every time \n     the Secretary of the Interior snaps his fingers at us? The \n     Secretary and our director seem dead set on destroying our \n     reputation and destroying the geological division as an \n     organization in pursuit of short-term goals.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, there has been discussion that somehow the \nState of Alaska is going to renege on this deal, that the 50-50 split \nsomehow is going to be changed as a consequence of State action against \nthe Federal Government. Well, that is a red herring, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nour Governor and a letter from the president of our State senate and \nthe speaker of our State house.\n  I am going to just read a portion of those letters.\n  This is from Drue Pearce, State president, and Gail Phillips. And I \nwould ask they be included in the Record, as well as that of Governor \nKnowles. Both these letters are dated October 17.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Alaska State Legislature,\n\n                                     Juneau, AK, October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House, Rayburn HOB, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: On behalf of the Alaska State \n     Legislature, we would like to thank you for taking the time \n     to meet with us during our recent visits to Washington, D.C. \n     and for your support of oil and gas leasing in ANWR.\n       As the Republican leaders of the state Senate and House, we \n     would like to state our unqualified support for current \n     congressional plans to allow oil and gas development on the \n     coastal plain of ANWR and to share lease revenues 50-50 \n     between the state and federal governments.\n       We are aware that some House Republicans have expressed \n     concern about this revenue sharing in light of Alaska's right \n     under its statehood compact to receive 90% of revenues from \n     oil and gas leases on federal lands.\n       Governor Tony Knowles announced on September 28th before \n     the National Press Club that he backs the 50-50 state-federal \n     split of ANWR lease revenues as proposed in the budget \n     reconciliation act. He is on record saying he will introduce \n     legislation to change the statehood compact to provide a 50-\n     50 revenue split for ANWR lease revenues.\n       As the U.S. House and Senate works to complete action on \n     the budget reconciliation act, Members of Congress should \n     know that we will do everything in our power to ensure that \n     such a bill passes the Alaska State Legislature and becomes \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Drue Pearce,\n       Senate President.\n     Gail Phillips,\n       House Speaker.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              State of Alaska,\n\n                                     Juneau, AK, October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: During my recent visit to \n     Washington, D.C., it became clear to me that a central issue \n     in the debate related to oil development in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is the allocation of the \n     revenue between the State of Alaska and the federal \n     government. Accordingly, I am writing to you to reiterate my \n     position on this issue.\n       By your legislation, and that of Congressman Young, you \n     have concluded that fifty percent of the revenues of ANWR \n     should be used to reduce the Federal budget in order to \n     accomplish Congressional approval.\n       The state is entitled to receive ninety percent of oil and \n     gas revenues generated from federal lands in Alaska. \n     According to your reports, Congressional action is highly \n     unlikely unless Congress sees some direct benefit to the \n     federal budget. In addition to all of the other strong \n     arguments in support of opening ANWR, it has been made clear \n     to us that a fifty-fifty split of the revenue is necessary to \n     attain favorable Congressional action. I support your \n     strategy to split the revenues evenly between the state and \n     federal governments.\n       If there is federal enactment of the fifty-fifty revenue \n     split, it would constitute an amendment of the Alaska \n     Statehood Act. According to the Alaska Department of Law, an \n     amendment to the Statehood Act requires state concurrence. \n     This concurrence must occur through the enactment of a bill \n     by the Alaska Legislature and approval by the Governor.\n       Therefore, I will introduce and pursue legislation to \n     accept such a change if Congress adopts a fifty-fifty revenue \n     split. In this way, Alaska's elected officials in Juneau will \n     have a full opportunity to debate the merits of agreeing to \n     any modification of the ninety-ten revenue formula.\n       I firmly believe any amendment of the ninety-ten revenue \n     split should apply to ANWR only. I will continue to insist, \n     by way of the statehood compact lawsuit, that Alaska receive \n     its full entitlement on the development of other federal \n     lands in Alaska.\n       The State of Alaska stands ready to assist you in attaining \n     Congressional approval of opening ANWR.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tony Knowles,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The first is from Drue Pearce, senate president and Gail Phillips, \nhouse speaker.\n\n       As the Republican leaders of the State Senate and House, we \n     would like to state our unqualified support for [the] current \n     congressional plans to allow oil and gas development on the \n     coastal plain of ANWR and to share lease revenues 50-50 \n     between the State and Federal Governments.\n\n  Further:\n\n       Governor Tony Knowles announced on September 28 before the \n     National Press Club that he [supports] the 50-50 State-\n     Federal split of ANWR lease revenues as proposed in the \n     budget reconciliation act. He is [further] on record saying \n     he will introduce legislation to change the statehood compact \n     to provide [for] a 50-50 revenue split for ANWR lease \n     revenues.\n\n  Further, Mr. President, a letter from the Governor.\n\n       . . . it has been made clear to us that a fifty-fifty split \n     of the revenues is necessary . . .\n       Therefore, I will introduce and pursue legislation to \n     accept such a change if Congress adopts a fifty-fifty revenue \n     split. In this way, Alaska's elected officials in Juneau will \n     have a full opportunity to debate the merits of agreeing to \n     any modification . . .\n\n  So, Mr. President, for the record, you have a commitment from the \nState of Alaska relative to the revenue sharing. And, Mr. President, \nour word is good.\n  Now, in conclusion, let me just point out one of the disturbing \nthings that is occurring on this issue. And I find it difficult to \nbring this to the attention of the body, but for a period of time the \nSecretary of the Interior has chosen to represent one segment of the \nissue, and that is the segment fostered by and supported in conjunction \nwith the Gwich'in people, with the backing of the preservationists and \nenvironmental groups in this Nation.\n  The disturbing feature is that now we have a Secretary who is not \nrepresenting the majority of Alaska's Native people. On the other hand, \nhe is representing a small minority. Somewhere less than 10 percent.\n  As I indicated in my opening remarks, the Native people of Alaska, \nthe Eskimo people of Alaska, who have lived for generations on a \nsubsistence lifestyle have gone through an extraordinary transition. \nPrevious to the welfare system, to the food stamps, these proud people \nwere dependent on hunting, fishing for their subsistence. As a \nconsequence of that dependence, they generated a small amount of cash \nfrom trapping, fishing, for the necessities of life, gasoline for their \noutboard motors, their snow machines, rifles, \n\n[[Page S 16642]]\nshells, and over an extended period of time, when food stamps came in, \nwhere they qualified. So there was a transition. After food stamps came \nin they did not have to depend to the same extent on subsistence.\n  I am reminded, I might say by my staff, I said that the Secretary was \nrepresenting about 10 percent of Alaska's Native people. I am told \nGwich'ins consist of about 1 percent of the Native people. So, it is \neven smaller. But my point is, in this transition of the Native people \nof our State, as a consequence of food stamps, they have become less \ndependent on subsistence. Subsistence played a vital role, but they did \nnot have the total dependence. So, as a consequence, trapping was \nreduced and a little later we began to expand the welfare system.\n  So, today in Alaska we have a significant portion of our rural \nresidents, most of them Native residents, dependent on subsistence and \nwelfare. Now we are going to cut welfare. Welfare is going to be \nreduced. We all know that. The BIA, that plays a major role in the \nlives of many of Alaska's Native people, is going to be cut. Now, these \npeople want jobs. They want jobs at home. These are good-paying jobs \nassociated with resource development, oil and gas. So 99 percent of \nAmerica's Native people, I should say 99 percent of Alaska's Native \npeople, support, through their Federation of Natives, or thereabouts, \nopening this area. We have job training capabilities in Alaska.\n  We have a Job Corps center. We have a good experience of utilizing \nsome of our Native people in Prudhoe Bay. But here is a long-term job \nopportunity. And the Secretary of the Interior has taken a position \nagainst a majority of Alaska's Native people in favor of that 1 \npercent, the Gwich'ins people who oppose opening up this area for \ncompetitive leasing. The justification for that is going to have to be \nthe Secretary explaining to the Native people of Alaska why he has \nchosen to represent this minority.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be talking further next week on some \naspects that I feel are important to this body. I think what we will do \nthe first of the week is to go into some of the fact and fiction, \nbecause America's environmental community has found this issue to be \nvery attractive in raising funding-generated membership.\n  I was in one Senator's office the other day. The Sierra Club had \nevidently contracted with one of our Nation's communications firms. The \nway it worked is that the Sierra Club provided the communications firm \nwith telephone numbers of people who were members of the Sierra Club in \nthat particular State.\n  They were able to dial in simultaneously, two calls in one. They \nwould phone a Mr. Brown in the State of Arkansas and say, ``Mr. Brown, \nwe have the Senator's office on the line. We would like you to express \nyour opinion about the possible drilling in the Arctic oil reserve \nwhich would ruin this area and wipe out the animals in the area.'' \nImmediately, the call would come in--Mr. Brown would be on the phone--\nto the Senator's office and be able to log in a call.\n  This is a pretty significant effort. It costs a lot of money. We do \nnot have those capabilities to explain our side of the story. What we \ndo have is 18 years of experience producing oil from Prudhoe Bay. Where \nwould this Nation be today without that oil, that 25 percent? We would \nbe even more dependent on the Persian Gulf.\n  We have the finest oilfield in the world in Prudhoe Bay, and we are \nproud of that. We built an expertise in the Arctic with our geologists, \nwith our USGS personnel showing that we can open this area safely, we \ncan do it compatibly with the environment and the ecology, as evidenced \nby this picture of the caribou flourishing in Prudhoe Bay. The same set \nof circumstances can happen in ANWR.\n  So we have the can-do spirit. The only difference is today we have \nnearly 20 years of experience. We can make the footprints smaller. We \ncan provide more jobs in this Nation. We can reduce our national \nsecurity exposure to more dependence on the Mideast. We can provide for \nthe largest single identification of jobs in the United States which \nwill help our unions, help our economy, and, lastly, Mr. President, \nwhat it will do is it will address our balance of payment deficits. \nHalf the balance of payment deficit is the price of imported oil.\n  I want to thank the President for his attention, and I wish he and my \ncolleagues a good day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16638-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN W. ANDERSON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to an outstanding \nlong-time member and president of the Alabama Farmers Cooperative \n[AFC], John W. Anderson, who retired from his post effective September \n30, 1995.\n  John was named president of AFC on December 13, 1989. He became a \nmember in 1969. During those 26 years, he served in various capacities \nat AFC, including his management of the Anderson's Peanuts Division \nfrom 1984 to 1989.\n  Anderson's Peanuts was founded in 1933 by John's father, Robert B. \nAnderson, and acquired by AFC in 1969. Since that time, the peanut \ndivision has grown steadily and now includes buying points, shelling \nplants, and storage facilities in more than 20 locations. It is a major \nsupplier of both domestic and export peanuts.\n  John currently serves on the board of directors of the Mississippi \nChemical Corp., and has previously served on the boards of the National \nPeanut Council, the Southeastern Peanut Association, Commercial Bank, \nand Andalusia Hospital. He is a past president of the Alabama Crop \nImprovement Association and was selected as its Man of the Year in \n1988.\n  A native of Andalusia, AL, John and his wife, the former Evelyn \nWilder, have three grown children and five grandchildren. He has a \ndegree in industrial management from Auburn University. He will spend--\nand no doubt enjoy--his retirement in Destin, FL, near two of the \nchildren. So, they will be properly surrounded by grandchildren.\n  John's leadership at AFC will be sorely missed, but his friendship, \nguidance, and example will continue to benefit the organization for \nmany years to come. I commend him for a job well done, and wish him all \nthe best for a long, happy, and healthy retirement.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, several months ago, I was reviewing \nsome data about the tax burden on the American family. I have mentioned \nit more than once here, but it was absolutely intriguing--one of the \nthousands of pie charts we see around here--showing the growth of taxes \nfrom 1950 to 1970, 1970 to 1980, and so on.\n  I was struck by this because in 1950--it always makes me think of \nOzzie and Harriet, the sort of television portrayal of the average \nfamily of that time--and that family, Ozzie and Harriet, would have \nbeen sending, of every dollar they earned, 2 cents to Washington--2 \ncents. And outside of their local taxes and the like, the balance of \nwhat they earned they used to house that family, clothe that family, \neducate that family and provide for the health of the family.\n  What was stunning to me was if Ozzie was here today in 1995, he would \nbe sending 24 cents of that dollar to Washington and about that much to \nthe State and local government. So that family has lost enormous \nresources. They work over half the year now for one of the governments; \na quarter of the year just for the Federal Government.\n  When I was a youngster, everybody always told me that the largest \ninvestment that an American family will ever make is for the home. That \nis the single largest investment by far the vast majority of Americans \nwill ever make. That is not true anymore. Now the largest investment \nthey will ever make is to the tax collector. That is the single largest \nconsumer of the earnings of an American family today--the Government.\n  It made me curious because that is an enormous force and pressure on \nthat \n\n[[Page S 16643]]\nfamily. If somebody comes by the door and takes half of what you have, \nit is bound to have an effect. So I started looking for what that \neffect may have been.\n  One of the first things that comes to mind, as we all know, is that \nthere are far more families with both parents working today in 1995 \nthan there were in 1950. So I began to measure the growth line of \ntaxes, because I had it in the back of my mind, ``I will bet you that \nline is absolutely identical to the number of families that have \ndecided both parents have to work.''\n  Sure enough, the lines are absolutely parallel, within 6 percentage \npoints. As we took more from the family, more of those families had to \nput both parents in the workplace and, of course, we all know the \nproblems that follow that.\n  Everybody has a different reason for the altered behavior of the \nAmerican family today. Our leader suggested maybe it was Hollywood. The \nFirst Lady is suggesting it is capitalism, turbocharged capitalism, \nthat is affecting the American family. A lot of writers today think it \nis greed, that the American family has to have another electric can \nopener or an addition on the house or another car, and that is what has \ncaused so much change in the behavior of the American family.\n  I reject all of those. I am sure they have had their effect, but \nnothing has had the effect--nothing--no institution has had the effect \ncomparable to the Government that has taken so much of the resources \nout of the family. The effect is that we have marginalized those \nfamilies.\n  How often have you read, Mr. President, that the American family is \nnot saving today? What is left to save?\n  If you take an average family of $40,000 a year and take half of it, \nand they have $20,000 to $24,000 to provide for all of the needs of the \nfamily, of course they are not saving. About every way you look at that \nfamily--two parents working, savings down, divorce up--the impact has \nbeen staggering.\n  Mr. President, the point I am making is that it is absolutely \nappropriate in our deliberations over balanced budgets that a major \npiece of the equation be to lower--to lower--the tax burden on the \naverage family, to push it down, to give more resources to the family, \nwhich is a central component of building American life, give them the \nresources to do it.\n  The balanced budget bill that we passed just last Friday, a week ago \ntoday, does just that. It has the effect on the average family of \nputting around $2,000 in disposable income on that kitchen table, or \nincreasing the disposable income of the American family an average of \n10 to 20 percent.\n  How do we do that? Well, interest rates are dropping because of the \nbalanced budget battle. If they have an average mortgage of $50,000, we \nwill save them over $1,000 a year in reduced interest payments. We will \nsave them almost $200 a year on the interest payments on their car. We \nwill save them $200 a year on the interest payments on the credit \ncards, or the addition on the house, or the student loan.\n  The average family has two children. They are going to save $1,000 a \nyear right off the top of the tax bill with the children's tax credit \nof $500 per child. That is $2,000 to $3,000 for the average family. \nThat is where the work of America is done. That is who we depend on to \nhouse a family, that is who we depend on to educate, that is who we \ndepend upon to provide the health. It is our duty to find our way, Mr. \nPresident, to get the resources back to that family.\n  It is almost unbelievable that we have come to the point that the \nlargest single investment an American family makes is to the tax \ncollector. It used to be the home, as I said earlier. That was the \nsingle largest investment a family ever made. Not so anymore. No, it is \nWashington. Twenty-four percent of every dime they earn, we bring to \nthis city. I have to tell you, Mr. President, as good sounding as all \nthese bills you hear about are here--to educate, to house, health--no \none, certainly not a Washington program, does as much for taking care \nof America as does her families. That is where we need to get the \nresources, Mr. President. That is why the reduction in taxes that we \nhave talked about in this balanced budget resolution is so terribly \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, for the past 30 years, the Medicaid \nProgram has been the lifeblood of the United States health and long-\nterm care delivery system for millions of Americans. Today, I will \nbegin a series of presentations on the Medicaid Program. Today, I will \nbe refuting the false notion that the Medicaid Program has been a \nfailure and that it should therefore be abandoned. The fact is that \nMedicaid is an American success story.\n  Next week, I will continue by exposing the bogus economic basis upon \nwhich the block grant proposal is built and which is used as a \npurported replacement of our current Federal-State Medicaid \npartnership. I will suggest to the Senate through a side-by-side \nanalysis what we know to be the demand for health care services under \nMedicaid and what has actually been provided under the Senate-passed \nbill.\n  Finally, I will conclude with a proposal on how a consensus can be \nreached which would accomplish an objective of reducing the cost of the \nMedicaid Program, potentially by tens of billions of dollars, over the \nnext 7 years without destroying the essential Federal-State \npartnership.\n  The word ``failure'' has been used frequently and casually as a \njustification for why this country must abandon the Federal-State \npartnership in health care for poor children and their mothers, for the \nfrail elderly, and for the disabled. Critics have bellowed that \nMedicaid is a failure, and in the next breath they say that since \nMedicaid is a failure we can go ahead and back out $187 billion from \nwhat has been projected as the necessary amount of money to meet the \nneeds of those traditionally served under Medicaid.\n  There is a story that needs to be told. That story is an American \nsuccess story, and the name of that American success story is Medicaid.\n  If my colleagues truly pondered the significance of this Federal-\nState partnership, they would not seek to plunder $187 billion from \nMedicaid at the expense of the health and safety of the 37 million--I \nrepeat, 37 million--Americans who depend upon Medicaid.\n  The Medicaid Program truly is an American success story. The Senate \nshould be building upon that success story, not retreating from it. The \ntruth is the Medicaid Program has been a lifesaver. One need only look \nat the role Medicaid has played in reducing infant mortality in \nAmerica.\n  When I was Governor of the State of Florida, the Southern Governors \nAssociation under the leadership of the then Governor of South Carolina \nand now Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, decided to tackle the \nunacceptably high infant mortality rate among Southern States--a rate \nwhich put the Southern States on par with some developing countries \naround the world. So in 1984, we formed the southern regional infant \nmortality project. We decided to tackle infant mortality through \nenhancing prenatal care, screening pregnant mothers to identify at-risk \nbabies, and making sure that nutrition services and other resources \nwere brought to bear on the infant mortality rate.\n  During the period 1984 to 1992, national infant mortality decreased \n21 percent. A great deal of that progress was due to the improved \nperformance of the Southern States. My own State of Florida knew that \nit had a scandalously high infant mortality rate so that it made a \nconscious decision to decrease infant mortality, low birthweight \ndeliveries, and the number of women lacking prenatal care. The Federal \nGovernment was a full partner \n\n[[Page S 16644]]\nwith each of the Southern States to help achieve their impressive \nresults. The name of that full partnership, the name of that American \nsuccess story is Medicaid.\n  What happened in just a decade? In 1985, Florida had a rate of 11.3 \nstillbirths for each 1,000 live births. By 1992, that number had \ndropped to 8.8, a decline of over 22 percent. I am pleased to say that \nthat rate of infant mortality in Florida continues to decline. Today \nthe rate is 7.6 per 1,000 to live births.\n\n  Mr. President, nearly 1,000 Florida children are alive today who, had \nwe continued the rate of infant mortality of a decade ago, would have \ndied at birth but for the Medicaid initiative called Healthy Start.\n  Mr. President, prevention pays because healthier babies were born due \nto earlier intervention efforts, and tens of millions of dollars, \nFederal and State, have been saved. Florida, through the Medicaid \nProgram, has been able to invest in success rather than simply pay for \nfailure.\n  Success stories like that where States are willing to make a \ncommitment to improve the lives of their citizens found a willing \nFederal partner. Those States cry out for the continuation of the \nFederal-State partnership, the American success story called Medicaid.\n  In total, Medicaid pays for more than one-third of the births in \nAmerica. I would like to repeat that, Mr. President. Medicaid pays for \nmore than one-third of the births in America. Medicaid covers one-\nfourth of all of America's children's health care. The great majority \nof those 1-in-4 children are children who are living in homes with \nworking but uninsured parents.\n  In Florida, that translates into 991,000 children, children who, \nbecause of Medicaid, are eligible for immunizations, checkups and other \npreventative measures. So many of these Medicaid recipients are the \ncasualties of the private sector's retreat from the health insurance \nneeds of their employees and the families of their employees. The \nGeneral Accounting Office reported that between 1989 and 1993, the \npercentage of children with employment-based health insurance declined \n9 percent.\n  This could have resulted in a national crisis in health care for poor \nchildren. How was that crisis averted? A success story was written in \nAmerica, and the name of that American success story is Medicaid. \nBecause of Medicaid, the number of uninsured children did not increase \nwhen employers were dropping coverage for those children.\n  As the General Accounting Office has reported, as the private sector \nretreated from the provision of private health insurance to their \nemployees, and particularly to the dependents of their employees, \nMedicaid has become the lifesaver for those poor children. It has been \nthe lifeline for those children who otherwise would have been an \nAmerican crisis, health crisis.\n  Mr. President, Medicaid has also been a lifeline for our Nation's \nfrail elderly. Over 60 percent of the nearly 2 million nursing home \nresidents in this country qualify for Medicaid, many qualifying only \nafter their life savings have been depleted by successive medical \ncrises in their own lives.\n  Approximately a quarter of a million older Floridians receive \nMedicaid, and 70 percent of Florida's Medicaid budget goes to pay for \nservices to the elderly and disabled. Great strides have been made in \nimproving the quality of care for our elderly who depend on Medicaid \nfor their survival.\n  I would like to look for a moment at the qualified Medicare \nbeneficiary program which covers Medicare premiums, deductibles, and \ncopayments for beneficiaries who have incomes below the Federal poverty \nlevel. Mr. President, there are 5 million low-income elderly Americans \nwho qualify for Medicare but could not pay the $46.10--soon to be \nalmost double that amount--of monthly payments in order to participate \nin the voluntary Medicare Program to provide physician services. They \ncould not afford to pay the $100 deductible--soon to be a $210 \ndeductible--but for the fact they were able to receive the financing \nfor that deductible through the Medicaid Program.\n  They did not have the private resources to pay for prescription \nmedication. And, therefore, Medicaid came to the aid of 5 million poor \nolder Americans to provide critically needed prescription medication. \nThis program has meant the difference between preventive care in a \ndoctor's office and intensive care in a hospital or acute care in a \nnursing home.\n  Medicaid is an American success story. Mr. President, the individuals \nwhose lives have been bettered through the Medicaid Program each have \ntheir own story to tell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a sampling of those stories provided by \nFamilies USA Foundation and the Long Term Care Campaign be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate your accepting those stories, \nwhich are profiles in courage, the courage of a loving family trying to \ndeal with health setbacks and scarce resources. These families could \nhave been your family, they could have been my family, they could have \nbeen any American family.\n  We cannot turn our backs on our citizens who have given so much to \nour country, nor can we retreat on the gains we have made in providing \na decent quality of life for our Nation's developmentally disabled \ncitizens. We all remember when a consensus emerged from across the \ncountry, ``Stop warehousing the handicapped in those shamefully large \ninstitutions.'' That was the goal, an ambitious goal, to get as many \npeople out of institutions and into community-based home settings as \npossible.\n  The Federal-State partnership called Medicaid became the framework to \nachieve that national objective. Medicaid said to the States, ``If you \nare interested in providing a more humane living environment for your \nvulnerable citizens, we will be a full partner with you.'' Some States, \nmany States, moved quickly. Unfortunately, others chose not to do so.\n  That is one of the attributes of the Medicaid Program. It is a \nFederal-State partnership, but the results for those States which did \nmove speak for themselves. In 1967, there were 194,000 mentally \nretarded or developmentally disabled persons living in State \ninstitutions. By 1994, there were 67,600.\n  When you look at the cost of care, it costs $65,000 per year per \ninstitution bed. It costs the State and the Federal Government $26,000, \non average, to provide a home waiver bed.\n  These numbers provide some sense of the huge cost savings which the \nAmerican success story of Medicaid has made available to American \npeople while at the same time enhancing the quality of lives of some of \nour most vulnerable fellow citizens. But even more impressive than the \nsavings are the number of people whose families stayed together, at \nhome, because of Medicaid.\n  Mr. President, that incredible effort at deinstitutionalization of \nthe handicapped and helping them live at home or in home-like settings \nis a success story. And the name of that American success story is \nMedicaid.\n  Today, some 6 million disabled Americans are covered under Medicaid. \nI submit that there is a compelling national interest in assuring a \nhumane quality of life for the disabled and the infirm. The nursing \nhome standards, the Medicaid waiver programs, the spousal \nimpoverishment provisions, these and so many more tools have helped to \nbuild a decent quality of life for persons who live at our mercy and \ntheir families.\n  Recently, Mr. President, I visited the Arnold Palmer Clinic at the \nOrlando Regional Medical Center. I was struck by the number of infants \nand toddlers who were developmentally delayed or disabled and that were \nbeing served at the Arnold Palmer Clinic. The directors of the clinic \nstressed that if you can bring therapy and treatment to those children \nfrom infancy to the age of 3, you can avert many of the problems that \nwill otherwise occur in later life.\n  I was impressed with the results that I saw. What they are doing at \nthe Arnold Palmer Clinic is writing a success story. And the name of \nthat success story is Medicaid. Fully two-thirds of the children who \nwere participating in the Arnold Palmer Clinic for handicapped and \ndisabled children were being served under the Medicaid part H program. \n\n[[Page S 16645]]\n\n  Yet, the children, the disabled, the elderly, are not the only ones \nwith a huge stake in the Medicaid debate. So often the debate on \nMedicaid has been dominated by doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and \nthose whom they serve. We forget how the mentally ill and those \novercoming substance abuse problems will be affected by the pending \nproposal to cut $187 billion out of the projected needs for Medicaid \nover the next 7 years.\n  In fact, those will be some of the first to feel the pain, the first \nto be cut, because they do not have lobbies, Mr. President, they do not \nhave political action committees.\n  They do not have much political muscle. That statement is not a scare \ntactic. This is not a residue from Halloween, this is a fact.\n  Last year, when the State of Florida had to cut back on its Medicaid \nProgram due to a State budget crisis, the mentally ill and their \nproviders were the first to feel the sharp edge of the budget cutting \nknife. Children's mental health programs were cut, payments to \nproviders were reduced, and this year the cutbacks are expected to be \neven more severe.\n  Has anyone on the Senate floor discussed how Medicaid funds the \ninstitutions for the mentally ill? Has anyone talked about how it is \npossible to cut costs in caring for persons who are found not guilty by \nreason of insanity or incompetent to proceed to trial? How do you cut \ncosts here? Do you put them on the honor system? Do you cut back in \nsecurity at the facilities?\n  Yes, Mr. President, it is a well-kept secret, but Medicaid helps to \nkeep our streets safe. In Florida, a full $50 million in Federal \ndollars this year primarily through Medicaid goes to the residential \nand treatment service for forensic patients. In total, Medicaid covers \n41 percent of the budget for State mental health programs. Let me \nrepeat that, Mr. President, because I do not believe that many of our \ncolleagues understand that fully 41 percent of the budget for State \nmental health programs is financed through a program that we are \nproposing to cut $187 billion from projected needs over the next 7 \nyears.\n  In some States, the percentage is substantially higher than 41 \npercent, particularly in those States which have abused the \ndisproportionate share of funding for hospitals.\n  Next week, I intend to talk in detail about the abuses that have \noccurred in the disproportionate share program. Believe it or not, we \nare about to reward the very abusers of the Medicaid system and even \nworse, Mr. President, to pay for those rewards by raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund. That is what happened a week ago today.\n  Of course, because of the blind rush to pass sweeping changes in \nMedicaid without so much as a hearing, the U.S. Senate has not fully \nheard from the children who have been sexually abused and mentally \nscarred, children whose chance to have a normal life hinges on mental \nhealth services that are funded through Medicaid.\n  The Nation currently has over 300,000 children who have been abused \nwhile living in foster homes. So many of them receive little or no \nmental health services. The State of Florida has over 9,000 foster \nchildren and is in Federal court as a defendant because of the lack of \nmental health services for these children. It is not ironic that the \nSenate will maintain the entitlement status of its foster care title IV \nprogram while gutting the entitlement that helps foster children get \nmental health treatment. It is not ironic, it is schizophrenic.\n  We are saying to foster children that we will keep the entitlement \nthat covers the cost of a roof over their heads, but we will no longer \nhelp them deal with the wounds of their heart. We are going to cut $187 \nbillion and, of course, that means that mental health, AIDS, program \nfor the handicapped are on the chopping block first. What a shame it \nwould be to abdicate responsibilities to such populations where so many \ngreat strides have and are being made.\n  The Presiding Officer now represents the State of Mississippi, one of \nthe States that participated in the program that I referred to earlier, \nthe effort across the South to reduce infant mortality. I mentioned, \nMr. President, that in my State of Florida when this effort began in \n1985, we had a ratio of 11.3 stillbirths for every 1,000 live births, \nand today, largely because of the kind of initiatives that Medicaid has \nfunded, that has been reduced in the State of Florida to 8.8 per 1,000. \nYou might be interested, in the State of Mississippi, in 1985, the rate \nof infant mortality was 13.7 per 1,000 live births. Today, that has \nbeen reduced to 11.9, or a 13.1-percent reduction, in the period from \n1985 to 1992.\n  That is illustrative of the kind of success stories that are \nattributable to the Federal-State partnership of Medicaid.\n  I say shame on the Governors of the States who are now cheerleading \nfor the destruction of that partnership. I have a warning for them, or \nmore accurately a proverb for them. The proverb goes as follows: Fish \nsee the worm not the hook.\n  These Governors who are salivating, who are so anxious to gobble up \nblock grants being proposed, will feel the hook when their economies \nstumble, when an epidemic strikes, when a natural disaster hits, when \ninflation creeps up again, or when their population grows. Worst of \nall, they will be held accountable in history for killing a program \nthat actually had achieved its objectives and nurtured a national pride \nin providing basic health care for fragile and vulnerable citizens.\n  I have strained my eyes to see and my ears to hear the justification, \nthe policy basis for the amount of $187 billion. What is the rationale? \nWhat is the health policy behind reducing this program $187 billion \nover the next 7 years, reducing it below what its current projections \nare that will be necessary in order to continue to provide health care \nto poor children, their mothers, the disabled, and the frail elderly?\n  The response to this is dim words and inaudible whispers. There is no \nanswer to the question of what is the policy rationale behind the \nreduction in terms of health care for the American people.\n  Is it any wonder that millions of Americans, including this Senator, \nare left to conclude that the measuring stick being used for the $187 \nbillion Medicaid cut is the width of the wallets that will be fattened \nby the tax cut, a cut taken in part out of the lives of working people \nand defenseless people?\n  To tout Medicaid's success is not to ignore its faults. There is work \nto be done to improve its accountability, to combat fraud and waste, \nand to monitor its growth in spending. Next week, I will talk about how \nwe can achieve these objectives without discarding the Federal-State \npartnership that has helped to maintain this country as a Union of \nStates and has helped to maintain a basic American value: That we care \nabout all of our people; that we particularly care about poor children; \nthat we particularly care about the health of the mothers of those poor \nchildren; that we particularly care about those who live in the shadows \nof life, the disabled, and the frail and elderly.\n  I have only skimmed through the pages of 30 years of the success \nstory which is Medicaid. I urge my colleagues to think twice before \nclosing this chapter of America's history. Medicaid has not been a \nfailure, it has been a success. This success story needs to be told and \nretold from the healthy infant born to the frail elderly living in \ndignity; from the disabled adult to the handicapped child; from the \nabused child to the immunized child. These are the faces of the success \nstory that is called Medicaid. These are the faces that are watching \nthe Senate at this defining moment of American history.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   [From ``Hurting Real People: The Human Impact of Medicaid Cuts'']\n\n               Families Who Depend on Medicaid's Lifeline\n\n       Here's a sampling of stories of people on Medicaid. For \n     more names and numbers, call Greg Marchildon.\n\n\n                               california\n\n       Angela Mack, Los Osos, CA.--Angela, 43, was employed as a \n     journalist until she suffered from a rare spinal cord \n     disorder. She is now quadriplegic. For two years, she lived \n     in a nursing home, but now she is able to get four hours of \n     personal care paid by Medicaid per day and live at home. \n     Medicaid pays this monthly cost of $1032, pays some of her \n     prescriptions and pays the share of doctor bills not paid by \n     Medicare. Angela receives $990 monthly in social security \n     disability benefits and pays $350 of it as her share of \n     medical costs. She is fortunate to live in HUD assisted \n     housing. Still, when she finishes paying for medical supplies \n     not covered by insurance, a high-fiber diet, and other \n     necessary expenses, she ends the month with $0 \n\n[[Page S 16646]]\n     to $2. Recently, she was notified that MediCal will cover six \n     prescriptions per month. Right now, she takes seven. Her \n     monthly prescription bills total $185.\n\n\n                                delaware\n\n       Sharon and Bob Dudek, Delaware.--Before Medicaid came to \n     their aid, Bob had to tell his sons they would not be able to \n     play Little League. ``[They] needed the money to help mommy \n     feel better.'' Their mom, Sharon, has progressive Multiple \n     Sclerosis and is bedridden. She is unable to care for \n     herself, much less their two sons. Bob had to enroll the kids \n     in day care so that he could continue working. He tried his \n     best for a year to care for Sharon himself, but then he \n     realized how much he was neglecting his children. He was also \n     taking away from their futures. Their college funds were \n     dwindling as were the rest of the family's funds. He asked \n     Medicaid for help. Now Medicaid pays for a nurse's aide, \n     nursing care, physical therapy, medical supplies and a \n     hospital bed. This care would cost the Dudeks $34000 a month. \n     Bob has employer health insurance that pays for Sharon's \n     acute care. But he said that Medicaid has allowed him to keep \n     his family together. Without it, he would not be able to keep \n     Sharon at home and take care of his boys.\n\n\n                          district of columbia\n\n       Millie Ross, Washington, DC.--Ms. Ross has high blood \n     pressure, high cholesterol, ulcers, infective cysts and a \n     problematic intestine. She had surgery on her left eye and \n     her colon last year. The hospital bills helped her qualify \n     for Medicaid under the medically needy program. She paid 50 \n     cents for each of eight prescriptions. Her Medicaid coverage \n     ended in March and she must now meet a new spend-down of over \n     $1,000 to be covered. Meanwhile, her drugs cost over $200 a \n     month. Her monthly income is only about $720. She has had to \n     save money by limiting her food and drug purchases. She \n     credits Medicaid for enabling her to buy more nutritious food \n     when she was covered.\n\n\n                                indiana\n\n       Argene Carson, Indianapolis, IN.--Argene, 80, has arthritis \n     and has had cataract surgery. Without Medicaid, her costs \n     would be astronomical for the drugs and the supplies \n     necessary to properly care for herself. Medicaid allows her \n     to have a home nurse and the funds to pay for specialized \n     equipment. With this kind of assistance, she can live at home \n     and remain independent.\n\n\n                                 kansas\n\n       Inez Williams, Kansas City, KS.--Inez, 62, worked hard \n     running a day care center before she became ill in 1991 from \n     heart disease and high blood pressure. Her medical treatment \n     quickly totalled $150,000 and she had to rely on getting \n     Medicaid to pay her bills. She had an artery transplant and a \n     throat operation last year. She had to pay $25 copayments for \n     each of these treatments, which was already a stretch on her \n     family's $500 monthly income. If she had been required to pay \n     more, she would not have been able to get the lifesaving \n     treatment she needed.\n\n\n                               louisiana\n\n       Denise and John Oehlerts, Baton Rouge, LA.--Denise learned \n     that she was pregnant when her husband was in a masters \n     program in landscape architecture at LSU. Denise was working \n     as a floral designer, but did not receive health benefits and \n     they had a very low income. Their small income qualified them \n     for Medicaid and allowed them to receive the prenatal care \n     necessary to have a healthy child. Their baby, Katie, is \n     covered by Medicaid until October, when the Oehlerts must \n     reapply for coverage. John is now a part-time student and \n     works full time in a landscape architecture firm. Denise \n     still works full time as a floral designer. Neither of their \n     jobs offers health insurance.\n       Karen, Dan and Alison Higginbotham, Opelousas, LA.--Alison \n     is seven years old, but functions like an 18-month-old child. \n     She has physical and mental disabilities from a rare seizure \n     disorder called infantile spasms. She cannot attend to her \n     personal needs and she cannot speak. She uses a wheelchair to \n     travel any distance. Alison needs physical, occupational, and \n     speech therapy every week. Her care would total $30,000 a \n     year in doctor and therapy fees. Medicaid covers the expenses \n     of her specialists and treatments as well as her specialized \n     equipment. Karen also gets respite and personal care \n     assistance through a home and community based waiver. At \n     first, Danny's company health insurance was paying for part \n     of Alison's care and Medicaid was paying the rest. Danny was \n     earning $23,000 a year until he was let go by the company \n     without any explanation. Danny has found another job and is \n     making $19,000 a year, but the company does not offer health \n     benefits. Medicaid covers most of Alison's expenses.\n\n\n                                maryland\n\n       Emily Holloway, Baltimore, MD.--Ms. Holloway, 73, was a \n     history teacher and a counselor, but retired without a \n     pension. She now receives only Social Security and SSI. Her \n     monthly income is $478. Though she has been relatively \n     healthy, Medicaid pays for two or three prescriptions, yearly \n     checkups and flu shots that Ms. Holloway could not otherwise \n     afford. A recent biopsy showed potentially scary results. Ms. \n     Holloway is thankful that Medicaid will pay for further \n     testing and treatment.\n       Bill Mauer, son of Leopoldini Mauer, Bowie, MD.--Mr. and \n     Mrs. Mauer saved over $70,000 during their working careers. \n     Mr. Mauer was a head waiter and Mrs. Mauer worked part time \n     in school cafeterias. They lived modestly, and invested in \n     stocks and land. Sixteen years after her husband's death, a \n     series of ministrokes left Mrs. Mauer with dementia and she \n     went to live with her son's family. Then she fell and \n     fractured her hip. She was admitted to a hospital and then to \n     a nursing home in 1992. Medicare paid for the first two weeks \n     of care. After that, all of Mrs. Mauer's life savings went to \n     pay for the nursing home. Now she has $2,500 remaining. She \n     contributes her monthly social security check to the nursing \n     home. Without Medicaid, she would not be able to pay the \n     remaining cost of her nursing home care, which is over $3,400 \n     a month.\n\n\n                                missouri\n\n       Katherine Williams, Kansas City, MO.--Katherine, 42, is \n     legally blind and has asthma. Her esophagus is closed and she \n     can only drink fluids and small amounts of food. She hasn't \n     seen a doctor in three months because she knows he will tell \n     her she has to have surgery, but she can't afford it. She has \n     been trying to get Social Security for two years and she \n     still hasn't been given an official decision. Medicaid pays \n     for her doctor appointments and medicine.\n\n\n                                  ohio\n\n       Melvin and Toi Patrick, Columbus, Ohio.--Melvin and Toi \n     have six children, three of whom have asthma. They have some \n     health insurance through Melvin's company, the Central Ohio \n     Transit Authority. However, the children's asthma is \n     considered a pre-existing condition and care for that ailment \n     is not covered. The children's medical care, including \n     hospital stays, daily medications and treatment, costs \n     thousands of dollars each year. ``Had it not been for \n     Medicaid,'' Toi said, ``the high costs of my children's \n     health care would have bled us dry. Medicaid assistance has \n     enabled us to remain financially independent.''\n       Yvette Elkins, Columbus, OH.--After giving birth to her \n     first child, Yvette stopped working to stay home with her \n     baby. Shortly after she resigned, she learned that she was \n     pregnant again. Soon after, her husband left her and the \n     baby. For the first time in her life, Yvette began receiving \n     welfare. Two weeks after her second child was born, Yvette \n     began interviewing for full-time jobs. She depended on \n     Medicaid to bridge the gap between homelessness and gainful \n     employment. Medicaid paid for prescription drugs, doctor \n     visits, and emergency visits; all critical services since \n     Yvette's younger child suffers from chronic ear infections. \n     Transitional Medicaid allowed Yvette to catch up on back \n     bills and advance far enough to obtain a job that offers \n     benefits.\n\n\n                              pennsylvania\n\n       Lester Thomas, Philadelphia, PA.--Lester thought that \n     everyone had insurance and only lazy people were unemployed--\n     until he was laid off and left without insurance. The \n     computer cabinet manufacturing company to which he had \n     devoted 17 years of his life, went out of business. Lester \n     was left to provide for his wife and daughter with no income \n     and no medical coverage. Six months before the layoff, Lester \n     had been diagnosed with diabetes. His wife has chronic \n     sinusitis that requires almost $200 a month in prescription \n     drugs. His daughter has occasional sinusitis. After some time \n     and some guidance from the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, \n     Lester got his medical assistance card. Medicaid covered his \n     family for the next 14 months while Lester looked for another \n     job. He found employment with Paper Manufacturers in \n     Pennsylvania, until that business had to downsize. Lester was \n     let go once more.

She and her brother worked very hard to care for him \n     and help him live at home for almost four years. But when he \n     started to show up at his son's home for breakfast about 15 \n     times a day, and would scorch pans because he left the stove \n     on all night, they realized that it was not safe for him to \n     live at home any more. He needed round-the-clock care so he \n     wouldn't wander off or injure himself. Nursing home costs in \n     South Dakota are very expensive. The home Jackie chose for \n     her dad costs $23,000 a year. In a few short years, she and \n     her brother had spent more than $65,000 on their dad's care. \n     Their families had nothing left. For two years now, Medicaid \n     has paid the nursing home fees that her dad's Social Security \n     checks won't cover. Jackie and her brother can now rest a \n     little easier because they know their dad's getting good \n     care, and their families won't have to face total financial \n     devastation.\n\n\n                               tennessee\n\n       Donna Guyton, Nashville, TN.--A mosquito bite is generally \n     irritating, but hardly ever life-threatening. After a fateful \n     family vacation to Michigan in 1990, Donna's son, Patrick, \n     contracted viral encephalitis, possibly from a mosquito bite. \n     He was hospitalized for three and a half months and suffered \n     from severe seizures. He eventually had to be placed in a \n     drug-induced coma. Until September of 1991, he was covered \n     under his father's health insurance. Then his father's \n     company was bought out, and when they re-enlisted in the \n     plan, Patrick was not covered. Patrick was covered by COBRA \n     for 29 months and in November 1992, he was enrolled in the \n     Medicaid Model Waiver Program. Patrick then enrolled in \n     Vanderbilt \n\n[[Page S 16647]]\n     HMO so that he could receive care from the specialists he needed. But \n     Vanderbilt's medical director consistently denied the care \n     that the specialists requested. As a result of poor attention \n     and insufficient medication, Patrick has been out of school \n     for eight months and has had other health emotional problems.\n\n\n                                 texas\n\n       Peggy Sackett, Austin, TX.--Peggy 36, got freon gas \n     poisoning while working through a temp agency. She now has \n     Respiratory Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS) and is totally \n     disabled. Her husband works for SAM's Club and their health \n     insurance company considers Peggy too high of a risk. She is \n     insured through her previous company, but only for the next \n     two years and she is only covered for problems relating to \n     her lung injury. They almost lost the house paying for \n     medical bills while trying to support two children. She is \n     not able to work anymore so they are supporting the household \n     on one income. She is on Medicaid and Medicare.\n       Doris Brisson, Mesquite, TX.--Doris is only able to pay for \n     two of the four medications her doctor prescribed for her. \n     She is a low-income widow and received SSI and Medicaid until \n     she was 62, when she started collecting her late husband's \n     social security. She then lost her SSI. She does qualify for \n     the QMB benefits, but that does not cover her drug costs. \n     Right now she can only afford to pay for arthritis and high \n     blood pressure medication. She goes without the anti-\n     depressants and the stomach medications her doctor \n     prescribed.\n\n\n                                virginia\n\n       Edna Faris, Alexandria, VA.--Mrs. Faris is 76 years old. \n     Her husband, Wilson, worked hard most of his life. After he \n     served his country in the Navy, he spent 23 years working as \n     a science teacher during the day, and at a supermarket in the \n     evening. In 1990, Mr. Faris was diagnosed with Alzheimer's \n     disease. Mrs. Faris took care of her husband at home for \n     three years, feeding, dressing and bathing him. His condition \n     progressively worsened, until he became combative, and Mrs. \n     Faris was forced to place him in a nursing home. The Farises \n     did not have anywhere near the $48,000 yearly fee for a \n     nursing home, so Mrs. Faris applied for Medicaid. Now \n     Medicaid picks up most of the nursing home's tab, and allows \n     Mrs. Faris to keep a portion of her small income to live on.\n\n\n                               washington\n\n       Vicki and Sean Russell, Lynnwood, WA.--Sean, 4, has a-gamma \n     globulin anemia, an immune deficiency. In order for Sean to \n     live, he must get infusions of gammamune into his bloodstream \n     every three weeks. Each infusion cost about $800. Sean was \n     insured through his father's Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, but \n     when his parents were separating, his father stopped paying \n     the premiums. Vicki works part time as an administrative \n     assistant at a law firm and as a beauty consultant--neither \n     job offers health benefits. The only way Vicki can afford \n     Sean's lifesaving treatment is through Medicaid. Sean has \n     been on Medicaid since last August.\n\n\n                             west virginia\n\n       Joyce and Amy Altizer, Huntington, WV.--Joyce's daughter, \n     Amy, now 20, suffers from a multiple congenital anomaly which \n     has left her severely mentally retarded. She has lost 70 \n     percent of her hearing, she has a seizure disorder as well as \n     behavioral problems. Through the Medicaid Home and Community \n     Based Waiver Program, Any receives case management therapy, \n     day and residential habilitation, and medical care. Her \n     family gets respite care so they can spend time with Amy's \n     sister and do other things typical families take for granted. \n     Amy has also learned to be more independent with therapy.\n\n\n                               wisconsin\n\n       Nathan and Hannah Iverson, Plum City, WI.--Nathan, age \n     three, and Hannah, age five, both receive well-child visits, \n     immunizations, treatment of ear infections and bronchitis, \n     and prescription medicines through Medicaid. Nathan has a \n     speech disorder. The area of his brain which controls his \n     mouth is not fully developed. Medicaid covers his speech \n     therapy, and, with this help, Nathan has just started to \n     speak. Mr. and Mrs. Iverson are farmers. They have had \n     trouble finding private insurance for their family due to \n     Nathan's problems. They have only been able to purchase \n     limited family coverage with a $3,000 deductible. Their \n     policy would help pay expenses for a serious accident or \n     illness, but is not useful for routine health care, nor for \n     Nathan's therapy. The Iversons live modestly. Their farm \n     income is about $12,000 per year. Because the Iverson's \n     income is close to the poverty line, the children qualify for \n     Medicaid.\n\n                   [From the Long-Term Care Campaign]\n\n                         The Faces of Medicaid\n\n       Claudia and Harvey, Council Bluffs, IA.\n       A family struggles to pay for nursing home care.--Harvey \n     began exhibiting the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in his \n     mid-50s. He lost his job as a credit manager, and tried to \n     find work he could still handle, working as a janitor at \n     Creighton Unviersity for a while. But eventually, Alzheimer's \n     caught up with him, and for the past 7 years, he has lived in \n     a nursing home. After years worlding in department stores, \n     Claudia had just opened her own small women's clothing store. \n     But when the bills for Harvey's care began to come in, she \n     had to give that up. Within two years, they used all of their \n     savings to pay over $80,000 in nursing home bills: and Harvey \n     now qualifies for Medicaid. Most of his social security \n     check--$755 a month--still goes to the nursing home. \n     (Medicaid picks up the balance.) Claudia gets $253 Harvey's \n     check, under spousal improverishment rules. She works in a \n     local department store to get enough money to make the house \n     payments, pay for insurance, utilities and food. As she says, \n     she goes from pay day to pay day, never knowing for sure \n     whether there will be enough to make ends meet. (Claudia is \n     starting a new job with a new store that is just opening. It \n     means a slight increase in her salary, but she will not have \n     any more money because the amount she is allowed to keep from \n     Harvey's check will be reduced--and that will go to the \n     nursing home.) Harvey's nursing home now costs over $3,000 a \n     month. They have no way to pay that bill without Medicaid.\n       David, New London, NH.\n       Medicaid allows a young man to work and live \n     independently.--David is a 30 year old man who lives \n     independently and works three days a week at the Granite \n     State Independent Living Foundation as a Public Information \n     Coordinator. In 1990 when he was a college student, David had \n     an accident that left him a quadriplegic. After a three month \n     hospital stay and another three months of rehabilitation, \n     David was ready to continue with his life. Medicaid home and \n     community-based services allows David to do just that. \n     Medicaid paid for the purchase of an electric wheelchair \n     which enables David to be mobile and independent. Medicaid \n     pays for the Personal Care Attendants who assist David in his \n     home daily. PCA services are provided eight hours a day and \n     they help David bathe, dress, transfer, prepare food, do \n     laundry and work on range of motion exercises. David's \n     employer provides health insurance coverage, but the policy \n     does not include the long term services and supports David \n     needs to live independently and work in the community. \n     Medicaid has made it possible for David to rent his own place \n     and work several days a week at a job he enjoys.\n       Bob and Sharon, Wilmington, DE.\n       A family struggles to keep their mother at home.--Bob and \n     Sharon met at the Rochester Institute of Technology, married \n     and moved to Wilmington in 1981 when Bob went to work for \n     DuPont. Sharon was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1983 \n     while she was pregnant with her second son, Matthew. Though \n     bedridden for two years, Sharon fought back, even re-\n     qualifiying for her driver's license. In 1988, her condition \n     deteriorated rapidly and she became completely disabled. She \n     cannot talk and communicates only by signaling ``yes'' or \n     ``no'' with her eyes. She eats and takes medication \n     through a tube in her stomach and is bedridden 24 hours a \n     day. Sharon's two sons, Matthew and Mark help their dad \n     care for her. Medicaid home care allows her to live with \n     her family, providing the care that allows her to stay out \n     of a nursing home. Bob says, ``My objective is to keep my \n     wife and family together for as long as possible. . . . \n     Cuts in Medicaid would force us to put her into a nursing \n     home.''\n       Elaine and Stewart, Central Michigan.\n       A family spends everything they have and Medicaid provides \n     a safety net.--Stewart spent 17 years in a small law \n     practice, then was ordained a Lutheran minister and spent the \n     next 25 years as a pastor. He and Elaine raised their \n     children and saved for their retirement. Then Stewart got \n     Alzheimer's disease. Elaine cared for him at home as long as \n     she could, but she became ill and simply couldn't provide all \n     the care he needed. When Stewart finally had to move to a \n     nursing home, Medicare was no help because the kind of care \n     he needed was considered ``custodial''. Elaine liquidated \n     every asset they had--life insurance, savings, IRAs--and \n     spent it to pay for his care. Finally, she spent everything \n     except the $17,000 Michigan allows her to keep under spousal \n     impoverishment rules. Elaine now spends half of her remaining \n     income on her share of the nursing home bill; Medicaid pays \n     the balance. This leaves her with about $1,200 a month to \n     live on. With nursing home expenses running $100 a day, even \n     if Elaine spent every penny she had left, she would not have \n     enough to pay the bill without help from Medicaid. Bringing \n     Stewart home again is not an option--Elaine is just not \n     strong enough to provide the round-the-clock attention and \n     physical care he requires.\n       Louise and Stewart, Pinellas Park, FL.\n       Home and community-based services allows a husband to keep \n     his wife out of a nursing home.--Stewart has been a caregiver \n     for his wife Louise for eight years. For seven of the past \n     eight years, Louise has been able to remain at home with her \n     husband with the help of Medicaid home and community-based \n     services. When she first received services in 1988, she was \n     unable to walk and communication was difficult--consisting of \n     an occasional word or sentence. Louise needed assistance with \n     all activities of daily living and instrumental activities of \n     daily living. Today, Louise is bedbound. She can no longer \n     speak and must be fed. Though working hard to provide care \n     for Louise, Stewart has health problems of his own, including \n     prostrate cancer and an injured back which prevents him from \n     doing any lifting. Because of these problems, Stewart is \n     unable to give Louise all the care that she needs. But the \n     home and community-based services Louise receives has allowed \n     her to remain at home. An aide comes to their home for two \n     hours a day, five days a week to give Louise a bath, \n\n[[Page S 16648]]\n     feed her and change the bed. During these two hours a day, Stewart is \n     able to run errands, go to the grocery store, and attend a \n     support group. The long term care services Louise receives at \n     home costs $9,224 a year. Without these services, Stewart \n     would have no other option than to place Louise in a nursing \n     home. He says ``I feel secure knowing Louise is getting the \n     best of care.'' Several weeks ago, Stewart spilled hot grease \n     on his right hand. He did not request additional services \n     because he doesn't want to use any more than he absolutely \n     needs.\n       Mary, Rogue River, OR.\n       A woman receives long term care at home and doesn't need to \n     be institutionalized.--Mary is living at home with her \n     husband and is able to visit with her grandchildren and \n     friends on a regular basis in spite of physical problems \n     which would have otherwise confined her to a nursing facility \n     years ago. For four decades Mary has suffered from severe \n     arthritis and several years ago her activities were curtailed \n     even further because she had a stroke. Her health problems \n     also include diabetes, edema, and depression. Mary needs \n     assistance with bathing, transferring, mobility, meal \n     preparation, medication management, and transportation. Until \n     recently, her husband provided all this care that she needs. \n     Three years ago, because he found it difficult to keep up \n     with the physical demands of providing care as he got older, \n     Mary's husband enlisted the help of a in-home aide for 26 \n     hours per month. The aid helps with bathing, medication \n     management and meals. The state pays $144.56 per month for \n     this home-based long term care. The family's only source of \n     income is Social Security. Medicaid pays for all Mary's \n     medications. Without Medicaid supplementing her husband's \n     care, Mary would need to be in a nursing home.\n       Jonathan, Debra and Doug, Lakeview, IA.\n       Medicaid allows a family to keep their child with special \n     needs at home.--Twelve year old Jonathan attends fifth grade \n     in a public school hopes to join a junior bowling league next \n     year. But Jonathan has severe cerebral palsy and \n     developmental disabilities. Jonathan began receiving Medicaid \n     at the age of two because of his severe disabilities. He has \n     undergone four surgeries and hundreds of medical \n     appointments. His disability will require ongoing medical \n     treatment and the use of customized durable medical equipment \n     and assistive technology. Medicaid pays for his electric \n     wheelchair so he can go to school and get around. Jonathan's \n     family provides the care he needs with the help of Medicaid \n     which provides thirty hours a month of supported community \n     living. These hours help Jon become more independent in the \n     community by helping him with mobility, money management and \n     other skills. ``It's far cheaper to raise a child with a \n     disability in their home than it is to institutionalize a \n     child. Plus it just is better for families and better for \n     communities,'' says his mother Debra. ``I think my biggest \n     fear is that they'll cut back on services or tighten \n     guidelines on how much they'll pay on a piece of equipment.''\n       Dana, Chicago Heights, IL.\n       Medicaid helps a woman care for her sister who has mental \n     retardation.--Dana and her sister have lived together for the \n     last 30 years. Dana has partial paralysis on her left side \n     and mental retardation; she requires assistance with personal \n     care, housekeeping, laundry, shopping, errands, and meal \n     preparation. Dana's sister, along with her nephew, and in \n     partnership with Medicaid, has provided that care for the \n     last thirty years, keeping Dana out of an institution. Her \n     sister is limited in her ability to care for Dana due to \n     health problems of her own. Dana's income is about $275 a \n     month from Social Security, and another $145 a month from \n     SSI. At the same time, she pays about $50 for her \n     medications. Dana, Dana's sister, and even Dana's nephew have \n     all pitched in to try and make things work. But without \n     Medicaid, Dana would be forced into an institution--and \n     Dana's sister would face the difficult task of placing her in \n     that institution.\n       Fredda, Salt Lake City, UT.\n       A blind woman struggles to remain in the community.--Fredda \n     is a 68 year old woman who has diabetes. She is legally \n     blind, hypertensive, has chronic heart failure and joint \n     disease--and is firmly determined to maintain her \n     independence. An educated woman, books have long been an \n     important part of her life, and the loss of her ability to \n     read was traumatic. In response, Fredda soon became connected \n     to the library system's book-on-tape program. But as much as \n     Fredda values her independence and her ability to live on her \n     own, she could not make it without Medicaid. Her income is a \n     mere $500 a month, and conditions make it impossible to make \n     it alone. Medicaid helps her pay for prescriptions and also \n     provides needed services. An aide helps her with her bathing, \n     housekeeping, and runs basic errands for her. Fredda lives \n     alone and thrives on her independence. Medicaid helps make \n     that happen.\n       Betty and Howard, Paducah, KY.\n       Medicaid helps a wife keep her husband at home.--Betty and \n     Howard married 35 years ago. Betty was in the WAVES in World \n     War II, then came back to a job in their County Court House, \n     from which she is now retired. Howard started as a farmer, \n     sold cars, and finally worked as a guard for a private \n     security force. Neither of them ever had high paying jobs, \n     but they paid off their mortgage and saved what they could \n     for their retirement. Now, at the age of 71. Betty provides \n     round-the-clock care for Howard, age 79, who has Parkinson's \n     and Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and congestive heart \n     failure. They live on their combined retirement income of \n     less than $1,000 a month. After spending down their savings \n     to spousal impoverishment levels. Howard now qualifies for \n     Medicaid waiver services. That gives them about $150 worth of \n     help a week--Howard goes to a day care center for 4 hours two \n     days a week, and Betty gets help with him at home for another \n     6-8 hours a week. This is the only time she has for \n     uninterrupted sleep, to shop for groceries and Howard's \n     diapers and medications, or to take care of herself. Betty \n     and Howard do not have children. Their three siblings are all \n     in their 70's and 80's and have their own health problems. \n     With help from Medicaid, Berry is managing enough time to \n     keep herself reasonably healthy and to keep Howard at home. \n     Without these services, Betty says, both she and Howard would \n     quickly end up in a nursing home (with no money to pay the \n     bill).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran).

Mr. President, yesterday, it was announced that a \nJapanese bank, Daiwa, will be closed in the United States and charged \nwith fraud and conspiracy for hiding over $1 billion in losses.\n  The Federal Reserve has done the right thing on this issue--closing \ndown a fraudulent bank. But of greater concern, however, is that the \nFederal Reserve has announced it will bail out Japanese banks in the \nUnited States should they suffer a short-term money crisis. The plan \nwas put into place and finalized in September, but only recently was it \nannounced to the public.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important that the United States \nnot become the lender of last resort for every country in the world, \nand we are rapidly moving ourselves in that direction. First, it was \nMexico, and now it is Japan. Who is next around the world? Once you \nopen this door, it is going to be extremely difficult to close. And we \nare opening it.\n  Further, if we cannot get our own budget affairs in order and our \ndeficit under control, who will bail us out? Particularly with this \nPresident, we are getting very little cooperation from the White House \nin our efforts to get the budget in balance in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. President, everyone is well aware that Japanese banks are having \nextreme financial problems. News accounts indicate that Japan's 21 \nlargest banks have $136 billion in nonperforming loans. Some have even \nestimated, and probably more correctly, that this figure could be as \nhigh as $400 to $600 billion in bad loans.\n\n  This is why I was concerned and dismayed that the Federal Reserve has \nunder consideration a plan to meet the short-term credit needs of \nJapanese banks here in this country with the amount of problems they \nhave in Japan.\n  The Fed has assured us any loans to the Japanese banks will be fully \nsecuritized with U.S. Treasury securities. But this totally misses the \npoint and is beside the point. The principle should never be \nestablished that the United States is responsible for meeting the \ncredit needs of foreign banks. This is a responsibility of the Japanese \nMinister of Finance. I repeat, we should never get in the position and \nstart the precedent of bailing out banks around the country.\n  I might add that the Japanese Minister of Finance was aware of the \nDaiwa scandal for 6 weeks before it informed our own Federal Reserve \nBoard. This is their financial problem, not our financial problem. I do \nnot seem to recall any offer from the Japanese to help rescue our \nsavings and loans.\n  Domestic bailouts are bad enough. It is bad enough that the U.S. \ntaxpayers had to put up, pay for $100 billion to correct the savings \nand loan crisis. It was bad enough when our own banks were in trouble \nand the U.S. Treasury had to increase the FDIC's line of credit from $5 \nbillion to $30 billion to support the banking industry. \n\n[[Page S 16649]]\n\n  Now, in a new twist, we have embarked on international rescues. What \nwould compel anyone in this Government to think it is the role of the \nUnited States to rescue overseas banks?\n  This year we loaned $12.5 billion to Mexico. The money came from the \nExchange Stabilization Fund, a fund used to help maintain the value of \nU.S. currency. A good part of that fund has been used in Mexico.\n  The United States taxpayers may have to and probably will have to \nreplenish this fund if Mexico does not pay its loan back. We have had \nthe first indication that they will not pay or will be slow paying \nbecause they have had to roll over one loan four times already.\n  The President did all this on his own. The President did all this \nwithout congressional approval. Now comes this new plan without any \ncongressional approval input in any way to rescue Japanese banks.\n  Mr. President, this whole policy needs to be examined by the \nCongress. We have to make clear that we are not the world's banker. We \nhave to make it clear to the world that we are not the lender of last \nresort. We cannot be the lender of last resort.\n  I strongly urge the Federal Reserve to cancel any plan it has to \nengage in this bailout.\n  Financial bailouts with tax dollars have to stop, and it is the \nresponsibility of the Congress to stop it. Moreover, I cannot think of \na less worthy use of tax dollars than bailing out foreign banks, \nparticularly Japanese banks, when Japan has a positive trade balance of \nover $100 billion.\n  Mr. President, since 1980 we have spent $4 trillion we did not have. \nWe have borrowed and borrowed. Soon, we will raise the limit to $5 \ntrillion. We cannot afford to continue spending this way. This is the \nfirst place I think we should stop it--in bailing out foreign banks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16648-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16649-S16652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, yesterday's long-awaited testimony by \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich on the subject of campaign finance reform was, to \nsay the least, disappointing for me. I hope it does not represent a \nroadblock in the path of needed legislation to reform our campaign \nfinance system in a fashion that does give citizens the sense that they \nhave more power or control over the political process then they \ncurrently do.\n  It seems to me, the top of the list of items I would put on an agenda \nof things needed to be done in order to restore people's confidence in \ndemocracy would be to change our laws that govern campaigns for \nelection either to the U.S. Senate or to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We had legislation. I actually did not support the legislation last \nyear because I thought it created a new, publicly funded entitlement, \nand I did not like that. We had legislation last year that came close. \nThe now-majority leader has indicated he believes it is a top priority. \nA lot of us talk about campaign finance reform. We always get right to \nthe end and we say, ``Yes, I am for campaign finance reform, but there \nis something about this proposal I do not like,'' and there is always a \ngood excuse not to do it.\n  The decision I made earlier this week was, in part, a response to \nthat. I am the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee, a legal organization--there is a Republican counterpart as \nwell--that is designed to go out and find candidates and support \ncandidates for office. It is a later subject, as to whether or not \nthose committees themselves ought to be part of campaign finance \nreform. I certainly would like to see them as part of it. There is \nsomething unsavory about going out and campaigning against people you \nare working with all the time. But, as I said, I will leave that for a \nlater discussion.\n  I, this week, endorsed and became a cosponsor of a piece of \nlegislation that has been developed by Senator McCain of Arizona and \nSenator Feingold of Wisconsin, as well as Senator Thompson of \nTennessee, Senator Simpson of Wyoming, and a number of others. It has a \nbipartisan group of people in the House of Representatives who are \nsupporting it as well. Not just to say I support this legislation. \nThere are changes I want to make in the legislation, particularly as it \nrelates to smaller States such as mine, that I think might not be \npositively affected by this. What it represents is an effort to say to \nRepublicans: Look, on this issue we have to, at some level, set down \nour political party concerns and embrace legislative change that will, \nperhaps, increase the risk to us as incumbents. It seems to me at the \nend of the day that becomes one of the most important risks that \npersonally one factors in, when thinking about whether or not to \nsupport a particular piece of legislation.\n  I feel strongly we cannot continue to give the American people an \nexcuse as to why we cannot do it. It seems to me that is what we always \ndo. We say, ``I am for campaign finance reform, but * * *.'' That is \nwhat I did last year. I do not want to do it this year. I want to be \nable to stand here as a Democrat with Senator McCain, a Republican, \nSenator Thompson, a Republican, Senator Simpson, a Republican, and vote \nfor final passage of legislation that has an opportunity of being \nconferenced with the House bill, if not in this calendar year certainly \nin this session of this Congress. I find, in the Speaker's \nrecommendation, some things I simply cannot support. He is recommending \na 16-member commission on power and political reform in the information \nage.\n  It goes on. There is an article here I am holding that says, in \ntypical expansive, characteristically expansive fashion, he urges all \nof us, if we really want to understand campaign finance reform and get \nto the heart of the matter, he urges all of us ``to study ancient \nGreece and Rome, pre-Civil War United States and the words of Thomas \nJefferson, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow \nWilson, and Henry Cabot Lodge.''\n  Mr. President, I have read most of those. I have been educated far \nmore on these matters listening to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, I must point out, than almost any other speaker on this \nfloor. We have, it seems to me, not a shortage of historical \ninformation. What we have is a shortage of will to vote for something \nthat might put our own political careers at risk.\n  I would object personally to being told that what I have to do is \nwhat the Speaker is recommending--that we are going to have a 16-member \ncommission. They are going to decide. If two-thirds of them vote for a \nspecific proposal, then we have to vote for it up or down. That is a \nrecipe, it seems to me, that on the one hand we are saying we are not \ngoing to get involved--Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, Senator \nThompson, Senator Simpson, myself, and Senator Dodd, and many others of \nus are saying it is time for us to enact legislation that we can reach \nagreement on. I reject that premise on the one hand. On the other hand, \nwhat it calls for is another delay. This commission is supposed to make \nits report on the 1st of May of next year. That will, in my judgment, \nlikely cause us to not be able to enact legislation.\n  Second, I must say with respect to the Speaker's proposal that he has \nbroadened this thing to a point where it is almost a self-defeating \nmission. By broadening it, I mean he wants to include not just campaign \nfinance reform but the power of private sector individuals in the \ninformation age. Specifically, he references in here and compares in \nhere, a multi-millionaire broadcaster on ABC News being given \ntremendous access to the American people. That individual does not \nrepresent political power; whereas, the thousand-dollar contribution \nbeing written by the broadcaster's spouse does. Then he says--and I \nmust say, in his typically characteristic way, only the Speaker seems \nto be able to come up with these sorts of phrases--``This is simply a \nnonsensical, socialist analysis based on hatred of the free enterprise \nsystem.'' \n\n[[Page S 16650]]\n\n  Anybody that does not see it the way the Speaker sees it hates the \nfree enterprise system and is a socialist. Interesting argument. I will \nleave it to somebody else to figure that one out.\n  Mr. President, the Speaker knows quite well that there are many free \nenterprise organizations that give you--for example, Rupert Murdoch put \n$10 million into a magazine called American Standard. He has a \npolitical orientation there. We do not restrict that activity. I hope \nthe Speaker is not suggesting that we get into that kind of activity \nbecause it is a self-defeating mission, if that is what we are going to \ndo. He may not like the views of somebody on television, or somebody \nwriting an editorial page, or something like that. But, for gosh sakes, \nthat is not the issue.\n  The issue is people who decide to run for office. Once we get to \noffice, we have power that a challenger does not have. Specifically, in \nmy own case in the last Senate reelection campaign, I started off the \ncampaign with nearly 100 percent name recognition. Anybody who wants to \nchallenge me will have to spend $1 million, let us say, on the TV just \nto get their name up as a credible candidate. That really is a hurdle \nthat an individual has to be able to get over if they are going to be \ncompetitive against an incumbent.\n  So the legislation that Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have put \ntogether--the reason, it seems to me, that it has merit--deals with \nthis problem of financing head on. The Speaker, on the other hand, \nsays--it is a remarkable headline. I cannot remember exactly. I cannot \nsee the print. I did not bring my glasses. But he said something to the \neffect that there is a great myth going on in the country today that we \nspend too much on campaigns. That is a myth? I think he is maybe the \nonly person in America who has discovered that is a myth, that we spend \ntoo much. That we do not spend too much is the Speaker's view. He says \nit is not that we spend too much, but that we do not spend enough. What \nwe need, instead of $4 million Senate races in Nebraska, are $8 million \nSenate races.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I have my \nglasses on. I was very excited to hear my colleague from Nebraska over \nhere, so I decided to join him.\n  The quote here is, rather than limit campaign spending, Gingrich \nsaid, ``One of the greatest myths in modern politics is that campaigns \nare too expensive. The political process, in fact, is not overfunded \nbut underfunded.''\n  So that quote in that particular instance is one of the great myths I \nhave ever heard about. I do not know about the Speaker, but I can tell \nyou as someone who has been through seven elections, that for the \naverage Senate race, either Republican or Democrat, candidates must \nraise $12,000 a week every week for 6 years to meet the cost of the \naverage Senate campaign in the United States. If the Speaker thinks \nthat is underfunded, then he lives on a different planet than I do.\n  One of the problems is too many Members spending too much time--way \ntoo much time--out there raising the money, sitting down with the \npeople who can raise and give them the kind of resources necessary. I \npromise you, if we continue on the path we are going, it is going to \ndestroy this process in this country. It has to stop.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate that comment. I would like to \nask the Senator from Connecticut, he is the chairman of the Democratic \nNational Committee, and when we earlier this week endorsed what is \ngenuinely a bipartisan bill where at the moment there are at least more \nRepublicans on it than Democrats--what we are trying to do is get \nChairman Barbour and Chairman D'Amato, not necessarily because they \nlike every detail. I do not like every detail in the bill, nor does the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut like it. But to say we know--I \nthink Chairman Barbour knows and Chairman D'Amato knows. They are out \nthere a lot with the people making contact with citizens, and citizens \nare saying loud and clear to us, ``Change this electoral system. Change \nit so that we feel like we have more power, more control, and more \nopportunity to participate.''\n  One of the things that I hope comes out of this is, rather than this \njust being a couple of Democrats coming down to the floor of the \nSenate, I am not trying to seek partisan advantage as a consequence of \nwhat Speaker Gingrich says. I am not going after Chairman Barbour or \nany Republicans down here at all. Indeed, quite the opposite. I am \npraising Republican leadership in recognizing, as Senator McCain has, \nand Senator Thompson and Senator Simpson have, that this process has to \nchange. I am hopeful that leadership of our parties can say to the \nAmerican people, ``OK, we are going to put our swords down. We are \ngoing to stop cranking the fax machine for a while, and we are going to \nlet the legislative process work.''\n  The Members of the Senate and the House go home over the weekends. \nThey know what is going on. You ask at the townhall meeting for a show \nof hands for how many favor limiting campaign spending and for reform \nof the process. If it is an audience of 100, you will get 100 hands. If \nyou ask the audience how many think we do not spend enough in political \ncampaigns, not a single hand will go up, unless somebody owns a \ntelevision station and wants to spend more money or something like \nthat.\n  I really believe that we know. I doubt that there is a single Member \nof this body who would say that the campaign laws ought to stay the \nsame as they are. My guess is 100 out of 100 know this thing ought to \nchange.\n  I hopeful, at least on this issue, that we can stop being partisan \nfor a moment and be Americans instead and pass legislation that the \nAmerican people are saying is a top priority for them.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I want to underscore, Mr. \nPresident, what the Senator from Nebraska has said today with his \nleadership on this issue. The author of the legislation that the \nSenator from Nebraska and I are speaking about is our colleague from \nArizona, Senator McCain. And in the House of Representatives, similar \nlegislation is sponsored Representative Linda Smith, who I gather is a \nfreshman Member of the House--I do not know her personally, and I do \nnot know if we have ever met. Christopher Shays, a House Republican \nMember and a colleague of mine from the State of Connecticut whom I \nknow, is another sponsor of the House legislation. To suggest that what \nwe are doing is somehow partisan, is to belie the facts. I have been a \nstrong supporter, as my colleague has, for years on campaign finance \nreform.\n  What we see with this legislation being offered by our colleagues \nfrom Arizona--and Washington and Connecticut in the House--is an \nopportunity to get beyond the partisanship; and, that is, to join \ntogether here, Republicans and Democrats who believe that despite \nwhatever differences we may have on other issues and on this issue of \ntrying to slow down and limit the proliferation of money in these \ncampaigns, it is a worthy cause.\n  Whatever other differences we may have on this issue, we ought to be \nable to come together. By supporting a bipartisan piece of legislation, \nwe can achieve it. How anyone can believe what the Speaker says--I read \nwhat the Speaker says here, and I quote him:\n\n       I would guess that over half of the money I raise is spent \n     offsetting the weight of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\n  Half the money is spent running against a newspaper in Georgia. The \nlast time I heard, my opponent was not the newspaper. I normally end up \nwith someone on the other side I debate with and face.\n  So now let me see if I understand this. We raise this much money \nbecause we have to take on our local newspapers and radio stations? \nThat is ludicrous, Mr. President, absolutely ludicrous to make that \ncase, for the Speaker of the House to make the case, that we need to \nspend more money so we can take on the media.\n  That is what this is about. I have never heard that argument before. \nI have heard other arguments about why we do not want to limit campaign \nexpense, but never the suggestion that somehow we have to do it in \norder to beat back our local newspaper and columnists.\n  Mr. KERREY. If the Senator will yield on that one point, I find it \nrather ironic; Speaker Newt Gingrich at the start of the session made \nRush \n\n[[Page S 16651]]\nLimbaugh an honorary Member of Congress, so apparently if the views \nline up with your views----\n  Mr. DODD. It is OK.\n  Mr. KERREY. You make them an honorary Member. I would say it is more \nthan just ironic that the Speaker, on the one hand, is willing to make \nRush Limbaugh an honorary Member of Congress because he believes that \nhe and talk radio have been enormously helpful, but the Atlanta-\nConstitution is an enemy.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is lucky; he has Bob Shrepf in that \nState so he does not have that problem. There have been many views \nexpressed by media highly critical of the Senator from Nebraska. I \nthink they have been wrong, almost never justified. Always some outrage \nboils up inside of me, and I have said, ``This is not fair.''\n  Well, that is free speech. It is fair. That is the press. I walked \ninto the arena, and I should not look for somebody to blame for the \nproblems I have. It seems to me the American people have said \noverwhelmingly--I do not know about Connecticut but in Nebraska over \nand over they say to me, ``We're sick of all that money.'' I had \ntrouble in 1994 getting people excited about my campaign because very \noften they would say to me, ``We give too darned much money. We are \nsick of it. We are tired of seeing these 30-second ads over and over. \nWe get sick of your face. We would like to have a race that is a bit \nmore on the issues, a bit more opportunity for people to become \ncompetitive.''\n  I can think of 100 reasons why not to vote for campaign finance \nreform. I have a lot of reasons why I would not want to vote for it, \nand they are all good. I do not like public finance. I do not like \nthis. I do not like limits. There are all kinds of reasons why I would \nnot want to support it. But it seems to me one of the dominant things \nthat occurs is, gee, is this going to hurt the Democratic Party or is \nthis going to hurt the Republican Party or is this going to hurt me as \nan incumbent? I think we are hurting democracy the longer we wait to \nchange this political system so the American people feel they do have \nmore power, more control, and more opportunity to participate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just want to echo the comments made by my \ncolleague from Nebraska. As I mentioned a moment ago, we are all too \nfamiliar with the cost of these campaigns, the ever-increasing costs. \nTo give you an idea, 20 years ago, the most expensive race statewide \never in the history of Connecticut was when Ella Grasso ran for \nGovernor; she spent about $400,000 in a statewide race. I am told that \nin 1998, should I seek reelection, the cost of a competitive race in my \nState, given the price of New York media, Boston media, my own State \nmedia, would hover somewhere between $4.5 and $6 million. That is in 20 \nyears.\n  That is the average cost, by the way, nationwide, taking California \non the one hand, the extreme case, because of the size of that State \nand on the other hand a State I suppose like Rhode Island. Or maybe \nthat is not a good example--maybe a smaller State in population, \nMontana, Idaho, whatever it may be--the average cost is roughly $4.5 to \n$5 million.\n  That means the average Senator would have to be raising $12,000 a \nweek every week for 6 years--from the day they arrive and are sworn in \nin the Chamber of this Senate, from that day forward, $12,000 a week \nevery week.\n  When you consider as an incumbent the advantage of that, considering \nsomeone who might 2 years out decide to take a shot at being a U.S. \nSenator, what are their chances? What is the population pool from which \nwe are likely to draw candidates for the Senate?\n  If you decide 24 months out that you would like to run for the \nSenate, you have to raise not $12,000 a week; you have to raise \nsomething like $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a week, or you have to \nhave the wealth yourself.\n  Last year we saw in California one individual spend $28 million of \nhis own money, and I do not think people want to see an institution \nproliferated by either people who have only the personal wealth that \nallows them to run or that have only the access to that kind of \nwealth--knowing the kinds of commitments that get made in this \nbusiness, have them come here already in a sense committed on a whole \nhost of issues where the public interest would be jeopardized.\n  So again, I emphasize I think Congresswoman Linda Smith had it right, \nwith her opinion on this idea of a commission. We have had many \ncommissions and many studies on this. No one is fooled by that one. \nForming a commission to go out and study this issue again is laughable. \nThere has been much analysis and much study on this. The question is \nwhether or not we have the intestinal fortitude to come to terms with \nan issue that demands resolution.\n  So I hope that these commission ideas would be shelved, and that we \nwould get about the business here of putting a bill in the Chamber. Let \nSenator McCain and Senator Feingold bring up their bill. Let amendments \nbe brought up to moderate and change it. As the Senator from Nebraska \nsaid, he and I may have some modifications to offer to that \nlegislation, but we are never going to have that chance if it does not \nget called up.\n  So, while I may disagree with Congresswoman Smith on many, many \nissues, on this one she is right. Senator McCain is right. We better \nget about the business of allowing this bill to go forward.\n  I am saddened when I see the continued call for more and more money \nbeing spent. And to suggest somehow that you need to spend more, as \nthis headline says, ``Gingrich Calls For More Not Less Campaign Cash,'' \nbecause he has to take on the Atlanta Constitution, is going to be met \nI think with the kind of derision that it ought to be. No one buys that \nargument. Not a single person in this country will buy that argument.\n  And so I hope that our colleagues will support what Senator Kerrey \nand I have done over the last several days. Get behind the McCain-\nFeingold bill. Senator Simpson has done so. Our colleagues as well, \nseveral, have offered this. Senator Nunn and Senator Simon on our side \nover here have been supportive of it. I believe it is on the right \ntrack.\n  Again, it is not going to be perfect in every detail, but certainly \nit is the only way that I can see in the short run we are going to get \nanything done on this.\n  Believe me when I tell you that Senator Kerrey and I have certainly \nbeen challenged in our own party for cosponsoring this bill. This was \nnot met with wild applause by everybody who wears the label of \nDemocrat.\n  And so do not misunderstand us here today. This is not something that \nis greeted with great applause in every quarter. But we happen to \nbelieve as the leaders of our respective groups, as chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and chairman of the Democratic \nNational Party, this is truly in the national interest. It is truly in \nthe national interest to put a stop to what I would, I think, \nappropriately call the obscene amount of money being spent in American \npolitics. It is turning people off by the day in this country. They are \nsick of it. They want it to stop. They want choices that they can make \nwhen they go to the polls, and they see the amount of money being spent \nis a real detriment in that effort. So we urge the leadership to allow \nthe bill to come to the floor for a vote.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, one last comment and I will yield the \nfloor. I see the Senator from Pennsylvania is here. He and I just had a \ncouple of minutes of conversation on this subject.\n  Polls are very popular methods of trying to determine the attitudes \nand views of the American people or some segment of the American \npeople, and sometimes those polls are encouraging and sometimes those \npolls are discouraging. One of the most, if not the most, discouraging \npolls that I have ever read was a poll that asked the American people \nwho has the most power in Washington, DC, the President of the United \nStates, the Congress, the special interests?\n  I understand that the special interests can mean one thing to one \nperson and another to another. I can be a good special interest and a \nbad special interest. But by a margin of 3 to 1 the American people \nbelieve that the special interests have more power than a Member of \nCongress does or than even the President of the United States. \n\n[[Page S 16652]]\n\n  That is a very disturbing fact. We all know that perception becomes \nreality. If that is the belief of the American people, that means they \nwould say we do not have any opportunity. If we want to change a law, \nif there is something that we would like to influence in Washington, \nDC, we would like to bring in an idea and have it become incorporated \ninto a piece of legislation, we just do not think we have a fighting \nchance.\n  We have to change that perception.\n  I believe, among other things, campaign finance reform can be a means \nto that end. There may be other things that people have on the list, \nbut I would put that very high--indeed, I would put that at the top of \nmy list in the ways to change the law so we can begin to change that \nperception, so the American citizens out there can say, as, for \nexample, Sarah Brady did, we can change the law. It may not be a \npopular change, maybe it will produce a lot of heartache where people \nwill have to take a position on legislation we want to change, but we \nwant to fight to change the law.\n  We have to change the perception that people have that there is no \nopportunity for them to come to Washington, DC, and change the law of \nthe land. If we are able to do that, not only will we get increased \nparticipation at the day of the election, we will get increased \nparticipation all year long from citizens who feel this really is a \ngovernment of, by, and for the people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I believe that campaign finance reform is long \noverdue. I have just had a conversation with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut--if I could have the attention of the Senator from \nConnecticut--and one of the real problems in the electoral process \ninvolves the soft money, where, on both sides of the political \nspectrum, Republicans and Democrats have sought enormous sums of money \nwith the $100,000 contribution being made which is totally outside the \nsystem.\n  I have just talked to Senator Dodd about that. And I am glad to know \nhis acquiescence on the issue of eliminating the soft money, because \nyou can have all the limitations you like in many other respects, but \nif that soft money is available, it is all for naught. So I thank my \ncolleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield.\n  The bill does do that. And I think there is value in that. I \nneglected to say to my colleague in our private conversation that I \nthink you might be able to make a case, for instance, in the area of \nlocal--not national--but local, statewide elections, and so forth, \nwhere you want to promote a certain activity, that you might find a way \nto have some exceptions and caveats.\n  In the underlying point, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is \ncorrect, but I can also see where some modifications in that might meet \nthe concerns of the Senator from Pennsylvania and my concerns, what he \nproperly describes as the proliferation of this kind of resource that \ncomes into our national coffers, in a way to promote, I think, sound, \nintelligent, and worthwhile political activity at the grassroots level.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may pursue that discussion for one more moment with \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  I get concerned when you say caveat.\n  What kind does the Senator have in mind?\n  Mr. DODD. I do not have one in mind. I think, like the Senator from \nNebraska said, this 60-percent requirement, that the funds be 60 \npercent from your State, that might be fine in California, \nPennsylvania, even Connecticut, but in some other States you may want \nto have some flexibility in that, small States that do not have that \nkind of population. You may want to modify that.\n  That is what I mean by some of the provisions here. I support this \nbill. I am a cosponsor of it. I think that speaks volumes about where \nwe stand. I am willing to consider ways in which we can accommodate \nsome legitimate questions being raised.\n  But my view is it is better to get behind a bill you fundamentally \nsupport so we have some possibility of reform, than to not support the \nbill at all. If I had as my standard here that I disagreed with a \ncouple of points here and believed that there needed to be some \nmodifications before I could support it, we would never get anything \ndone in this area. In all the years I have supported campaign finance \nreform, that is what has happened here. The Democrats offer a bill, the \nRepublicans offer a bill, and nothing ever gets done. We both go out \nand issue our press releases saying how much we are for campaign \nfinance reform.\n  What the Senator from Nebraska and I have decided to do here backs \nour colleague--here is a colleague from the other side of the aisle who \ncares deeply about the issue, with two Members of the House, both of \nthe Republican Party, Congressman Smith and Congressman Shays, along \nwith some Democrats, who offer a proposal. Because there are a number \nof Republicans and Democrats who endorse the McCain bill, we thought \nmaybe, just maybe, we might be able to get beyond what has been the \ntraditional response, Mr. President, to the historic way we have dealt \nwith this issue, and that is a couple of bills and the press releases \ngo out.\n  I am not going to endorse every aspect of this bill. I would not \nexpect everyone else to. In the soft money area, my general view is we \nought to get out of it. You may make some exceptions on the local level \nor State level. That may have some value. But I still believe honestly \nwe ought to get behind this bill and get something on the floor that \nwould change the way we run our campaigns in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16649-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16652-S16653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL ON WAR CRIMES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to lend \nmy support to a request made by the prosecutor on the International War \nCrimes tribunal on the Bosnian situation, where the International \ntribunal on War Crimes in Bosnia has formally asked the United States \nto make the surrender of the indicted suspects a condition for any \npeace accord.\n  As we know, right now in Dayton there are negotiations underway to \ntry to resolve the Bosnian conflict. But indictments have already been \nissued for Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, and \nRadovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, on indictments which specify \ntheir leadership role in the ethnic cleansing and reported massacres \nand organized rapes that marked the first months of the Bosnian war.\n  The tribunal prosecutor, the distinguished lawyer Richard J. \nGoldstone, has been pursuing these matters with real diligence, and it \nposes a real test for the international community. Part of the test \narises because the President of Serbia, President Slobodan Milosevic, \nis involved in these negotiations. He was identified some time ago by \nthe then-Secretary of State, Lawrence Eagleburger, as having been \ninvolved possibly in international war crimes in connection with the \nBosnian Serbs' ethnic cleansing in the early months of that campaign.\n  I am pleased to note that ranking Clinton administration officials \nhave committed that there will be no amnesty granted, but I think it is \nvery important as a matter of international law that these prosecutions \ngo forward and the United States cooperate with these prosecutions.\n  For more than a decade, Mr. President, I have urged the formation of \nan international criminal court to deal with crimes such as hostage \ntaking, terrorism, and drug dealing where we find that there are people \nin custody who they will not extradite to the United States; for \nexample, in Colombia where there are drug leaders and drug criminals \nwho ought to be brought to trial, but because of domestic politics in \nColombia, they are not willing to extradite them to the United States. \nIf there were an international criminal court, then I do believe there \nwould be a tribunal set up where the political disadvantage of \nextraditing, say, to the United States would not be present.\n  And I note today, Mr. President, that there are ceremonies marking \nthe tragedy of Pan Am 103, where indictments have been issued for two \nLibyans implicated in the tragedy of Pan Am 103, and the intransigence \nof the Libyan \n\n[[Page S 16653]]\nGovernment and their leader, Mu'ammar Qadhafi, who is refusing to allow \nthose suspects to be tried in the United States or in Scottish or in \nBritish courts.\n  Were we to have an international criminal court, there is at least a \nchance that those individuals would be extradited to be tried in an \ninternational criminal court. Perhaps if such a court were in \nexistence, Qadhafi would find another reason for declining to allow \nthat trial to take place, but at least it would provide a possible \nalternative for such a trial.\n  The rule of law is indispensable, Mr. President, in a civilized \nsociety. We have benefited enormously in those countries which do have \nthe rule of law. It is a high priority in the United States, obviously, \nwith our constitutional rights.\n  We should have established an international criminal court a long \ntime ago. It has been on the horizon. It has received favorable comment \nfrom the U.S. Senate and from the House on sense-of-the-Congress \nresolutions. But we ought to be moving to really put it into effect. \nWith the Bosnian war crimes tribunal, we have a chance to advance the \nrule of law internationally. So I do hope that we will see to it that \nthe request made by the international tribunal on war crimes to have \nthe surrender of these indicted suspects be made as a condition to any \npeace accord that will take place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Let me just now refer briefly to my work on the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. I chaired that committee.\n  Mr. President, each and every day the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \napparently greets his employees with a memo on their computer. Usually \nthat memo recognizes the accomplishments of individual employees, notes \nthe significance of a particular date in terms of this country's \nmilitary history, or exhorts VA employees to a higher level of service \nto America's veterans. Nothing at all wrong with that.\n  But, on August 21, the Secretary took a leap beyond that boundary. In \nthat day's message, he launched into his old stump speech about the \nwoeful VA budget. About the same time, he also communicated with all VA \nemployees by means of a similar message printed on their own personal \npay stub.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these messages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMessage From Secretary Jesse Brown Printed on a Recent VA Employee Pay \n                                Voucher\n\n       The Administration and the Congress have outlined \n     dramatically different budget approaches designed to balance \n     the budget, reduce taxes, and create a leaner government. As \n     I have been telling the nation's veterans organizations this \n     summer, the Administration's plan is much better for veterans \n     and their families. The President recommended a good FY 1996 \n     VA budget, with a $1.3 billion increase, including nearly $1 \n     billion for health care. On the other hand, the House of \n     Representatives has approved a plan to increase veterans \n     health care $563 million by taking money from our \n     construction account and preventing us from building badly \n     needed hospitals in Florida and California, hospitals which \n     the President proposed be fully funded. And we will lose some \n     of the money we need to renovate older facilities. The House \n     also voted to stop compensation to some incompetent veterans. \n     This is nothing but a means test that will push some service-\n     connected veterans into poverty. We hear a lot these days \n     about making sacrifices. We need to point out that veterans \n     and their families have already paid their dues.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Secretary Brown's Message Sent August 21, 1995\n\n       This is what our veterans' budget future boils down to: the \n     President has proposed a 10-year plan to eliminate the \n     deficit, while protecting critical programs. He has proposed \n     no new cuts in veterans entitlements. Congress has adopted a \n     budget resolution outlining a 7-year plan to eliminate the \n     deficit, which would be devastating to veterans' programs. \n     The President has recommended a $1.3 billion increase in VA's \n     FY96 budget, nearly a billion of which is targeted to \n     veterans' health care. The congressional budget resolution \n     effectively freezes VA funding for veterans' health care at \n     1995 dollar levels for the next 7 years. This means \n     eliminating 61,000 health care positions by 2002 and denying \n     care to more than a million veterans. The House budget would \n     also cancel plans for two badly needed VA replacement \n     hospitals in central Florida and northern California. When it \n     comes to meeting veterans' needs, gratitude and penny-\n     pinching don't mix.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           Secretary Brown's Daily Message on October 6, 1995\n\n       I am being attacked publicly for telling you through \n     various forums what is going on with our budget. Rest assured \n     I do not intend to stop. I believe VA employees had a right \n     to know about the public and Congressional debate on VA's \n     future and the impact our lawmakers' decisions can have on \n     benefits and services for veterans. Is this a partisan \n     endeavor? Absolutely not! As Secretary of Veterans Affairs, I \n     have a responsibility to keep you informed on issues that \n     affect your careers, livelihood an roles as members of the VA \n     team. And certainly I have the right to let our valued \n     constituency--veterans and their families--know that their \n     programs may be adversely affected. It is important that \n     employees be made fully aware that tens of thousands of VA \n     jobs may be eliminated over the next seven years as a result \n     of current budget proposals. I am not calling on you to act, \n     but I think you have the right to know the facts. Stay tuned!\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, these messages, and their distribution to \nall VA employees, are highly political, and seem to me to be wholly \ninappropriate.\n  They all state a biased, partisan perspective of the Department's \nbudget and its implications. This is a perspective with which I \nwholeheartedly disagree.\n  Nothing new in that either. Reasonable men can disagree.\n  However, my disagreement regarding the effects of the Congressional \nbudget for veterans' programs is fully supported by a General \nAccounting Office [GAO] analysis of the budget conducted for the \nChairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n  GAO documented that, on the merits themselves, Secretary Brown's \ncriticisms of the VA budget which was approved by the Congress are \nindeed ``exaggerated.''\n  GAO also points out that if Secretary Brown were to analyze the \nPresident's budget using the same assumptions he used when he analyzed \nthe budget approved by the Congress, he would find that veterans are \nbetter off under the Congressional budget--than under the President who \nappointed him.\n  In short, Mr. President, veterans should not be misled. Veterans are \nbetter off under the budget that Secretary Brown is attacking than they \nare under the President's budget he is defending.\n  Please hear that clearly. The VA knows this. The Secretary knows \nthis.\n  Secretary Brown complains that the Congress will force him to close \nhospitals. What he doesn't tell us, and what he doesn't tell the VA \nemployees who are pretty much compelled to read his daily ration of \npropaganda, is that, using the very same pessimistic assumptions, the \nPresident's own budget would require him to close 6 additional \nhospitals than he would have to close  \n\n[[Page S 16654]]\n\nunder the Republican Congressional budget. Hear that too.\n  Secretary Brown then uses--rather misuses--the power of his fine \noffice to scare the wits out of VA employees, and the veterans they \nserve, by asserting that the Congressional budget would ``force'' VA to \ntreat fewer veterans.\n  What he does not tell them is that under his budget, using these very \nsame pessimistic assumptions, again VA would provide 283,000 fewer \noutpatient visits--and treat 12,500 fewer veterans--than VA would be \ntreating under the very Congressional budget he is attacking. Hear \nthat.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is playing \nplenty fast and loose with the facts in order to divert attention away \nfrom the tough and necessary budget decisions made by our President. He \nis our President. I find that offensive.\n  That is cheap politics and demeans his office. But, it is certainly \nnot unheard of in this town.\n  What is absolutely unacceptable is his use of taxpayer funded VA \nresources to place his purely political message in the hands of every \nVA employee--and on the screen of every single VA computer when it is \ncranked up every morning.\n  What is absolutely unacceptable is his use of the full authority of \nhis office, and the latent power of his supervisory position over VA's \n240,000 employees, to add to the weight of his opinions. Stump speeches \nare for out on the road Mr. Secretary, not for the taxpayers' \ncomputers.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Brown has stepped right up to the plate of \npublic service and there are now two strikes in the count.\n  Strike one is found right there in Secretary Brown's message.\n  It is distorted and it is wrong. And the distortions serve a clear \npolitical purpose. The distortions serve to create the impression that \nthis Republican Congress is hell bent on--and is--harming our veterans.\n  Strike two is found in Secretary Brown's delivery.\n  He piously then states that he is not trying to provoke any action on \nthe part of VA employees. He is not ``calling on you to act'' he says, \nin the computer.\n  No, not much. He is only keeping his loyal employees informed of what \nis happening in Washington. But let us just think about that a moment, \nMr. President. These messages are on employee pay slips. What do you \nthink the average worker in America would think if their pay slip \nincluded a message from their boss attacking the Congress?\n  I do not know about others, Mr. President, but it does not take a \nrocket scientist to figure out that many employees might take that as a \npretty good hint to take some action or at least say something to \nsomebody. Come on.\n  If it talks, walks and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck. And \nSecretary Brown's belated attempt to put some latter invented public \nservice label on his inappropriate lobbying cannot pluck the feathers \nfrom the manipulative and political duck he has hatched out.\n  Why do we think Secretary Brown is keeping in such close touch with \nhis myriad empire of employees--240,000 of them to be exact? Just being \na genial communicator of the morning hour? Maybe like Don Imus? Give us \na break.\n  I have been here now for 17 years and I have never seen a VA \nAdministrator or Secretary--Democrat or Republican--misuse VA's \ninternal communications methods in this blatant fashion.\n  It is wrong.\n  It should stop.\n  The World Series is over, Mr. Secretary, and you already have these \ntwo big strikes against you. But you should put down your big bat, \nreflect a bit, cease abusing your fine office in this fashion and step \nup to the plate one more time.\n  And this time, Mr. Secretary, do not resort to unfortunate distortion \nand childish scare tactics in a desperate attempt to enlist America's \nfine veterans to be used--and that is the word--``used'' as point men \nto try to turn back a historic effort to protect the future of the next \ngeneration by balancing the budget of those living in this one.\n  When you do that, you dishonor yourself and you dishonor the veterans \nyou profess to serve. And many of them do not believe you any more. \nThat is sad.\n  Mr. Secretary, finally, those of us who are veterans served to \nprotect the future of our country. I am very proud to have been one. We \nserved to provide for a better future for our children and \ngrandchildren. The budget you take pleasure in attacking is an honest \nand forthright budget that keeps faith with America's veterans by \nkeeping faith with America's future.\n  If a balanced Federal budget is to be defeated by the ugly forces of \nreaction and fear, then all that America's veterans fought to achieve \nwill also be lost.\n  If this very stirring movement for a truly balanced Federal budget is \nturned aside, whether or not you agree with it, then all the sacrifices \nof the servicemembers who died or were wounded in the service of our \ncountry will have been in vain. It sounds dramatic, does it not? No \nmore dramatic than the words the Secretary uses in his standard stump \nspeech.\n  If we fail to balance this Federal budget, the inevitable collapse of \nthe American economy will destroy the future that we American veterans \nwanted to ensure.\n  This inevitable collapse of the American economy will also destroy \nthe ability of our country to be able to fund the benefits upon which \nmany veterans depend.\n  So, Mr. Secretary, when you face that third pitch, there is a message \nthat you can share with America's veterans on the taxpayer's computers \nlinking up with the 240,000 VA employees who are committed to serve \nthem.\n  You can tell them about the strength of America's commitment to her \nveterans and the willingness of the Congress--Democratic and Republican \nalike--to reinforce that commitment with hard bucks.\n  During my own time here in the Senate, I have watched the budget of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs nearly double--from $20 billion in \n1978 to nearly $40 billion now.\n  And that growth will only continue. Indeed, even under the rigorous \nbudget constraints applicable to us today, the VA budget is anticipated \nto increase by nearly $4 billion more under these evil Republicans by \nthe year 2002.\n  And the growth in the VA health care budget has been real growth. We \nare not just ``keeping up'' with inflation. In the time I have been in \nthe Senate, the number of VA physicians has increased by 9.6 percent.\n  The number of VA Registered Nurses has increased by 40 percent.\n  The total Veterans Health Administration staff has increased by 10.8 \npercent. These are real increases in the real numbers of real health \ncare professionals who provide real increased services to real \nveterans. Forget the other hokum the Secretary puts out in the old \nstump speech and remember we are talking about real, real things.\n  In contrast to the proposed Congressional, that is Republican budget, \nwhich protects VA health care spending to the fullest, the President's \nbudget proposes a reduction in the veterans' health care account. Hear \nthat.\n  The Secretary knows that too. And it irritates him greatly because he \nknows the President is on mighty thin ground with many veterans anyway.\n  The budget the President has sent to the Congress would actually \nreduce VA health care spending from $16.2 billion in 1995 down to $15.4 \nbillion at the turn of the century. The Secretary knows that.\n  Secretary Brown is caught complaining about a budget with no \nreductions while at the same time ignoring his own President's budget \nwhich would provide $337 million less bucks than the Congressionally \napproved budget he is continuously and hysterically attacking.\n  I have said to Secretary Brown in the past: ``Every man is entitled \nto his own opinion--but not to his own facts.'' These are the cold hard \nunrefuted facts.\n  This Nation has been absolutely unstinting in its support of her \nveterans over the years. No Nation on earth has been more generous to \nher veterans. Why is it this Secretary never acknowledges that? He \nshould.\n  Our own Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent \nAgencies, so ably chaired by my old \n\n[[Page S 16655]]\nfriend Senator Kit Bond, recently reported out an extremely generous \nbudget for veterans--to include a $285 million increase over fiscal \nyear 1995 for veterans' health care.\n  Items eliminated from the budget, as originally requested in it, \ninclude hospitals in East Central Florida and Travis Air Force Base, \nCA.\n  In a consensus document expressing the views and estimates on the \nadministration's budget proposal, the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee expressed its own reservations about the need for this \nadditional construction of infrastructure at a time when the veteran \npopulation is declining at a rate of 2 percent per year. The GAO \nrecently reported to Congress that with the veteran population \ndeclining--even in Florida--there is no documented need whatever for \nanother VA hospital there. We take awfully good care of our veterans. \nWe should--those who bore the battle and their widows and orphans.\n  So let it be recorded that I personally was incensed, as I know some \nVA employees were, to see the partisan political message the Secretary \nsent out to his troops on August 21. I consider it grossly wrong to use \nemployee's pay vouchers or access to the VA computer system to \ncirculate that type of hoorah.\n  Secretary Brown may--and I think often does--perceive his mission to \nbe a purely political one, to toe the line for this President. But he \nsteps over that line when he uses his access to, and his control over, \nthe taxpayer provided resources of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nas a means to preach a political message to his civil service \nsubordinates. It is wrong and he knows it is wrong.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Brown owes it to the veterans he serves, to \nthe Congress, and to the Department he leads, to change his course away \nfrom a path of politicized, distorted and exaggerated rhetoric on the \nstump speeches and toward a course of statesmanlike and steady \nleadership.\n  Mr. Secretary, you are now headed toward treacherous shoal waters and \nit is long over due time for a change in course. Many of us will be \nwatching more closely than ever before.\n  Save the politics for when you no longer serve in this type of \nposition of trust.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1389 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, last month, the University of Denver \nCollege of Law opened the Mapelli Brothers' Place in the Yegge Student \nCenter. Mapellis' Place recognizes the wonderful contribution the \nMapelli family has made to Colorado and Denver University. It was in \ncommemoration of the Mapelli family who has given so much to the State \nof Colorado, and particularly to Denver University. It also \ncommemorates the fact that a number of years ago, in the World War II \nera, the Denver University Law School used to be adjacent to the \nMapelli Meat Market. A generation of Colorado attorneys took their \nlegal education within the sight and the sound, and even the smell, of \nthat meat market. Perhaps it even influenced those attorneys throughout \ntheir career.\n  The Mapelli family is typical, I think, of American families who have \ncontributed so much to this Nation. The Mapellis started their meat \nmarket in 1906 and, one by one, the brothers were drawn over from Italy \ncoming to this country, some as small children, literally coming on a \nboat with a name and a location pinned on their clothes, and they would \neventually find their way to Denver, CO.\n  Their story is a story of success for hard workers. To me, the \nMapelli Law School will also be a reminder of Sonny Mapelli. He is \nsomeone I worked for for many years, and his example of love and \ndevotion to community serves as an example for all Coloradans and, yea, \neven Americans, for what someone can accomplish when they love their \ncountry and love their community and make a project of serving it.\n  The Mapelli meat market used to be adjacent the Denver University \nCollege of Law when it was located in downtown Denver. A generation of \nattorneys received their legal education within the sound, sight, and \nsmell of the Mapelli meat market.\n  To me, the Mapelli Place will always call to mind Roland L. ``Sonny'' \nMapelli. Sonny passed away on January 19, 1995, but the memory of his \nwarmth and wisdom will stay with all who knew him.\n  Sonny and his brother, Gene, were owners-operators of Mapelli \nBrothers Co. which was founded by their father and his brothers in \n1906. In 1969 Mapelli Brothers Co. merged into Monfort of Colorado. \nUnder Sonny's direction, 50 Mapelli Food Distributing Co. branches were \noperated throughout the United States. Sonny was also owner-operator of \nMapelli Farms & Ranches.\n  Sonny was a faithful and devoted husband and father. He was devoted \nto his faith and believed in serving his community, State, and Nation. \nSonny also served on several boards ranging from Loretto Heights \nCollege in Denver to Colorado State University Land Council in Ft. \nCollins and Norwest Bank in Greeley. He was a member of the Colorado \nCattle Feeder's Association, Mountain/Plains Meat Association, and the \nNational Cattlemen's Association.\n  Sonny received numerous awards. He received the Knute Rockne Award \nfor outstanding civic achievement in 1961 as well as Who's Who in \nFinance and Industry in 1984. He was honored by the Colorado Meat \nDealers as Man of the Year in 1975; by the Longs Peak Council, Boys \nScouts of America as Weld Distinguished Citizen of 1994, along with \nmany other distinguished awards.\n  Sonny had a distinguished military career. He enlisted in the U.S. \nAir Force in August 1942. He subsequently served 3 years overseas with \nthe 8th Air Force, serving in the European Theater in Normandy, \nNorthern France, and the Rhineland campaigns. Sonny was commissioned a \nwarrant officer in London, England, in 1944. He received a Commendation \nfor Outstanding Achievements from the 8th Air Force commanding general. \nHe was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1945 and remained in the \nU.S. Air Force Reserve until 1955.\n  You could not see Sonny and not come away with a smile on your face. \nColorado voters loved him and elected him to the Denver City Council \nfrom 1955 to 1959. He was appointed to the State House of \nRepresentatives for 1961-62 and won election to the State Senate in \n1962 by the largest margin of anyone in Denver.\n  Sonny's remarkable success in business and politics came from his \ngenuine concern about others and a wonderful sense of humor. All who \ncame in contact with him felt a little better about themselves and the \nworld.\n  Everyone has their favorite Sonny story. They reflected his common \nsense, his love of others, and an extraordinarily humorous view of the \nworld. When you write out his stories, though, they lose something. It \nwas not so much the story itself that was funny, but Sonny Mapelli \nhimself. Without him those stories and perhaps our lives lack some of \nthe sparkle that makes life a joy.\n  Sonny Mapelli is survived by his wife Nomie, and daughters Terri \nDeMoney and Jerri Gustafson; by his grandchildren Travis, Tyler, and \nLindsey DeMoney, and Drew and Karly Gustafson; and by his brother, \nEugene Mapelli.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S 16656]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I want to extend warmest 80th \nbirthday wishes to a stalwart of the trade union movement--Moe Biller, \npresident of the American Postal Workers Union. Moe was born November \n5, 1915, in New York City, where he graduated with honors from Seward \nPark High School. After attending City College of New York, he served \nin the Army's Adjutant General Corps from 1943 to 1945.\n  He began his professional career as a postal clerk in New York City \nin 1937. After returning from the service, Moe recognized the strength \nand importance of the union. He became active in the New York area, \nwhere he was elected to many union positions of trust and leadership. \nAt various times, he has held virtually all leadership positions within \nhis own union, and has been elected to the executive council of the \nAFL-CIO, the organization's policy-setting body. He is also executive \nvice president of the AFL-CIO Public Employee Department.\n  In the military, the highest accolade that can be given to a \ncommanding officer is that he was a soldier's general. For his \nleadership, Moe Biller has been known as a member's leader.\n  In New York's sometimes tumultuous labor history, Moe never let his \nmembers down; and, in turn, they have always given him their confidence \nand support. He has not failed them at the bargaining table, and he has \nnever been afraid to lead. He has always been a strong, effective, \npowerful voice for working men and women. It was not always easy. \nRecognizing the winds of change, Moe was a key player in the committee \nthat brought the merger of five predecessor unions into what is now the \nAPWU.\n  Beyond dealing with employers, Moe Biller has also served the \ninterests of his members in the society at large and worked to extend \nthe reach of the union to those who were sometimes excluded. He has \nbeen active in many outreach organizations, especially Cornell \nUniversity's Trade Union Women Studies Program and the A. Philip \nRandolph Institute.\n  Moe has also gone beyond the union movement to serve others. Among \nthe numerous charitable organizations to which he has contributed his \nconsiderable talents are the Leukemia Society of America, the Muscular \nDystrophy Association, United Way International, and the Combined \nFederal Campaign.\n  As we wish Moe, his sons Michael and Steven and his wife Colee and \ndaughter Aleesa our best on his 80th birthday, we should all remember \nhe always went the extra mile for his members, his union, and his \ncountry. Happy birthday, Moe Biller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16656-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The permanent Record will be \ncorrected to reflect the following version.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me briefly remind everybody that a \nwhile back, when we were dealing with the budget resolution, 67 of us \nvoted not to cut more than $4 billion out of higher education. This \namendment would bring this level closer to where we in the Senate voted \nearlier this year to be--a $5 billion cut from the $10.8 billion. I \nremind my colleagues of that. I hate to see anybody be inconsistent \nwith their voting, and since 67 voted for something a little more \ndraconian than this, I hope Senators will stay with us on this \namendment.\n  Our amendment restores the 6-month grace period, eliminates the .85 \npercent institution fee, and lowers the interest rate on PLUS loans, \nreducing the Labor Committee's instruction from $10.85 billion over 7 \nyears to $5 billion.\n  Let me lay aside the issue of reducing education cuts for one quick \nmoment and explain why this amendment is so important. As I mentioned \njust a few moments ago, the amendment offered by my Democratic \ncolleagues restores direct lending to current law--or a transition to \n100 percent. I simply cannot support such a provision. I have always \nbeen a supporter of testing the direct lending program and am on record \nas opposing the Labor Committee's bill to limit it to 20 percent. \nTwenty percent in my view is too small, it cuts out schools that \ncurrently participate in the program, and that to me is wrong.\n  However, as I stated during debate of the 1993 reconciliation, I \nbelieve in a slow, implementation of direct lending. It should be \nundertaken thoughtfully and carefully. The amendment offered by my \nDemocratic colleagues is tantamount to a phase-in of direct lending. A \nphase-in suggests something very different than a thoughtful analysis \nof the two programs. My fear is that we have already made the decision \nto go full force without really looking at the advisability of such a \nmove. It is like saying ``ready, fire--and then aim''. For this reason \nI support a firm cap on direct lending. That cap, in my mind should be \nset at a point which protects the schools that are current participants \nand allows some room for growth. I suggest that number be set between \n30-40 percent.\n  Mr. President, that is not the amendment we are currently \nconsidering. I offered that suggestion to my colleagues as a bipartisan \napproach. Unfortunately, that amendment coupled with billions of \ndollars in additional student aid, was rejected by the Democrats and \ninterestingly also by groups purporting to represent higher education. \nIn particular the American Council on Education.\n  There is agreement that we must balance the budget and do so in a way \nthat protects students, parents, and institutions. That is what this \namendment does. It strikes the .85 percent institution fee, restores \nthe 6-month grace period, and eliminates the increase in the PLUS \ninterest rate. Support for this amendment will provide important \nsavings to these students, their parents, and institutions of higher \nlearning.\n  Eliminating the interest subsidy during the 6-month grace period \ncould increase the debt of an undergraduate who borrows the maximum \n$23,000 by almost $1,000, resulting in additional payments of nearly \n$1,400 over the life of the loan. For a graduate student who borrows \nthe maximum $65,500, the result would be $2,700 in additional debt and \nalmost $4,000 in additional payments. Raising the interest rate and the \ninterest rate cap on PLUS loans would increase the total payments of \nparents who borrow $20,000 for their children's education by $1,300.\n  It simply does not pay to cut education.\n  Consider the following: More highly educated workers not only earn \nmore, but they work and pay taxes longer than less educated workers. \nAccording to a recent study, between 1973 and 1993, median family \nincome dropped by over 20 percent for families headed by a person with \na high school diploma or less; but it held steady for those families \nheaded by someone with 4 years of college; and increased for families \nhead by someone with 5 years of college or more.\n  We need to encourage our young people to pursue higher education both \nto keep us competitive and to help balance the budget. Unfortunately, \nthe opportunity for individuals to go on to postsecondary education is \ngetting slimmer and slimmer. Pell grant awards have not kept pace with \ncollege costs. Students have had to increase borrowing in order to make \nup the difference. In 1985-86, the actual maximum Pell grant of $2,100 \npaid 58 percent of the total annual cost of attendance for a 4-year \npublic institution ($3,637). In 1993-94, the maximum Pell grant of \n$2,300 paid only 36 percent of the total cost ($6,454).\n  Because Federal grant programs have grown much more slowly than the \ncost \n\n[[Page S 16657]]\nof attending college, loans now (1994-95) account for 56 percent of all \nstudent aid, up from 49 percent in 1985-96.\n  Borrowing has skyrocketed in recent years to such an extent that the \namount borrowed through the FFEL program from 1990 to 1995 is greater \nthan the total amount borrowed from its inception in 1965 through 1989.\n  With such statistics it is no wonder that polls show more and more \nstudents and families deciding that college is simply out of their \nreach. In fact, close to 20 percent of students consider leaving school \nbecause of debt. Considering the impact on our economy and the future \nearning potential of individuals with a postsecondary degree, this \nstatistic is most disheartening.\n  So again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and tell the \nNation that the issue of education spending is a bipartisan issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16656-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A TRIBUTE TO BILL MOTT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to pay tribute \nto Bill Mott, a South Dakotan who has become one of our Nation's truly \ngreat horse trainers. Last weekend, at Belmont Park in New York, a \nthoroughbred bay named Cigar won the finale of the Breeders' Cup \nClassics. The finale was Cigar's 12th straight track victory. With that \nvictory, Cigar secured Horse of the Year honors, and is on track for \neven greater glory next year. Cigar could break the all-time record of \n16 consecutive track victories, which was done by the legendary \nCitation, and could surpass Alysheba as horse racing's all-time money \nwinner.\n  Of course, Cigar would not have achieved excellence on the track if \nit was not for the training excellence of Bill Mott. It was Bill who \nput Cigar on the path of greatness by switching the bay from grass \nracing to dirt. Though bred for grass, Cigar won only 1 race in 11 \nstarts on turf. Bill's move to dirt has moved Cigar to the ranks of the \nunbeaten.\n  For Bill Mott, his success as a horse trainer is nothing less than a \nchildhood dream come true. It was while he was in high school at Park \nJefferson in South Dakota that Bill Mott began his career as a horse \ntrainer. At the age of 16, Bill won the South Dakota Thoroughbred \nFuturity. After graduating high school, Bill left South Dakota to \npursue his dream. Bill learned from many great trainers, including Bob \nIrwin, Jack Van Berg and D. Wayne Lukas. Now, young, aspiring trainers \nno doubt will be seeking Bill out.\n  Today, Bill Mott is at the peak of his profession. Bill trains more \nthan 100 horses across the country. Bill is the best because he knows \nhow to bring out the best in the horses he trains. His record is proof: \nLast year, Bill's horses won 137 races; this year, his victory total \nreached 140.\n  Bill Mott is an inspiration not just to aspiring horse trainers, but \nto all who set their sites to be the very best in their profession. I \nam sure all who know Bill Mott, especially his friends and family back \nhome in South Dakota, are very proud of him. In fact, Bill's brother \nRob, a pilot who lives in Mobridge, SD, just returned to our State \nafter being with Bill during his latest achievements at the Breeders' \nCup Classics.\n  One of the best parts of my job is when I can speak of the great \naccomplishments of South Dakotans like Bill Mott. Through hard work and \ndetermination, Bill Mott is living a dream come true. My wife, Harriet, \nand I wish Bill Mott continued success in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16657-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16657-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16657-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following measure was read the second time and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 1833.

A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n   the senate campaign spending limit and election reform act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of \ngreat concern and importance to me, and I believe, to the integrity of \nour democratic system of Government: campaign finance reform.\n  I supported the legislation introduced and passed by this body in \n1993, and I came back to Washington in 1995 \n\n[[Page S 16658]]\nwith renewed commitment to pursuing meaningful reform of our Nation's \ncampaign finance laws.\n  Mr. President, I completed in November my 10th political campaign--10 \nof them. Three of them were very big. One was for Governor of the State \nof California, and two were for the U.S. Senate.\n  I would like to tell you what I raised in just those three campaigns: \nIn 1990, for Governor, $19,770,062; in 1992, $8,540,222; and in 1994, \n$14,407,179. That totals in three campaigns $42,231,463.\n  Mr. President, I am a walking, talking, case exhibit for campaign \nspending reform. And I would like to submit that the time has come for \nthe Senate and the House to rally to the challenge, and produce some \nlegislation which can reduce the impact and the need for fundraising \nand dollars in American political national House and Senate campaigns.\n  I supported the legislation introduced and passed by this body in \n1993. And I came back to Washington after this last campaign really \nwith a renewed commitment. I raised $14 million. My opponent outspent \nme by better than 22 to 1. That should not be the case for a U.S. \nSenate seat, even in a State as big as the State of California.\n  The bill I introduce today addresses what I believe are the areas \nmost in need of reform: curbing the astronomical amounts of money that \nflood campaigns today, creating a level playing field between wealthy \ncandidates who finance their own campaigns and candidates who cannot, \nand honesty in campaign advertising.\n  Among the bill's key provisions are:\n  Voluntary spending limits based on voting-age population;\n  Provisions relating to spending from personal funds and creating a \nlevel playing-field for their opponent; and\n  Disclosure requirements for political advertisements.\n\n\n                            spending limits\n\n  For almost 20 years now this Congress has studied and debated the \nissue of campaign spending reform. Last year in the Senate, we passed \nout a bill. It did not move forward in the House. During that time, \nthough, spending in Senate races has increased more than 500 percent \nwhile the cost of living has roughly doubled.\n  The last election cycle exemplifies the absurd levels campaign \nspending has reached. According to the Federal Election Commission, \ncongressional candidates in 1994 raised and spent over $724 million--\nthe highest amount ever recorded in any election cycle in the \nCommission's 20-year existence.\n  The fundraising pressure on candidates to meet ever-growing demand is \nenormous. I know it firsthand. It increases with every election cycle, \nand it clearly discourages otherwise qualified candidates from running.\n  So the legislation which I put forward today is very limited and very \nsimple. Not a lot of it is new. There are a few new twists. But it \nreally is combining three things that were presented before that I \nthink go to reduce spending, create that level playing field, and \nparticularly to reduce the inordinate costs of media.\n  Voluntary spending limits would be based on each State's voting age \npopulation ranging from a high of $8.2 million in a State like \nCalifornia to a low of $1.5 million in a smaller State like Wyoming.\n  The rules are the same as those that were sent out by the Rules \nCommittee in the Senate bill of last session.\n  In return for voluntarily controlling spending, a candidate receives \na bonus. This is the carrot to go along with the voluntary limit.\n  In return for voluntarily controlling spending, a candidate would be \nentitled to receive: 30 minutes of free broadcast time, a proposal \nwhich is based on a bill Senator Dole introduced in the 102d Congress; \na 50-percent discount on television time over and above the free time, \nand a reduced postage rate on two pieces of mail to each voting-age \nresident in their State.\n  These latter two benefits were in the bill passed by the Senate in \nthe last Congress.\n  Previous spending limit proposals have been seen as pro-incumbent \nmeasures and a barrier to challengers who have to spend more money to \ncompete against an incumbent with high name recognition.\n  This bill evens the playing field a little by making critical \nadvertising time available to challengers and incumbents alike--30 \nminutes of broadcast time free, and the rest at half the price.\n  With 30 to 40 cents of every dollar raised--sometimes well over \nhalf--going to media advertising, free media time and a 50-percent \nbroadcast discount rate will not only reduce campaign costs but will \nalso serve as a powerful incentive for candidates to agree to voluntary \nspending limits.\n\n\n                             personal funds\n\n  This legislation, which mirrors parts of the campaign finance bill \nintroduced by the majority leader, Senator Dole, in the last Congress, \nattempts to limit the ability of a wealthy candidate to buy a seat in \nCongress.\n  This is where the provisions are a little different than anything \nanybody has introduced prior. But let me say what they are.\n  Under this bill, after qualifying as a candidate for the primary, a \ncandidate must declare if he or she intends to spend more than $250,000 \nof their own funds in the election. If the candidate says, Yes, I am \ngoing to spend more than $250,000 of my own money in this election, \nthen the contribution limits on his or her opponent are raised from \n$1,000 to $5,000. If a candidate declares that he or she will spend \nmore than $1 million on the race from their own pocket, then the \ncontribution limit on his or her opponents are removed entirely.\n  As with my case, where somebody came forward and said, I will spend \n$30 million of my own--that still is disbelief to me to even say that \nhuge amount of my own money on this race--there is no way, no matter \nhow proven a fundraiser you are, that you can compete with that amount \nof money. This would enable an individual to compete because the \nspending limits are off of them.\n  I believe this requirement will minimize the advantage of enormous \npersonal wealth in campaigns, while maximizing the opponent's time to \npursue a campaign on the issues, rather than being caught in a \nquicksand of fundraising.\n  Let me speak for a moment about honesty in campaign advertising, \nwhich I really did not believe that we should deal with. I really \nthought that, well, campaigns are freewheeling. They are rough and \ntumble. I participated in very hard mayoral races, rough and tumble in \nSan Francisco. But I never saw the degree to which negative ads \npermeate the campaign spectrum as I did in the last campaign.\n  So honesty in campaign advertising is of great interest to me. I \nthink it is critically important to the voters who are now saying, \nwell, a pox on both their houses, and I do not believe any of them, as \nwe restore some level of credibility and respect to the political \nprocess. Honesty will do it. Honesty in campaign ads will go a long, \nlong way.\n  One issue of great concern to me and one that, I believe, is \ncritically important to restore some level of credibility and respect \nto the political process, is honesty in campaign advertising. In recent \nyears, the amount of negative advertising and personal attacks in \ncampaign ads has exploded. And all the experts are predicting in the \nnext set of races that it is going to get even worse. You see it \nbeginning to start with someone who may be a probable or possible \nPresidential candidate even before he gets into the race.\n  Campaigns that rely on unchecked character assassination--with no \nregard for the validity or truth of the charges--have contributed to \nunprecedented voter cynicism and apathy.\n  In the 1994 campaign, negative ads, groundless attacks on character, \ndistorted facts dragged political advertising to this new low. In my \ncampaign, at least two televisions stations and one radio station ran a \ndisclaimer before my opponent's ads in an attempt to absolve their \nstation of responsibility and liability for the content of the ads and \nnoting that the reason they ran the ads is because they were required \nby law to do so.\n  Campaign advertising has become a virtual arms race, and in some \ncases is based upon a deliberate strategy of alienating voters to \ndegrees voter turnout. The result again is this public turn-off, the \ncynicism, the pox on both your houses, and the enormous disaffection \npeople feel with political leaders and the political process itself.\n  Most of us would like but we are limited in our ability to curtail \nnegative \n\n[[Page S 16659]]\nadvertising because of first amendment considerations. We can hold \ncandidates and campaign committees more responsible for what they do or \nwe can individually just decide not to do it ourselves. I resolved not \nto do it myself, not to respond, and my poll numbers went like this. \nAnd when we did the focus groups, what we found was that the negatives \nblasted through and the positive credentials did not. People just did \nnot believe them. They tend to believe the negatives, but they would \nnot believe the positives. And that is a sad, sad case in American \npolitical affairs.\n\n  So what has happened--and I believe this is fairly typical across the \nUnited States--is campaign consultants are finding that the negative \nads blast through and the positive ads do not, so the tendency on an \nincreasing basis is to go to negative campaign advertising.\n  The provisions of my bill would set minimum standards for disclosure \nin print, on radio, and on television. The bill would require \ndisclaimers in TV ads to appear for at least 4 seconds with a \nreasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the \nprinted statement. It requires a clearly identifiable photograph or \nother image of the candidate if the ad is paid by a candidate or the \ncandidate's committee by the candidate, and the statement at the end of \nthe add by the candidate saying, ``This is Dianne Feinstein. I have \napproved the content of this ad.''\n  The thrust of this is to connect the responsibility between the \nconsultant who does the ad and the candidate whose campaign runs the \nad. After all, the candidate is eventually responsible.\n  The bill also would require sponsors of other advertisements such as \nindependent campaigns to indicate in a statement that they are \nresponsible for the veracity of the content of the ad.\n  Now, what is not contained in this bill? What is not contained in \nthis bill is public financing of campaigns. It is my belief that the \nAmerican people are not ready to accept public financing of campaigns. \nTax dollars are hard fought for, and that situation is not going to get \nbetter; it is going to get worse. Therefore, even a checkoff for public \nfinancing of campaigns I think is unworthy of the priorities that we \nface as legislators.\n  So there is no direct public financing in this legislation.\n  Some have opposed spending limits as contrary to the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Buckley versus Valeo which rejected mandatory limits unless \nthey are imposed--for example, in exchange for public benefits. This \nbill attempts to strike a balance called for in that decision by making \nthe spending limits voluntary and tying them to public benefits.\n  I supported initial campaign spending reform that would curb the \ninfluence of political action committees, and in the $14 million that I \nraised in the last campaign, about 16 percent was from political action \ncommittees. But I believe distinctions need to be made to protect small \ncontributors who pool their resources, share information, and involve \nthemselves in the process by supporting candidates or causes in which \nthey believe.\n  A blanket ban on all political action committees in a sense throws \nthe baby out with the bath water. I think we need to be encouraging \npeople to be involved in politics, not discouraging them. And virtually \nevery legal scholar I know who has examined this question believes that \na complete ban is unconstitutional.\n  The Congressional Research Service has advised the Senate:\n\n       A complete ban on contributions and expenditures by \n     connected and nonconnected PAC's appears to be \n     unconstitutional in violation of the first amendment.\n\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that campaign contributions and \nexpenditures are a form of political speech protected by the first \namendment to the United States Constitution. While the activities of \nsome political action committees certainly need to be scrutinized, \nothers give the small person, the ordinary person a voice in politics. \nThey allow many people who cannot afford to make only small \ncontributions to band together so that their voices can be heard. For \nthose PAC's whose practices violate the letter or intent of Federal \nelection law, the full weight of the FEC enforcement should be brought \nto bear. But I do not believe we should silence the voice of small \ncontributors in our efforts to curb the influence of big special \ninterest PAC's.\n  One example is the League of Conservation Voters. The average \ncontribution to their PAC is $40. Individually, these donors cannot \ntake out ads supporting environmental legislation or candidates. But by \npooling their resources, they can purchase an ad announcing their \nsupport. Surely this is not the type of political influence that \nwarrants an outright ban on political action committees. Yet, other \nlegislation being considered by this body would do just that. And that \nis where I split.\n  I was encourage when President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich agreed to \nset up a bipartisan commission to study and perhaps finally act on \ncampaign finance reform. But apparently that agreement seems to have \nsince become bogged down with political baggage. This issue has been \nstudied and studied and studied not only by this Congress for 20 years \nbut by a bipartisan commission whose recommendations were made to the \nCongress in 1990.\n  I think it is time for Congress to act. And what we have tired to do \nin this legislation is take concepts that have stood the test of time, \nput them together in a limited package of three major areas where I \nbelieve there is a consensus in both political bodies and around which \nI think there can be forged no real opposition that is credible and \nworthy to taking these three steps as a first and meaningful step in \ncampaign spending reform.\n  So I submit the legislation, and I welcome the discussion and the \ndebate.\n  I thank the forbearance of the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \npermit a private person against when a civil or administrative penalty \nis assessed to use the amount of the penalty to fund a community \nenvironment project, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n          the local environmental improvement facilitation act\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow companies that violate the Clean Water Act the option to invest \nfines in improving their local environment. This bill makes good sense. \nClean Water Act fines could be invested in the community where the \nviolation occurred, rather than sent to Washington to be spent by \nbureaucrats.\n  In May 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency began a new program \nto encourage local environmental projects through EPA fines. My bill \nwould adopt as law the goals of this program--to give Clean Water Act \nviolators the option to perform community services by targeting their \nfines to local pollution prevention and remediation activities.\n  Under my legislation, companies found guilty of violating the Clean \nWater Act would be given the option of contributing to a community \nenvironmental project in lieu of paying fines directly to the Treasury. \nViolators could negotiate with State and local officials to determine \nan appropriate project. The money would then be paid by the violator \ndirectly to cover project costs.\n  The benefits to this legislation are clear. Passage of this bill \nwould express Congress' support for local environmental projects. In \naddition, this legislation represents community empowerment. It gives \nthe local community the opportunity to right a wrong done to its \ncitizens by one of its own. It is common sense. Clean Water Act \nviolations inadvertently can punish the community where the violation \noccurred. It's only fair that when a violator is punished, the \ncommunity should receive some compensation. This option certainly is \npreferable to sending penalty dollars back to Washington to pay for \nmore bureaucracy.\n\n  At the State and local level, many of those who violate the law are \ndirected to perform community service. That tradition deserves a place \nin our Federal system as well. The legislation I am introducing today \nwould do just that.\n\n[[Page S 16663]]\n\n  Senator Chafee, chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, has stated his intent to hold hearings on efforts to reform \nthe Clean Water Act in the near future. I look forward to working with \nhim to make sure that fines collected under the Clean Water Act can \ncontinue to be used for the benefit of the community where violations \noccurred. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1391. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nprohibit the imposition of any civil or administrative penalty against \na unit of local government for a violation of the act when a compliance \nplan with respect to the violation is in effect, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 CLEAN WATER ACT PENALTIES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nlift the unfair burden of excessive regulatory penalties from the backs \nof local governments that are working in good faith to comply with the \nClean Water Act.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year we worked on legislation to bring \ncommon sense to the regulatory process. That legislation is still \npending. It is my hope that we will return to that bill and pass it. \nEveryone from small business persons to city mayors want real relief \nfrom Federal regulatory overreach. That is the goal of my bill as well.\n  Under current law, civil penalties begin to accumulate the moment a \nlocal government violates the Clean Water Act. Once this happens, the \nlaw requires that the local government present a municipal compliance \nplan for approval by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency [EPA], or the Secretary of the Army in cases of section 404 \nviolations. However, even after a compliance plan has been approved, \npenalties continue to accumulate. In effect, existing law gives the EPA \nthe authority to continue punishing local governments while they are \ntrying to comply with the law.\n\n  When I talk with South Dakotans, few topics raise their blood \npressure faster than their frustrating dealings with the Federal \nbureaucracy. Government is supposed to work for us, not against us. Mr. \nPresident, this is clearly a case where the Government is working \nagainst those cities and towns trying in good faith to comply with the \nClean Water Act.\n  In South Dakota, the city of Watertown's innovative/alternative \ntechnology wastewater treatment facility was built as a joint \npartnership with the EPA, the city and the State of South Dakota in \n1982. The plant was constructed with the understanding that EPA would \nprovide assistance in the event the new technology failed. The facility \nwas modified and rebuilt in 1991 when it was unable to comply with \nClean Water Act discharge requirements. Unfortunately, the newly \nreconstructed plan still was found to violate Federal regulations. The \ncity now faces a possible lawsuit by the Federal Government and is \nincurring fines of up to $25,000 per day.\n  The city of Watertown, under the very capable guidance of Mayor \nBrenda Barger, has entered into a municipal compliance plan with the \nEPA. Under the agreed plan, Watertown should achieve compliance by \nDecember 1996. However, that plan does not address the issue of the \ncivil and administrative penalties that continue to accumulate against \nthe city.\n\n  Under the law, Watertown could accumulate an additional $14 million \nin penalties before its treatment facility is able to comply with the \nClean Water Act requirements.\n   Mr. President, no city in South Dakota can afford such steep \npenalties.\n  My legislation would offer relief to cities like Watertown. Under my \nbill, local governments would stop accumulating civil and \nadministrative penalties once a municipal compliance plan has been \nnegotiated and the locality is acting in good faith to carry out the \nplan. Further, my bill would be an incentive for governments to move \nquickly toward achieving compliance with the Clean Water Act.\n  This legislation is designed simply to address an issue of fairness. \nLocal governments must operate with a limited pool of resources. \nLocalities should not be forced to devote their tax revenues both to \npenalties and programs designed to comply with the law. It defies \ncommon sense for the EPA to penalize a local government at the same \ntime it is working in good faith to comply with the law. My legislation \nrestores common sense and fairness to local governments. By eliminating \nunfair penalties, local governments could better concentrate their \nresources to meet the intent of the law in protecting our water \nresources from pollution.\n   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \ncommonsense legislation for our towns and cities.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1392. A bill to impose temporarily a 25-percent duty on imports of \ncertain Canadian wood and lumber products, to require the administering \nauthority to initiate an investigation under title VII of the Tariff \nAct of 1930 with respect to such products, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      emergency timber legislation\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to give \nour timber industry emergency relief in the face of a surge of \nsubsidized lumber imports from Canada.\n  I have said before that when it comes to trade Canada does not play \nfor the love of the game. Canada plays rough. Canada plays to win. \nCanada plays hardball.\n  You see that in fisheries, wheat, beer, intellectual property, and \nmaybe most of all in timber. And if the game is hardball, we have to \nput on our helmets, pick up our bats and show that we can play too.\n\n\n                       provisions of legislation\n\n  That is what my bill will do. It contains three tough but fair \nmeasures:\n  First, temporary duty: We impose a temporary 25-percent tariff on \nCanadian lumber. This figure is based on the best estimates of the \nvalue of Canadian subsidies to Canadian timber exporters.\n  Second, countervailing duty investigation: We direct the Department \nof Commerce to investigate Canadian subsidization. At the end of the \ninvestigation, the temporary duty would be lifted.\n  If Commerce finds subsidization and damage to U.S. industry, the \nInternational Trade Commission would impose a permanent countervailing \nduty at a level appropriate to the damage. If the investigation were to \nfind no subsidy, Commerce would refund the money collected under the \ntemporary duty. Likewise, if the damage were under 25 percent, the \ndifference would be refunded to Canada.\n  Third, renegotiate dispute settlement panels: We declare that no \nAmerican judicial function or authority can be delegated to an \ninternational body under any trade agreement and give the President \nauthority to renegotiate the so-called chapter 19 dispute settlement \npanels of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and NAFTA.\n  The general effect of this would be to eliminate the jurisdiction of \ninternational dispute settlement panels over our countervailing duty \ndecisions. In the specific case of timber, it would repeal the 1992, \n1993, and 1994 decisions of the United States-Canada dispute panels \nwhich have barred us from using our countervailing laws against \nsubsidized Canadian softwood lumber exports.\n  Now, some will say, ``Max, gee, that is pretty tough.'' I agree. \nSometimes tough measures are necessary. That is because today we face a \nsurge of imported timber which has depressed prices, closed mills, and \nput Americans out of work.\n  The first two sections of this legislation respond to this crisis in \na reasonable, fair way. We have the right to emergency relief under our \ndomestic laws, and all our trade agreements so provide. This is a case \nwhere we definitely need it.\n  The third section responds to the longer term, but equally grave \nproblem with the decisions dispute panels have made on United States-\nCanada timber disputes. Again, it does so in a tough but limited way. \nSo, yes, this is tough but it is also fair.\n  Now, let me explain the situation and my proposed response in more \ndetail. We will begin with the facts and figures \n\n[[Page S 16664]]\non the immediate crisis, the Canadian subsidies and the import surge \nthey have created.\n  Our bill deals with two forms of subsidies. The first is the \nextremely low stumpage fees the Canadian provinces charge for logging \non their public land. Do not forget almost all the land in Canada on \nwhich timber is harvested is public land, called Crown land--the land \nowned by the provinces: very low stumpage; timber sale, very low, low \nprices.\n  The other subsidy is Canada's ban on all export of raw logs, which \nlowers the price of logs in Canada's market and gluts Canadian mills.\n  Some have a broader definition of subsidy. The Raincoast Conservation \nSociety, a Canadian environment group based in Victoria, BC, says.\n\n       * * * low stumpage rates, unsustainable rates of timber \n     cutting, inadequate environmental controls, and the continued \n     destruction of natural habitat constitute a massive network \n     of public subsidies to the British Columbia timber industry.\n\n  Canada's timber practices have created an environmental disaster. \nBritish Columbia, for example, requires neither sustainable forestry; \nwe do. Nor environmental assessments of forest practices; we do. It has \nminimal riparian protection; we have a lot. Allows clearcuts up to four \ntimes what is legal in the United States and requires no protection of \nendangered species and habitat.\n  Compare that with our Endangered Species Act. It gives the public \nvirtually no role in forest management. Think of all the appeals and \nall the private rights of action we have in our country. If you take a \nboat up the coast of Washington State, you can literally see the border \nbecause Canadians have cut right down to the shore.\n  Our bill defines subsidies much more narrowly. All by themselves, the \nartificially low-stumpage rates on the ban on raw log exports have \ncaused a trade disaster as profound as the environmental disaster in \nBritish Columbia.\n  Imports of Canadian lumber have risen 121 percent since 1991, from \n$2.56 billion to $5.65 billion last year. During this period, Canada's \nshare of the American lumber market rose from 27 percent to 36 percent.\n  Mr. President, 36 percent of all the softwood timber consumed in the \nUnited States is Canadian. Last year we imported more than 16 billion \nboard feet of timber; 3 billion board miles of softwood timber. That is \nenough to build a wooden bridge to the Moon 12.5 feet wide.\n  By comparison, we sold Canada about .3 of a billion board feet of \nlumber. That is a fiftieth of Canada's exports.\n  Canada's subsidies vastly inflate our imports of timber. We estimate \nthat they cost American timber companies about $829 million last year \nand cost American workers 25,100 jobs.\n  This is an emergency. Every mill worker and mill operator in Montana \ncan tell you the pressure from these subsidies is intolerable and the \nsituation is getting worse all the time. That is the reason for part 1 \nof the bill, the temporary duty, and also for part 2, under which the \nCommerce Department will investigate Canadian timber practices and \narrive at a long-term countervailing duty.\n  Now, let us turn to part 3. That is renegotiation of the application \nof the dispute settlement panels established in chapter 19 of the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to our domestic \ncountervailing duty or CVD decisions. To start, we need to review a bit \nof history.\n  During the drafting of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement \nin the 1980's, a Canadian negotiator told the American side:\n\n       You must understand that the Canadian people are committed \n     to helping their industries that cannot compete. Our \n     Constitution requires that funds be transferred to assist \n     companies in noncompetitive locations to compete in \n     international trade.\n\n  That is to say, in areas where free trade means a competitive United \nStates industry will do well, Canada will subsidize its own industry to \ndo its best to make sure that we cannot do well.\n  This sort of practice is, for obvious reasons, the most controversial \nissue we considered when the Reagan administration negotiated the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement in the 1980's. The Canadians, \nas was their right, refused to change their subsidy policies, but they \nalso asked us to guarantee that we, Americans, would not use our \ncountervailing duties laws against their subsidies.\n  Obviously, that was unacceptable. A free trade agreement which let \nCanada subsidize exports, while we gave up our right to combat the \nsubsidies of domestic trade laws, would not be a free trade agreement \nat all. It would have been an agreement to give Canada a captive \nmarket, and we would have opposed it.\n  So we essentially agreed to disagree. Canada did not give up its \nsubsidies and neither did we give up our trade laws. We agreed that the \nUnited States would continue to settle subsidy disputes through our \ndomestic CVD laws. That is, dispute settlement panels setting up in the \nagreement's so-called chapter 19 would be available to Canada in these \ncases only to make sure that we had properly used our laws. That was \nthe only point of that provision.\n  That was fine in theory. Unfortunately, at least in the timber case, \nit has not worked very well in practice. The past 10 years of this \ndispute have gone as follows.\n  On December 30, 1986, Canada and the United States signed, agreed to \na joint memorandum of understanding on softwood lumber, under which \nCanada agreed to charge its timber companies a 15-percent export tax to \nmake up for the value subsidies. Canada agreed.\n  In September 1991, 5 years later, Canada unilaterally abrogated this \nmemorandum of understanding--just walked away from it, threw it in the \ntrash bin. On October 1991, a month later, the Commerce Department \nopened up, as we obviously should have done, an investigation of the \nCanadian lumber subsidies.\n  In June 1992, this legislation ended with a finding that the \nsubsidies damage the American industry. The ITC imposed countervailing \nduties, as is our right and is what we really should have done and did \ndo.\n  Canada then challenged this finding at the dispute panels set up \nunder chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. \nLater in 1992, and in appeal decisions in 1993 and 1994, the panels \nsplit along national lines and upheld Canada's cases. In each one, \nCanada had a majority of judges. There were more Canadian judges than \nAmerican judges. At least two of the judges had serious conflicts of \ninterest and one had even worked for the Canadian timber industry. In \neach case they all voted as a bloc to deny justice to the U.S. \nindustry.\n  The last of these cases, our appeal to the Extraordinary Challenge \nCommittee, which decided in the spring of 1994. Judge Malcolm Wilkey \nwas the only American panelist and he describes the decision this way:\n\n       The Panel started, of course, by giving us the litany of \n     the standard of review of administrative agency action as \n     enunciated in United States law, all thoroughly familiar. The \n     Panel then preceded to violate almost every one of those \n     canons of review of agency action * * *. This Binational \n     Panel Majority opinion may violate more principles of \n     appellate review of agency action than any opinion by a \n     reviewing body I have ever read.\n\n  That is the opinion of the American panelists--the only American \npanelists; the rest are Canadian. As Wilkey says, ``The panel reached \negregiously wrong results.'' Those are his words. It was allowed to \nreview only whether we applied our CVD laws as the United States Code \nrequires. That is what we were supposed to do.\n  Instead, the panel declared our laws should not apply at all. That is \nwhat the panel said, totally above and beyond its jurisdiction. The \npanel had no right to make that decision, but it made it. Under the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, the panel has no right to \nmake such decision, yet the Canadian majority went ahead and did it \nanyway. Worst of all, have been the concrete real results of these \ndecisions.\n  Since 1993, imports of Canadian timber have skyrocketed. The price of \nlumber has fallen by more than a third. Mills have closed in Superior, \nLibby, Bonner, and elsewhere in Montana, putting hundreds of good folks \nout of work. The same thing has happened all over America.\n  Our timber workers have been cheated, cheated by the dispute panels. \nThere is no other word for it. We need to make sure nobody else suffers \nthe same injustice. \n\n[[Page S 16665]]\n\n  Since Canada refuses to a fair settlement through negotiation, I see \nno alternative other than to remove the cause of the trouble.\n  Now, these are tough measures, but if your partner is playing hard \nball, you need more than a golfing cap and a whiffle bat, you need a \nhard plastic helmet and Louisville slugger. You need tough measures \nlike the ones my bill will provide.\n  I say let us stand up, restore fairness in the timber market, let us \ngive a hand to some workers who have suffered grave injustice. I ask \nsupport for my bill, which I think, once enacted, we can restore the \nplaying field so it is fair and give people in our country the justice \nthey deserve.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself and Mr. Simon):\n  S. 1393. A bill to extend the deadline for commencement of \nconstruction of a hydroelectric project in the State of Illinois; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   hydroelectric project legislation\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing \ntoday, on behalf of myself and Senator Simon, grants the city of Alton, \nIL, a 6-year extension of its Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n[FERC] license to begin construction of a hydroelectric power project \nnext to lock and dam 26R on the Mississippi River. This extension is \nnecessary because the Alton license expired October 15, 1995.\n\n  A license to permit construction for this proposed plant was first \nissued by FERC to the Missouri Joint Municipal Electric Utility \nCommission [MJMEUC] on October 15, 1987. MJMEUC transferred the license \nto the city of Alton with FERC approval on April 5, 1990. At the time \nof the transfer, the city of Alton entered into an agreement with Sithe \nEnergies, a developer, which was granted a licensing extension pursuant \nto the Federal Power Act and Public Law No. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, \nsection 1075 (b) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct of 1991.\n  Between 1990 and 1995, Sithe Energies developed plans for a \nhydroelectric plant. However, there were several problems with its \nproposal. Sithe Energies was depending on State subsidies to support \nthe estimated $190 million cost of the plant. The Illinois General \nAssembly did not provide those subsidies. Further, Sithe Energies was \nunable to comply with several FERC license requirements. For example, \nSithe was unable to meet the FERC requirement for a fish mortality \nstudy. The proposed plant could have had a substantial effect on fish \nand other aquatic life in the Mississippi. Finally, due to the high \nrate per kilowatt hour that would be required to retire the debt that \nwould be associated with the project and provide an attractive return \non investment, Sithe Energies was unable to negotiate a purchase and \nsale agreement for the plant's electricity.\n  In May 1995, Sithe Energies terminated its relationship with the city \nof Alton. Subsequently, the city was contacted by Bedford Energies with \na new plan that happens to be more economically feasible. Bedford \nEnergies is proposing a smaller plant, using turbines that move more \nslowly and which should therefore reduce the plant's impact on fish and \naquatic life in the Mississippi. The cost of the project is estimated \nto be $110 million--much less than the Sithe Energies' project. The \nprojected costs per kilowatt hour is approximately one-half of Sithe's \nestimates.\n  The city of Alton and the River Bend area have been hit hard by plant \nclosings and the loss of manufacturing jobs over the past 20 years. \nDuring the 1980's, Alton alone lost nearly 4,000 jobs. Alton's per \ncapita income is significantly below the State of Illinois' average per \ncapita income and, since 1970, Alton's population has declined from \n39,700 to 33,064 residents. Alton's unemployment rate currently exceeds \n9 percent and has consistently exceeded State and national averages. \nOne-hundred to one-hundred fifty jobs are expected to be created during \nthe 2- or 3-year construction phase of this project, and 6 to 12 \npermanent power plant operator jobs will be created once the plant is \noperational. The royalties from power sales will provide revenue to the \ncity for capital improvements and other needed city projects which \nimpact employment.\n  Lock and dam 26R on the Mississippi was designed and constructed for \na hydroelectric plant. Because of the difficulties the city experienced \nwith Sithe Energies, there was simply no way that construction could \nhave begun in accordance with the schedule anticipated by the current \nlicense. This FERC license extension is a reasonable proposition for \nthe residents of Alton who are counting on this project. Mr. President, \nthis type of license extension has precedent in previous congressional \naction, and it is my hope that the Congress can move this \nnoncontroversial bill forward as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1393\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION DEADLINE \n                   FOR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT IN THE STATE OF \n                   ILLINOIS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified \n     in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that \n     would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission project numbered 3246, the Commission shall, at \n     the request of the licensee for the project, in accordance \n     with the good faith, due diligence, and public interest \n     requirements of that section and the Commission's procedures \n     under that section, extend until October 15, 2001, the time \n     period during which the licensee is required to commence \n     construction of the project.\n       (b) Applicability.--Subsection (a) shall take effect on the \n     expiration of the extension, issued by the Commission under \n     section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806), of the \n     period required for commencement of construction of the \n     project described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the license for \n     the project described in subsection (a) has expired prior to \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall \n     reinstate the license effective as of the date of its \n     expiration and extend until October 15, 2001, the time \n     required for commencement of construction of the \n     project.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMPSON:\n  S. 1394. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nreform the legal immigration of immigrants and nonimmigrants to the \nUnited States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   THE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I have stood before my good colleagues so \nmany times over the last 15 years seeking their support for reform of \nthe immigration laws of our country. Today I do so once again, and this \ntime the proposed change is fundamental.\n  The bill I am introducing today is the product of many years. It \nwould reform the law relating to legal immigration--to reduce the level \nand to revise the criteria of selection. Many of the proposals are \nconsistent with recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Immigration \nReform and its very able Chairwoman, that remarkable and impressive \nwoman, former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. She and a bipartisan group \nof people put together some very important recommendations for us. The \nmembers of the Commission were appointed by the Speaker, by the \nRepublicans, by the Democrats, by the majority leader, the minority \nleader. I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       Members of the Commission\n\n       Barbara Jordan, Chair.\n       Lawrence H. Fuchs, Vice Chair.\n       Michael S. Teitelbaum, Vice Chair.\n       Richard Estrada.\n       Harold Ezell.\n       Robert Charles Hill.\n       Warren R. Leiden.\n       Nelson Merced.\n       Bruce A. Morrison.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. They are wonderful, contributing members of this \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, there are those in this country, including some in \nthis body, who eternally say, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' I \nhave heard that old, tired canard too many times. They assert that the \npresent immigration-related problems of this country relate entirely to \nillegal immigrants, to the failure to prevent rampant violation of \nimmigration law--not only by the hundreds of thousands per year who \ncross this border illegally, but also by a perhaps equal number of \npersons who \n\n[[Page S 16666]]\nenter legally on temporary visas, and then remain here even after their \napproved period of stay has expired.\n  Mr. President, illegal immigration is, indeed, a major problem, and I \nintroduced legislation earlier this year which would greatly improve \nour ability to combat that. In June, that bill, S. 269, was favorably \nreported out of the Immigration Subcommittee, which I have the honor to \nchair.\n  Perhaps the most important element of that bill is its proposed \nenhancement of the employer sanction system that is so necessary if we \nare ever to control both forms of illegal immigration, visa overstays, \nas well as illegal border crossing. The employer sanction system has \nbeen left incomplete and ineffective in the years since enactment of \nthe 1986 immigration reform bill, because expected improvements in the \nsystem that is used to verify work authorization have never been made. \nS. 269 would require a series of pilot programs and within 8 years a \nfinal verification system. This system would be used not only for \nemployment but for welfare or any other form of public assistance.\n  The proposals for an improved verification system have been \ncontroversial. Ironically, I point out to my colleagues that anyone \ngetting on an airplane in the United States in the last 3 weeks has \nbeen asked to present a picture ID of themselves. I have not seen much \nmedia squawk about that, or any concerned and high-emotion editorials \nabout the ``slippery slope,'' or threats to our privacy or civil \nliberties. Perhaps it was partly because no Federal card was involved. \nYet, even when the President held up before the joint session of \nCongress 2 years ago a card and said, ``This is a health care card and \neveryone will have one,'' not much was said about ``the card'' then--a \ngreat deal about health care but not much about ``the card.''\n  Maybe it was also because such actions have to do with their personal \ninterest and their health and safety.\n  In any case, the system I favor would involve no ``national ID \ncard,'' no new card of any kind--just improvements in various ID and \nother systems that are already in use. I refer to telephone \nverification of a Social Security number--a service already available \nto employers--plus improvements in the State driver's license or ID \ncard, and in the birth certificate. That would be it. I honestly do not \nbelieve the American people have any reason for concern, and I honestly \ndo not believe that they will be concerned, else we would have heard a \nlittle bit about that in these past weeks with what is happening to \nthem at each and every airport in this country.\n  But, Mr. President, curbing or even stopping illegal immigration is \nnot enough. Why do I say this? A major reason is that the American \npeople are increasingly troubled about the impact legal immigration is \nhaving on their country. Poll after poll shows us this.\n  The people have made it so very clear they believe the level of \nimmigration is too high. The people have been saying more or less the \nsame thing for a very long time.\n  According to a recent article in the American Enterprise, which \nreviewed 11 major polls taken since 1955, well over 60 percent of the \nAmerican people favor a reduction in immigration, according to most \npolls since 1980--and that has always included legal immigration \nwhenever it was specifically asked about.\n  Yet, what do people see going on, year after year after year? They \nsee steady increases. In 1953, 170,000 new legal immigrants. In 1963, \n306,000; 1973, 400,000; 1983, 560,000; in 1993, 904,000. Thus, in these \n40 years since 1953, the annual level of new immigrants has gone up \nfivefold, rising from 170,000 to 904,000.\n  The American people have become increasingly restless and \ndissatisfied at seeing their will ignored. Proposition 187 may be only \nthe first of many indicators of their real displeasure.\n  Mr. President, there are individuals and groups who are actively and \nobsessively working against the efforts of those of us here and in the \nother body--and on the Commission on Immigration Reform--who are all \ndoing our level best to develop and enact into law an immigration \npolicy that will better promote the long-term best interests of this \nentire Nation. These individuals and groups form an unholy alliance \ncomposed of, one, those wanting to preserve the historically high \ncurrent level of immigration and all aspects of current law which \nenable a person to bring to this country extended family members, not \neven part of the nuclear family--a nuclear family being spouses and \nminor children--joined with, two, certain employers who want to avoid \npaying wages high enough to attract U.S. workers, or to preserve their \n``right'' to bring in the employee they really want, notwithstanding \nthe impact on any U.S. workers.\n  I submit that we must break through all of this clatter. We must not \nallow these defenders of the status quo to deter us from the national \ninterest-based policy the American people so deeply want--and deserve.\n  Now, I have recently read that one in the other body claimed that to \nreduce legal immigration is to ``punish legal immigrants'' for the \nactions of the illegals. That is surely quite an extraordinary claim. \nTo use the word ``punish'' in this way is another fine example of \nrhetorical exuberance--not uncommon around this village, of course. \nBut, still, let us try to keep at least one foot on the ground.\n  No one has the ``right'' to immigrate to the United States. Hear \nthat. There are apparently hundreds of millions who would like to do \nso, but none of them has any ``right'' to do so. For the citizens of \nthis country and their legislators to decide to reduce the level of \nlegal immigration is not to ``punish'' anybody. ``Punishment'' is \nsomething imposed because of a judgment that the punished person has \ndone ``something wrong.'' It is most usually meted out with an intent \nto encourage more acceptable behavior.\n  The issue involved in legal immigration reform is not whether \nindividual aliens abroad, who would like to be legal immigrants--or \neven aliens who have already succeeded in becoming legal immigrants--\nhave done anything ``blameworthy.'' It is simply that the annual \naddition of 800,000 new residents, including hundreds of thousands of \nnew workers, has some major consequences--and some of these \nconsequences are ones the American people simply and clearly do not \nwant. No mystery here; no evil reasoning.\n  Taking it as a given that a majority of the American people believe \nthat immigration, under current law, has consequences which are harmful \nto their interests, it is appropriate that they demand change. And that \nis exactly what they are doing: demanding change--not punishment--but \nchange.\n  Mr. President, the American people are so very fed up with being \ntold--when they want immigration laws enacted which they believe will \nserve their national interest and when they also want the law to be \nenforced--that they are being cruel and mean-spirited and racist. They \nare fed up with the efforts to make them feel that Americans do not \nhave that most fundamental right of any people: to decide who will join \nthem here and help form the future country in which they and their \nposterity will live.\n  We must not allow ourselves to be distracted by these \nwretched rhetorical excesses and the confused non sequiturs and the \nbabble used by so many of the opponents of the direly needed reform. \nLet us focus our attention always on the main issue: What will promote \nthe best interest of the entire Nation.\n\n  We are so fortunate in having the substantial assistance in our \nefforts of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, who have worked \nso diligently and so well to produce their recommendations on changes \nto be made to the system of legal immigration. Their ideas have been of \nimmense help to me. As I describe my bill, I will refer frequently to \ntheir well-founded and thoughtful recommendations.\n  We are also most fortunate in having such talented and dedicated \nlegislators working in a consistent, bipartisan fashion in the other \nbody, the House of Representatives--especially my friends, Lamar Smith \nand John Bryant. The steady, patient, and fair way they have proceeded \nin the processing of a bill under the chairmanship of Senator Henry \nHyde--a lovely friend of many years--is something we would do well to \nkeep in mind as we go forward with our work here. I and my immigration \nsidekick here in the Senate, Senator Ted Kennedy, will heed their \nlessons. \n\n[[Page S 16667]]\n\n  Mr. President, the people are demanding change--and soon--and they \nare so right.\n  Most immigration to our United States is of a legal nature and, thus, \nmany of the impacts the people find most troubling are due to legal \nimmigration.\n  For too many U.S. workers, the impact of immigration includes adverse \naffects on their own wages and individual job opportunities.\n  At this time--when major U.S. employers like IBM, AT, and GM are \nlaying off workers by the tens of thousands, when the defense industry \nhas undergone a major downsizing, when we read of the difficulty so \nmany young American college graduates are facing in finding a job in \ntheir own field--we must then reconsider some of the increases that we \nauthorized in 1990, before so many of these events had occurred and \nwhen certain experts were predicting to us shortages of scientists and \nengineers, shortages that would not have occurred even if the 1990 \nincreases in immigration had not come about.\n  The current major reform of the Nation's welfare system, which we \nwill complete this session, is another reason why we must revise the \npresent system. It is expected that these reforms will add large \nnumbers of unskilled workers to the labor market. That is how the law \nwill read: ``After 2 years on welfare, if you are able bodied, you will \nwork.'' As a result, it is increasingly inappropriate for U.S. \nemployers to be able to continue to petition for unskilled or low-\nskilled workers. That adversely affects the job opportunities and wages \nof the least-advantaged U.S. workers.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today contains new and lower \nlimits on immigration; and assigns a ``higher priority'' to immigrants \nwith skills and other characteristics that are consistent with the \nneeds of the entire Nation--rather than primarily the needs or wishes \nof those abroad who would wish to come to this country, or the fraction \nof our own population who wish to bring in their relatives or who want \nto employ foreign workers.\n  Mr. President, in 1990 the level of legal immigration was increased \nsubstantially, by 37 percent. This was done partly because Congress and \nthe President believed that the 1986 immigration reform law had \ninstituted workable measures--including sanctions against employers who \nknowingly employ illegal aliens--that would greatly reduce illegal \nimmigration. Unfortunately, the belief was overly optimistic. As a \nresult, total immigration--legal plus illegal--had been in excess of 1 \nmillion per year.\n  For this reason--and because the American people so clearly want it--\nthe annual level of legal immigration to the United States must--at \nleast for the time being--be significantly reduced.\n  The bill I am introducing today would reduce the annual level of \nregular nonrefugee legal immigration from 675,000 to about 540,000. \nThis would include 90,000 employment-related immigrants, plus 450,000 \nfamily immigrants--composed of 300,000 of the ``nuclear family,'' that \nis, spouse and minor children citizens and permanent residents, and \n150,000 per year to reduce the backlog of spouses and unmarried minor \nchildren of permanent residents who are already eligible to come here.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleagues should be aware that most \nother bills in this area introduced in this Congress and in the last \nCongress have proposed nonrefugee totals much lower than mine. Most \nhave proposed 300,000, or even less.\n  Now, I do know that some do find the constant talk about numbers to \nbe quite distasteful, but I sense that many who feel this way are not \nin very close touch with the American people--who observe firsthand \njust how much these ``numbers'' mean to conditions in the heavily \nimpacted areas of this country. Yes, the issue of ``numbers'' is an \nessential element of the problem and the people will not let us forget \nthat.\n  Yes, I know full well that the numbers represent human beings--human \nfaces--and that to reduce immigration because it is in the interest of \nthe entire Nation, nevertheless has its cost. And this cost may, \nindeed, involve many fine individuals in many places outside of this \ncountry giving up their dreams of a lifetime. This is not easy for us, \nand that is why we must keep focused always on the ultimate issue of \nwhat will promote the long-term best interests of the American people--\nthose of us here.\n  It is time to slow down, to reassess, to make certain that we are \nassimilating well the extraordinary level of immigration the country \nhas been experiencing in recent years. Yes, I say ``assimilating.'' \nBarbara Jordan uses that term, too. That should not be a ``politically \nincorrect'' term. Terms like ``assimilation\" and ``Americanization'' \nshould not be ``politically incorrect.''\n  Mr. President, my bill also proposes major reform of the criteria for \nselecting immigrants, including both family-sponsored and employment-\nbased immigrants.\n  The bill would reserve family-sponsored immigration for those most \nlikely actually to be living with the relatives in the United States \nwith whom they are in theory being ``reunited.''\n  Mr. President, in 1965 the United States adopted an immigration law \nthat was primarily oriented toward family reunification. With some \nmodifications, this emphasis has continued ever since.\n  The policy has not been limited to reunification of the closest \nfamily members, those most likely to actually llive together in the \nUnited States; that is, spouses and unmarried minor children: what is \ncalled the ``nuclear family''--the family unit the American people \nbelieve is most conducive to the raising of healthy, productive, and \nhappy children.\n  No, the current policy has also given preference to adult or married \nchildren, parents, and brothers and sisters, who are much less likely \nto live with the U.S. relative who has petitioned for them. Last year, \nfamily immigrants outside of the nuclear family totaled more than \n150,000.\n  This policy of admitting immigrants who are relatives of citizens and \nimmigrants but outside of their nuclear families is serving primarily \nthe interests of the immigrants themselves and those of their relatives \nin the United States\n  Because the American people want immigration reduced, and because \neliminating the preferences for nonnuclear family would not greatly \noffend the family values of the American people, this is an area where \nsignificant change should be made.\n  Accordingly, the bill would narrow the presently numerically \nunlimited category of ``immediate relatives'' of U.S. citizens to \ninclude only: spouses and unmarried minor children, plus parents 65 or \nolder, if the greatest number of their sons and daughters reside in the \nUnited States. It would also reserve numerically limited family \nimmigration for spouses and unmarried minor children of lawful \npermanent resident aliens--``green card'' holders--at an annual ceiling \nof 85,000, still above the current level of new petitions coming in on \nbehalf of such immigrants.\n\n  The Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends this elimination \nof most family classifications not related to the nuclear family.\n  In addition, ``special immigrant'' status would be provided for \nseverely disabled adult sons and daughters of citizens or permanent \nresidents, which is again consistent with the recommendations of the \nCommission on Immigration Reform. This provision would require a \nshowing of being able to provide adequate medical and long-term care \ninsurance for any such dependent immigrants.\n  The bill would also provide for a very generous program to reduce the \ncurrent backlog of spouses and unmarried minor children of permanent \nresidents--now 1.1 million. The bill would authorize 150,000 additional \nvisa numbers per year until all who are now ``on the waiting list'' \nhave been reached. This too was recommended by the Commission.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues of a final point on \nfamily immigration. Neither the Government of these United States, nor \nthe American people are responsible in any way for ``breaking up'' \nextended families abroad. Please hear that. No, immigrants who have \ncome here consciously chose to do so and, by doing so, they personally \nchose to leave most of their family behind--to ``break up'' their \nfamily. No one else is responsible.\n  The American people will continue to generously favor allowing \nindividual citizens and permanent residents to \n\n[[Page S 16668]]\n``sponsor'' members of their immediate family--their spouse or \nunmarried minor children, even those disabled sons and daughters and \nelderly parents who they want to have live with them. But it is not in \nthe best interests of the American people to continue to allow the \nimmigration of the entire ``rest of the family'' they made a conscious \nchoice to leave behind, and then witness the spawning of the chain \nmigration of the in-laws, and in-laws of in-laws, to which this clearly \nleads.\n  Mr. President, the bill's proposed changes in the employment-related \nclassifications are intended to protect the wages and job opportunities \nof our U.S. workers, especially those who are first entering upon their \ncareers, and to preserve long-term incentives for Americans to acquire \nneeded skills and education, and for employers to continually encourage \nthem to do so.\n  We have a wonderful group of fine young people who have acquired an \nexcellent and often very expensive education--and much of it, \ninterestingly enough, paid for directly or indirectly by the U.S. \ntaxpayers. It is in the national interest that their learned and \nnatural abilities be fully utilized before employers are permitted to \nemploy foreign workers.\n  At this time then I will review briefly the bill's employment-related \nprovisions.\n\n\n                   Reform of preference requirements\n\n  Section 103 would reform the ``employment-based'' preference \nclassifications, generally again along the lines recommended by the \nCommission. Two of the three components of the existing first \npreference--priority workers--would be essentially retained in the \nfirst two new preferences: First, aliens with extraordinary ability--\nthe ``superstars''--and second, executives and managers of \nmultinational firms. The first would be modified, as recommended by the \nCommission, by the addition of aliens with the clear potential for \nextraordinary achievement. The second provision, relating to \nmultinational executives and managers, would be modified by the \naddition of a definition of the current multinational firm and a \nrequirement for meeting a longer period of prior work experience.\n  Both of these classifications would be exempt from the new labor \ncertification requirements I will also explain.\n  Also exempt from the labor certification requirement would be two \nother classifications in current law: third, investors and fourth, \n``special immigrants,'' which includes clergy and other religious \nworkers, as well as several other classifications, such as former \nemployees of the U.S. Government.\n  The ``outstanding professors and researchers'' category would be \ndropped, but please be assured that more than enough ``numbers'' would \nbe provided under our ``extraordinary ability classification'' to \naccommodate all of these genuinely outstanding individuals.\n  In addition to the four classifications that would not be subject to \nthe new labor certification requirements, the bill proposes three \nclassifications that would then be subject to labor certification: \nfifth, professionals with an advanced degree and at least 3 years \nexperience in the profession practiced outside of the United States \nafter the receipt of their degree, sixth, professionals with a \nbaccalaureate degree and at least 5 years experience in their \nprofession practiced outside of the United States after the receipt of \ntheir degree, and (7) skilled workers with at least 5 years experience \ngained outside of the U.S., plus having at least a high school \neducation, and 2 years of college or of specialized vocational \ntraining.\n  The foreign work experience requirement is basically intended to \nprovide protection for U.S. workers who are just beginning their \ncareers.\n  These three classifications would also require a minimum score on a \ntest of the English language. Again, this is employment-based only. We \nare not talking about family. No test there.\n\n\n                  New labor certification requirements\n\n  Section 104 proposes that the present labor certification process be \nreplaced with a new system involving two alternative approaches. Under \nthe first alternative, a petitioning employer would be required to pay \na fee equal to 25 percent of annual compensation and to demonstrate \nthey have made appropriate efforts to recruit U.S. workers, including \nthe offering of at least 100percent of the actual wage paid by the \nemployer for such employment or 105percent of ``prevailing wage,'' \nwhichever is higher. The fees would be paid into private, industry-\nspecific funds that would use the money solely to finance training or \neducation programs or in other ways to reduce the industry's dependency \non foreign workers.\n  This section also proposes that the permanent resident status to be \nobtained under the preferences subject to the labor certification would \nbe ``conditional''--as is the status obtained as the result of \nmarriage. The conditional status would become full permanent resident \nstatus after 2 years if the alien were still employed by the \npetitioning employer and had also received the required wage.\n  This first approach to labor certification generally follows the \nrecommendations of the Commission, although they did not recommend a \nparticular amount for the fee. Twenty-five percent was chosen because \nit is a balance between the standard fee charged by recruiters in the \ncomputer programming industry and ``recruitment'' for other positions. \nThe goal is to make an employer's ``cost'' of obtaining and employing a \nforeign worker at least as expensive as the cost of paying a \nprofessional recruiter to find a U.S. worker and then paying all of the \nworker's wages and benefits.\n  Under the second approach, the Secretary of Labor would be authorized \nto determine that a nationwide labor shortage or labor surplus does \nexist in the United States with respect to one or more occupational \nclassifications. If there was a determination of labor shortage made, a \nlabor certification would be deemed to have been issued. The fee would \nstill be required, in order to provide funding for the private, \nindustry-specific funds mentioned earlier, and to maintain the basic \nincentive of employers to seek--and to take action to increase the \nsupply of--U.S. workers. If there were a determination of a labor \nsurplus, no labor certification could be issued.\n\n\n            Numerical limit for employment-based immigrants\n\n  Section 112 would reduce the total for employment-related immigrants \nto 90,000. Although the total immigrants allowable under current law, \nas the result of the 1990 act, is 140,000, the actual entries in fiscal \nyear 1994 were about 93,000--excluding unskilled workers and immigrants \nunder the Chinese Student Adjustment Act. Thus, this provision of the \nbill would reduce the employment-based numerical limit to about the \ncurrent level of new immigrants under the skilled-worker categories. We \nbelieve it to be fair.\n\n\n                             Nonimmigrants\n\n  The bill also contains provisions relating to nonimmigrants, \nincluding temporary foreign workers.\n\n\n  Prohibition of ``dual intent''; reduction of maximum stay to 3 years\n\n  Section 201 would, first, prohibit what is commonly known as ``dual \nintent'' for the visa classifications of H-1B--temporary foreign worker \nin a ``specialty occupation''--or L--intra-company transferee.\n  Before 1990, an overseas consular officer could refuse a visa \napplicant if the officer thought the applicant ``intended'' to remain \nin the United States permanently--in other words, if he or she had the \nintent to become, ultimately, an immigrant, as well as the similar \nintent to be, initially, a temporary worker. The 1990 act authorized \nthis ``dual intent'' for H-1B and L visas.\n  After the change proposed by my bill, those visas would once again \nnot be issued unless the applicant had a ``residence'' in a foreign \ncountry which he had no intention of ever abandoning--which is the rule \nfor all other temporary visas.\n  The second change proposed by this section is that the ``maximum \nstay'' under these visas would be reduced to 3 years--from 6 years--for \nH-1B and H-2B--or from either 5 or 7 years--for L. A 3-year maximum is \nmore consistent with the ``supposedly'' temporary nature of the job--\nand of the stay of the worker. It would also reduce the total number of \nsuch foreign workers who could be in the United States at any one time.\n\n\n  Annual fee; recruitment and other attestations; foreign experience \n                              requirement\n\n  Section 202 would require the petitioning employer to pay an annual \nfee \n\n[[Page S 16669]]\nin order to employ an H-1B worker. The fee would be used for the same \npurposes as the fee for immigrants that I mentioned earlier, although \nthe H-1B fee would be lower--5 percent in the first year, 7.5 percent \nin the second, and 10 percent in the third.\n  The section would also require petitioning employers to make several \n``attestations'' in addition to those that are required under current \nlaw before entry of an H-1B worker could be approved: the employer \nwould have to agree: First, to pay the H-1B worker at least 100 percent \nof the actual compensation as paid by the employer for such workers or \n105 percent of the ``prevailing wage,'' whichever is higher; second, \nnot to replace U.S. workers with H-1B workers unless each replacement \nworker were paid at least 105 percent of the mean of the compensation \npaid to the replaced workers; third, to take ``timely, significant, and \neffective steps'' to end dependence on foreign workers; and fourth, if \nit is a job contractor, to require its clients to make the same \nattestations as would the direct employers. The employer would also \nhave to attest that it had attempted to recruit a U.S. worker, offering \nat least 100 percent of the actual compensation paid by the employer \nfor such workers or 105 percent of the ``prevailing wage,'' whichever \nis higher.\n  Finally, the section would require that all H-1B workers have 2 years \nexperience in their specialty while working outside of the United \nStates after obtaining their most recently received degree. Similar to \nthe foreign work experience required for immigrants, this is intended \nbasically to protect job opportunities for U.S. workers who are just \nentering their careers.\n\n\n              Definition of multinational firm for L visas\n\n  Section 203 would apply to L visas--intracompany transferees--the \nsame definition of ``multinational firm'' as is contained in the bill \nfor purposes of describing the employment-based immigrant \nclassification as used for certain multinational executives and \nmanagers.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the citizens of this Nation very much want, and they \ndo surely deserve, an immigration policy that is designed primarily to \npromote their own long-term interests--their Nation's--and the \ninterests of their descendants. This has thus been the fundamental \ncriterion in the drafting of my own bill--together with my own \nintuition and feelings about the realities of today's political world. \nWe must remain reasonable and responsive in pursuing this legislation \nand avoid the efforts of extremists, revisionists, and restrictionist. \nAnd be assured, this fundamental national-interest criterion will be my \nconstant and steady guide as I move the bill through the ofttimes \ntreacherous waters of the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Summary of the Immigration Reform Act of 1995\n\n       This bill would amend provisions of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, primarily those relating to the numerical \n     limits and selection criteria for immigrants and \n     nonimmigrants.\n\n\n                   changes in family classifications\n\n        Sec. 101. Immediate relative classification.\n        This would narrow the immigrant classification ``immediate \n     relatives'' of U.S. citizens (a numerically unlimited \n     classification). At present, the classification includes \n     spouses and unmarried minor (under 21) children of citizens, \n     plus parents of adult citizens. After the change, only a \n     portion of the parents would be included: those 65 or older, \n     whose sons and daughters reside for the most part in the \n     United States (the latter is often called the ``Australian \n     rule''). The goal is to provide immigrant visas to \n     ``reunify'' the parents most likely to live with their U.S. \n     citizen sons or daughters, but only if there is not another \n     country with a greater number of sons and daughters with whom \n     the parent could live.\n        The section also proposes an amendment to the ``public \n     charge'' exclusion that would condition admission of these \n     parents on adequate medical and long-term care insurance.\n        Parents not qualified to immigrate to the U.S. under the \n     new ``immediate relative'' classification would be able to \n     immigrate through one of the employment-related \n     classifications or to visit their U.S. relatives with a \n     tourist visa.\n        Sec. 102. Family-sponsored preference classifications.\n       This would limit family preferences to the nuclear family \n     (spouse and unmarried minor children) of lawful permanent \n     residents. (However, severely disabled sons and daughters of \n     citizens or permanent residents would have ``special \n     immigrant'' status; see below.)\n        Thus, the section would eliminate or greatly narrow \n     several non-nuclear family preferences, as recently \n     recommended by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform:\n        4th (brothers and sisters of adult citizens)\n       3rd (married sons and daughters of citizens)\n       1st (unmarried adult sons and daughters of citizens)\n       2B (unmarried adult sons and daughters of permanent \n     residents)\n        These classifications would be eliminated, except that \n     bill section 105 would create a new ``special immigrant'' \n     classification for ``disabled'' adult sons and daughters of \n     citizens or lawful permanent residents, consistent with the \n     Commission's recommendations.\n\n\n        Changes in employment preferences and special immigrants\n\n       Sec. 103. Employment-based preference classifications.\n       This would reform the employment-based preferences. Two of \n     the three components of the existing 1st preference (priority \n     workers) would be essentially retained in the first two new \n     preferences: (1) aliens with extraordinary ability (the \n     ``superstars''), and (2) executives and managers of \n     multinational firms. The first would be modified, as \n     recommended by the Commission, by the addition of aliens with \n     the potential for extraordinary achievement. The second \n     provision, relating to multinational executives and managers, \n     would be modified by the addition of a definition of \n     multinational firm and a requirement for a longer period of \n     prior work experience. These classifications would be exempt \n     from the new labor certification requirements (see below).\n       Also exempt from the labor cert. requirement would be two \n     other classifications in current law: (3) investors and (4) \n     ``special immigrants.'' The investor classification would be \n     modified to eliminate the ``set-aside for targeted employment \n     areas'' and by a requirement that the new jobs which must be \n     created be for citizens or lawful permanent residents (not \n     ``other immigrants lawfully authorized to be employed in the \n     United States;'' thus, for example, jobs for H-1B temporary \n     workers would not be counted).\n       ``Special immigrants'' include, among other classifications \n     (e.g., former employees of the U.S. government), clergy and \n     other religious workers. One proposed change: the required \n     two years of experience in religious work would have to have \n     been abroad. (The major change for the ``special immigrant'' \n     classifications, however, would be the addition, in section \n     105 of the bill, of a new classification: severely disabled \n     adult sons and daughters of citizens and lawful permanent \n     residents.)\n       The outstanding professors category would be eliminated, \n     but more than enough numbers would be provided for the \n     extraordinary ability classification to accommodate \n     professors who are genuinely outstanding.\n       In addition to the four classifications not subject to the \n     new labor certification requirements, the bill proposes three \n     classifications that would be subject to labor certification: \n     (5) professionals with an advanced degree and at least 3 \n     years experience in the profession outside the U.S. after \n     receipt of the degree, (6) professionals with a baccalaureate \n     degree and at least 5 years experience in the profession \n     outside the U.S. after receipt of the degree, and (7) skilled \n     workers with at least 5 years experience outside the U.S. and \n     at least a high school education plus two years of college or \n     specialized vocational training. The foreign work experience \n     requirement is intended to provide additional protection for \n     U.S. workers just beginning their careers.\n       The latter three classifications would also require a \n     minimum score on a test of English.\n       The first of the seven employment-based classifications \n     would have complete priority over the second (only the visa \n     numbers available after demand under the first classification \n     had been completely satisfied would be available for the \n     second). Similarly, the 2nd classification would have \n     complete priority over the 3rd, the 3rd over the 4th, and so \n     on--with two exceptions: (a) there would be a numerical limit \n     on most ``special immigrants'' under the 4th classification, \n     and (b) the 5th classification (professionals with an \n     advanced degree) and 6th classification (professionals with a \n     baccalaureate degree) would each be allocated half of the \n     numbers available after demand in higher classifications had \n     been satisfied. The allocation between the 5th and 6th \n     classifications reflects their current relative levels, as \n     well as the fact that a professional with a baccalaureate \n     degree in a particular field may contribute more to the \n     economy than a professional with an advanced degree in a \n     different field, one in less demand.\n       Sec. 104. Labor certification.\n       This proposes that the present labor certification process \n     be replaced with a new system providing two alternative \n     approaches. Under the first alternative, a petitioning \n     employer would be required to pay a fee equal to 25% of \n     annual compensation and to demonstrate appropriate efforts to \n     recruit U.S. workers, including the offering of at least \n\n[[Page S 16670]]\n     100% of the actual compensation paid by the employer for such \n     employment, or 105% of ``prevailing compensation,'' whichever \n     is higher.\n       The lawful permanent resident status obtained under the \n     preferences subject to labor certification would be \n     conditional (like the status obtained as the result of \n     marriage). The conditional status would become full lawful \n     permanent resident status after 2 years if the alien were \n     still employed by the petitioning employer and had received \n     the required wage (105% of prevailing wage). This section of \n     the bill contains many provisions describing the procedure to \n     be followed to upgrade the conditional status. Such \n     provisions are modeled on INA section 216 (intended to combat \n     marriage fraud).\n       Such approach generally follows recommendations of the \n     Commission. The Commission did not recommend a particular \n     amount for the fee. 25% was chosen because it is in the \n     middle of the range of fees charged by professional \n     recruiters in various industries. The goal is to make an \n     employer's cost of obtaining and employing a foreign worker \n     at least as expensive as the cost of paying a professional \n     recruiter to find a U.S. worker and then paying the worker's \n     wages and benefits. The fees would be paid into private, \n     industry-specific funds, which would use the money to finance \n     training or education programs or in other ways to reduce the \n     industry's dependence on foreign workers.\n       Under the second approach, the Secretary of Labor would be \n     authorized to determine that a nationwide labor shortage or \n     labor surplus existed in the United States with respect to \n     one or more occupational classifications. If there were a \n     determination of labor shortage, a labor certification would \n     be deemed to have been issued. The 25% fee would still be \n     required, in order (a) to provide additional funding for the \n     industry-specific private funds, and (b) to maintain the \n     incentive of employers to seek--and to take action to \n     increase the supply of--U.S. workers. If there were a \n     determination of a labor surplus, no labor certification \n     could be issued.\n       Any person could request that the Secretary make such a \n     determination, by submitting evidence relevant to whether or \n     not the claimed labor shortage (or surplus) existed. The \n     burden of proof would be on the person making the request. \n     The request could not be considered unless the requester had \n     provided notice to other persons with an interest (as \n     determined by the Secretary). Such other persons, or anyone \n     else, could submit documentary evidence relevant to the \n     Secretary's determination.\n       Sec. 105. Special immigrant classifications.\n       This section would create a new ``special immigrant'' \n     classification for severely disabled sons or daughters of \n     citizens or lawful permanent residents. It contains a \n     definition of ``disabled son or daughter'' which would \n     require a ``severe mental or physical impairment'' that is \n     likely to continue indefinitely and that causes \n     ``substantially total inability to perform functions \n     necessary for independent living.'' Providing such a \n     classification is consistent with recommendations of the \n     Commission.\n       The definition is based on several Federal statutes \n     relating to disability, modified to refer to the degree of \n     disability consistent with the policy of this ``special \n     immigrant'' classification. Such policy is that it should \n     cover only the sons and daughters who cannot take care of \n     themselves and whose parents in the U.S. want to care for \n     them at home.\n       The section also proposes an amendment to the ``public \n     charge'' exclusion that would condition admission of these \n     disabled sons and daughters on a showing of adequate medical \n     and long-term care insurance. Failure to provide such \n     insurance would subject the sponsor to civil penalties.\n\n\n   new provision on the effect of an approved immigrant visa petition\n\n       Sec. 106. Effect of approved immigrant visa petition.\n       This would reduce a problem in current visa practice which \n     arises from the division of visa responsibility between INS \n     and the State Department. At present, when an applicant is \n     found ineligible for an immigrant visa by a consular \n     officer--e.g., because the alien does not have the claimed \n     occupation or family relationship--the officer may only \n     ``suspend action'' and return the petition to INS. At that \n     point, INS caseload is frequently such that the petition is \n     once again approved, without additional investigation, and \n     sent back to the consular officer. If the officer does not \n     have additional factual evidence indicating that the alien is \n     not entitled to immigrant status, the visa is issued. Section \n     106 would authorize the officer to deny the visa and return \n     the petition to INS for appropriate action. This section is \n     based on the view that the consular officer, who has the \n     petition beneficiary before him, is in a better position to \n     make the final determination of eligibility than an INS \n     officer considering only the paperwork, usually hundreds of \n     miles from the petitioner and thousands of miles from the \n     beneficiary.\n\n\n  new provision on judicial review of agency actions on visa petitions\n\n       Sec. 107. Judicial review.\n       This would establish limitations and conditions on judicial \n     review of agency actions relating to petitions for a visa or \n     adjustment of status.\n\n\n           changes in numerical limits for family preferences\n\n       Sec. 111. World-wide numerical limitation on family-\n     sponsored immigration.\n       This would reduce the numerical limit for family preference \n     immigrants to 85,000, approximately the current level of new \n     petitions for spouses and unmarried minor children of \n     permanent residents (the only remaining family preference \n     classification in the new system). Unused visa numbers would \n     not carry over from one year to the next.\n       The result would be a decrease of about 140,000 from the \n     current annual total of about 226,000 (for the full current \n     group of 4 family preferences). Together with the likely \n     reduction of at least 35,000 in ``immediate relatives'' of \n     citizens that would result from limiting the admission of \n     parents to those 65 or older, this provision would result in \n     a level of family immigrants of about 300,000, a reduction of \n     about 175,000 per year. Most of this saving (up to 150,000 \n     per year) would be devoted to reducing the 1.1 million \n     backlog in spouses and unmarried minor children of lawful \n     permanent residents, resulting in overall family immigration \n     of about 450,000 until the backlog is eliminated.\n\n\n         changes in numerical limits for employment preferences\n\n       Sec. 112. World-wide numerical limitation on employment-\n     based immigration.\n       This would reduce the limit to 90,000. The total allowable \n     under current law is 140,000. However, the actual entries in \n     FY94 were about 93,000 (excluding unskilled workers and \n     immigrants under the Chinese Student Adjustment Act). Thus, \n     this provision of the bill would reduce the annual numerical \n     limit for employment-based immigrants to approximately the \n     current level of new immigrants under the skilled-worker \n     categories.\n\n\n                    Changes in the per-country limit\n\n       Sec. 113. Numerical limitation on immigration from a single \n     foreign state.\n       This would reestablish the per-country limit of 20,000 for \n     preference immigrants in effect before 1990 (a 40,000 limit \n     is proposed for ``contiguous countries'' and 5,000 for \n     ``dependent areas''). The limit would not, however, affect \n     spouses and unmarried minor children of lawful permanent \n     residents as long as the backlog-clearance numbers were being \n     provided (see sec. 114 below).\n       As under current law, this limit would not restrict the \n     level of ``immediate relatives'' of citizens. However, the \n     bill proposes to reduce the limit for a particular foreign \n     state in a fiscal year by the number of immediate relatives \n     of citizens above the 20,000 (40,000 for ``contiguous \n     countries'' and 5,000 for ``dependent areas'') such \n     foreign state sent in the prior year. For example, if in \n     fiscal year 1995 the number of nationals from a non-\n     contiguous country who entered as immediate relatives was \n     30,000, then the per-country limit for such country for \n     fiscal year 1996 would be 10,000 fewer than the normal \n     20,000.\n\n\n                           Backlog reduction\n\n       Sec. 114. Transition for certain backlogged spouses and \n     children of lawful permanent residents.\n       This would authorize 150,000 additional visa numbers in the \n     first fiscal year beginning on or after the bill's effective \n     date for reduction of the current backlog of spouses and \n     unmarried minor children of permanent residents (now 1.1 \n     million). After such first year, the quantity of backlog \n     reduction numbers would be equal to the lesser of 150,000 and \n     the amount by which the level of family immigration in the \n     prior fiscal year was below the current level of about \n     475,000. The full 150,000 would be available, for example, if \n     the level of nuclear family of permanent resident aliens were \n     85,000 (the limit provided in the bill) and the level of \n     immediate relatives of citizens were no more than about \n     240,000 (if the bill's provisions were now in effect, the \n     current level would be no more than 215,000, probably much \n     less). The goal is for the total level of family immigrants \n     (including those using backlog reduction numbers) to be no \n     higher than currently.\n       The backlog numbers would go first to the spouses and \n     children of permanent resident aliens who had not obtained \n     immigrant status through the amnesty program of the \n     Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (``IRCA''). \n     Backlog numbers would be provided for as long as anyone now \n     on the waiting list had not been reached.\n\n\n                 review of numerical limits by congress\n\n       Sec. 115. Congressional review of numerical limitations.\n       This would require that after the present backlog of \n     spouses and children of permanent resident aliens had \n     declined to 10,000, or 5 years after enactment, whichever \n     came later, the Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate \n     each hold a hearing on the subject of whether the annual \n     numerical limitations on family-sponsored or employment-based \n     immigrant classifications should be changed. If, within 30 \n     days of such a hearing, a bill pertaining solely to such a \n     change was reported, that bill would be considered by the \n     House and Senate under expedited procedures described in this \n     section.\n\n\n                             nonimmigrants\n\n       Sec. 201. Changes in H and L classifications.\n       This would, first, prohibit ``dual intent'' (present intent \n     to work temporarily, but with the ultimate intent to \n     immigrate permanently). After the change, an H-1B \n     (temporary foreign worker in a ``specialty occupation'') \n     or L (intra-company transferee) visa could not be issued \n     unless the applicant had a residence in a foreign country \n     which he had no intention of abandoning, which is the rule \n     for all other nonimmigrant visas.\n\n[[Page S 16671]]\n\n        Second, the maximum stay under these visas would be \n     reduced to three years--from six years (for H-1B and H-2B) or \n     from either five or seven years (for L).\n        Sec. 202. Changes in H-1B classification.\n       This would require a petitioning employer to pay an annual \n     fee in order to employ an H-1B temporary foreign worker. The \n     fee would be used for the same purposes as the fee under bill \n     section 104.\n        The section would also require petitioning employers to \n     make several additional attestations before entry of an H-1B \n     worker could be approved: the employer must agree (1) to pay \n     the H-1B worker at least 100% of the actual compensation paid \n     by the employer for such workers or 105% of the prevailing \n     compensation (whichever was higher); (2) not to replace U.S. \n     workers with H-1B workers unless each replacement worker were \n     paid at least 105 percent of the mean of the compensation \n     paid to the replaced workers; (3) to take ``timely, \n     significant, and effective steps'' to end dependence on \n     foreign workers; and (4) if it is a job contractor, to \n     require its clients to make the same attestations as direct \n     employers. The employer would also have to attest that it had \n     attempted to recruit a U.S. worker, offering at least its \n     current actual compensation for the job, or 105 percent of \n     the prevailing compensation in the area, whichever was \n     higher.\n        The section would also provide that ``prevailing \n     compensation'' for an occupational classification, such as \n     researcher, could not be considered to vary depending on the \n     characteristics of the employer, except to the extent there \n     is a difference in either (a) working conditions (for example \n     the presence or absence of conditions that could make the job \n     so attractive or unattractive relative to similar jobs for \n     other employers that wages would be affected), or (b) the \n     functional requirements of the job.\n        Finally, the section would require that all H-1B workers \n     have two years experience in their specialty outside the U.S. \n     after obtaining their most recently received degree.\n        Sec. 203. Changes in L classification.\n       This would provide the same definition of ``multinational \n     firm'' contained in bill section 103 for purposes of the new \n     employment-based immigrant classification for certain \n     multinational executives and managers.\n        Sec. 204. Pilot program on information and tracking system \n     relating to nonimmigrant foreign students.\n       This would establish a pilot program to collect from \n     colleges and universities certain information relating to \n     nonimmigrant students and make it available in electronic \n     form to selected U.S. consulates and INS officers. Such \n     information would include whether an alien is enrolled, or \n     has been accepted for enrollment, in a U.S. college or \n     university; current U.S. address; and whether the alien is a \n     full-time or part-time student and is making normal progress \n     toward the degree.\n\n\n                         note on total numbers\n\n       Under the bill, the numerical limits are: 85,000 for family \n     preferences and 90,000 for employment preferences. The \n     current level of spouses and children of citizens, plus \n     parents 65 or older, is appropoximately 215,000. These \n     numbers together total 390,000. Adding the backlog reduction \n     of 150,000 brings the total to 540,000 (not including \n     refugees).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would very much like to commend the \nSenator from Wyoming for his work on immigration.\n  I am privileged to serve on his subcommittee on immigration on the \nJudiciary Committee, and it has been very wonderful for me to be able \nto watch him work out various problems in what has been a most \ndifficult arena in which to legislate.\n  So I would just like to say to him, I am delighted he has presented \nhis bill. I look forward to reading it. I hope I will be able to \ncosponsor it. I look forward to work with him in the committee as this \nbill is moved.\n  I think, Mr. President, that the Senator from Wyoming understands the \nneed to move a bill in this session of the Congress. So I would like \nhim to know that I am very respectful and grateful for his work in this \narea.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Exon):\n  S. 1396. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide for \nthe regulation of surface transportation; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n         THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION SUNSET ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Interstate \nCommerce Commission Sunset Act of 1995. I am very pleased to be joined \nin this effort by Senator Exon. It is a bipartisan bill and I urge my \ncolleagues' bipartisan support as we work toward what must be very \nswift passage. Let me also make it clear at the outset that this bill \nis a work in progress. I introduce it today as the next step in a \nprocess of discussions and revisions that have been ongoing for months. \nThis process will continue.\n  I would like to begin by outlining some of the underlying philosophy \nthat went into its drafting. In addition, I will address the procedural \nposture in which we find ourselves in relation to this bill.\n  In preparation of the legislation we are introducing today, Senator \nExon and I have worked together very closely. In fact, much of this \nlegislation initially was written by my good friend and distinguished \ncoauthor. Compromise and cooperation have produced what I feel is a \nbalanced bill, addressing the immediate and compelling needs driving \nthis legislation.\n  Our staff members and those of other committee members have \ncollaborated throughout this process. They have spent many long hours \nin joint meetings with various interest groups and constituents who \nhave raised concerns or urged additions. We have worked very hard to \naddress legitimate concerns, and have made numerous changes to the \npreviously circulated staff draft in an effort to address those \nconcerns. However, as hard as we have worked to please all parties, our \npolicy decisions ultimately were driver, in part, by the need to \nproduce a bill which could be passed and signed into law this year. In \nshort, the clock is running.\n  For reasons I shall address in a moment, however, we have made a \nconscious effort to avoid addressing broader transportation policy \nissues than those directly related to sunsetting the ICC and \ntransferring its essential functions to its successor. To that extent, \nthe Senate bill is more limited in scope than its House counterpart. \nIndeed, it remains largely unchanged from the staff draft which was \ncirculated some time ago.\n  Mr. President, I introduce this legislation with mixed feelings. On \nthe one hand, I am a firm believer in a less-is-better approach when it \ncomes to government. Too often in Congress, we gage accomplishment by \nquantity rather than quality. We need to reduce Federal Government. In \nthat sense, this is historic legislation. The ICC is our oldest \nindependent agency, yet its functions can and should be reduced. \nIndeed, this could be said about every agency, every executive \ndepartment, and both Houses of Congress. Less would be better. Our bill \nmoves us in that direction.\n  However, the positive and necessary adjudicatory role of the ICC \nshould not come to a screeching halt. Indeed, the ICC has performed and \ncontinues to perform important functions. For example, without its \nabandonment public interest review authority, my home State of South \nDakota would today have hundreds of miles less rail service than we \npresently enjoy.\n\n  Quite honestly, budget constraints and appropriations legislation \nwhich terminate the agency's functions at the end of this year renders \nmoot any debate over whether or not we should keep the ICC. Given the \nrealities of the budget situation, the issue is not whether the ICC \nshould be terminated, but how it will be dismantled.\n  Therefore, we must determine what ICC functions can continue to be \neffectively performed by a successor with a greatly reduced budget. \nWhich functions can be subsumed into the Department of Transportation? \nIs there an ongoing need for a review process independent of political \npressures? These are questions this legislation is designed to address.\n  This bill provides a reasoned approach designated to ensure continued \nprotections against industry abuse while at the same time assure the \neconomic efficiencies of our Nation's surface transportation system can \ncontinue. We propose to sunset the ICC and transfer its necessary \nresidual functions to an independent Intermodal Surface Transportation \nBoard within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Board would \nadminister the residual regulations over rail carriers and pipelines \nand provide limited adjudicatory oversight over the motor carrier \nindustry. The Secretary of Transportation would inherit the residual \nnonadjudicatory functions governing the motor carrier industry.\n  Fundamentally, the approach taken in this legislation was to limit \nits \n\n[[Page S 16672]]\nscope to the most efficient and simplest sunset and transfer bill, as \nopposed to a wholesale rewrite of transportation policy. But the very \nnature of the task--which is to close down an entire Federal agency--\nthere is of necessity a need to sunset certain of its functions, \nhowever, some changes to these functions also had to be made in light \nof the budget realities which will confront the remaining agency.\n  None of this is to say concerns raised during the process through \nwhich this legislation was developed are not legitimate. Indeed, I \nbelieve they are. I am particularly concerned about the concerns of \nsmall rail shippers and operators in light of recent and continuing \nindustry trends toward overwhelming industry concentration. More and \nmore of this Nation's rail infrastructure is owned by fewer and fewer \nrailroads.\n  Competitive concerns continue to increase, and the leverage of the \nsmaller shippers and small feeder railroads relative to the class I \nrailroads decreases. I recall chairing a hearing in 1985 which \naddressed some of those concerns. Since that time, my concern has only \nheightened.\n  Some have urged us to re-regulate the rail industry in this \nlegislation. They argue that since the Staggers Act greatly deregulated \nthe rail industry, shippers have been faced with difficult if not \nimpossible relief mechanisms. They point out that the potential for \nshipper abuse increases with industry concentration. Their arguments \nare not entirely unpersuasive. However, a return to a pre-Staggers \napproach is not the answer at this time.\n\n  The shipper complaint procedure at the current ICC is hopelessly \ncomplicated to the point where shippers with a legitimate grievance \ngenerally do not have an effective remedy available. The real question \nin my mind is the extent to which legitimate grievances can be \nidentified, aired, and resolved. Most of the suggestions raised \ninvolved some form of re-regulation.\n  Even though I voted against the Staggers Act over a decade ago, I \nmust say it has proved to be extraordinarily successful in reviving a \nfailing industry and on balance has been positive for shippers and \nindustry alike. Therefore, at this juncture, it is premature to attempt \nto re-regulate, without a clearer identification and articulation of \nthe problem, and an established record which provides some reasonably \ncompelling evidence that the solution proposed actually fixes the \nproblem.\n  On both counts, it seems more effort could be made by all parties to \nattempt to develop industry solutions before seeking Government \nsolutions. The fundamental problem I see developing in the industry \ntoday is that the shippers and others are, as I said, increasingly \nlosing leverage in their relations with the class I railroads. In many \nways, shippers and small railroads are in the same boat.\n  Due to these concerns, I am proposing to establish a rail-shipper \ntransportation advisory council in an attempt to give them a stronger \nvoice, and a mechanism to resolve many of the concerns within the \nindustry, rather than having the Government address them. It is clearly \nand intentionally weighted in favor of small shippers and small \nrailroads in an effort to address the many issues in which they have \nmutual and legitimate public interest concerns. After a reasonable \nopportunity has been made available to review the varied issues \nconfronting small shippers and railroads, I would anticipate a series \nof oversight hearings to review the advisory council's findings or \nrecommendations, and, if necessary, appropriate legislative action will \nbe taken.\n  Whether the council is an effective tool or not will depend largely \non the reasonableness of the small shippers and railroads position. It \nwould be as much of a mistake for them to overplay their hand as it \nwould for the large railroads not to treat their concerns seriously. If \nthe smaller railroads and shippers overplay their hand by making \nunreasonable demands, the council will quickly lose credibility, both \nwithin the industry and with policy makers. At the same time, if class \nI's are indifferent or unresponsive to legitimate concerns raised, \nlegislative solutions far more expansive than any proposed to date will \nbe seriously considered. Re-regulation, antitrust protection, and \neverything else will be on the table.\n  Mr. President, let me say it again. This chairman knows the concerns \nof the shippers and small railroads are very real. They need to be \naddressed. The message to both the rail industry and to shippers is \nsimple. Be reasonable. Define and solve your problems to the best of \nyour ability. Excessive Government involvement is a last resort. It \nwill not happen without compelling need and a demonstration of good \nfaith effort by those seeking Government intervention, that all \nreasonable avenues to develop a reasonable industry compromise have \nbeen blocked by relative unreasonableness.\n  With respect to labor, there have been attempts to reach a negotiated \nsolution to that issue as well. We have included language which is far \nless satisfactory in my view than the House bill, but I agree to it \nwith the expectation that the parties can agree to compromise on this \nissue. It remains an issue that is unresolved, but which shall--as with \nother provisions of the bill--be addressed further.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16657-8", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 847\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gregg, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. Moynihan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 847, a bill to terminate \nthe agricultural price support and production adjustment programs for \nsugar, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 939\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Dole], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], the Senator from \nIndiana [Mr. Coats], and the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 939, a bill to amend title 18, United States Code, \nto ban partial-birth abortions.\n\n\n                                S. 1219\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry], the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], the \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], and the Senator from Illinois [Ms. \nMoseley-Braun] were added as cosponsors of S. 1219, a bill to reform \nthe financing of Federal elections, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1289\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the name of the Senator from Mississippi \n[Mr. Cochran] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1289, a bill to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to clarify the use of private \ncontracts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 146\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnston, the names of the Senator from \nWisconsin [Mr. Kohl], the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], and the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] \nwere added as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 146, a resolution \ndesignating the week beginning November 19, 1995, and the week \nbeginning on November 24, 1996, as ``National Family Week,'' and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16672-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 192--MAKING MAJORITY PARTY COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS\n\n  Mr. DOLE submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, death and taxes may be the only two \nthings in life that are unavoidable, and the Federal Government has \neven found a way to combine them. Federal estate--death--and gift \ntaxation represents punitive double taxation and unfairly transfers \nincome from families to the Government. They tax money that has already \nbeen taxed once, if not twice. The steep 55 percent top estate tax rate \nfrequently forces many families to liquidate or sell their businesses \nor farms just to pay the tax collector rather than being able to pass \nthose belongings onto their next generation--often wiping out a \nlifetime of hard work.\n  Unfortunately, many taxpayers are punished even when they play by the \nrules. Because of the complexity of the Tax Code, many unsuspecting \ntaxpayers get caught up in a situation in which they have to capitulate \nto the demands of the IRS or have to spend huge sums of money in the \nhopes of a fair tax court decision. Federal estate and gift taxation \ncreates some of the most egregious cases. For example, hypertechnical \nIRS interpretation of the interplay between Code sections 2034 and 2038 \nhave transcended any intent of Congress. Unforeseen technical traps in \nthe Tax Code were not meant to be revenue raisers for the Federal \nGovernment at the expense of unsuspecting taxpayers.\n  Our complex and punitive Federal tax system is in need of a complete \noverhaul. Americans now waste some $190 billion and 6 billion man-hours \njust complying with our onerous Tax Code each year. That's the \nequivalent to the man-hours it takes to produce all the cars, trucks, \nand airplanes in this country each year. Tax reform is critical to \nsimplifying the Tax Code and enhancing our Nation's long-term economic \ngrowth. And, as always, this will likely take several years to \naccomplish. In the meantime, taxpayers must always be treated with \nfairness and respect by the IRS as they comply with our current complex \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16673-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16673-S16674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LOAN PLAN GOOD FOR SCHOOLS, STUDENTS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the interim chancellor of the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, David C. Broski, had a letter to the \neditor in the Chicago Tribune about direct lending.\n  Because our colleagues are trying to figure out right now what to do \non direct lending, I thought they would be interested in seeing the \nperspective of a college administrator.\n  I ask that the letter to the editor be printed in the Record.\n  The letter to the editor follows:\n\n                  Loan Plan Good for Schools, Students\n\n       Chicago.--I couldn't agree more with the Tribune's \n     editorial opposing the changes in the Federal Direct Loan \n     Program that have been suggested by the banking industry \n     (``Cooking the books on student loans,'' Sept. 11).\n       The program received a big boost last year when rules were \n     changed to allow the government to lend directly to students \n     at some universities, without running the money through \n     banks. But it could lose all it gained if Congress succumbs \n     to pressure from banking interests and goes back to the old \n     system. The debate in Washington has centered on arcane--and \n     conflicting--reports from accountants. Some say the new \n     program is more costly; others say it's not.\n       I'm not qualified to analyze the accountants' reports \n     (though I don't understand how eliminating a middleman can \n     cost you money). But I do know that the new program has \n     benefited the people it was supposed to help: the students \n     and the universities.\n       At the University of Illinois at Chicago, the direct-\n     lending program has cut the average processing time for a \n     student loan from seven weeks to three. And it has saved time \n     and effort for our financial-aid staff because they don't \n     have to deal with a multiplicity of banks. As a result, \n     students get their \n\n[[Page S 16674]]\n     money sooner and UIC saves money in reduced staff time and processing \n     costs. We expect to process more than $40 million in direct \n     student loans this academic year. At our sister campus in \n     Urbana-Champaign, direct lending resulted in 2,500 more \n     students receiving their loan proceeds at the beginning of \n     the fall semester, compared with the previous year.\n       A Harvard University official echoed the sentiments of our \n     financial-aid people when he said, ``Now that we're no longer \n     caught up in the paper chase from many lending institutions \n     and guarantee agencies, we have more time to deal with real \n     issues.''\n       There's another good thing about the direct lending program \n     that was not mentioned in your editorial. It offers a greater \n     variety of repayment options. In addition to the standard \n     repayment plan spread out over 5 to 10 years, students can \n     choose: an extended repayment period with lower monthly \n     payments, a plan in which payments increase over time, a plan \n     with payments pegged to the borrower's income.\n       The advantage of these options, of course, is that they \n     give college graduates the freedom to take lower-paying but \n     socially useful jobs and still repay their student loans.\n       Federally guaranteed bank loans haven't been abolished. In \n     fact, they make up more than half of the $25 billion in \n     annual student loans. But UIC, like most of the state \n     universities in Illinois, has switched to direct lending--\n     with excellent results. The program is good for our students \n     and good for Illinois taxpayers, and it shouldn't be \n     abolished or weakened.--David C. Broski.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16673-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRANIAN BEHAVIOR\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on Iranian \nbehavior and the continued need for sanctions to be placed upon this \nbarbarous regime.\n  The Iranian regime's stubborn insistence on actions which only serve \nto isolate that nation and its people, threaten to cast Iran into total \ndeprivation. The sponsorship of international terrorism, continued \nefforts to build weapons of mass destruction, and human rights \nviolations against innocent Iranians, threaten to throw the country \nback into medieval times, where all the technology of the West and the \nease of our daily life will be absent from the Iranian nation, due \ndirectly to the abusive rule of this primitive regime.\n  Iran is isolated and universally viewed as a pariah state. Its \nactions are abhorrent to the civilized world. As long as this warped, \nterroristic regime continues to punish the Iranian people with its \nmisrule, this condition will continue. The tyrants in Tehran must \nunderstand their aggression and abuse of the good people of Iran will \nnot last, and one day they will be brought to task for their actions.\n  While the tyrants continue to rule in Tehran, sanctions are a clear \nway to keep up the pressure on Iran and to deny them the ability to \ncarry out their aggression on the outside world as well as against \ntheir own people. We do not take these issues lightly. It is a pity \nthat the regime cannot act like a civilized country and not be so \nabusive. If only Iran would not conduct these brutal actions, we would \nnot have to place sanctions on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16674-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CUTTING TAXES NO MATTER THE COST\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, our colleague, Senator Russ \nFeingold, has been leading the charge in trying to get us to use common \nsense and not have a tax cut at this point.\n  I have been pleased to join him in this effort.\n  The Chicago Tribune, a newspaper that is independent but with a \nslight Republican leaning, had an editorial titled, ``Cutting taxes no \nmatter the cost'' that makes a great deal of sense.\n  I ask that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                    Cutting Taxes No Matter the Cost\n\n       Republican lawmakers who know better will swear that a tax \n     cut is necessary, that the savings from balancing the budget \n     and shrinking government should go to small businesses, \n     families with kids and others who will spend it better than \n     Congress.\n       The same lawmakers will insist that they must honor a \n     House-Senate compromise reached last summer to cut taxes by \n     $245 billion, even though a few will acknowledge that a \n     smaller number--or better yet, no tax cut at all--would make \n     their job of balancing the budget in seven years that much \n     easier.\n       But for now, as Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee \n     clearly showed last week, the need to maintain party unity, \n     appease the party's conservative elements and confront \n     President Clinton on the budget is overriding sound judgment, \n     economic logic and tax policy.\n       On Friday, Republicans on the tax-writing panel announced \n     they had agreed to a $245 billion package of tax cuts over \n     seven years that includes a permanent $500-per-child tax \n     credit, significant reductions in capital gains taxes and \n     breaks for corporations. The unanimous agreement insured that \n     the measure will pass the full committee this week and made \n     it likely it will be added to a budget-balancing bill for a \n     full Senate vote later this month.\n       The deal also ended weeks of growing GOP division over tax \n     cuts. Several weeks ago, for example, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas \n     candidly suggested that a smaller tax cut package might be \n     appropriate and that it made sense to let the expensive \n     family tax credits expire in five years. He was attacked \n     immediately by rival presidential candidate Sen. Phil Gramm \n     of Texas for backpedaling on the promised GOP tax cuts. Soon \n     after, Dole ditufully got back in line.\n       In fact, the $500-a-child tax credit is the package's \n     costliest provision, yet does nothing to boost long-term \n     economic growth. But Gramm and conservative constituencies \n     like the Christian Coalition believe families that forgo \n     income to raise children deserve an allowance, and they're \n     insisting on nothing less.\n       What many Republicans still don't get, however, is that \n     their own analysis say the tax cuts will add $93 billion in \n     extra debt and interest payments to the $5 trillion of red \n     ink that the nation has collected.\n       Any savings earned from balancing the budget should be used \n     to shrink the national debt, not to finance tax breaks. That \n     would be the fiscally prudent course. But, as the Finance \n     Committee has shown, politics outweighs prudence of any kind \n     these days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16674-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16674-S16675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GAMBLING FEVER\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nattached article be printed in the Record. \n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 10, 1995]\n\n                             Gambling Fever\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Harpers Ferry, W.Va--At the age of 14. I was standing on a \n     landing in the stairwell at Joan of Arc Junior High School in \n     Manhattan, watching a crap game, when I felt the heavy hand \n     of a teacher on my shoulder.\n       My protest that I didn't even have a bet down was \n     unavailing; four of us, all seniors, were branded as \n     gamblers. The shaming punishment: though permitted to be \n     graduated, I was refused a place at commencement and denied a \n     diploma.\n       That was back when gambling was viewed as wrong: when \n     bookies and numbers racketeers were considered the scum of \n     society; and when a lust for something-for-nothing was looked \n     upon as a weakness of character.\n       Today, state-sponsored gambling is the national pastime. \n     Nearly 100 million casino visitors, video gamblers and sports \n     bettors wager close to a half-trillion dollars--with $40 \n     billion going to the ``house.''\n       And today, aboriginal Americans are exploiting those of us \n     who followed in neon casinos on their reservations. The \n     tribes are becoming a nation of croupiers, in league with \n     national gambling interests, while pretending ill-gotten \n     profits are used primarily to educate their children.\n       The ``gambling industry''--none of its pious proponents \n     call it the gambling racket--is the source of the greatest \n     sustained, bipartisan political hypocrisy of our time.\n       Liberals, professing a horror of regressive taxation, turn \n     a blind eye to the way state-sponsored gambling redistributes \n     income upward, and how new casino permissions snatch welfare \n     checks to fatten per-share earnings of casino stockholders.\n       Conservatives, ostensibly upholders of public morality, \n     approve government advertising campaigns to entice citizens \n     to gamble in lotteries and play the ponies at off-track \n     betting parlors.\n       Gullible voters were sold this notion: since many people \n     liked to gamble anyway, why not turn gambling's profits to \n     public benefit?\n       But the result is the gambling epidemic, with its \n     associated money laundering by criminals, corruption of \n     public officials and ``cannibalization'' of local economics. \n     Thanks to the public blessing of gambling by government, the \n     moral stigma was removed and the high roller has become a \n     folk hero.\n       The media cannot escape their share of the blame. From the \n     hysterical hype of the Publishers Clearing House to the \n     front-page and primetime publicity given sweeptakes \n     winners (nobody covers the losers), we have glorified the \n     pernicious philosophy of something-for-nothing.\n       Nothing is for nothing. Crime always goes hand-in-hand with \n     gambling. Here in the relatively poor state of West Virginia, \n     a former governor confessed to taking bribes from racetrack \n     operators and a lottery director was jailed for rigging a \n     video lottery contract. Disgusted, church groups recently \n     leaned on legislators to reject riverboat gambling, and the \n     pols suddenly realized that a pro-casino vote could be a \n     loser.\n       Now the media are at last awakening. Gee-Whiz stories \n     touting the craze are out and hard reporting of the spreading \n     addiction is in.\n       The Economist cast into doubt the claim that gambling \n     salvages local economies. USA Today headlined: ``Nation \n     raising `a generation of gamblers,' '' focusing on the ring \n     corrupting schools in suburban Nutley, N.J. The best \n     reporting was in Sports Illustrated's detailed expose of the \n     gambling addiction rampant in the nation's colleges.\n       But television news is still gambling's friend. With young \n     gamblers relying heavily \n\n[[Page S 16675]]\n     on the sports ticker that runs at the bottom of CNN's Headline News, \n     that network has a special responsibility to show how the \n     lives of many students are being ruined by the compulsion its \n     ticker helps feed. A ``Gambling is for suckers'' crawl among \n     the scores would do for starters.\n       Will the pols sense the coming voter revulsion at the \n     ``painless'' revenue source that failed? Representative Frank \n     Wolf of Virginia has introduced a bill to establish a \n     ``National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission''; let's see \n     if the casino lobby can buy the votes to avert scrutiny and \n     resigmatizing.\n       The yen to gamble is a personal weakness, but state-\n     sponsored gambling is a banana-republic abomination that \n     undermines national values. My gratitude goes to that tough \n     teacher at Joan of Arc who stopped me before I started.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16674-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16675-S16676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OPPOSITION TO THE WELFARE BILLS IS GROWING\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as there will be no rollcall \nvotes in the Senate today, some Senators are away and may have missed \nthe open letter to the President from Marian Wright Edelman, entitled \n``Say No to This Welfare `Reform,' '' in this morning's Washington \nPost. She writes:\n\n       As President, you have the opportunity and personal \n     responsibility to protect children from unjust policies. It \n     would be a great moral and practical wrong for you to sign \n     any welfare ``reform'' bill that will push millions of \n     already poor children and families deeper into poverty, as \n     both the Senate and House welfare bills will do. It would be \n     wrong to destroy the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for \n     children, women and poor families, as both the Senate and \n     House welfare bills will do.\n\n  An accompanying Post editorial makes a further point about the Senate \nwelfare bill:\n\n       Now here is the part you need especially to know: Mr. \n     Clinton's own advisers have told him that it would likely \n     consign as many as a million more children to poverty, and it \n     would provide several billions less for child care than his \n     own proposal of a year ago. [Their italic.]\n\n  Mr. President, something important is happening here. There is a \ngrowing recognition that the Senate made a terrible mistake 6 weeks \nago. We voted 87 to 12 to repeal title IV-A of the Social Security \nAct--with almost no understanding of what the consequences might be.\n  Fortunately, the hard evidence has begun to come out. I only hope it \nis in time. Last Friday, the Los Angeles Times ran a front-page story \nabout a September 14 report prepared by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. The report, which has yet to be officially released, \nconcludes that the Senate bill would plunge 1,100,000 dependent \nchildren into poverty, and would also significantly deepen the poverty \nof children who are already living below the poverty line. I had the \nreport made a part of the Record on November 1, and I hope every \nSenator will read it carefully.\n  Another analysis will become available in official form early next \nweek. The Office of Management and Budget--in response to a request \nfrom this Senator along with Representative Sam Gibbons and 10 other \nmembers of the conference committee on welfare--will release a report \non Monday or Tuesday on the effects of the Senate and House bills on \nchildren. I fully expect that this new analysis will confirm what the \nearlier estimates indicated: either bill would be Armageddonic for \nchildren.\n  Over the years Congress may have missed opportunities to help \ndependent children, but never in our history have we calculatedly set \nout to injure them. The administration's own analysis shows that this \nis precisely what will occur under either bill now before the \nconference.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the open letter to the President from \nMarian Wright Edelman and the editorial from today's Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 3, 1995]\n\n                     Say No to This Welfare Reform\n\n                       (By Marian Wright Edelman)\n\n\n                    An open letter to the president\n\n       I am calling for your unwavering moral leadership for \n     children and opposition to Senate and House welfare and \n     Medicaid block grants, which will make more children poor and \n     sick.\n       As president, you have the opportunity and personal \n     responsibility to protect children from unjust policies. It \n     would be a great moral and practical wrong for you to sign \n     any welfare ``reform'' bill that will push millions of \n     already poor children and families deeper into poverty, as \n     both the Senate and House welfare bills will do. It would be \n     wrong to destroy the 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for \n     children, women and poor families as both the Senate and \n     House welfare bills will do.\n       It would be wrong to leave millions of voteless, voiceless \n     children to the vagaries of 50 state bureaucracies and \n     politics, as both the Senate and House bills will do. It \n     would be wrong to strip children of or weaken current ensured \n     help for their daily survival and during economic recessions \n     and natural disasters, as both the Senate and House bills \n     will do. It would be wrong to exacerbate rather than \n     alleviate the current shameful and epidemic child poverty \n     that no decent, rich nation should tolerate for even one \n     child.\n       Both the Senate and House welfare bills are morally and \n     practically indefensible. Rather than solve widespread child \n     deprivation, they simply shift the burden onto states and \n     localities with far fewer federal resources, weakened state \n     maintenance of effort and little or no state accountability. \n     As you well know, these block grants are not designed \n     primarily to help children or to make families more self-\n     sufficient. They are Trojan Horses for massive budget cuts \n     and for imposing an ideological agenda that says that \n     government assistance for the poor and children should be \n     dismantled and cut while government assistance for wealthy \n     individuals and corporations should be maintained and even \n     increased. Do you think the Old Testament prophets Isaiah, \n     Micah and Amos--or Jesus Christ--would support such policies?\n       Neither the Senate nor House welfare bill is an example of \n     the good competing with the perfect. Both are fatally flawed, \n     callous, anti-child assaults. Both bills eviscerate the moral \n     compact between the nation and its children and its poor.\n       If child investments are unfairly and indiscriminately cut \n     by many billions of dollars, there is perhaps some prospect \n     of recouping the money over time when new child suffering \n     becomes apparent, as it did after the Reagan cuts and as it \n     will this time as pending cuts are many times worse. But \n     longer-term and perhaps irreparable damage will be inflicted \n     on children if you permit to be destroyed the fundamental \n     moral principle that an American child, regardless of the \n     state or parents the child chanced to draw, is entitled to \n     protection of last resort by his or her national government. \n     If any piece of the framework or cornerstone of the laws--\n     AFDC, Medicaid, family and child nutrition--is dismantled, we \n     may not get them back in our lifetime or our children's.\n       What a tragic step backward for America when so many \n     children already are left behind. Both you and I know that \n     there are lessons from American history, including the end of \n     Reconstruction, when the immoral abandonment of structures of \n     law and equity led to decades of setbacks for powerless \n     Americans and battles we still are fighting today. What a \n     tragic irony it would be for this regressive attack on \n     children and the poor to occur on your watch. For me, this is \n     a defining moral litmus test for your presidency.\n       We cannot heal our racial divisions or prepare our nation \n     for the future unless we give poor black, brown and white \n     children a healthy and fair start in life. These pending \n     block grants will make that task so much harder. Together \n     with the proposed tax policies, they widen the income gulf \n     between America's haves and have-nots. You have spoken too \n     eloquently and worked too long for children to wipe it out \n     with your signature now.\n       It is nonsense for congressional leaders to argue that they \n     are protecting children from a future debt children did not \n     create by destroying the vital laws and investments children \n     need to live, learn and grow today. That is the domestic \n     equivalent of bombing Vietnamese villages in order to save \n     them. It is moral hypocrisy for our nation to slash income, \n     health and nutrition assistance for poor children while \n     leaving untouched hundreds of billions in corporate welfare, \n     giving new tax breaks of over $200 billion for non-needy \n     citizens, and giving the Pentagon almost $7 billion it did \n     not request.\n       The Children's Defense Fund wants welfare reform. But we \n     want fair reform that does not pick on and hurt children and \n     that provides parents jobs and safe child care. We want \n     reform that prepares our children for the new millennium--not \n     reform that pushes them back to past inequities within and \n     among states.\n       We want to ``end welfare as we know it.'' But we do not \n     want to replace it with welfare as we do not want to know it. \n     We do not want to codify a policy of national child \n     abandonment.\n       Franklin Delano Roosevelt correctly said: ``Better the \n     occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of \n     charity than the constant omissions of a government frozen in \n     the ice of its own indifference.'' Every president since \n     FDR--Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, \n     Carter, Reagan and Bush--preserved the minimal national \n     guarantee of income assistance for poor children. It is a \n     precedent I hope and trust you will uphold. What was right \n     and compassionate in FDR's day is right today and will be \n     right tomorrow.\n       There is an even higher precedent that we profess to follow \n     in our Judeo-Christian nation. The Old Testament prophets and \n     the New Testament Messiah made plain God's mandate to protect \n     the poor and the weak \n\n[[Page S 16676]]\n     and the young. The Senate and House welfare bills do not meet this \n     test.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 3, 1995]\n\n                            The Welfare Fade\n\n       Now President Clinton has walked away from the welfare bill \n     he sent to Congress last year, just as the week before he \n     renounced the tax increase he pushed to passage in 1993. What \n     next? Perhaps he'll say he didn't mean to send up last year's \n     health care reform proposals either. Mrs. Clinton made him do \n     it. It becomes increasingly difficult to know what this \n     president stands for, or whether he stands for anything.\n       Mr. Clinton telephoned the columnist and author Ben \n     Wattenberg last week. Mr. Wattenberg is a conservative \n     Democrat who thinks the party has drifted too far from \n     majority values to which it ought to return. Among much else, \n     he thought the welfare plan the president submitted last \n     summer was too weak--and guess what? The president agreed \n     with him. Mr. Wattenberg wrote in a column that Mr. Clinton \n     told him, ``I wasn't pleased with it either.''\n       The White House went to its familiar battle stations. The \n     president, after all, wouldn't want the many people in and \n     out of the administration who helped formulate the plan, to \n     say nothing of the many in Congress whom he had urged to \n     support it, to think he was abandoning them. His spokespeople \n     therefore once again had to scurry to explain what it was \n     that he had really meant. What he had really meant was that \n     the budget made him do it, his press secretary said. For lack \n     of child-care money, he hadn't been able to draw up a plan to \n     force as many mothers off the rolls as he would have liked. \n     But that's not what really happened. It's a misleading and \n     self-serving, not to say self-deluding, account of the \n     history of this bill, as fictional as was the president's \n     account of the history of the tax increase.\n       Campaigning in 1992, Mr. Clinton suggested that he would \n     force people off the welfare rolls after two years; that was \n     the top of the message, which people heard. It was followed \n     by all kinds of footnotes saying he would force them off only \n     under certain conditions. The government, as part of the \n     process of moving them off the rolls, would offer increased \n     support in the form of training, an extension of their \n     Medicaid, child care--even a job itself, if necessary. The \n     families would be off ``welfare,'' but government spending on \n     their behalf would meanwhile go up, not down. That's how it \n     has to be, of course, but in the campaign, that not-so-\n     popular part of the message was played down. One still could \n     have hoped and even believed he meant it, of course.\n       In office, the task of marrying the slogan to the footnotes \n     fell mainly to the Department of Health and Human Services. \n     The secretary hired some of the best people in the country to \n     do the work. They did it well. Last summer the president \n     loved it, or seemed to. ``If we do the things we propose in \n     this welfare reform program, even by the most conservative \n     estimates, these changes together will move one million \n     adults who would otherwise be on welfare into work or off \n     welfare altogether by the year 2000,'' he said in announcing \n     its submission.\n       But the president's plan was swept aside by Republican and \n     other congressional conservatives who pocketed his proposal \n     for time-limited welfare and went beyond it. Mr. Clinton \n     started and in a sense legitimized a process that he then \n     lacked the votes and stature to stop. No action was taken on \n     welfare last year; this year, with Republicans in command of \n     both houses, the House and Senate have passed much tougher \n     bills than Mr. Clinton proposed.\n       Both are bad by the standards the president enunciated last \n     year. They are punitive, would pull the federal floor out \n     from under welfare, could lead to the breakup of the food \n     stamp program as well, and would likely end up stranding some \n     of the most vulnerable people in the society. Most of those \n     are children. The president has nonetheless climbed aboard \n     and said he would sign the Senate version. Now here is the \n     part you need especially to know: Mr. Clinton's own advisers \n     have told him that it would likely cosign as many as a \n     million more children to poverty, and it would provide \n     several billions less for child care than his own proposal of \n     a year ago. But, well, it's better than the House bill, and \n     surely you couldn't ask a president who promised to end \n     welfare as we know it to begin the election year by vetoing a \n     welfare reform bill that he himself did so much to beget.\n       Mr. Clinton could have fought for the right result on \n     welfare. He knows the issues by heart; he has the power; and \n     when he still had the courage to voice them, he had the \n     better arguments. What he has done instead is acquiesce for \n     political reasons in the wrong result--and then give false \n     reasons for the acquiescence. He thinks he gains by such \n     behavior, but he diminishes himself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16675-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        FLAG-DESECRATION AMENDMENT COULD MAKE MATTERS FAR WORSE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, George Anastaplo, who teaches law at \nthe Loyola University of Chicago, is a longtime battler for first \namendment rights. Recently, he had an item in the Chicago Sun-Times \nabout the flag amendment to the Constitution that we will be \nconfronting before too long.\n  One of the points he mentions is that the amendment in the \nConstitution would elevate the flag above the Constitution. It does \nstrike me as ironic that flag desecration would be enshrined in the \nConstitution, while if you burn the Constitution, nothing happens. \nShould we then have another amendment for that? And perhaps another \namendment for anyone who would burn the Bible? Where does this stop?\n  I also have noted flags made into shirts and even pants. I confess, I \nfind this offensive, but I don't think we need to amend the \nConstitution because of offensive conduct.\n  I ask that the George Anastaplo item be printed in the Record.\n\n              [From the Chicago Sun-Times, Sept. 11, 1995]\n\n        Flag-Desecration Amendment Could Make Matters Far Worse\n\n                         (By George Anastaplo)\n\n       The occasional flag-burning display permitted during the \n     last decade by the U.S. Supreme Court is generally offensive. \n     But the proposed constitutional amendment authorizing the \n     government to punish physical abuse or desecration of the \n     flag may make matters far worse, however patriotic the \n     motives of the amendment's sponsors.\n       One implication of such an amendment is that all other \n     forms of desecration in this country would be thereafter \n     considered beyond government supervision. Also, the flag \n     would be elevated above the Constitution, even though that \n     document alone is granted special status in the Constitution. \n     (Every federal and state officer of government in this \n     country is required to take an oath to support the \n     Constitution of the United States.)\n       A likely effect of legislation grounded in the proposed \n     flag-desecration amendment would be to increase the number of \n     publicized flag-burnings in this country. Those impassioned \n     flag-burners who want to provoke the authorities to act \n     against them are protected, and in effect discouraged, these \n     days by Supreme Court rulings.\n       Routine abuses of the flag will continue, no matter what \n     the Constitution and laws happen to say. Most of these \n     abuses, keyed to commercial exploitation, have always been \n     ignored by a public that is aroused only by those abuses that \n     take the form of hostile flag burnings. Highly selective \n     official enforcement of flag-desecration laws, even if a \n     constitutional amendment should be ratified, would continue \n     to raise First Amendment issues.\n       The proposed flag-desecration amendment is but the latest \n     of a series of exercises in constitutional frivolity that \n     have diverted recent Congresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16676-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16676-S16677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       OUTREACH TO THE SMALL AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS COMMUNITY\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

I was extremely pleased to see nearly 80 \nFederal agencies and private corporations participate as exhibitors in \nthe fair, providing hundreds of small business owners an opportunity to \nunderstand the rules governing Federal and private contracting, as well \nas how and where to look for contracting opportunities. This fair, \nmodeled on an old-fashioned trade fair, will help bridge the gap that \nhas existed between the small and disadvantaged business community and \nkey procurement staff within the government and private sector.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services was one of many Federal \nagencies who shared important procurement information at the fair. I \nthank them for their participation and commend the Department of Health \nand Human Services on their active efforts to reach out to small, \ndisadvantaged, and women-owned businesses.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of remarks by Mr. John \nCallahan, Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, be printed in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n                     Statement of John J.

I bring you \n     greetings and well wishes from Secretary Shalala and Deputy \n     Secretary Walter Broadnax for a most successful gathering. \n     They would like to commend Senator Carol Moseley-Braun for \n     her efforts in putting together this Federal Procurement Fair \n     and Congressman Donald Payne as Chairman of  \n\n[[Page S 16677]]\n\n     the Caucus during this 25th legislative forum weekend.\n       I would like to convey HHS' strong commitment to the \n     participation of small businesses and small disadvantaged \n     businesses in the work of our department. HHS has an \n     outstanding record in this field, and has steadily increased \n     the number of prime and subcontract awards being made to \n     small businesses in general, and to small disadvantaged \n     businesses in particular.\n       Our top staff who are here today, Ms. LaVarne Burton, our \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget Policy Initiatives, and \n     Mr. Verl Zanders, the head of the Department's OSDBU, made it \n     a special point to insure that HHS maintains a strong \n     commitment to the participation of small and disadvantaged \n     businesses in the HHS federal acquisition process. Let me \n     just give you a few highlights of our effort.\n       Our Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization \n     establishes and maintains outreach programs to provide a flow \n     of information about HHS' Small Business Programs to small, \n     small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. OSDBU staff \n     provided personal counseling and marketing assistance to over \n     2,500 interested small businesses during Fiscal Year 1994.\n       OSDBU also developed and distributed 8,000 copies of \n     various publications designed to assist individuals and \n     organizations in understanding our mission and programs of \n     HHS.\n       In Fiscal Year 1994, HHS awarded approximately 41 percent \n     (over $1.2 billion), of its total acquisition awards to small \n     businesses; and of that amount approximately 13 percent (over \n     $390 million) was awarded to small disadvantaged businesses. \n     We think this is particularly noteworthy.\n       In addition, small disadvantaged businesses received \n     approximately 8.2 percent ($31 million) of the total \n     subcontracting dollars from prime contracts awarded by the \n     Department.\n       Historically, HHS has exceeded all of the statutory goals \n     for small business participation on a consistent basis.\n       These achievements are made possible because of broad \n     institutional acceptance and support of these programs \n     throughout the Department.\n       HHS remains committed to the development and expansion of \n     acquisition opportunities which can, and will, encourage many \n     more small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses to \n     participate in our programs.\n       In short, we are proud to be a part of one of the best \n     small and small disadvantaged business programs in \n     government!\n       I would also like to remind everyone about the HHS exhibit \n     table which is staffed by our Departmental small business \n     experts who will have various printed materials and \n     information on hand.

Mr. President, Kristina Ford, the executive \ndirector of the New Orleans City Planning Commission, had an op-ed \npiece in the New York Times about casino gambling in New Orleans. \nBecause it touches on a subject that we have not seriously examined as \na nation, I believe it merits the attention of my colleagues.\n  Let me remind you also that Senator Lugar and I have a bill in to \nestablish a commission to take an 18-month look at where we are and \nwhere we should go in this whole question of legalized gambling.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 18, 1995]\n\n                           Betting on a Loser\n\n                           (By Kristina Ford)\n\n       New Orleans.--In New York State, opposition to gambling has \n     crumbled in the face of a budget that apparently is to be \n     balanced by windfalls from games of chance. Keno is trumpeted \n     as a solution to the state's $5 billion deficit, and both the \n     tourist-hungry Catskills and Niagara Falls hope for casinos. \n     Promises of prosperity have also paved the way for a casino \n     in Bridgeport, Conn.\n       After the oil and gas industry largely abandoned the New \n     Orleans area a decade ago, we heard similar stories, and we \n     can offer advice to lawmakers who believe their fiscal \n     problems can be solved by a roll of the dice.\n       This week, just five months after Harrah's opened a casino \n     here, The New Orleans Times-Picayune characterized it as \n     ``beleaguered.'' It is bringing in only a third of the \n     projected $33 million monthly revenue.\n       The whole gaming experiment here has been disappointing. \n     Two of our four riverboat gambling operations have failed and \n     another is reported to be sinking. Casino operators are \n     seeking waivers from city building regulations that were \n     designed to preserve the historic French Quarter from gaudy \n     marketing schemes more appropriate to the Las Vegas strip.\n       Two years ago, when the city planning commission asked \n     casino operators what effects they predicted for New Orleans, \n     they gave us revenue projections based on Harrah's \n     experiences in Atlantic City, a city very different from ours \n     in demographics and spirit. They also claimed there would be \n     no limit to the demand for gambling, saying the proof was in \n     the state of Mississippi, where riverboat profits were paying \n     off their loans in 12 months and cities were reducing \n     property taxes. (Seven of the Mississippi gambling boats have \n     failed since then.)\n       Despite the assurances, we knew that legalized gambling is \n     at best a crapshoot whose projected effects are most \n     frequently stated in terms of anecdotes, cooked-up numbers \n     and promises. The one clearly foreseeable result--families \n     bankrupted by parents with uncontrollable urges to gamble--is \n     often overlooked.\n       Public policy should not depend on who can fashion bigger \n     promises but on how gambling will really effect a city. Yet \n     as we debated the issue, it was impossible to get a clear \n     picture of how it would transform civic life. Would it \n     increase or decrease our considerable crime rate? What would \n     be the effect on our poorest neighborhoods? How would it \n     effect our essential tourist business?\n       So the city has instituted a five-year study to assess what \n     gambling will do to our fiscal well-being and community life. \n     We will study how the industry has affected other businesses, \n     determine whether tourists perceive the city's attractions \n     differently now and measure the consequences of gambling on \n     families. Harrah's is paying for the research, but the work \n     is being conducted by a consortium of local universities, \n     which will make annual reports.\n       Arguments over casino regulation will dominate the City \n     Council's agenda for years.

Mr. President, the former U.S. Ambassador to \nSomalia, Frank Crigler, had an op-ed piece in the Washington Post on \nSomalia.\n  The first few paragraphs may have been written tongue-in-cheek. I am \nnot sure. If not, Ambassador Crigler is wrong.\n  But the remaining three-fourths of his op-ed piece are correct.\n  When he talks about ``the Somalia disaster,'' if he is referring to \nwhat we did, there is no question that hundreds of thousands of lives \nwere saved. I do not count that a disaster.\n  Some mistakes were made. We had a retired American military officer, \nacting for the United Nations, who made some decisions that probably \nlooked correct from a military point of view, but would not have been \nmade had he consulted with former Ambassador Robert Oakley. That \ndecision resulted in the needless deaths of 19 American service \npersonnel, 1 of whom we saw dragged through the streets on our \ntelevision sets. The combination of this repulsive action, and our \nbeing there to help save lives, caused many in Congress to say that we \nshould pull our troops out. In reality, in 1993, there were more cab \ndrivers killed in New York City than American service personnel killed \nin Somalia.\n  Ambassador Crigler describes the Somalia action as ``George Bush's \nembarrassing last hurrah,'' my own guess is that history will view it \nas his finest hour. George Bush made the right decision, a courageous \ndecision. Without that decision, many lives would have been lost, and \nthe attitude in the Moslem nations of the world, would have hardened \nagainst the United States. They would have rightly sensed that if \nSomalia had been a white, Christian, or Jewish nation, the United \nStates would have responded. Ambassador Crigler says that the Somalia \naction ``was Bill Clinton's first big foreign policy flop.'' There is \nsome truth to that. It is difficult to move from Governor of Arkansas \nto become the most influential person in foreign policy, particularly \nif you have not been interested in foreign policy that much prior to \nthis occasion. Had Bill Clinton been able to explain to the American \npeople why we were there and that we were going to stay there for a \nwhile until some semblance of order was restored, the American people \nwould have understood, and American leadership would have become more \ntrusted in the world.\n  In terms of the three basic lessons that Ambassador Crigler mentions, \nhe \n\n[[Page S 16678]]\nis right on No. 1: ``Overwhelming military force can help to halt \nfighting, end suffering and save lives. Hundreds of thousands of lives, \nin fact.''\n  He is right on No. 2: ``You cannot do peacemaking unless you swallow \nthe risk, go where the fighting is and dirty your shoes.'' One of the \ndifficulties of our foreign policy right now is that there has been a \nreal reluctance to recognize that risk-taking is part of leadership. \nYou cannot maintain stability in the city of Chicago without having the \npolice take risks, and you cannot maintain stability in the world \nwithout those in the Armed Forces also taking risks.\n  Lesson No. 3 is: ``Even overwhelming force cannot solve another \npeople's political problems. They must do that for themselves.''\n  I do not question that, if it is properly understood, but it could be \nused as a reason for not acting responsibly in Bosnia, for example. No. \n3 needs to be rephrased in order to be universally applicable.\n  I ask that the article by Ambassador Frank Crigler be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 15, 1995]\n\n  Return to Somalia--In a Land Americans Want To Forget, Some Modest \n                            Signs of Success\n\n                           (By Frank Crigler)\n\n       Baidoa, Somalia.--Last month, far away from this forlorn \n     ``City of Death'' where anarchy and hunger had once claimed \n     tens of thousands of lives, Gen. Colin Powell said some \n     remarkably upbeat things about our military misadventures in \n     Somalia. That Powell was willing to talk about the subject at \n     all was newsworthy. Most people would just as soon forget the \n     Somalia disaster.\n       For Republicans, Somalia was George Bush's embarrassing \n     last hurrah; for Democrats, it was Bill Clinton's first big \n     foreign policy flop. And for the average American, it was one \n     more example of foolish leaders getting our fine young troops \n     killed in places they never should have been sent.\n       But for Colin Powell, Somalia had been this nation's first \n     grand attempt at humanitarian military intervention, and it \n     taught some lessons worth remembering--some we might want to \n     review as we debate sending our troops to Bosnia on yet \n     another rescue mission.\n       Powell's argument, in a nutshell, is that we were right to \n     answer the 911 fire alarm when the Somalis' house was burning \n     down. But we should not have hung around afterward pretending \n     to solve domestic squabbles we didn't understand.\n       ``Where things went wrong is when we decided, the U.N. \n     decided, that somehow we could tell the Somalians how they \n     should live with each other. At that point we lost the \n     bubble,'' Powell said in an interview with The Washington \n     Post, offering an odd but apt description of the tragic \n     sequel to Operation Restore Hope.\n       It's now been six months since the last U.N. peacekeeping \n     troops retreated in frustration from Somalia. Almost all \n     civilian relief agencies and non-governmental personnel left \n     with them or soon after. Almost everyone predicted that \n     without their help, Somalia would quickly sink back into its \n     nightmarish misery.\n       Little was left to show for the enormous investment in \n     time, money and human lives we and our allies had made trying \n     to put this East African Humpty Dumpty back together. The \n     country still lay in ruins, with no functioning government, \n     no public services, no viable economy, no judicial system. \n     The feuding clan warlords who had trashed it still ruled in \n     their fiefdoms, unbowed and uncompromising, making and \n     breaking alliances among themselves.\n       What surprised me when I returned here a few weeks ago, \n     however, was that Somalia had refused to relapse into its \n     earlier spasms of violence. Inexplicably, the truce U.S. \n     Ambassador Robert Oakley compelled the feuding warlords to \n     sign back in December 1992 (with the robust backing of nearly \n     30,000 heavily armed allied troops) generally seemed to be \n     holding. People were not starving again. As Powell himself \n     noted, ``There has been no image of swollen-bellied kids on \n     our CNN screens [after all].''\n       Somalia Lesson No. 1: Overwhelming military force can help \n     to halt fighting, end suffering and save lives. Hundreds of \n     thousands of lives, in fact.\n       I wanted to see what was happening for myself, so when one \n     of the warlords invited me to come take a look, I jumped at \n     the chance. Five others--among them a respected U.S. \n     historian, two clerical types looking for a responsible \n     agency to distribute medical supplies from their parishioners \n     and an American entrepreneur hoping to sell a telephone \n     system--accepted his invitation as well, all of us willing to \n     risk being ``used'' for public relations purposes in order to \n     judge the state of things first-hand.\n       Our host was the most celebrated warlord of them all, a man \n     with a PR problem to rival that of Attila the Hun: Gen. \n     Mohamed Farah Aideed. But his people told us that \n     ``President'' Aideed (his clan confederates had bestowed the \n     title on him in June, shortly after the last U.N. \n     peacekeepers fled) wanted to make a new start with Americans.\n       At the outset, anyway, Aideed's new Somalia seemed a lot \n     like his old one. When en route to Africa, we'd heard reports \n     that his heavily armed militia forces had captured Baidoa as \n     part of a major new military offensive. Trapped there as \n     virtual hostages were said to be 23 foreign relief workers \n     (including five Americans) loosely affiliated with U.N. aid \n     agencies.\n       Unanimously, our group determined that we were not going to \n     let our visit be used to sanction hostage-taking, and we sent \n     word ahead that we wouldn't budge from Nairobi until the \n     United Nations itself assured us the relief workers were safe \n     and sound. Soon a reply came back via the United Nations that \n     everything had been sorted out and the ``hostages'' were free \n     to go where they pleased. So we proceeded directly to Baidoa, \n     hoping to help evacuate those who wished to leave and then \n     get on with our own visit.\n       But there were no grateful relief workers in sight when we \n     landed, no welcoming committee, no explanation. Instead, \n     armed militiamen trundled us off to the general's field \n     headquarters and dumped us without ceremony in the middle of \n     a presidential Cabinet meeting. It was instantly apparent \n     that a high-level debate was raging over what to do with the \n     unfortunate relief workers, our friends from the United \n     Nations--and now ourselves.\n       On one side of the debate were ranged an assortment of \n     senior ``state security'' agents whose type I knew well from \n     my previous service in Somalia (I realized I had not missed \n     them one bit). The agents, we learned, had discovered \n     evidence that some of the foreigners were suspiciously cozy \n     with trouble-making dissidents in Baidoa. This group was \n     urging Aideed not to release them until charges were \n     thoroughly investigated.\n       Ranged on the other side were, let's say, an \n     ``internationalist'' faction concerned about the \n     embarrassment of yet another incident with the United \n     Nations, particularly in the eyes of the distinguished guests \n     who had just arrived. This group was urging a more statesman-\n     like approach on Aideed, and we did what we could to \n     reinforce their arguments.\n       With occasional concessions and much posturing, the debate \n     ran on for two more days. In the end it was Aideed who \n     stepped forward with a grand face-saving compromise, \n     dismissed the rumors, released the detainees and even \n     apologized to the United Nation and to us for the \n     ``misunderstanding'' his overzealous security agents had \n     caused. Maybe we were going to see a ``new'' Somalia after \n     all!\n       As for us distinguished visitors, we felt we had validated \n     another timely precept:\n       Somalia Lesson No. 2: You can't do peacemaking unless you \n     swallow the risk, go where the fighting is and dirty your \n     shoes.\n       As promised, Aideed made himself quite accessible, so we \n     took advantage to question him more closely about his Baidoa \n     offensive. He bridled when we used the word ``capture,'' \n     however. He had only come to mediate a local clan dispute, he \n     insisted, not to impose his rule or grab territory. There was \n     no need to ``capture'' a town whose people had long ago \n     joined his camp.\n       He pointed out, and we had to agree, that we had seen no \n     signs of recent fighting in Baidoa and that its streets and \n     shops were full of people peacefully going about their \n     business.\n       He reminded us that he had spent most of the previous day \n     and night in marathon meetings with local clan elders, \n     working to untangle the strands of their dispute (the very \n     one in which our relief workers were alleged to have \n     meddled).\n       He also reminded us that we'd watched thousands cheer his \n     promises of political peace, regional autonomy, a free market \n     economy and multiparty elections at a rally staged to welcome \n     him at the Baidoa soccer field. Did they look to us like \n     ``captured people?'' he asked.\n       (We granted him these points, although I still suspect what \n     we saw was more akin to Powell's doctrine of overwhelming \n     military superiority: Deploy enough firepower, and even your \n     bitterest enemies will turn out to cheer for you.)\n       With the ``hostage'' crisis resolved, our group was finally \n     able to take the closer look we'd come for. In and around \n     Baidoa, much of what we saw looked like the same old Somalia \n     to me--battered buildings, broken-down trucks, burned-out \n     warehouses.\n       But if you squinted just right, you could see some \n     encouraging signs too: City streets were crowded, tea shops \n     thriving, markets bustling. Goods seemed plentiful for those \n     who could pay, and people seemed relaxed and friendly to \n     outsiders.\n       Later, on the highway down to the coast, we found buses and \n     trucks piled high with passengers coming from somewhere, \n     merchandise going elsewhere. But we also saw more signs of \n     serious fighting between two subclans whose dispute Aideed \n     claimed he was attempting to resolve, and sensed more \n     nervousness on the part of our escorts.\n       But in the agricultural heartland at Afgoi and along the \n     Shebeli River, we passed sorghum fields carefully banked and \n     plated, sesame and cotton growing tall, citrus for sale in \n     heaps on the highway, barrels of ripe tomatoes on donkey \n     carts bananas ripening, camels copulating and cattle \n     fattening for shipment to Red Sea butcher shops.\n       And in Mogadishu at last (where some areas were still ``off \n     limits''), we pushed through incredible traffic jams and ate \n     at crowed restaurants. Ships were loading bananas in the \n     port. The central market was \n\n[[Page S 16679]]\n     teeming, protected by its own private police force. The Somali shilling \n     was trading at stable rates--with no protection at all. And a \n     half-dozen crude newspapers were circulating freely.\n       Most hopeful of all, we saw practically no guns on the \n     street and heard almost none at night. Disarmament, the \n     elusive goal of American and U.N. peacekeepers, finally \n     seemed to be occurring in their absence, perhaps \n     spontaneously.\n       To be sure, the only schools operating were Koranic \n     schools. The only regularly scheduled air service carried \n     bales of khat, the Somalis' narcotic of choice. The only \n     telephones were satellite links. The only electricity came \n     from noisy private generators, though it was often shared \n     among neighbors. The only water came from private wells, and \n     there wasn't much of it.\n       Hospitals were dismal and might as well have been closed. \n     Drugs cost a fortune. Rubble and wreckage still choked the \n     streets. Some buildings had been cleaned up windows replaced \n     and shell holes patched, but we saw little major renovation. \n     And the big problem on everyone's mind was how to create jobs \n     for the youngsters who'd gone to war instead of to school. In \n     a word, there was more poverty than progress in Aideed's \n     ``new'' Somalia--but at least no one seemed to be starving.\n       Was this just a ``show'' for foreign guests, as several \n     Aideed critics whispered to us? Or were Somalis themselves \n     finally putting their nation and their political system back \n     together again, absent our help?\n       As Powell observed of the people here: ``They had been \n     solving their political problems for a thousand years before \n     Jeffersonian democracy came upon the scene.''\n       Somalia Lesson No. 3: Even overwhelming force can't solve \n     another people's political problems. They must do that for \n     themselves.\n       When we lunched with Aideed one afternoon before leaving \n     Baidoa, I read him some excerpts from The Post's interview \n     with his old adversary. He was fascinated. It was no surprise \n     that he agreed with Powell's central point: We should have \n     stopped while we were ahead.\n       But what bothered Aideed wasn't so much our arrogance as \n     our ignorance. ``I think if Americans had tried to understand \n     our system, our traditions, our history, our way of life \n     before sending troops and experts into Somalia to change \n     everything,'' he reflected, ``we would still be close \n     friends.''\n       Perhaps. But it was fortunate for Somalia that Americans \n     hurried to lend a helping hand, even as we were slow to \n     understand how a nation can collapse in turmoil and misery. \n     Had we delayed our intervention until we ``understood'' the \n     conflict's root causes, many thousands more would have died \n     and clan warfare might yet be raging.\n       Gen. Powell would probably agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16677-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HEAD-IN-THE-SAND FOREIGN POLICY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Washington Post on Monday, \nOctober 16, 1995, ran a column by Jessica Mathews that is absolutely on \ntarget.\n  My colleagues have heard me speak before about the need for a more \nresponsible foreign policy.\n  I thought it was particularly fascinating to note the quotation in \nthe Jessica Mathews column that it costs $600 million less to run the \nUnited Nations than it does the New York City police department.\n  How foolish we are to fail to do what we should in support of a more \nenlightened and responsible international policy.\n  I ask that the Jessica Mathews column be printed in the Record at \nthis point, and I urge my colleagues to read it.\n  The column follows:\n\n                    Head-in-the-Sand Foreign Policy\n\n                          (By Jessica Mathews)\n\n       A dispassionate foreign observer of Congress's budget \n     choices would have to conclude that Americans' only \n     international aspiration is to be global policemen. Or, to be \n     scrupulously fair, policeman with a handout for refugees and \n     the most wretched victims of disaster.\n       That isn't what Americans want, but its' what--unless \n     drastic adjustments are made in the next few weeks of \n     bargaining--they're going to get. In both the House and \n     Senate versions of next year's budget every means of keeping \n     the peace short of military action and every other cost of \n     international leadership or national self-interest--\n     political, economic, environmental, humanitarian--is stripped \n     to near or below the minimum while more money than the \n     Pentagon thinks it can usefully spend is crammed down it \n     throat.\n       In round numbers, Congress has added $7 billion to a $220 \n     billion military total that already dwarfs what all of the \n     rest of the world outside NATO spends on defense. Meanwhile, \n     in the name of deficit reduction, it is planning to cut $3 \n     billion to $4 billion from all other international spending. \n     That may not sound like much but it amounts to 15 percent to \n     20 percent of the $20 billion total in international affairs \n     spending and includes reductions for most international \n     agencies of 25 percent to 60 percent.\n       The cuts mean that U.S. embassies and consulates will close \n     when a globalizing economy and more independent countries \n     mean that more should be opening. They translate into fewer \n     foreign service officers, hamstrung diplomacy and less of the \n     most cost-efficient means of intelligence gathering. They \n     mean long lines and poor services for Americans at home and \n     abroad. All of that is tolerable, if neither sensible nor \n     necessary, given defense increases.\n       What will really hurt American interests--indeed already \n     has--are the cuts to the United Nations, the World Bank's \n     fund for the poorest countries and the host of small \n     international agencies that provide hundreds of services \n     Americans need and value and underpin agreements that both \n     parties have spent years of tough negotiating to achieve.\n       Where the cuts are in dues for which the United States is \n     legally committed, as are its U.N. dues, the cost will be \n     measured in an unraveling of international law not limited to \n     finances. If the United States can renege on its funding \n     obligations why can't X on Y (fill in the country and topic \n     of your choice)?\n       Even where the cuts are in voluntary contributions, the \n     result of a U.S. pull back from the international community \n     along a front that reaches from peacekeeping to environmental \n     protection will be a declining interest on the part of other \n     countries in supporting U.S. initiatives. That will fuel \n     further disenchantment in the United States etc., with \n     results that no one wants.\n       The cycle has already begun. The United States owes the \n     U.N. $1.5 billion, a debt that threatens to tip that \n     institution into insolvency. The U.N. is limping along by not \n     paying what it owes to contractors and to countries that \n     supply its peacekeeping troops. In effect, the likes of \n     Pakistan and Bangladesh are covering our bad check.\n       Congress wants to see organizational reforms at the U.N. \n     before it will consider even a partial payment. But for the \n     rest of the world, the No. 1 item on the agenda is that a \n     country that can afford to do so does not pay its dues year \n     after year. As Britain's foreign secretary remarked to an \n     appreciative audience, the United States seems to want \n     ``representation without taxation.''\n       Part of what has brought us to this sorry pass is too many \n     years of cheap shot--and now almost obligatory--political \n     rhetoric that has inflated the self-evident need for U.N. \n     reform into a problem of unrecognizable dimensions in the \n     minds of most Americans. Even while defending the U.N., U.S. \n     Ambassador Madeline Albright called it ``elephantine.'' It \n     took Australia's Gareth Evans to provide some perspective by \n     pointing out that the U.N.'s secretariat and core functions \n     (in New York, Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and the Hague) cost \n     $600 million less than the New York City Police Department. \n     Adding the development, environment and population agencies, \n     the huge refugee operation, UNICEF and others, the total is \n     still less than Congress's defense add-on.\n       Having launched a last-minute effort to reduce U.N. funds \n     and the rest of the international affairs budget, the \n     administration is battling a sentiment it helped create by \n     blaming the United Nations for its own mistakes in Somalia \n     and Bosnia, and an attitude on the part of congressional \n     freshmen for which the politest description is a profound and \n     willful ignorance of America's role in the world, its \n     obligations, its interests and what it takes to meet them.\n       However long it takes, this struggle deserves attention and \n     public support. No American doubts the need for a superlative \n     military. But it should be obvious by now that the best-armed \n     force in the world cannot meet more than a fraction of the \n     threats of the post-Cold War world nor help seize most of its \n     opportunities. An America served by a rich military budget \n     and impoverished funding for every other international \n     function will be a country both poorer and less secure than \n     it should be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16679-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16679-S16680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ALL BETTER NOW\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a longtime friend who headed my \nIllinois operation for many years and still is associated with me, \nJerry Sinclair, once again showed why he is a valuable friend by \nsending a column that appeared in World Business in their September-\nOctober 1995 issue.\n  It deals with the Canadian health care system written by Diane \nFrancis, the editor of Canada's foremost business newspaper, the \nFinancial Post. It views things from a business perspective. She is the \nauthor of five books on business.\n  Ms. Francis spells out very clearly why the Canadian health care \nsystem is far superior to the United States system.\n  The propaganda spread against the Canadian system here in the United \nStates by those who profit from the present system terribly distorts \nwhat the Canadians have. This column helps to balance that.\n  I would add, in the last poll I saw of Canadian citizens, exactly 3 \npercent of them said they would prefer the United States system of \nhealth care to theirs. That does not, as this column points out, \nsuggest there are no problems with the Canadian system. But they \ndeliver superior health care to their \n\n[[Page S 16680]]\ncitizens. We spend more and do a worse job.\n  Ms. Francis quotes a Peat Marwick 1995 study titled, ``A Comparison \nof Business Costs in Canada and the United States.''\n  Listen to this analysis: ``Costs of hospitals, surgical, medical, and \nmajor medical insurance premiums are the prime reason for the \ndifference in costs. These insurance premiums represent a cost of 8.2 \npercent of gross pay in the United States compared with 1.0 percent in \nCanada.''\n  American businesses who, frankly, fell down on the job, when they \nshould have been backing the Clinton plan, ought to be taking a good \nlook at what is happening in Canada.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Diane Francis column be printed in \nthe Congressional Record at this point.\n  The column follows:\n\n                             All Better Now\n\n       Among the health care systems of the world's wealthiest \n     industrialized countries, the United States' is the most \n     expensive; even worse, it fails to provide health care for \n     all Americans. Canada, on the other hand, provides excellent, \n     comprehensive coverage to all of its citizens. Its system, \n     administered jointly by the federal government and the twelve \n     provincial governments, provides Canadian business with an \n     enormous competitive advantage. And yet vested interest in \n     the United States--including doctors, privately owned health \n     care facilities, and insurance companies--have lobbied \n     against government systems such as Canada's. They say that \n     Canadians must wait months for procedures. This is simply not \n     the case. They would also have Americans believe that \n     Canadian hospitals are second-rate, and that Canadian \n     physicians are poorly trained. These are also not so.\n       The same type of lobbying took place in Canada in the late \n     1960s, when the government-run plan was first implemented. It \n     is interesting to note that Vice President Al Gore became a \n     fan of Canada's health system after his seriously brain-\n     injured son was successfully operated on in Toronto by one of \n     the world's best neurosurgical pediatrics teams.\n       A look at the facts leaves little doubt that the Canadian \n     system is superior. An average of 6.3 out of every 1,000 \n     babies born die before the age of 1 in Canada, as opposed to \n     8.3 in the United States. Life expectancies in Canada are 81 \n     years for women and 74.5 for men, compared with 78.9 and 72.1 \n     years, respectively, in the United States. Yet the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an \n     international monitoring group, reports that while Canada \n     spends just 10.2 percent of its gross domestic product on \n     health care services for all its citizens, the United States \n     spends 14.1 percent and still has millions of citizens with \n     inadequate or nonexistent coverage.\n       It isn't just the individual that benefits from Canada's \n     comprehensive health program. The Canadian system affords \n     business many advantages, including reduced employee costs \n     and an expanded, healthier labor pool. According to a March \n     1995 study by KPMG Peat Marwick called ``A Comparison of \n     Business Costs in Canada and the United States,'' Canadian \n     employers spend less on employer-sponsored benefits than \n     their American counterparts. ``Costs for hospital, surgical, \n     medical and major medical insurance premiums are the prime \n     reason for the difference in costs,'' the study says. ``These \n     insurance premiums represent a cost of 8.2% of gross pay in \n     the United States compared with 1.0% in Canada.''\n       Unlike in the United States, Canadian health coverage is \n     not tied to welfare benefits; unskilled workers can take low-\n     paying entry-level jobs without fear of losing access to \n     government-paid health care. This removes the possibility \n     of creating an entrenched underclass with health problems \n     who are handcuffed to welfare because of medical-cost \n     issues.\n       Businesses in Canada are also able to hire workers \n     regardless of their health history. This is particularly \n     important when it comes to using the talents and efforts of \n     senior citizens, or people with chronic illnesses. Canadian \n     workers aren't trapped in dead-end or unsatisfactory jobs \n     because they are afraid of losing company-provided health \n     benefits.\n       Reduced labor costs are not the only corporate benefit of \n     the Canadian system. Individuals rarely file the type of \n     high-stakes personal injury lawsuits commonly seen in the \n     United States. Because all citizens are guaranteed quality \n     medical care, catastrophic medical expenses, generally the \n     largest component of a settlement, are usually not sought \n     when such suits are filed. In the United States, product \n     liability insurance converge costs corporations upwards of \n     $500 million a year, and the premiums are growing by 20 \n     percent to 30 percent annually. Insurance costs are \n     dramatically lower in Canada--unless a manufacturer is \n     exporting to the United States.\n       Canada's government-run workers' compensation plan is \n     managed by the provincial governments, in contrast to the \n     patchwork quilt of private and public systems at various \n     levels of government in the United States. The workers' \n     compensation premium for a Canadian autoworker in London, \n     Ontario, is 4.56-percent of his or her wages; for an American \n     autoworker in Minneapolis, it is 9.07 percent, according to \n     the KPMG comparative report.\n       Business should be free to conduct business, and in Canada \n     this is so. There is no need for every company to have \n     personnel employed just to handle the paper burden of \n     private-sector workers' compensation or health care.\n       Canada's systems is not perfect; nor is Canadian business \n     able to outcompete American business at every turn as a \n     result of cradle-to-grave medical care for its population. \n     But the advantages to citizen and business alike are very \n     real. And as American health care costs outpace economic \n     growth and the country's population ages, a dose of Canadian \n     medicine may cure what ails it. Failing that, the United \n     States' system will make its insured workers increasingly \n     expensive to employ and its uninsured workers increasingly \n     unable to afford proper health care.\n       Diane Francis is editor of Canada's foremost business \n     newspaper, The Financial Post, and the author of five books \n     on business.

Mr. President, Recently, the Wall Street Journal \nhad an article that deals with sports; but much more important than \nthat, it deals with where we are in our society and what one \nenlightened leader, Coach Lou Tepper, is doing to bridge the gap that \nexists between people in our society.\n  The leadership he is showing on this is leadership that should \nprovide an example to coaches all over the country, not simply to \ncoaches but to schools, churches, civic organizations, and many other \ngroups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article by \nFrederick C. Klein be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 13, 1995]\n\n            Racial Harmony Is Contact Sport for Illini Coach\n\n                        (By Frederick C. Klein)\n\n       Champaign, IL.--By now, I think, most people have come to \n     understand that the interracial harmony they see on fields of \n     play is more apparent than real. Black and white teammates \n     may exchange high-fives or even hugs to celebrate moments of \n     triumph, but once the games are over they go their separate \n     ways, in keeping with the patterns of the society as a whole.\n       Mention race relations to people in sports in any capacity, \n     and the likely response is a shrug. Few volunteer to discuss \n     the subject, and when it does come up it's quickly brushed \n     off. The unspoken but clear consensus is that teams exist to \n     win games, and what their members do on their own time is \n     their own business.\n       There is, however, at least one exception to this rule. Lou \n     Tepper, the head football coach at the University of Illinois \n     in this city amid the cornfields 150 miles south of Chicago, \n     believes that as long as young men must get along on the \n     gridiron in order to succeed, it'd be a shame if they didn't \n     get to know one another better in other ways. He's made \n     racial integration a part of his program, requiring his \n     players to promise to get to know teammates of the other race \n     and putting them in situations that promote such contact.\n       ``This is a university, and I'm here as an educator,'' he \n     says. ``I think there ought to be more to the sports \n     experience than what appears in the box scores.''\n       Lest anyone get the impression that the earnest, \n     bespectacled Mr. Tepper is insufficiently concerned with X's \n     and O's--a high crime in big-time-college-coaching circles--\n     he's quick to set them straight. His record is 21-19-1. He \n     puts in the 100-hour weeks that are standard at his level of \n     his profession, and goes around honorably bleary-eyed from \n     his scrutiny of game films. He tells a recent visitor that \n     the only reason he has time for more than a quick chat \n     about next Saturday Illinois foe is that, on the week in \n     question, there was none, his team having that Saturday \n     off.\n       That said, however, he became more expansive. ``Maybe I \n     come at coaching from a different perspective than some \n     people,'' he remarked. ``Maybe I come at life that way, \n     too.''\n       That life began 50 years ago in Keystone, PA., a hamlet 50 \n     miles south of, and, maybe, 30 years behind, Pittsburgh. \n     Sixty-one people lived in Keystone at the time, and 31 of \n     them were his relatives. His father, whose education ended \n     with the eighth grade, was a janitor, and his family lived on \n     and worked a plot of land he calls ``too small to be a farm \n     but too big to be a garden.''\n       On his first day at the area's consolidated high school, an \n     hour's bus ride from his home, he learned what it was like to \n     be an outsider. ``I found out quick I was a bumpkin,'' he \n     says. ``I talked and dressed different from the other kids. I \n     smelled different, too; that happens when you start your day \n     feeding pigs and chickens. Being an athlete helped me gain \n     acceptance, but I've never forgotten how it felt to be an \n     object of prejudice.''\n\n[[Page S 16681]]\n\n       Mr. Tepper says that feeling drew him close to the blacks \n     he met while attending Rutgers University on a football \n     scholarship. His determination to bridge racial gaps, fed in \n     part by his active Christianity, grew during the 24 years he \n     spent as an assistant coach at a half-dozen schools before \n     Illinois promoted him to head coach from defensive \n     coordinator in late 1991. ``My wife, Karen, and I told \n     ourselves that if I ever got a top job, we'd make it reflect \n     our views about how people should be treated,'' he says.\n       Those views are contained in a ``mission statement'' that's \n     sent to everyone Illinois recruits for football. One of its \n     provisions is a ``family concept'' that asks team members to \n     treat each other with ``love and discipline.'' In case anyone \n     misses the point, Mr. Tepper tells them it especially applies \n     white-to-black and vice versa, and requires the lads to \n     pledge to do that before they sign scholarship papers. The \n     school has lost several recruits as a result. ``I've had \n     whites balk [at the pledge], but never a black,'' the coach \n     notes.\n       Players quickly get the chance to prove their words. Seats \n     at all team meetings are assigned on a black-white-black-\n     white basis. Room assignments for summer practice before \n     classes start, and for team road trips, are made the same \n     way. The process is facilitated by the fact that the team is \n     almost 50-50 white and black.\n       Thursday team dinners in season are designated as ``Unity \n     Nights,'' and players are encouraged to eat next to ones they \n     don't know well. Players joke that this can mean that \n     defensive players sit next to members of the offense, but the \n     dinners also are occasions for interracial fraternizing.\n       Some of the ties fostered in those ways have flowered in \n     others: Several whites and blacks on the team now are full-\n     time roomies, and interracial team parties, the exception in \n     pre-Tepper days, have become the rule.\n       Team members admit their white-black relationships are, \n     mostly, no more than skin deep; ``serious'' racial issues, \n     such as the O.J. Simpson trial, go undiscussed. ``We like to \n     keep things light,'' says Chris Koerwitz, an offensive \n     lineman from Oshkosh, Wis. But while most of the Fighting \n     Illini continue to take their ease with others of their race, \n     it's with the knowledge that it could be otherwise.\n       ``You might say I was prejudiced before. I knew very few \n     black people, and accepted the negative things white people \n     say about them,'' says Paul Marshall, a defensive lineman \n     from almost-all-white Naperville, Ill. ``Here, I've seen that \n     the negatives aren't true, and that, given the chance, guys \n     want to be friendly.''\n       ``Yeah, I signed coach's pledge, but I thought it was just \n     recruiting stuff. Then I got here and, right away, I had this \n     white guy for a roommate,'' says David James, a linebacker \n     from almost-all-black East St. Louis, Ill. ``It wasn't so \n     bad,'' he smiles. ``I played some rap for him and he played \n     some Van Halen for me. We still do it sometimes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16680-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AID FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most shortsighted things \nwe can do is to cut back on our foreign assistance, which is already \nfar behind what other Western nations do in terms of the percentage of \nour budget and in terms of the precentage of our national income.\n  The New York Times had an excellent editorial titled, ``Aid for the \nWorld's Poorest.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                      Aid for the World's Poorest\n\n       The new Republican majority in Congress wants to eliminate \n     government services that private markets could also provide. \n     Yet it has aimed its budget knife at a valuable program--\n     economic aid to the world's poorest countries--that could not \n     possibly survive without Federal funds. Drastic cuts approved \n     by the House and Senate threaten to grind dreadfully poor \n     people into deeper poverty.\n       Under President Bush's leadership, the United States \n     committed itself to contributing about $1.3 billion next year \n     to the International Development Association, an affiliate of \n     the World Bank that provides very-low-interest loans to poor \n     countries. As part of its deficit reduction program, the \n     House and Senate want to renege on that commitment and reduce \n     the contribution to between $577 million, the House figure, \n     and $775 million, the Senate's figure.\n       Neither figure makes fiscal or ethical sense. The I.D.A. \n     loan program is cost-effective. Every dollar in American \n     contributions leads to $4 or $5 more in contributions from \n     other industrialized countries. To save a few hundred million \n     out of a $10 billion-plus foreign aid budget, Congress would \n     trigger a $3 billion reduction in I.D.A. loans.\n       The loan program is also politically effective. By inviting \n     poor countries to open their economies to trade and adopt \n     market reforms, I.D.A. loans are a cheap way for Congress to \n     spread capitalism. The program's multilateral nature \n     insulates recipient countries from pressures to warp their \n     economic programs to suit the narrow export interests of \n     individual donors. I.D.A. programs worked well in Korea, \n     Thailand, Turkey and Indonesia. They are working well in \n     Ghana and Bolivia.\n       Critics of the I.D.A. say that third-world countries would \n     become more prosperous more rapidly if they relief more on \n     private capital and far less on World Bank handouts. This \n     criticism applied, at least until recently, to World Bank \n     loans for dams and other infrastructure projects. As the new \n     president of the World Bank concedes, private capital markets \n     are willing and able to extend such loans. But private \n     investors will not bail out sub-Saharan Africa and other \n     economic disasters. Over 70 percent of private lending to \n     developing nations goes to fewer than a dozen countries. Sub-\n     Saharan Africa claims only 2 percent.\n       The I.D.A., not private capital, fights the spread of AIDS. \n     The I.D.A. helps pay for schools. The I.D.A. finances women's \n     health and childhood nutrition programs. The World Bank has \n     shifted its priorities from investing in concrete to \n     investing in people. No one else can take on this role. Do \n     American taxpayers really prefer to save themselves about $2 \n     a year rather than leading the world to help those eking out \n     an existence on less than $2 a day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16681-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16681-S16682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS AS ``AMERICAN AS THE CONSTITUTION''\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I believe \nthat affirmative action is a very good thing for our country; even \nthough, like any good thing, it can be abused.\n  Prof. Steven Lubet of Northwestern University had an interesting \narticle that points out that affirmative action is part of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  My colleagues, who may be startled at that bit of information, will \nfind the Steven Lubet article of interest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n       Affirmative Action Is as ``American as the Constitution''\n\n                           (By Steven Lubet)\n\n       Opponents of affirmative action say the idea is contrary to \n     basic American principles because it unfairly disadvantages \n     blameless individuals, needlessly emphasizes group rights and \n     enshrines an ethic of victimization. Affirmative action, they \n     say, is a failed experiment from the despised '60s.\n       The real truth, however, is that affirmative action \n     originated in the '80s. Not the 1980s, but the 1780s--1789, \n     to be exact. Here is what the United States Constitution \n     (Article I, Section 3) says about affirmative action: ``The \n     Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators \n     from each state.'' That's affirmative action--in fact, a \n     quota system--for small states. There is no denying that the \n     framers designed the Senate to protect group rights, \n     notwithstanding any disadvantage to blameless individuals, \n     and all on a theory of possible victimization. While any \n     specific instance of affirmative action may be unnecessary or \n     ill-advised, the concept has been with us from the beginning.\n       The size of a state's delegation in the House of \n     Representatives is determined on the basis of population, in \n     keeping with the democratic principles articulated in the \n     Declaration of Independence. In the Senate, however, small \n     states are given special treatment. They are afforded \n     representation far out of proportion to population, to ensure \n     that they will not be victimized, oppressed or subjected to \n     discrimination by the majority.\n       There is no clearer example in our history of \n     institutionalized group rights. Based upon accidents of birth \n     and geography, the citizens of small states, such as Delaware \n     and Maine, enjoyed the benefits of a quota system that made \n     their political influence comparable to that of New York and \n     Virginia, the giants of the time. In the 1990s, the same \n     quota operates to the advantage of Alaska (one senator per \n     300,000 citizens) and to the detriment of California (one \n     senator per 15,000,000 citizens). Is it unfair to count the \n     vote of an Alaskan at 50 times the vote of an Californian? \n     Sure it is, but we have become so inured to the Senate that \n     it just seems natural.\n       That's our system. That's the way it works. And so it is; \n     but it is also group-based affirmative action.\n       We are all familiar with the original arguments in favor of \n     the Senate. One concern was that the interests of small \n     states would not be respected in a Congress constituted \n     strictly on the basis of population. Another consideration \n     was the need to protect minorities (primarily meaning \n     political minorities) from the temporary passions of \n     transient majorities. And after more than 200 years, there is \n     far-reaching agreement that the Senate has well served its \n     intended functions. State-based affirmative action has worked \n     according to plan.\n       So let's compare the establishment of the Senate to current \n     programs of race-based affirmative action. To be sure, the \n     parallel is inexact, but certain principles do overlap. In \n     1789, the small states feared the possibility of future \n     discrimination under the newly-proposed Constitution. They \n     were not willing to accept promises of benevolence or \n     paternalism, but insisted on structural protection even at \n     the cost of proportional democracy.\n       Today, racial minorities and women fear not only the \n     hypothetical possibility of discrimination, but the \n     persistence of a proven historical fact. They, too, decline \n     to trust benign intentions and demand a structural \n\n[[Page S 16682]]\n     remedy. A requirement of special treatment or attention to women and \n     minorities similarly assures that they will be protected from \n     the ``passions'' of today's majority, which, in the case of \n     upper-level decision-makers, still consists overwhelmingly of \n     white males.\n       It is true that the non-proportional Senate came about as \n     the result of a political compromise. The small states \n     extracted it as the price of their acceptance of the new \n     national government. They had the right to withhold \n     ratification of any constitution that did not satisfy their \n     perceived needs.\n       Today's minorities, African-Americans in particular, do not \n     have that power. Their ancestors were brought here \n     involuntarily, without the ability to agree or disagree with \n     the political or economic system. Certainly, though, there \n     must be something about democracy that prevents us from \n     saying that affirmative action was a one-time-only \n     phenomenon, imposed only at the insistence of certain framers \n     and never to be repeated for the benefit of future \n     minorities. To accept that argument would transform \n     constitutionalism from an enduring philosophy into little \n     more than an 18th Century version of ``Let's Make a Deal.''\n       I do not want to make too much of this analogy. Many recent \n     efforts at affirmative action have been ineffective or \n     counter-productive. The wisdom or appropriateness of any \n     particular program ought to be subject to continuous review. \n     But when Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) or Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) \n     inveigh against affirmative action, they ought to do so with \n     some sense of humility, if not irony. After all, they owe \n     their Senate seats to affirmative action's first appearance \n     in our national life.\n       It is simply wrong to say that affirmative action--as a \n     tool for achieving political equity--is out of place in the \n     American system. To the contrary, it is as American as the \n     Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16681-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16682-S16686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SYMPOSIUM: UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD IRAN: FROM CONTAINMENT TO \n                          RELENTLESS PURSUIT?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am sure I know less about what is \ntaking place in Iran than some members of the Senate. I have followed \nthe news, but I have not tried to become as knowledgeable about Iran as \nI am some areas of Africa and other areas of the world. I read about a \nsymposium in the publication Middle East Policy in which Ellen Laipson, \nDirector of Near East and South East Affairs from the National Security \nCouncil, discusses the Iran situation with Prof. Gary Sick of Columbia \nUniversity, and Prof. Richard Cottam of the University of Pittsburgh.\n  Ms. Laipson gives an administrational line on what is taking place in \nIran. But coming from a base of limited understanding, it appears to me \nthat Gary Sick and Richard Cottam make a great deal of sense. What I \nkept thinking, as I read the discussion, was that our attitude toward \nIran is very similar to our attitude toward Cuba. There is no question \nthat our Cuban policy has been counterproductive, appealing to the \nnational passion rather than the national interest. I have the uneasy \nfeeling that our policy toward Iran is the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their discussion be printed in the \nRecord at this point and urge my colleagues to particularly read the \ndiscussion by Professor Sick and Professor Cottam.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Symposium: U.S. Policy Toward Iran: From Containment to Relentless \n                                Pursuit?\n\n             (By Ellen Laipson, Gary Sick, Richard Cottam)\n\n\n ellen laipson, director of near east and south asian affairs for the \n                       national security council\n\n       It will come as no surprise that Iran has been a major \n     challenge for the Clinton administration's foreign policy. \n     Today's forum is well-timed, because it gives us a chance to \n     review the recent debate over the policy and the changes that \n     the president announced just about a month ago. I welcome the \n     chance to discuss this important issue and hear your views as \n     well, and to be able to bring those ideas back to the debate \n     that we have within the government.\n       We all recognize the importance of Iran in the Middle East \n     region--the complexity of its society, the richness of its \n     cultural traditions, and the very troubled history of U.S.-\n     Iran relations in recent years. I think no one would disagree \n     with the proposition that the last decade and a half has been \n     a difficult time in the relationship between Iran and the \n     United States. But it is our view that the situation we're in \n     today does derive from the conditions in the region and from \n     our efforts to protect our critical interests there.\n       I will divide my remarks into three simple questions. \n     First, what is the policy? Second, why did the president make \n     the changes that were announced on April 30? And, lastly, \n     where do we go from here?\n       To give you the current state of play in the policy, it's \n     important to note that our approach focuses on Iran's \n     actions--not the nature of the regime, not what they call \n     themselves, not the Islamic character of the regime, but the \n     specific actions that we have observed the Iranian government \n     get involved in. These include, first and foremost, their \n     involvement in terrorism, particularly that which undermines \n     the peace process in the Middle East--and their pursuit of \n     weapons of mass destruction. In addition, we focus a lot of \n     our concern on their efforts to subvert friendly governments \n     in the region, their unfortunate human-rights record, and \n     their conventional arms buildup which could, if realized, \n     pose real threats to small Persian Gulf states that are \n     friends of the United States.\n       At the same time, we also have to focus on the long-term \n     challenge from Iran--not just the actions of today, but the \n     potential, the capability that Iran could have, if it were to \n     fulfill its ambitions, particularly in the weapons area. We \n     are not trying to argue that today Iran poses a major \n     military threat to the United States, but we are working to \n     prevent it from doing so. We are looking at Iran's ambitions \n     and intentions, not just its current military capabilities.\n       The policy is trying to capture, on the one hand, our \n     efforts to address Iran's behavior today and, on the other \n     hand, to develop a strategy that tries to anticipate a future \n     Iran that would be a stronger and more formidable player in \n     the region. Our approach combines pressure with other \n     measures. We are trying to give Iran's leadership a chance to \n     make a strategic choice. They could change their policies in \n     order to serve Iran's interests, which we believe are \n     fundamentally, among other things, economic growth and \n     political stability. We think that Iran's government has the \n     chance to adapt its behavior in ways that would make it \n     conform more with international norms.\n       There has been no change in our policy on the question of a \n     dialogue. We are still willing to engage in a dialogue with \n     authoritative representatives of the Iranian government. We \n     believe that pressure and dialogue can go together. This \n     would be normal. By the rules of diplomacy, it would be \n     possible to have both.\n       Let me give you a little more detail on what the pressure \n     tactics involve, since they have recently changed. The policy \n     of containment, which was declared when the Clinton \n     administration first came to office, involves a comprehensive \n     series of unilateral measures and a series of multilateral \n     efforts as well. Until recently, the dimensions of our \n     economic policy towards Iran consisted of an arms ban, a ban \n     on dual-use technologies, a total import ban on Iranian \n     products coming into this country, controls on certain items \n     for export to Iran, and a diplomatic position of blocking all \n     lending to Iran from international financial institutions.\n       After four to five months of internal debate, the president \n     announced on April 30, and signed on May 6, an executive \n     order that is an important reinforcement or strengthening of \n     our policy towards Iran. He announced that, from now on, we \n     will prohibit all trade, financing, loans and financial \n     services to Iran. We will ban U.S. companies from purchasing \n     Iranian oil overseas, even if it is for resale overseas. And \n     new investment by American companies in Iran is prohibited. \n     The president's executive order also bans their re-export to \n     Iran from third countries of those goods or technologies that \n     are on controlled lists for direct export from the United \n     States to Iran. In addition, it prohibits U.S. persons and \n     companies from approving or facilitating transactions with \n     Iran by their affiliates.\n       The executive order does not have exterritorial application \n     to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies. It does not ban \n     the import of informational materials from Iran. And it does \n     not block Iranian assets or ban private remittances to and \n     from Iran by private Iranian nationals.\n       As you can see, these are very strong, but not total, \n     economic measures. They form part, but not all, of our policy \n     effort vis-a-vis Iran. The economic pressure, in a way, has \n     to be seen in both the political and diplomatic context that \n     is our overall policy. We are working and will continue to \n     work hard multilaterally to make sure that the arms ban, the \n     limits on credit and aid, the ban on support for Iran from \n     international financial institutions, and cooperation with \n     Iran in nuclear matters continue. We have enjoyed, up until \n     now, what we consider to be good support from most of the \n     advanced Western countries in these areas, and we would like \n     to see more.\n       We initially worked within the G-7 context. But as you \n     know, in the past year, we have expanded our diplomatic \n     efforts to include Russia, China and all other potential \n     suppliers to Iran of these high-technology and weapons-\n     related items.\n       President Clinton and President Yeltsin last summer \n     announced an agreement that would involve the future ban of \n     all Russian arms sales to Iran. I think you will see more of \n     these kinds of agreements with others of Iran's would-be \n     suppliers.\n       We also have political talks with out major allies, both in \n     the West and in the Middle East, about Iran. These political \n     talks, in and of themselves, form a kind of pressure because \n     Iran is very aware of these discussions, and that we are \n     sharing information about our concerns over Iranian behavior \n     in these discussions. We hold the talks with the European \n     Union, with Canada, with Japan, with Russia, with most of our \n     Middle Eastern allies.\n\n[[Page S 16683]]\n\n       In these talks, we discuss the merits of our approach--an \n     approach of economic pressure, and the approach of our \n     allies. Some of our allies prefer critical dialogue, which is \n     the formula that the European Union uses. Some prefer \n     constructive engagement, which is, I think, how the Japanese \n     would characterize their policy. And others would use other \n     formulas to describe their approach to Iran. It is true that \n     we all continue to believe that there's room for some \n     disagreement over what is the best approach to Iran. But we \n     are of the view that the president's recent measures have \n     very much caught the attention of our allies and will create \n     a new dynamic in our discussion on this important topic.\n       We also share our concerns about the long-term threat that \n     Iran could pose if it achieved both its conventional and its \n     nonconventional military objectives--the threat that it would \n     pose to the Persian Gulf countries, and to the region as a \n     whole. I believe the Middle Eastern allies, in particular, \n     see the American military presence in the Gulf--which most \n     recently has been in response to Iraqi aggression--as helpful \n     to sending a deterrent message to Iran.\n       Let me address why the change. The Clinton administration \n     began a review in the fall of last year that, in some ways, \n     was a very thoughtful assessment as we approached the \n     midpoint of the presidential term. We thought it was a \n     natural time to do an assessment of what has worked and what \n     hasn't, where the policy can be refined, where it can be \n     improved or enhanced.\n       We examined how Iran has responded to American policy until \n     now and whether Iran's behavior had changed in the areas that \n     we had expressed greatest concern about. We identified that, \n     while in some areas Iran's behavior was more or less as it \n     had been a few years ago, in certain areas, we thought it had \n     worsened. In particular, we believe that the rise in \n     terrorism against the Middle East peace process that began in \n     the fall of 1994 has some links to Iran, and is deeply \n     disturbing to one of our principal objectives, not only in \n     the region, but worldwide: the achievement of a comprehensive \n     peace between Israel and its neighbors.\n       We also saw continuing and, in some ways, accelerating \n     signs of Iran's efforts to procure the materials and \n     technology needed for a weapons-of-mass-destruction program. \n     So, in those two key areas, it was our judgment that the \n     situation was in fact getting worse and required some new \n     policy responses.\n       Second, I would cite, as a reason for the change, the \n     increasing challenge from our allies. They saw and told us \n     that they saw an inconsistency between our containment policy \n     and the fact that we continue to trade with Iran. That \n     charge--even if based on a misleading use of trade \n     statistics--was harmful to our efforts to maximize the \n     consensus among Western partners that we consider to be a key \n     part of our overall policy success. We feel strongly that \n     Iran should hear to the maximum extent possible, the same \n     signal from the United States that it hears from its other \n     Western trading partners. This would have the greatest impact \n     of the calculation that Iran needs to make about how its \n     economic interests are affected by its own policy choices.\n       Third, and more recently, we did witness some erosion in \n     the domestic consensus that we have enjoyed over our Iran \n     policy. We saw a domestic debate, initiated here in the halls \n     of Congress, over the need to pursue a tougher policy towards \n     Iran. Until now, I would say that we have enjoyed \n     considerable domestic support for containment, and we wanted \n     to restore that degree of support. It was our view that an \n     unresolved debate, questioning whether the policy was \n     effective enough, would limit our effectiveness in \n     communicating with Iran.\n       The administration conducted a thorough review of the \n     policy options, and they were debated with some vigor among \n     both the national-security agencies and the economic-policy \n     factors within the U.S. government. We tried to balance a \n     complex and, I think, difficult set of considerations. We \n     asked ourselves, how would new economic measures, new \n     sanctions, affect Iran's behavior? Would they affect the \n     Iranian government or the Iranian people? How would they \n     affect American competitiveness and American jobs, and how \n     would they affect the willingness of our allies to work with \n     us in a coordinated fashion on the Iran problem?\n       It is true that no one of the options that we considered \n     would maximize all of these factors. There were trade-offs. \n     There were policy options that made some of these issues \n     easier and some harder. But we took them all into account.\n       Let me just end with what we see as the next steps. We do \n     not exaggerate our chances for any quick success on the \n     dramatic announcement the President made on April 30. We \n     don't have any illusions that, overnight, Iran will stand up \n     and publicly say that it is changing its behavior. But we do \n     see a number of important signs already. We know that the \n     President's announcement has had an impact on Iran. And I \n     think those of you who follow the currency market are well \n     aware of the dramatic fall in the value of the rial since the \n     President's announcement. We know that we have the attention \n     of the Rafsanjani government--witness his invitation to \n     prominent American media to try to explain the government's \n     side of the story, denying charges of terrorism, denying that \n     there is a weapons program, etc. To me, this very much \n     manifests the Iranian government's concern with the \n     perception of its behavior that the President's announcement \n     has evoked.\n       We think this is a process, an ongoing process that will \n     require a lot of diplomatic engagement, a lot of hard work, \n     and we are certainly aware that it has had some costs to \n     various interests. We will have to measure our success in \n     careful ways. We will continue to look for the supplier \n     restraint that we have already created, to a certain extent, \n     and for some other indicators. Will Iran need to think hard \n     about the trade-offs between what it wants economically and \n     its political behavior? We certainly hope so. Will the allies \n     accept, now, the firmness of our resolve and our commitment \n     to a containment policy? Will the allies join us in similar \n     measures? We hope and expect to see more restraints in aid to \n     Iran--loans, credits--and hopefully more political \n     convergence in our overall approaches.\n       We are doing a number of things. There are intensive \n     diplomatic efforts leading up to the Halifax meeting [of the \n     G-7] that will take place next week in addition to bilateral \n     meetings in which the Iran question is almost inevitably \n     raised. We are sharing more information with our allies about \n     terrorism and their nuclear plans, since some countries have \n     said that this will be a critical factor in determining \n     whether they change their policies or not. We don't know \n     whether this is a political posture for them or if they \n     really mean it. But we will make the extra effort to share \n     with them the information that we have found so \n     compelling and so persuasive, and hope that they will \n     agree to conduct an evaluation of their own policies and \n     see what else is possible.\n       And immediately and within Washington, we are engaging with \n     U.S. businesses to ensure a fair and prompt implementation of \n     the president's executive order. We are aware that the policy \n     has had some costs and has inflicted some short-term \n     dislocations on some of our interests. The president made his \n     decision because he believed it was commensurate with the \n     threat--both in the short-term and the long-term--that Iran's \n     behavior poses. We hope very much that this recent decision \n     will enhance our ability to exercise leadership with our \n     allies. It has already, in part, restored the domestic \n     consensus over our Iran policy.\n\n\ngary sick, director, gulf 2000 project and adjunct professor, columbia \n                               university\n\n       I agree with Ellen on many points. There are aspects of \n     Iran's behavior that are indeed troubling and that we should \n     try to change. Iran's record on human rights is deplorable. \n     The bounty that the revolutionary organization has placed on \n     the head of Salman Rushdie, which amounts to an incitement to \n     murder, is detestable. Iran's opposition to the peace process \n     is a complicating factor, and if that opposition takes the \n     form of money, arms and training for terrorist operations, it \n     is unacceptable.\n       The same holds true for the funding of terrorist operations \n     in any other country. Iran's development of military \n     capabilities that go beyond its legitimate needs for self-\n     defense and which pose a potential threat to its neighbors is \n     both destabilizing and unhealthy. No one wants to see Iran \n     acquire nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\n       On these issues, there is agreement not only in this room, \n     I think, and in Washington, but also in the capitals of \n     virtually every country in the world. The question is how to \n     pursue these objectives, and it is on that question that I \n     disagree most vigorously with the policies that are being \n     pursued by the Clinton administration.\n       There are two cardinal tests, it seems to me, that should \n     be applied to any foreign policy initiative. First, is there \n     a realistic prospect that the policy will accomplish its \n     intended objective? Second, does it do more harm than good? \n     Present U.S. policy fails both of these tests.\n       Economic sanctions are always problematic, as we've seen in \n     the case of Iraq, where the entire international community is \n     united. But unilateral sanctions do not work. The United \n     States is a powerful country and arguably the sole superpower \n     in the world. However, it cannot impose its will on Iran \n     without the support of many other countries that maintain \n     diplomatic and commercial relations with that country. At \n     present, there are only two countries in the world that think \n     the U.S. embargo strategy is a good idea; the United States \n     and Israel. If you like, we can add Uzbekistan to that list. \n     (Laughter.)\n       But not one of Iran's major trading partners has indicated \n     a willingness to join in this embargo.\n       This was not a surprise. The U.S. government did not \n     consult in advance with any other government before the \n     signing of the executive order on May 6. We knew that no \n     other government would support it, so we didn't bother. \n     Although this is a form of economic warfare, we did not raise \n     it at the U.N. Security Council because we knew our position \n     would attract no support.\n       We took this very grave step for our own reasons in the \n     certain knowledge that it would not have the kind of \n     international support that would, in fact, make it \n     successful.\n       The United States in the past has undertaken unilateral \n     sanctions as a matter of principle, even when we were unable \n     to forge an international consensus. One example is the grain \n     embargo against the Soviet Union. However, in that case, \n     there was a triggering event: The invasion of Afghanistan. \n     In this \n\n[[Page S 16684]]\n     case, as Ellen just pointed out, there was no triggering event.\n       We knew other nations would not follow our lead--in fact, \n     we counted on it. Although we have chosen not to purchase any \n     Iranian oil, we really do not want to have Iran's 2.5 million \n     barrels a day of exports withdrawn from the world market. \n     That would create chaos in the oil markets and a very \n     substantial increase in price that could affect our own rate \n     of inflation as well as that of the rest of the world.\n       In reality, we have been hurting Iran very, very severely \n     over the past several years. Oil, as you know, is denominated \n     in dollars, and the decline in the value of the dollar has \n     substantially reduced Iran's purchasing power. To put it \n     another way, in recent years, the real price of oil for Japan \n     has declined by over 70 percent because of the dollar's \n     decline against the yen. This has a real effect on the \n     Iranian economy but is inadvertent and unrelated to the \n     sanctions we are adopting.\n       One of the weaknesses of our policy is its \n     disproportionality. We are in the process of adopting much \n     more stringent sanctions against Iran than we imposed against \n     the Soviet Union, which was a real threat to U.S. national \n     security, even at the height of the Cold War.\n       Let me give you a couple of small examples. Against all \n     odds, the Coca-Cola Company managed to reestablish itself in \n     Iran some years ago. Local soft-drink producers in Iran were \n     outraged. Many of them are owned by parasitic revolutionary \n     so-called foundations. This, they said, was a reintroduction \n     of the Great Satan into Iran. Even worse, it cut into their \n     profits. They asked their leader for a fatwa prohibiting good \n     Iranians from drinking Coca-Cola, but he refused. However, \n     the Clinton fatwa will succeed where the hard-line \n     revolutionaries failed, by forcing Coca-Cola to withdraw from \n     the Iranian market.\n       Tehran is holding its annual book fair this month. Several \n     American publishers withdrew from the exhibition after \n     hearing of the executive order. Frankly, I wish Iranians had \n     access to American books. I think that's our loss.\n       Federal Express and UPS have both terminated their service \n     to Iran. I was planning to send some materials to a colleague \n     of mine in Iran, a political scientist, about a conference \n     that we have planned, and I'm now going to have to find some \n     other way to do it.\n       Can I subscribe to an Iranian journal or newspaper, or is \n     that trade with Iran?\n       Although the executive order is not intended to interfere \n     with normal academic contacts and freedom of expression, it's \n     going to have a chilling effect in many little ways. It will \n     impede or interrupt our few existing channels of reliable \n     information about what is being said and though and done in \n     Iran, and we need that information.\n       Our policy is also based on some false premises. I was \n     struck by Secretary [of State Warren] Christopher's recent \n     statement to an interviewer. He said, ``We must isolate Iraq \n     and Iran until there is a change in their government, a \n     change in their leadership.''\n       That statement recalls a very similar comment made by \n     Defense Secretary [Casper] Weinberger some years ago, when he \n     said, ``There must be a totally different kind of government \n     in Iran, because we cannot deal with the irrational, \n     fanatical government of the kind they now have.''\n       These offhand comments, calling, in effect, for the \n     overthrow of the government, seem more consistent with \n     U.S. actions and the reality of U.S. policy than the \n     repeated official assurances that we heard this morning \n     that we accept the Iranian revolution as a fact and that \n     it is not our objective to try to overthrow it. The voices \n     of our leaders suggest otherwise, at least when they are \n     caught off guard.\n       Our policies do make Iran's life more difficult in many \n     ways, but the notion that we're going to drive it into \n     bankruptcy and thereby bring down the Islamic government are \n     romantic and infantile pipe dreams. The Iranian government is \n     under great stress due to its own mismanagement of its \n     economy. About one-third of Iran's oil revenues this year \n     will go to pay off its creditors as a result of a consumer \n     import binge following the end of the Iran-Iraq War.\n       Iranians are dissatisfied with the economy and they are not \n     shy about making their views known. There will be change, but \n     it will take the shape of reforms to the existing system, not \n     of collapse or overthrow. There is no viable political \n     alternative to the present system. We may not like this \n     regime, but we're going to have to live with it. We are not \n     going to bring it down by an act of self-flagellation.\n       Our policy of demonizing Iran has affected our own \n     credibility in a number of areas. For example, the recent \n     State Department report on international terrorism in 1994 \n     states that Iran is still the most active state sponsor of \n     international terrorism. But if you read the report--and I \n     have read it now three or four times--it is remarkably silent \n     on evidence.\n       When Secretary Christopher recently claimed that Iran was \n     responsible for the bombing of the Argentine-Israel Mutual \n     Association in Buenos Aires last July, the Argentine foreign \n     minister immediately wrote a letter to Christopher asking him \n     for any verification or evidence that he had, but he said to \n     reporters at the same time that he wrote the letter, ``We do \n     not expect any news. There is no more information now than \n     there was in December.'' There have been no arrests. The \n     principal U.S. source, who was a paid informant of the CIA, \n     has been discredited, and the Argentine government is \n     resuming normal relations with Iran.\n       There are other major flaws in the terrorism report that in \n     some respects, make it more of a propaganda tract than a \n     serious statement of fact. The United States is reportedly \n     spending $4 million on a propaganda campaign designed to \n     destabilize Iran. It's one thing to conduct propaganda \n     against another state, but there is a real danger if we start \n     believing it ourselves.\n       The nuclear issue is simple. We do not want Iran to get the \n     bomb, and on that we are joined by virtually every government \n     in the world, notably including Russia, which does not want \n     to see the emergency of a nuclear-weapons state on its \n     southern borders. Again, the question is not the goal, but, \n     rather, how we get there from here.\n       The United States, in my view, has manufactured an \n     unnecessary crisis by focusing its attention on the sale of \n     nuclear power stations to Iran. Granted, all of us might \n     prefer to see Iran completely devoid of any nuclear \n     infrastructure, but we have diluted our moral and political \n     authority by attempting to deny to Iran a right that is \n     enshrined in the very terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation \n     Treaty [NPT] that we just recently fought so hard and \n     successfully to sustain.\n       The NPT explicitly promises in Article IV that states in \n     compliance with the treaty will have access to peaceful \n     nuclear technology. Iran is in compliance. The power stations \n     that Iran is buying from Russia and China are no different \n     from those we are offering free to North Korea in order to \n     gain their compliance with the NPT.\n       Our decision to focus on the sale of power stations is a \n     case of superpower swagger. We suggest that the rules of \n     international law apply only when we say they apply. That \n     attitude is not popular even among those states which have \n     good reason to fear Iran.\n       I believe that one of the reasons Iran is seeking nuclear \n     power stations is as part of a broader effort to develop a \n     nuclear infrastructure that would permit it to build a \n     nuclear weapon. Iran fought a bloody eight-year war with \n     Iraq, and I am sure that they were just as shocked as we were \n     to discover how close Saddam Hussein had come to having a \n     nuclear weapon, especially knowing that it most likely would \n     have been used on them, just as chemical weapons were.\n       They may also have the mistaken notion that nuclear weapons \n     will provide some form of insurance against superpower \n     intervention, having watched Iraq go down to defeat with such \n     apparent ease after they themselves had been beaten on the \n     battlefield by that same army. The Iranians almost certainly \n     wish to shorten the time required to build their own weapon \n     if they see the threat again emerging on one of their \n     borders.\n       It's worth noting in passing that we should be careful \n     about using the argument that Iran does not need nuclear \n     power because it has so much oil and gas. The two are really \n     not mutually exclusive. Russia has the greatest gas reserves \n     in the world. It also has the largest nuclear power industry \n     in the world.\n       In reality, Iran is currently short of gas. Every bit of \n     Iran's gas is being used domestically, and there is no \n     surplus. It is also, increasingly, short of energy. Its \n     domestic needs for electricity and heating are increasing \n     faster than it can produce them.\n       In addition to nuclear power, which may be a silly \n     solution, Iran is involved in major efforts to develop wind \n     power, thermal power and hydroelectric power. I would note in \n     passing that the Japanese loans that we are arguing so hard \n     to try to stop are for a dam on the Karun River in the south \n     that is designed to produce hydroelectric power.\n       The Conoco deal that we were so outraged about and \n     interfered with was an attempt to develop a gas field in the \n     south that would increase their supply of gas. I argue that \n     we are shooting ourselves in the foot repeatedly. Our recent \n     policies have tended to thwart Iran's development of non-\n     nuclear alternative energy sources.\n       But these facts, regardless of one's interpretation, are \n     not an argument for complacency about the nuclear issue. \n     Instead, in my view, our policy should focus on the central \n     issue of nuclear-weapons development. A sensible U.S. policy \n     should have the following objectives: First, we and our \n     allies and all prospective nuclear suppliers should convince \n     Iran to renounce technologies that provide direct access to \n     weapons fuel, specifically enrichment. That, of course, \n     includes centrifuge technology and reprocessing.\n       To that end, we should pressure Russia to reaffirm its \n     adherence to the nuclear suppliers' guidelines which go \n     beyond the NPT in restricting export of these two dangerous \n     technologies. We should also do everything in our power to \n     tighten the international regime, the successor to COCOM, to \n     prevent sale of long-range delivery systems which could be \n     used with nuclear weapons.\n       Second, any training of Iranians should be limited to what \n     it takes to operate a reactor, rather than providing broad \n     access to nuclear technology.\n       Third, we should insist on clear-cut agreements about the \n     disposal of spent fuel from the reactors. Iran has said that \n     it would return the nuclear waste to Russia, but we need to \n     ensure that there are safeguards at every stage to ensure \n     that both the fuel is returned and that Iran exercises no \n     control over that fuel once it has been returned--\n\n[[Page S 16685]]\n     again, a crucial point, and something that can be done in the \n     agreements that Russia is signing with Iran.\n       Finally, we should take Iran at its word that it will \n     permit frequent and intrusive inspections by the IAEA \n     [International Atomic Energy Agency] on demand and with \n     little or no advance notice. That should be an absolute \n     condition of any continuing nuclear power assistance which \n     Iran will require for the next decade or more. I would also \n     add that might be useful to explore this idea that's been \n     raised recently by the United Nations Association of a \n     nuclear rapporteur who would conduct independent \n     investigations to explore evidence of nuclear-weapons \n     development around the world and report directly to the \n     Security Council.\n       All of these steps are things that we could do, and a \n     negotiating package that is composed of these elements and \n     perhaps others of a more technical nature would be greeted by \n     understanding and sympathy by most if not all of our friends \n     and allies. It is consistent with international law and is in \n     the immediate national interests of potential nuclear \n     suppliers themselves. In short, it offers what our present \n     policy does not: a workable strategy to achieve our most \n     important objectives.\n       Our present policy is not really a strategy, since it lacks \n     a definable endgame. It rails against Iran's behavior, but \n     really doesn't offer anything like a credible roadmap for \n     changing it. And pious hopes that Iran is suddenly going to \n     change its spots really don't suffice, especially when we're \n     making such stringent efforts as we are.\n       So, in closing, let me suggest a five-point framework for \n     U.S. policy. I do so in the full understanding that any such \n     suggestions are probably fated to fall on deaf ears in the \n     present political climate in Washington.\n       First, we should cool the rhetoric for a while. At times \n     lately, we have sounded more shrill and ideological than the \n     ayatollahs. Let's put the thesaurus aside for a while. We \n     don't need any more synonyms for rogue, outlaw, or even \n     backlash, whatever that means.\n       Second, let's take some time to get our priorities \n     straight. Iran may be bad, but it's not all bad, and some of \n     the actions are worse than others. If the nuclear issue is at \n     the top of our agenda, and that's where I think it should be, \n     let's put together a strategy that addresses the central \n     issues, rather than painting everything with the same brush.\n       Third, let's begin to develop a strategy that engages our \n     allies and lets us work with them, instead of bullying them \n     and ignoring their own legitimate interests. Despite what \n     Ellen said, I think that's what we've been doing.\n       Fourth, we should adopt a policy of selective neglect. When \n     we disagree with Iran or find its behavior outrageous and \n     unacceptable, we should say so, but where we see improvement \n     in their policies--and there are, in fact, areas of \n     improvement that we could talk about--we should not be afraid \n     to acknowledge them or at least to remain silent. Distorting \n     the truth in the pursuit of a policy is demeaning to us as a \n     nation and ultimately self-defeating.\n       Finally, we should apply the Waco test. Yes, we have over \n     there what we perceive as an encampment of religious \n     extremists. They propound ideas that offend us. They are \n     armed, and they may represent a danger to the neighborhood. \n     But we should never forget that no matter how bad it is, our \n     policies, if misconceived, can make it worse for everyone \n     concerned.\n\n\n  RICHARD COTTAM, university professor of political science emeritus, \n                        University of Pittsburgh\n\n       I want to talk about two things primarily: one, the long-\n     run trends in Iran; two, Iranian intentions, as I see them.\n       I want to begin with something you all remember but I think \n     need to be reminded of and that is in December of 1978, on a \n     religious holiday, eight million people, journalists tell \n     us, demonstrated in Iran against that shah's regime. That \n     would be one out of every five, even though they knew that \n     attack helicopters could be used against them. Two months \n     later, the revolution was successful. It was without \n     question, I think, the greatest populist revolution in \n     human history.\n       In days following that revolution it began to unravel, and \n     the liberal element, which was very important in the \n     directorship of the revolution itself, began to desert or to \n     be regurgitated. A terrible process began to take place that \n     we haven't noted enough the development, wherever resurgent \n     Islam appears, of a polarization of the populations with two \n     sections of people, one religious and one secular, starting \n     to dislike each other to a point of intensity that is almost \n     genocidal. It takes place everywhere. In a better world, what \n     we on the outside should want to do is to try to bring about \n     some kind of reconciliation of these forces. Strangely \n     enough, our policy in Algeria seems to show slight signs of \n     doing exactly that.\n       Within a year of the revolution, the polarization was \n     pretty well complete in Iran. There was a regime pole, which \n     I would estimate, for what it's worth, at about 20 percent of \n     the population. And that pole followed Khomeini's great \n     leadership (that was their view of him). And within that \n     group there were two major factions or tendencies as they \n     called them, one you could call reform and one revolutionary. \n     Khomeini's decisional style was such that he didn't allow \n     either of these factions really to win and consolidate.\n       The result was that within the bureaucracy itself, many \n     bureaucrats reported to very different elements in the \n     revolutionary elite. Although there has been some \n     consolidation of control, this is still a phenomenon and \n     probably has a lot to do with explaining the assassinations \n     of Iranian dissidents abroad.\n       An intransigent opposition developed that looked almost \n     exclusively to the United States for salvation. And then \n     there appeared the phenomenon of a substantial majority of \n     the Iranians--a large acquiescing and accommodating majority \n     of the country--who saw no alternative to the regime, \n     accepted it and wanted to go on with their lives.\n       Fifteen years later, the change is very substantial. The \n     radical leadership has been defeated. It was rather \n     decisively defeated, although remnants, I believe, still are \n     in the bureaucracy. Its support base has shrunk even further, \n     I'm not allowed in Iran, one of the few Americans who is not \n     acceptable there. But people whom I respect who go all the \n     time have estimated that between 15 and 1.5 percent of the \n     population really supports the regime. It's a very \n     dangerously low level of support. I agree with Gary Sick that \n     it's not likely that there will be any kind of revolution. \n     But what is possible with this level of support is a \n     spontaneous uprising against a miserable economic situation \n     which could get out of control and go to something \n     unpredictable.\n       I think the major failing, though, of the regime has been \n     its failure to recruit a significant section of the \n     intelligentsia. The revolution has lost its vitality. It is \n     now a revolution striving to survive. [Ali] Khamenei, the \n     supreme leader of Iran is, a sincere advocate of the Islamic \n     movement, but he did participate in the defeat of the radical \n     element. And the president, [Ali Akbar Hashemi] Rafsanjani, \n     is, I believe, a realistic individual who's very interested \n     in reconciliation and would move far in the direction of \n     bringing people together if he had the latitude to do that.\n       The intransigent opposition, I think, can be largely \n     disregarded. It's important in the expatriate community, but \n     it seems to have virtually no real meaning within Iran \n     itself. Center stage today is held by the accommodationists \n     and the acquiescers. This is now a huge majority that \n     dominates the universities to a striking extent, both \n     faculty and student body. It dominates the progressive \n     element of the economic community. It's omnipresent even \n     in the bureaucracy and in the professions. It therefore \n     has created a picture that is very different from what \n     we've seen in the past and one that we should take \n     seriously into account.\n       This large majority grants the regime very little \n     legitimacy and in the past has been unwilling even to explore \n     the possibility of engaging it and becoming part of the \n     system. It is right now showing signs of a willingness to do \n     that. The Freedom Front, for instance, has openly told \n     American reporters that it's thinking of running for \n     parliament in the elections. They certainly believe the \n     liberalization process and the growth of pluralism are a real \n     possibility in Iran.\n       In foreign policy, this group is very different from the \n     regime. It has no interest in messianic Islam. It isn't \n     interested in the peace process or the Arab-Israeli dispute. \n     There is very little support from this large majority of the \n     Iranian people for an activist policy in support of what we \n     think the Iranian government is up to. I think this is a fact \n     that is extremely important.\n       This majority is, however, extremely nationalistic. And \n     those barren islands [Abu Musa and the Tunbs] sitting in the \n     Gulf are more important to it than any of these other issues \n     I've mentioned. We could easily offend this very \n     nationalistic element of the population. It yearns for \n     rapprochement with the United States and for a return to the \n     international system. It doesn't like to be a pariah state. \n     It wants to interact. it wants to become prosperous. It's \n     deeply disappointed in U.S. hostility, finding it \n     increasingly bemusing.\n       To return to the question of the regime's intentions, \n     first, I would say, is to position itself favorably in the \n     global economic system. A good competitive position for its \n     oil is vital for the survival of the regime itself. I believe \n     it will make that its first priority in its foreign policy.\n       Second, this regime believes that America, collaborating \n     with Israel, is ineluctably hegemonic in its ambitions. The \n     Iranian regime feels terribly threatened and believes that \n     the danger is from us. When it thinks in terms of arming \n     itself, it's almost pathetic. It can't seriously think in \n     terms of deterring us if we took it on directly. It can only \n     think in terms of deterring our puppets, as they see it, who \n     might attack them.\n       The most difficult part for me in making this case to you, \n     I believe, is this point: that as far as Islam is concerned, \n     the regime has stopped talking about becoming the great \n     leaders of an Islamic state. The imam of the umah was the \n     title for Khomeini, the leader of the entire community of \n     believers. In its place there is a much more defensive \n     concern.\n       I don't mean to understate the importance of Islam for this \n     regime. There are four external communities that it is \n     particularly interested in helping, Islamic communities \n\n[[Page S 16686]]\n     that it sees as under attack. These are the Shia communities of Iraq \n     and Lebanon, the Palestinians and the Bosnian Muslims. It \n     sees its support for all four of these as an integral part of \n     the same policy.\n       It understands that some of these groups resort to the \n     tactics of terror, but I have not seen evidence to indicate \n     that Iran ever pinpoints any appropriations, any money that \n     it gives, for that purpose. It would trivialize the \n     communities we're talking about to assume so. Iran does not \n     see itself as supporting terrorism. It sees itself as \n     supporting regimes that are fighting for their lives or for \n     the return of their property, of their territory. And it's a \n     sincere belief. They are bemused, again, by our depicting all \n     of this as support for terrorism.\n       I want to quickly give Iran's rationale for opposing the \n     peace process because I think it is underestimated and \n     misunderstood. It's not an irrational position. They argue \n     thus: one, the Arab-Israeli conflict is obviously highly \n     asymmetrical, and that asymmetry in Israel's favor is \n     declining. The reason for this is the appearance of major \n     popular movements. Hezbollah and the intifada in \n     particular, have improved the overall power picture in the \n     relationship between Israel and the Palestinians. Given \n     this favorable trend, this is the wrong time for peace \n     negotiations.\n       Second, the negotiations are being mentored by Israel's \n     protector, a country that promises the Israelis eternal \n     superiority in dealing with the Arabs. This adds to the \n     asymmetry and is not a format that the Iranians think they \n     would like to participate in.\n       Third, there has been no effort in this major movement to \n     deal explicitly with Islamic spokesmen in a process that \n     affects their lives intensely. This seems to indicate that \n     this large and vital movement is to be disregarded. Iran's \n     position, therefore, I believe, is exactly the same as the \n     position of resurgent Islam everywhere, and it isn't one they \n     can just bargain away. That's not a possibility for them. \n     They believe that even if there is a resolution between \n     Israel and the Palestinians, it will not last, because too \n     much of the population has been disregarded in the process.\n       At the same time, if you look in terms of man hours spent \n     on diplomacy, Iran is expending extremely little effort in \n     opposing the process. It has, in effect, said that if [Syrian \n     president Hafiz al-] Asad makes an agreement with the \n     Israelis, it will think it's a mistake, but it will go along \n     with the agreement.\n       I need to spend also just a minute on a very big subject \n     which Gary Sick has talked about: nuclear weaponry. I do not \n     believe the United States has seriously addressed the problem \n     of Iran, the Arab states and many other countries in the \n     world on this issue. There are many states that believe they \n     may someday be given a nuclear ultimatum with no possibility \n     of support from another nuclear power.\n       In the Middle East, the nuclear power that they expect the \n     ultimatum from is Israel. And no one in that area believes \n     for one second that the United States or any other nuclear \n     power would help them if Israel were to issue an ultimatum. \n     Consequently, since they think this is a realistic scenario, \n     they are going to try to defend themselves against it. I \n     think they have done very, very little in that direction so \n     far. They've made clear that they want a nuclear-free zone in \n     the area, but I would assume that any Iranian government, \n     including a future Iranian nationalist government, would have \n     to develop nuclear weapons unless this point is dealt with by \n     the international community. I do not believe we have been \n     serious on this issue at its most fundamental level.\n       In summary, then, I'm arguing that the United States has \n     misread Iran's intentions. Much more seriously, it has \n     misread basic fundamental trends in Iran, most of which are \n     favorable to American goals, and is taking actions that are \n     likely to reverse those trends. The worst case in my view is \n     for American policy ultimately to so anger Iranian \n     nationalists that they will become as hostile to the United \n     States as Iranian nationalists were under the shah's regime. \n     Therefore, the policy that I would prefer is the policy Gary \n     Sick calls ``playing it cool.''\n       I don't think dialogue means much at all. There are too \n     many misperceptions of each other's intentions. To have \n     people who totally misunderstand each other talking doesn't \n     seem likely to produce much. But let's just stop punishing \n     Iran gratuitously and allow trends that are moving in the \n     direction of a real change in the area to proceed as they're \n     proceeding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16682-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KIDS PAY THE PRICE\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we still are not doing what we \nshould to control the proliferation of weapons in our country, despite \nthe overwhelming evidence of the need to do that.\n  The Bob Herbert column in the New York Times recently was powerful \nevidence once again of the need to face up to these problems.\n  I commend him, I commend Oprah Winfrey, I commend Paul Newman, and \nanyone else who has played a part in putting together what, apparently, \nis a powerful, two-part program on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Bob Herbert column be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 30, 1995]\n\n                           Kids Pay the Price\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       Paul Newman, in the 30-second television spot, is reading \n     from a newspaper: ``Matilda Crabtree, 14, jumped out of a \n     closet and yelled `boo' to scare her parents.'' He pauses \n     very briefly before adding, ``And was shot to death when her \n     father mistook her for a burglar.'' Mr. Newman continues: \n     ``Matilda was supposed to be sleeping at a friend's house but \n     decided to sneak home and play a joke on her family. Her last \n     words were, `I love you, Daddy.' ''\n       This is followed by a stark message displayed full-screen \n     against a black background: ``A gun in the home triples the \n     risk of homicide in the home.''\n       We then hear Mr. Newman say, ``Before you bring a gun in \n     the house, think about it.''\n       The Newman spot is one of many compelling moments in a \n     special two-part Oprah Winfrey program devoted to the \n     terrible toll that gun violence is taking on young people, \n     especially children. The first part airs today.\n       The program opens with Ms. Winfrey standing in front of a \n     blackboard that says 15 children are killed by guns in the \n     United States every day, and that a teen-ager commits suicide \n     with a gun every six hours. ``If we were to build a \n     memorial'' to the kids killed by gunfire in the last 13 \n     years, Ms. Winfrey says, ``the names on that memorial would \n     outnumber'' the American lives lost in Vietnam.\n       The program uses the terms children and kids in the \n     broadest sense, so that they cover the entire period from \n     infancy through the teen years. In 1992, the last year for \n     which complete statistics are available, 37,776 people were \n     killed by firearms in the U.S. Of those, 5,379 were 19 years \n     of age or younger. Those are extraordinary number, and they \n     have risen since 1992.\n       And yet we pay very little attention to the problem of guns \n     and children, in part because of denial, and in part, as Ms. \n     Winfrey points out, because ``the frequency of death has \n     numbed us to what the death of one child really means.''\n       Today's show takes a step toward remedying that. For \n     example, we see glimpses of the exuberant life of Kenzo Bix \n     from home videos and a photo album and the comments of his \n     mother, Lynn. We see him as a toddler, and in that angelic \n     guise peculiar to the first grader, and romping as a teen-\n     ager,\n       ``He was kind of whimsical,'' his mother said. She shows us \n     a Mothers Day memo he posted: ``Do not go in the kitchen. \n     Your gifts are in there.''\n       ``That was actually the year just before he died,'' she \n     said.\n       When he was 14, Kenzo was accidentally shot and killed by a \n     friend who was playing with a gun.\n       One of the things that comes through in Ms. Winfrey's \n     program that is usually missing from news accounts of \n     homicides and suicides is the sheer suddenness of the absence \n     of the one who dies. Those who knew the child, were close to \n     the child, loved the child, cannot believe that he or she is \n     gone, and gone for good--gone irrevocably because of the \n     absurdity of the pulling of the trigger of some cheap and \n     deadly mechanism, usually for some cheap and stupid reason.\n       Larry Elizalde, 18, was a high school track and football \n     star, and Olympic team hopeful, who was shot to death on the \n     street in Chicago by gang members who mistook him for someone \n     else.\n       Mr. Elizalde died in the arms of a young seminarian, a \n     stranger named Doug Mitchell, who happened to have witnessed \n     the shooting. Mr. Mitchell, in an interview with Ms. Winfrey, \n     said he did not want ``the hatred of the gun, the violence of \n     the gun'' to be the last thing that mortally wounded youth \n     would experience, but rather the love and concern of another \n     human being.''\n       This was clung to as a blessing by Mr. Elizalde's anguished \n     mother, Lynette, who at first had harbored the desperate fear \n     that her son had died alone.\n       Throughout the program, Ms. Winfrey offers us evidence of \n     the humanity that is sacrificed--not just the lives lost, but \n     the humanity in all of us that is sacrificed by our \n     acceptance of the mass manufacture, mass sale and mass use of \n     firearms in this country.\n       She tries to lift at least a corner of our blanket of \n     denial to disturb and maybe even awaken us.\n       After all, she seems to be saying, children are \n     dying.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16686-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16686-S16687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CAN AMERICA'S RACIAL RIFTS BE HEALED BY A BLACK PRESIDENT?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the finest journalists in our \nNation today is David Shribman.\n  He writes a column that appears, among other places, in the Chicago \nTribune.\n  He recently had a column that suggests solving the problems of race \nin our country cannot be done dramatically by any one leader or person.\n  That does not suggest that a President, Senator, Governor, or leader \nin \n\n[[Page S 16687]]\nany capacity cannot have an impact. But his column reflects on the \ndepth of the problem that we have in our country, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to read it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n       Can America's Racial Rifts Be Healed by a Black President?\n\n                          (By David Shribman)\n\n       Washington.--Yes, there is a national political angle to \n     the O.J. Simpson murder trial. And yes, it's as troubling as \n     the social angle, the criminal-justice angle, the media angle \n     and the commercial angle.\n       It's this: Next year's election is going to be conducted in \n     a country that is so racially divided that one side can't \n     comprehend why the other side sees things the way it does. \n     And the irony is that the greatest imponderable in this \n     landscape of confusion is an African-American man.\n       Right now, as O.J. Simpson begins a new life, retired Gen. \n     Colin L. Powell contemplates his plans. Both are embarking on \n     uncharted paths. Both will be watched carefully by the \n     public. Both will in no small way shape the country we become \n     in the next century.\n       Simpson and Powell, to be sure, have so little in common \n     that it's almost stilted to connect them. One is a star \n     athlete, man about town, a bit of a libertine: fast on his \n     feet, fast in his life. The other is a war hero, a man of \n     probity, a paragon of discipline: slow to judge, slow to \n     rile.\n       But the murder trial of the one has opened up racial rifts \n     so wide that the temptation is to say that the steely drive \n     of the other might help the healing.\n       American voters know that the risk of hiring President \n     Powell isn't substantially different from the risk of hiring \n     President Dole or the risk of rehiring President Clinton. But \n     there is something about the Powell boomlet that carries \n     echoes from the tortured and tortuous American life of \n     Orenthal James Simpson. And those echoes are warning signals:\n       Colin Powell can't fix everything.\n       But that's not what you're hearing from the commentators, \n     handicappers, analysts, instant experts and grandstand big \n     mouths who proclaim their opinions on national politics much \n     the way they proclaim their opinions on, say, the National \n     Football League.\n       Many of them suggest that a Powell campaign could be the \n     George Washington Bridge of modern American politics, a \n     wonder of political architecture spanning wide distances--\n     between Republicans and Democrats, between liberals and \n     conservatives, above all between blacks and whites. It's an \n     appealing, even an intoxicating, notion: Bring centuries of \n     racism, violence, suspicion and repression to an abrupt end \n     by electing a black president.\n       But listen, too, to the undertow of the American \n     conversation. This is what many whites say about Colin \n     Powell: He doesn't seem black. He moves so easily between the \n     races. His accomplishments are so vivid that they are without \n     color content.\n       That's what some blacks say, somewhat warily, about Powell \n     as well: Not really black. Moves between the races. Without \n     color content.\n       And that, of course, is what everyone said about O.J. \n     Simpson. He was black but not too black. He was everybody's \n     favorite golf partner. He was the most fabulously appealing \n     black corporate spokesman of his time. When O.J. ran--and I \n     saw this myself two decades ago, at Buffalo Bills training \n     camps in Niagara Falls and again in Rich Stadium in Orchard \n     Park, N.Y.--the whites cheered as lustily as the blacks.\n       Everybody said that Simpson transcended race. He didn't. \n     Everybody says that Powell transcends race. He doesn't.\n       The wounds of America's centuries-long signature struggle \n     are too deep to be bandaged by one man. Winning the respect \n     of George Bush, who is privately urging Powell to run, isn't \n     enough to end tensions that have been festering since the \n     early days of colonial Virginia. It's a start, but it isn't a \n     finish.\n       Now that the trial of O.J. Simpson is over, the nation's \n     newspapers and television networks can start chronicling \n     another American drama: the 1996 presidential campaign. The \n     first subplot is Powell's decision, expected next month, \n     about whether to run for president.\n       One thing, however, is sure: A Powell candidacy can't \n     become a feel-good experience--or an excuse for not talking \n     about race.\n       Everyone now knows--press your TV remote and you'll see it \n     reinforced on O.J. retrospectives, talk shows, town meetings \n     and news broadcasts--that racial misunderstanding and \n     mistrust can't be overestimated in this country.\n       And so the Simpson trial isn't irrelevant to the campaign. \n     It tells us that race is more than skin deep, and so is \n     racism. It tells us that the leader who takes America into \n     the 21st Century will have to understand these gaps, not \n     paper them over. It tells us the president will have to say \n     something about things that, for many years, were better left \n     unsaid--about racism, injustice, fear. It tells us that, \n     after all these years, we still must summon what Lincoln \n     called the ``better angels of our nature.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16686-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16687-S16690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE UNITED NATIONS AT 50: LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING FORWARD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, in response to a question I asked \nDr. Jessica Mathews about an op-ed piece that appeared in the \nWashington Post, she sent me a speech made by Foreign Minister Gareth \nEvans of Australia.\n  I took the trouble to read the speech, and it is a good summation of \nwhere the United Nations is, where it has been, and where it should go.\n  Foreign Minister Evans points out the successes of the United \nNations, like El Salvador, Cambodia, and Mozambique, as well as areas \nwhere there are deficiencies. He calls upon the nations to move quickly \non a chemical weapons convention, and I hope the United States would \njoin in that effort.\n  Of no small significance is his comparison of the costs of running \nthe United Nations compared to other entities.\n  Note these sentences from his address:\n       The core functions of the U.N. (involving the Headquarters \n     in New York, the Offices in Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi, and \n     the five regional Commissions) cost just $1.2 billion between \n     them: to take just one comparison last year the annual budget \n     of just one Department in one United States city--the New \n     York Police Department--exceeded that by $600 million.\n       The total number of personnel needed to run those U.N.'s \n     core functions is around 10,700; compare the local \n     administration of my own national capital, Canberra--again \n     just one city in one of the U.N.'s 185 member states--which \n     employs some 22,000 people on the public payroll.\n       The cost of the U.N.'s peace operations last year--in \n     Cyprus and the Western Sahara and the former Yugoslavia and \n     thirteen other locations--was $3.2 billion: that's less than \n     what it takes to run just three New York City Departments \n     (Police, Fire and Corrections).\n       Add to the core functions of the U.N. all the related \n     programs and organs (including UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, \n     UNCTAD and International Drug Control) and you are talking \n     about a total of around 33,000 people and a total budget \n     (including both assessed and voluntary contributions) of $6.3 \n     billion: that sounds like a lot, but not quite so much when \n     one considers, for example, that the annual global turnover \n     of just one international accounting firm, Price Waterhouse, \n     is around $4.5 billion.\n       Go further, and add to the core functions and the related \n     programs all the other specialized programs and agencies of \n     the entire U.N. family--that is, add agencies like the FAO, \n     ILO, UNESCO and WHO, plus the IABA, and put into the equation \n     as well the Bretton Woods Institutions (the World Bank group \n     and the IMF, which between them employ nearly 10,000 people \n     and spend nearly $5 billion annually) and you are still \n     talking about total U.N. personnel of just around 61,400 and \n     a total U.N. system dollar cost of $18.2 billion.\n  He also praises Canada's leadership in suggesting that we have a more \neffective system of responding to world emergencies, and I join him in \nlauding what Canada has done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The statement follows:\n\n          The U.N. at Fifty: Looking Back and Looking Forward\n\n (Statement to the Fiftieth General Assembly of the United Nations by \n   Senator Gareth Evans, Foreign Minister of Australia, New York, 2 \n                             October 1995)\n\n        Mr. President, I congratulate you on your election to the \n     Presidency of this great Assembly. Your election is a tribute \n     both to you and to Portugal, and Australia will work with you \n     to ensure that this historic Fiftieth Session is as memorable \n     as it could possibly be. And I join in warmly welcoming, as \n     the UN's 185th member state, our fellow South Pacific Forum \n     member, Palau.\n       If we are to effectively prepare for our future we must \n     first be able clearly to see our past. If we are to see where \n     we must go, we must know where we have been: we must be \n     conscious of our failures, but we should be proud of our \n     successes.\n       The structure of today's world community--of sovereign, \n     self-determined, independent states working together on the \n     basis of equality in a framework of international law--simply \n     did not exist before the Charter of the United Nations. There \n     were imaginings of it in the minds of many for a very long \n     time, and we saw emerge, between the World Wars, a pale \n     approximation of it with the League of Nations. But it was at \n     that special moment in San Francisco, fifty years ago, that \n     today's concept of a community of nations was first truly \n     born. And that concept has passed the test of fifty years of \n     life.\n       Gifted though the authors of the Charter were, they would I \n     think be awed to see how very much their vision of a \n     globalised world has now been answered, and exceeded. Today's \n     world is one world, a world in which no individuals and no \n     states can aspire to solve all their problems or fulfill all \n     their dreams \n\n[[Page S 16688]]\n     alone. The ideas of San Francisco have entered into the unconscious of \n     people all over the world. Those who refuse to acknowledge \n     the global character of our world, or recoil from it and \n     retreat into unilateralism or, worse, isolationism, have \n     simply not understood the new dynamics that are at work. Ours \n     is an age in which we are called to more, not less, \n     cooperation--and to ever more, and more responsible, sharing \n     of our common destiny.\n       The ideas of San Francisco have assumed many concrete \n     forms, which have deepened and expanded over the last five \n     decades. States now habitually, virtually automatically, \n     conduct their relations with each other on the basis of the \n     United Nations Charter. We have added continually to the \n     corpus of international law and agreements made pursuant to \n     the Charter, in ways that have touched every aspect of modern \n     life. We have built institutions that have sought to deliver \n     to the peoples of the world their most basic needs--for peace \n     and security, for economic well-being, and for dignity and \n     liberty.\n       It was natural that, following a devastating World War and \n     the hideous brutality which accompanied it, that the Charter \n     would have at its heart the maintenance of international \n     peace and security. So far anyway, we have passed the test of \n     ensuring that the world would never again be subjected to \n     global conflict. The United Nations has been, of course, \n     deeply challenged in the maintenance of peace, from the very \n     beginning and ever since. There are areas in which its \n     attempts to maintain and restore peace have been flawed, and \n     where the UN has faltered. But for all that has gone wrong in \n     places like Bosnia and Somalia and Rwanda we should not \n     forget the successes, like those in El Salvador, Cambodia and \n     Mozambique. To go back a generation, no one should forget the \n     role that was played by the Security Council and the \n     Secretary-General in that desperate month of October 1962 \n     when the hands of the clock were seconds before midnight, and \n     the world faced potential nuclear holocaust. And no one \n     should forget the role that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty has played in falsifying the almost universal \n     prediction in the 1960s that within two decades there would \n     be twenty or more states possessing nuclear weapons.\n       In development, in seeking to fulfil its commitment to \n     promote ``social progress and better standards of life'' the \n     United Nations has laboured hard, sometimes in very difficult \n     circumstances. The gap between developed and developing \n     countries still remains unacceptably high; there have been \n     and continue to be difficulties with the availability of \n     resources for development assistance; and we have to \n     acknowledge the awful reality, according to the World Bank, \n     that 1.3 billion of our people still live in absolute \n     poverty. But in food and agriculture, in employment and \n     labour standards, in health, in education and in building the \n     infrastructure so vital to communities in the developing \n     world--roads, bridges, water systems--the United Nations and \n     its agencies have worked relentlessly in the service of the \n     human family. It is because of UNICEF that today 80 percent \n     of the world's children are immunised against six killer \n     diseases. And this is just one of hundreds of similar stories \n     that the UN can and should be telling.\n       Basic to the United Nations' concept of the world community \n     was that it should operate under and foster the development \n     of law, justice and human rights. A fundamental commitment of \n     the United Nations is to establish conditions under which \n     justice may prevail, international law will be respected and \n     peace can be built. In fulfilment of this charge, the United \n     Nations has provided the setting for the negotiation of over \n     three hundred major treaties, including in such crucial \n     fields as arms control, transport, navigation and \n     communications. This very practical area of international \n     cooperation has formed the framework of a globalised world.\n       The Charter of the United Nations spoke not just of \n     securing better standards of life, but of those better \n     standards being enjoyed ``in larger freedom''. And the \n     articulation, development and implementation of human rights \n     standards across the whole spectrum of rights--economic, \n     social and cultural as well and political and civil--has been \n     one of the UN's most important and constructive roles.\n       One of the worst of all denials of personal and political \n     freedom was that imposed by apartheid. The triumph over that \n     evil was above all a victory for those South Africans and \n     their leaders whose freedom and dignity apartheid had so long \n     denied. But it would ignore the testimony of history not to \n     recognize the importance of the role played by the General \n     Assembly and the Security Council in creating the conditions \n     for that to occur.\n       For the peoples of the world, no political right has been \n     more important than the right to self-determination. The \n     achievements of the United Nations in this field alone are \n     testimony to the indispensable role it has played in human \n     affairs, with hundreds of millions of people having exercised \n     their right to self-determination in these last fifty years. \n     It is the great movement of decolonisation, as much as the \n     Cold War and its aftermath, that defines the modern world as \n     we know it, and which shapes the world's agenda for the years \n     that lie ahead.\n       The United Nations of the future will need to be, above \n     all, an organisation which works and speaks for all its \n     members, no matter how large or small, and whose legitimacy \n     is thus without question. It must be an organisation better \n     oriented to performance, to delivery to people of the things \n     they need and have a right to expect. And it must be an \n     organisation which seeks to reintegrate, and better \n     coordinate, the implementation of the UN's three basic \n     objectives so clearly articulated at San Francisco fifty \n     years ago--the objectives of peace (meeting the need for \n     security), development (meeting economic needs) and human \n     rights and justice (meeting the need for individual and \n     group dignity and liberty).\n\n\n                            the peace agenda\n\n       Disarmament and arms control continue to be of crucial \n     importance in the peace agenda, and a major challenge \n     immediately ahead will be to maintain the momentum of \n     multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The \n     decision by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Review and \n     Extension Conference to extend the Treaty indefinitely was, \n     and remains--despite what has happened since--the right \n     decision. The work on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \n     must be brought to conclusion, as promised, in the first half \n     of 1996. We must also begin as soon as possible negotiations \n     on a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for \n     nuclear weapons purposes. A further helpful step, although \n     more difficult to achieve, would be a regime requiring all \n     states to declare and account for their present stocks of \n     fissile material. The basic objective in all of this is to \n     move towards the goal that is agreed by all--and it should \n     never be forgotten that it has been agreed by all--that we \n     will, ultimately, eliminate all nuclear weapons.\n       It is in this context, particularly, that the decisions by \n     France and China to continue nuclear testing are to be so \n     strongly deplored. The environmental consequences are bad \n     enough of setting off an explosion more than five times the \n     size of that which destroyed Hiroshima--as France did \n     yesterday on the fragile soil of Fangataufa in Australia's \n     Pacific neighborhood. But the nuclear policy consequences are \n     even worse. This is not the time to be reinforcing nuclear \n     stockpiles and asserting their ongoing deterrent role; the \n     world wants and needs to be moving in the opposite direction.\n       This is the time to be negotiating away those stockpiles, \n     and building verification systems of the kind we did with the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention--which needs still to be ratified \n     into effect (and I urge those states who have not yet acceded \n     to it to urgently do so). This is not the time to be \n     encouraging skepticism about the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty, as the French and Chinese tests are doing. It is, \n     rather, the time for the nuclear powers to be encouraging its \n     universal observance in the way that they best can--by \n     showing that they themselves are absolutely serious about \n     moving to eliminate nuclear weapons from the face of the \n     globe. The best way for them to do that right now is for \n     France and China to immediately end their testing programs; \n     for all the nuclear weapons states to sign on to the nuclear \n     weapons free zone treaties that now exist in the South \n     Pacific and elsewhere; and for those states to commit \n     themselves wholeheartedly to negotiating a genuinely \n     comprehensive zero-threshold CTBT into place by the middle \n     of next year.\n       The past few turbulent years of United Nations experience \n     on the ground in peace keeping and peace enforcement has \n     underlined the need for it to improve the effectiveness of \n     its work in these important fields. Australia has welcomed \n     the Secretary-General's further work in this area in his very \n     lucid January 1995 Supplement to An Agenda for Peace. In our \n     own contributions to the debate on these issues, we have \n     argued for the clearest possible thinking to be given to the \n     achievability of objectives right across the whole spectrum \n     of responses to security problems--from peace building to \n     peace maintenance to peace restoration to peace enforcement.\n       We have consistently argued, and I make the point again \n     briefly today, that if the United Nations is to be able to \n     meet effectively the security challenges of the post-Cold War \n     world it must begin to devote more resources to preventive \n     strategies than to reactive strategies. It makes more sense \n     to concentrate on prevention than on after-the-event peace \n     restoration, both for inter-state conflict and in the \n     unhappily now far more common case of intra-state conflict. \n     Violent conflicts are always far more difficult and costly to \n     resolve than non-violent disputes, and failed states are \n     extreme difficult to piece back together.\n       All that said, it has been encouraging to see the progress \n     made in recent days toward resolving the conflict in the \n     former Yugoslavia, and in moving the Middle East peace \n     process a substantial new step forward. The UN should always \n     be prepared to lend its support and encouragement to \n     preventive diplomacy and peace making efforts taking place \n     outside the formal framework of the UN system, and it should \n     remain particularly alert to the opportunities envisaged in \n     the Charter for advancing the peace agenda through regional \n     organisations. In this context, we in the Asia Pacific have \n     been pleased with the rapid evolution of the ASEAN Regional \n     Forum over the last two years as a new vehicle for dialogue, \n     and trust and confidence building, in our own region.\n       Particular attention has been given recently to the \n     question of improving the United Nations' rapid reaction \n     capability, and I  \n\n[[Page S 16689]]\n\n     warmly commend the work that has been done to clarify our \n     thinking on these issues by the Netherlands and Danish \n     Governments, and particularly in the major Canadian report, \n     Towards a Rapid Reaction Capability for the United Nations, \n     just presented to the Assembly. The very useful emphasis of \n     the Canadian study is on the idea of improving the UN \n     system's capability at the centre first--particularly in the \n     area of operational planning--and thereby encouraging \n     greater willingness by troop contributors to give \n     practical and more urgent effect to standby arrangements. \n     No organizational arrangements will substitute for clear-\n     eyed decisionmaking by the Security Council on the \n     responses and mandates that are appropriate to particular \n     situations, but the implementation of changes of this kind \n     should make us much better equipped as an international \n     community to deal in the future with situations like that \n     in Rwanda, where last time our response was so tragically \n     inadequate.\n\n\n                         the development agenda\n\n       The security agenda tends to dominate most popular \n     perceptions of the UN's role, but we in the international \n     community must never allow our attention to be diverted from \n     the demands of the development agenda, now as pressing as \n     ever. When historians hundreds of years hence look back at \n     this last half century, the Cold War and its aftermath will \n     not be the only great international current to be remembered: \n     it will be the giant step of decolonisation that looms at \n     least as large.\n       Decolonisation led to the emergence of a world economy \n     which for many years has been seen as divided principally \n     into two categories--the developed and developing countries. \n     But today the picture is more complicated. Mainly for reasons \n     of change in technology and information systems, we now live \n     in a global economy. No part of it is entirely separate from \n     the whole, and no-one can act in that economy in an effective \n     way entirely alone. Because we live in a global economy a key \n     part of our action to deal with the problems of development \n     must be multilateral. And the key problem facing us--both \n     multilaterally and in our bilateral donor roles--is that \n     within the global economy the gap between rich and poor \n     countries, despite all efforts to resist this, has grown. The \n     fact that some 1.3 billion of the 5.7 billion people alive \n     today live at an unacceptable level of poverty is morally \n     insupportable, and dangerous.\n       The United Nations of the future must, as a matter of the \n     most urgent priority, forge a new agenda for development and \n     reshape its relevant institutions to implement that agenda \n     effectively. This is as important as any task it faces in the \n     service of the human family, and in recreating itself as an \n     institution fit for the 21st Century. The agenda is available \n     for all to see. It has been fulsomely described in the six \n     global conferences held by the United Nations in the last \n     four years--the conferences on children, the environment, \n     human rights, population, social development and women. There \n     have also been important studies by the international \n     financial institutions and by academic institutions. We \n     know now what we need to do. We must resolve, politically, \n     to do it.\n       In pursuing these various themes it is important, however, \n     for us not to lose sight of those geographic regions where \n     particular focus is still required, and where the UN's role \n     is more vital than ever. Africa's influence and importance \n     continues to be felt throughout the world in every field of \n     human activity and culture. Exciting political developments, \n     including the ending of apartheid, have been accompanied by \n     major new efforts to restructure and reform national \n     economies: those efforts demand the continued support of the \n     international community, and in particular the UN system. \n     Other regions where the UN needs to play a particular role to \n     facilitate economic and social development are the Central \n     Asian republics, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and in a \n     number of areas in the Indian Ocean region.\n       The Indian Ocean region is one where Australia, as an \n     Indian Ocean country, has been promoting, with others in the \n     region, both governmental and non-governmental efforts to \n     enhance regional cooperation, particularly on economic and \n     trade issues. The success to date of APEC in developing \n     cooperative strategies in the Asia Pacific region to promote \n     prosperity and stability, complementing the UN's broader work \n     for these goals at the international level, offers one \n     possible model for the countries of the Indian Ocean Rim to \n     consider.\n       The institutions of the United Nations relevant to economic \n     and social development are urgently in need of reform. The \n     General Assembly has created the high-level working group \n     needed for political consensus on this. It must complete its \n     work in this Fiftieth Anniversary year, and it must do so \n     creatively, setting aside past vested interests in the \n     system. We must implement the development agenda of the \n     future in a way which ensures a productive and fair place in \n     the global economy for all states.\n\n\n                              human rights\n\n       The complex and inter-linked system of principles, legal \n     regimes and machinery that the United Nations has established \n     to promote human rights is one of its major achievements. It \n     must be built upon and strengthened, recognizing always that \n     the human rights whose universality and indivisibility we \n     assert, are about economic, social and cultural rights just \n     as much as the civil and political rights on which developed \n     countries tend to focus their attention. Priority must be \n     given to the major international human rights instruments and \n     machinery and the committees which monitor their \n     implementation. By this means we can provide a frank, non-\n     confrontational and constructive dialogue amongst states \n     parties.\n       The advisory services and technical assistance activities \n     of the United Nations can also play a role in promoting the \n     observance of human rights and the implementation of \n     democratic principles around the world. Programs to help \n     countries develop national institutions and systems to \n     promote and protect human rights will enhance their capacity \n     to prevent violations and make a direct contribution to human \n     security.\n\n\n                       the organizational agenda\n\n       It cannot be emphasized enough that the peace and \n     development and human rights agendas I have mentioned are all \n     inter- linked. We need to avoid the compart- mentalisation \n     that occurred throughout the Cold War years, in which peace \n     and security issues, development issues and human rights and \n     justice issues were isolated in completely different \n     conceptual and institutional boxes. Any viable modern concept \n     of international peace, let alone peace within states, must \n     recognize that ``peace and security'' and ``development'' are \n     indissolubly bound up with each other: there can be no \n     sustainable peace without development and no development \n     without peace. And human rights, in the fullest sense, have \n     to come into the equation too; there is unlikely to be \n     sustainable peace in any society if material needs are \n     satisfied, but needs for dignity and liberty are not.\n       No agendas of substance, no matter how clear in concept and \n     well-coordinated in principle they may be, will mean anything \n     to people if they are not able to be implemented through \n     effective organizational structures and instruments. There \n     has been widespread recognition in recent years that the \n     structure of the United Nations that grew up during the last \n     fifty years is simply not adequate to the tasks of the next.\n       We now have an embarrassment of riches with respect to \n     ideas and proposals for change to the United Nations \n     organization. Just as it is urgent that we complete work on \n     An Agenda for Development in this fiftieth year, it is \n     equally urgent that we compete the work of the high-level \n     working group on the reform of the United Nations system, \n     also within the fiftieth year.\n       The structural problem that it is probably the most \n     urgently necessary to resolve, if the credibility of the UN \n     system is to be maintained, is that of the Security Council. \n     The debate on this subject has been long and detailed and is \n     familiar to all of us. Australia's definite view is that it \n     has been going on for long enough, and we are now at the time \n     where action is required. Last year we submitted some \n     illustrative models on the basis of which consideration could \n     be given to an expansion in the membership of the Council. \n     Others have made very specific proposals. Again, in this \n     field there is no lack of ideas. What we must now do is move \n     to the stage of forging political consensus on a new Security \n     Council which will be effective, represents the whole \n     membership of the United Nations and sensibly reflect the \n     realities of today and the future, not those of 1945.\n       There are many structural changes and personnel reforms \n     that could and should be made within the UN system to improve \n     its efficiency. But ultimately the quality of that system \n     depends on what we are prepared to pay for it.\n       It is important to appreciate at the outset the order of \n     magnitude of the sums we are talking about. The core \n     functions of the UN (involving the Headquarters in New York, \n     the Offices in Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi, and the five \n     regional Commissions) cost just $US 1.2 billion between them: \n     to take just one comparison last year the annual budget of \n     just one Department in one United States city--the New York \n     Police Department exceeded that by $600 million.\n       The total number of personnel needed to run those UN's core \n     functions is around 10,700: compare the local administration \n     of my own national capital, Canberra--again just one city in \n     one of the UN's 185 member states--which employs some 22,000 \n     people on the public payroll.\n       The cost of the UN's peace operations last year--in Cyprus \n     and the Western Sahara and the former Yugoslavia and thirteen \n     other locations--was $3.2 billion: that's less than what it \n     takes to run just three New York City Departments (Police, \n     Fire and Corrections).\n       Add to the core functions of the UN all the related \n     programs and organs (including UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, \n     UNCTAD and International Drug Control) and you are talking \n     about a total of around 33,000 people and a total budget \n     (including both assessed and voluntary contributions) of $6.3 \n     billion: that sounds a lot, but not quite so much when one \n     considers, for example, that the annual global turnover of \n     just one international accounting firm, Price Waterhouse, \n     is around $4.5 billion.\n       Go further, and add to the core functions and the related \n     programs all the other specialized programs and agencies of \n     the entire UN family--that is, add agencies like the FAO, \n     ILO, UNESCO and WHO, plus the IAEA, and put into the equation \n     as well the Bretton Woods Institutions (the World Bank group \n     and the IMF, which between then employ nearly 10,000 people \n     and spend nearly $5 \n\n[[Page S 16690]]\n     billion annually) and you are still talking about total UN personnel of \n     just around 61,400 and a total UN system dollar cost of $18.2 \n     billion.\n       61,400 may sound like a lot of people, but not when you \n     consider that more than this number--65,000 in fact--are \n     employed by the three Disneylands in California, Florida and \n     France. Three times as many people--183,000--sell McDonald's \n     hamburgers around the world as work for the UN system.\n       And $18.2 billion might be a lot of money, but just one \n     major multinational corporation, Dow Chemical, which happens \n     also to have 61,000 employees world-wide, has an annual \n     revenue in excess of $20 billion.\n       When you put the UN's financial problems into this kind of \n     perspective, the solutions do not look quite so hard. Surely \n     between us the 185 member states, with our combined defence \n     expenditure alone of around $767 billion (as calculated in \n     the UNDP's 1994 Human Development Report), can find that kind \n     of money? But of course the problem of paying for the UN has \n     now become critical because of the unwillingness, or \n     inability, of so many of the member states (including the \n     biggest of us all) to pay their assessed contributions--\n     notwithstanding that the cost of these for the major \n     developed country contributors works out at between $7 and \n     $15 per head per year, the price of no more than one or two \n     movie tickets in this city.\n       We have a short-term problem, which can and should be \n     solved within the UN system by allowing the UN to borrow from \n     the World Bank. But we also have a longer-term problem which, \n     frankly, does not look as though it is going to be solved--\n     however much we continue to work at adjusting assessment \n     scales, and however much we exhort member states to pay up, \n     and remind them of the consequences under Article 19 of the \n     Charter if they fail to do so.\n       So what are we to do about all this? In my judgment, it is \n     time to look again--this time very seriously indeed--at the \n     options which do exist for supplementing member states' \n     contributions by external sources of finance. The \n     practicability of collecting a levy on every one of the $300 \n     thousand billion worth of foreign exchange transactions that \n     now occur every year remains to be fully assessed, but simple \n     arithmetic tells us that if we strike a rate for such a levy \n     of just .001 per cent--which hardly seems likely to have any \n     significant economic consequences--we could generate $3 \n     billion. And we know that if we could levy international \n     airline passengers just $10 for every international sector \n     flown--which would be very easily collectable indeed--we \n     could also raise $3 billion, nearly the whole annual cost of \n     UN peace operations.\n       There are as well other revenue options that have, to a \n     greater or lesser extent, the same rational nexus with UN \n     costs that these do, in the sense that they involve \n     transactions which are international, which take place within \n     a framework of law and cooperation provided by the United \n     Nations, and can be harmed by a breakdown in international \n     peace and security--precisely the areas in which the United \n     Nations has a fundamental responsibility.\n       But traditionally a threshold objection of principle has \n     been mounted against any such talk. Member states, it has \n     been said, should themselves own the UN system; if the \n     Secretariat had direct access to non-member state revenue, \n     who knows what adventures it might be inclined to get up to. \n     But ownership and control are totally separate issues. The UN \n     operates on a sovereign equality principle which means that, \n     for example, those six states which presently between them \n     pay over 55 per cent of the UN's regular budget should under \n     no circumstances have greater authority over how it is spent \n     than the overwhelming majority of members who each pay much \n     lesser proportions of the total.\n       Surely, whatever the funding sources involved, the crucial \n     question is how and by whom the money is spent: it is \n     absolutely crucial that there be appropriate control of funds \n     by member states, with all the accountability mechanisms that \n     implies, but that doesn't mean that those member states \n     should themselves have to prove all the funds in the first \n     place.\n       In talking to many of my foreign ministerial colleagues \n     from a wide range of countries and across all continents on \n     these issues over the last few days, I have found an almost \n     unanimous reaction that the UN's present and likely \n     continuing financial crisis demands that these issues be \n     looked at again, without any pre-judgments of the \n     questions of principle or practicability involved.\n       I would suggest, accordingly, that the time is right for \n     the Secretary-General to convene once again a high-level \n     advisory group, like the Volcker/Ogata group established in \n     1992, with a mandate explicitly to think through what has \n     hitherto been more or less unthinkable--how to fund the UN \n     system in a way that reaches out beyond the resources that \n     member states are prepared to directly put into it. Such a \n     group could report to, or work with, a committee of \n     representatives of member states--one in existence already \n     (like the High Level Working Group on the Financial Situation \n     of the United Nations) or one newly created for the purpose.\n       A great deal of work has been already, or is being, done on \n     many of these issues, and it should be possible for such a \n     group to report within six months or so, and certainly within \n     a year. The parameters of the debate have to be changed, and \n     for that to happen we need an authoritative new statement of \n     the art of the possible.\n       Here as elsewhere, we have to move forward. We have to look \n     to new ideas. We have to encourage humankind's ingenuity to \n     search for better ways for states to deal with each other as \n     relationships take new shape, as new states emerge and as \n     problems which could not have been conceived of a few years \n     ago become the challenges of the day.\n       We will fail to meet those challenges if we adhere solely \n     to the ideas and dogma of the past. The United Nations was \n     itself founded on a mixture of idealism and pragmatism. Both \n     were essential to build a new world fifty years ago, and in \n     the past fifty years that idealism has not disappeared. It \n     was an important force in bringing about the end of the Cold \n     War, and more than anything else it was idealism that lay \n     behind the process of decolonisation which shifted the \n     tectonic plates of history.\n       To some, idealism will always be the enemy of practicality. \n     But to others, it will always involve, more than anything \n     else, the courage to take advantage of new opportunities, \n     ensuring that at least some of today's ideals will become \n     tomorrow's reality.

Mr. President, when the New York Times ``Week in \nReview'' section had an article by Adam Clymer titled, ``Politics and \nthe Dead Arts of Compromise,'' I read it and cut it out for my future \nreference. I have just re-read the article, and it is such a \nsignificant insight into where we are and where we're going or where \nwe're not going, that I want to insert it into the Record.\n  We have become increasingly an excessively partisan body. I do not \nblame either party specifically for that. I have seen that grow over \nthe years, and it has hurt our country, and it has hurt the two-party \nsystem.\n  What is essential is not that we win public relations battles, but \nthat we work out practical compromises to govern. That's what Adam \nClymer understands, and that's what we have to understand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his observations be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The observations follow:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 22, 1995]\n\n                Politics and the Dead Arts of Compromise\n\n                            (By Adam Clymer)\n\n       Washington.--The most serious debate in at least three \n     decades over the role of government in American life is being \n     conducted in the nation's capital these days--with all the \n     dignity of a 30-second spot. \n\n[[Page S 16691]]\n\n       Polls are used to consider timetables for possible \n     negotiations, as each side ponders its moment of maximum \n     advantage. Television spots about Medicare have employed \n     slogans only minimally more civil than ``liar, liar, pants on \n     fire!''--which, of course, is their underlying message.\n       And focus groups scripted the debate that preceded the \n     House's vote Thursday to curb $270 billion in spending for \n     Medicare and make wrenching changes in the centerpiece of \n     Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Democrats may not have needed \n     any research before accusing the Republicans of slighting the \n     elderly to help the rich; that may be not be thoughtful, but \n     it is instinctive. But when Republicans said ``preserve and \n     protect,'' over and over, they were following their \n     pollsters' advice, not engaging in a serious discussion.\n       Even the most ordinary tasks of Congress are subordinated \n     to political tactics. Only three of the 13 spending bills \n     that Congress had promised to complete before the fiscal year \n     began three weeks ago have gone to the White House. Some of \n     those bills have real problems, and may be hard for even \n     Republicans to agree on.\n       But a few days ago Speaker Newt Gingrich explained the \n     delay in purely tactical terms. He said he thought President \n     Clinton would try to make headlines by vetoing them, and \n     snapped, ``I'm not going to give his Presidential campaign \n     new cheap-shot photo-ops.'' (In past Congresses, the dynamics \n     were only a little different: Democrats invited vetoes by \n     passing bills they knew Presidents Reagan and Bush would \n     reject, seeking campaign issues for the next election.)\n\n\n                          arranging surrender\n\n       One reason that major legislation and national issues are \n     being approached with the winner-take-all-quality of \n     elections is that the normal process of getting things done \n     in Washington, compromise, has become synonymous with \n     capitulation. If compromise is evil, then who needs \n     negotiations? All that's needed to arrange are the terms of \n     surrender.\n       Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Anneberg School of \n     Communications at the University of Pennsylvania and an \n     expert on political language, suggests the problem is more \n     than rhetorical. ``The thing that the word `compromise' was \n     designed to describe--the process by which you forge \n     consensus--is no longer an acceptable part of the political \n     process,'' she said. That was especially true in the House, \n     she said, where ``institutional courtesies'' like \n     consideration for the minority and civility in debate have \n     fallen into disuse.\n       Republicans, driven by a huge and unbending freshman class, \n     offer no apologies. Representative David M. McIntosh, an \n     Indiana freshman, explained last week: ``When we went home in \n     August, we all heard from the public, `Don't back down, don't \n     give in to the Senate or the President.' We came back and we \n     told the leadership that we won't back down, and we \n     haven't.''\n       Mr. Gingrich knew what was coming, for right after the \n     election last year he proclaimed himself ``very prepared to \n     cooperate with the Clinton Administration,'' but ``not \n     prepared to compromise.'' And even Senator Bob Dole, the \n     majority leader, who has built a considerable legislative \n     reputation on making deals, said last month, ``This will not \n     be an autumn of compromise, make no mistake about it.''\n       Mr. Clinton does not always spurn compromise. But he has \n     not given it a good name, either. Last week he even seemed to \n     be trying to cut a deal with himself on the subject of taxes, \n     first sounding contrite that he had raised taxes ``too much'' \n     in 1993 and then pronouncing himself proud of that year's \n     budget. But he has been attacking many of the Republicans' \n     spending cuts as ``extremist,'' so he risks being accused of \n     surrender if he reaches an agreement with them on next year's \n     budget.\n\n\n                             feats of clay\n\n       House Democrats will oppose almost any deal that involves \n     spending cuts; they don't believe in them. But Mr. Clinton \n     also fears attacks from the press, which cannot believe that \n     Mr. Clinton can give ground to help the country, but only \n     because he is wishy-washy.\n       Compromise was once highly prized in American politics, at \n     the Constitutional Convention, in the Republic's early days, \n     and when Henry Clay, the dominant lawmaker of the first half \n     of the 19th century, was hailed as the ``Great Compromiser.''\n       But in the years leading up to the Civil War, compromise \n     lost its good name. Abolitionists held slavery to be a moral \n     abomination, and Abraham Lincoln himself rejected a pre-\n     inaugural effort to preserve the Union by guaranteeing \n     slavery forever in the states where it then existed.\n       Joel Silbey, a Cornell University historian, noted that \n     compromise again fell into disrepute just before the \n     Progressive Era, when ``government seemed to be forever \n     compromising with evil power.'' Like the Civil War period, \n     and like today, he said, that was a time when outsiders got \n     involved in the political process and scorned its traditions.\n       An important House Republican leadership aide said the same \n     circumstances prevailed today: ``The American people think \n     that politicians, once they get to Washington, are all too \n     willing to give up their principles, wedded to a system of \n     selling out.''\n       Today's politicians find a lot of moral imperatives, like \n     the difference between achieving a balanced budget in 2002 \n     and, say, 2003. Not Mr. Clinton, who has said at various \n     times that it would take five years, seven years, eight years \n     or nine. But seven years is what the Republicans say they \n     must have--or else.\n       There are Democrats who speak of cuts in Medicare in the \n     apocalyptic terms they would use if faced with a bill \n     completely repealing this greatest of the Great Society's \n     programs. And there are Republicans, like Mr. McIntosh, who \n     look in absolute terms on a pet project of his and \n     Representative Ernest Istook's--an effort to prohibit groups \n     that get any Federal money from lobbying the Federal \n     Government, ever. They threaten to hold all other legislation \n     hostage until they get that prohibition adopted.\n       Norman Ornstein, the Congressional scholar from the \n     American Enterprise Institute, says there may be 100 House \n     Republicans ``who believe, deep down, that compromise is a \n     bad thing.'' He said the leaders were giving themselves very \n     little breathing room by leaving only three weeks to get \n     major bills passed and then settle things before the debt \n     limit expires Nov. 12. ``It's a dangerous end game,'' he \n     warns.\n       Earlier this month, it seemed both sides might negotiate. \n     But the Clinton side thought the Congressional quest for \n     Medicare cuts was hurting the Republicans and saw no reason \n     to give ground. It may be only when both sides think the \n     public will blame them for stubbornness that they may sit \n     down together.\n       If so, politicians may be too busy testing attack phrases--\n     like ``tax cut for your wealthy contributors,'' or ``a joke \n     wrapped in fraud and shrouded by farce''--to judge the public \n     clearly.\n       Peter D. Hart, a Washington pollster, said a recent poll \n     conducted for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed \n     that a majority of Democrats wanted the President ``to make \n     adjustments to reach compromise'' with Congressional \n     Republicans on budget issues and that a majority of \n     Republicans wanted their lawmakers to compromise with Mr. \n     Clinton.\n       ``Compromise may be a dirty word in Washington,'' he said. \n     ``But out among the public it is a very positive \n     term.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is informed \nthat, under the circumstances, morning business would have been closed. \nDoes he ask consent to continue that for a time in excess of 5 minutes?\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, last Friday, in the early hours following \nmidnight, the Senate passed S. 1357, the Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1995. Here it is; it is 1,949 pages. The passage of that bill was not \none of the Senate's finest hours. It was the latest, and perhaps the \nmost striking, example to date of the misuse of the Budget Act's \nreconciliation process to ram through the Senate a 1,949-page \nmonstrosity--there it is--a gigantic monstrosity, which will \npermanently change a vast number of statutes in ways that no Senator \ncan possibly understand.\n  The fast-track reconciliation procedures that were established in the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 were never intended to be used as a \nmethod to enact omnibus legislative changes under expedited, non-\nfilibusterable procedures. I know, because I helped to write the \nCongressional Budget Act in 1974, and it was never in my contemplation \nthat the reconciliation legislation would be used in this fashion and \nfor these purposes--never! I would not have supported it; I would have \nvoted against it.\n  As a matter of fact, I would have left some loopholes in that \nlegislation, which would have saved us, and which would continue to \nsave us from stultifying ourselves by using such procedures to pass \nlegislation which otherwise would be debated at great length, amended \nmany times, and assure the American people that their representatives \nhere knew what they were doing when they passed the legislation. So it \nwas never intended to be used in that fashion. Yet, that is what has \noccurred under the reconciliation process.\n  Beginning in 1981, the Senate Budget Committee has piled together \nwhatever changes the authorizing committees have recommended, and that \nis in accordance with the law. The Budget Committee has to do that. It \nhas no alternative. It has no recourse. It cannot amend, substantively, \nmeasures that come to it from the authorizing committees. And the \nBudget Committee then must present this package to the Senate in the \nform of a reconciliation bill, often with little regard as to \n\n[[Page S 16692]]\nwhether there was any deficit reduction purpose for such provisions, as \nwas intended by the 1974 Budget Act.\n  The temptation to get such extraneous provisions into reconciliation \nacts is almost irresistible because of the fact that reconciliation \nbills, as I say, cannot be filibustered, opportunities to amend \nreconciliation bills are extremely limited, and the time for \nconsideration of the measure is super extremely tight.\n  That was the reason for my amendment to the Budget Act in 1985. In \noffering what is commonly called the ``Byrd Rule''--I have noted that \nin the press it was referred to as the ``so-called'' Byrd Rule. I do \nnot know what the press means by the ``so-called'' Byrd Rule. It is the \nByrd Rule. My purpose was to curb this tendency to throw everything, \nincluding the kitchen sink, into reconciliation acts.\n  Now, the Byrd Rule has proved its efficacy. It might well be compared \nto Cerberus, which was--as referred to by Hesiod, the Greek epic poet, \nwho lived in the 8th century B.C.--a hydra-headed dog that had three \nheads, according to Hesiod, and it guarded the entry into the infernal \nregions. That is what the Byrd Rule does. It may be termed a ``hydra-\nheaded'' piece of work, but it guards the entry into the regions of \nlegislation, the entry of extraneous matter--Cerberus. Since its \nadoption, the Byrd Rule has had some success--considerable success, I \nwould say--in removing extraneous matter from reconciliation bills.\n  In this year's reconciliation bill, for example, the Democratic staff \nof the Budget Committee identified almost 250 provisions in the \nreconciliation bill, as reported by the Budget Committee which were, in \ntheir view, violations of the Byrd Rule. The list prepared by the \nRepublican staff totaled almost 200 Byrd Rule violations. So it is \nobvious that Senators are going to continue to attempt to use the \nreconciliation bill as a vehicle to which they hope to attach their \nfavorite legislative programs and provisions, whether such provisions \nare extraneous or not.\n  Mr. President, I have here at the desk--and I have already shown it \nonce to the viewers--the Senate reconciliation bill, S. 1357. It \nconsists of two volumes and a total of 1,949 pages.\n  Now, Senators received these two volumes--these 1,949 pages--on \nWednesday of last week. They showed up on our desks on Wednesday. That \nwas the same day that the 20-hour clock started ticking on this \nreconciliation bill. Debate is limited to 20 hours on the \nreconciliation bill. Can you imagine? Twenty hours on these two \nvolumes, 1,949 pages!\n  The bills just appeared the same day. A motion to proceed to take up \nthat bill was not debatable, and so when the motion was made, the bill \nwas ipso facto immediately before the Senate, and the clock was \nrunning.\n  I would hope that the American people who are viewing what I am \nsaying here through that camera can put themselves into the shoes of \nthose of us who are elected by those people to represent them in this \ngreat legislative Chamber.\n  People expect out there, expect us to know what we are doing. Passing \nthe reconciliation bill was like playing blind man's bluff at a blind \nman's ball.\n  Imagine walking around here with a handkerchief around one's head and \nover one's eyes, voting blind. It cannot be aptly described in any \nlesser fashion. Not one Senator--not one--and there are some pretty \nbright Senators in this body, excepting myself--not one Senator really \nknew what he was voting on when he voted for that bill.\n  No committee held hearings on this bill. Several committees held some \nhearings on portions of it but no committee held hearings on the whole \nbill. There was no committee report, nothing by which we might be \nguided, except our own staffs. They were hit with the same problem at \nthe same time.\n  Yet, we only had 20 hours on which to act on the bill. Everything \ncounted against that 20 hours except, say, the reading of amendments, \nthe time that was consumed on rollcalls, the time consumed on some \nquorum calls, and the time consumed by the Chair in response to \nparliamentary inquiries and so on.\n  That was an impossible--impossible--assignment. When the Senate \ncompleted action on its version, the 1,949 pages, it was only partly \ndone with its work because the conference will now take place between \nthe two Houses on the two differing versions of the reconciliation \nbill.\n  I now hold in my hand the House version. This is the House version of \nthe reconciliation bill as passed by the House and sent to the Senate--\ntwo volumes, 1,839 pages. The House did its work, in less time. The \nHouse only had 6 hours!\n  That is beyond my imagination or comprehension, really, that a body \nof 435 persons could work its will in a knowledgeable, knowing, wise \nway in 6 hours on a bill consisting of 1,839 pages--that was 110 pages \nless than we saw on the Senate bill. That is the House bill.\n  Now, when the Senate completed its work, it ended up with a bill \nconsisting of 1,862 pages--two volumes. So when the House and Senate \nconferees go to conference, this is what they have to contend with--\nthese four volumes I hold in my hands. They are supposed to resolve the \ndifferences between the two Houses on the separate versions of the bill \nas passed by both Houses.\n  When the conference is completed, the conference report will come \nbefore the Senate under a time limitation of 10 hours--10 hours. We are \ngoing to get this thing back! We are going to get the conference report \non this Leviathan. The conference report, we will have all of 10 hours \nto debate that.\n  There will surely be a number of brand-new items and provisions that \nwill be included in the conference report which have not yet been \nconsidered by the Senate. Yet, as I say, Senators will have only 10 \nhours to debate that conference report and amend it--if there is an \nopportunity to amend, if there are amendments in disagreement.\n  The 20-hour cap on reconciliation bill and 10-hour cap on conference \nreports to reconciliation bills is simply woefully inadequate for \nSenators to carefully examine these massive, nearly 2,000-page \nreconciliation bills and to offer and debate their amendments.\n  So that is why I offered an amendment during the debate on this \nreconciliation bill to extend the 20-hour cap to 50 hours on \nreconciliation bills and to extend the 10-hours to 20 hours on \nreconciliation conference report.\n  Do you know what happened? My amendment died on what was almost a \nparty-line vote. One Republican, I believe, the able Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Jeffords], voted to extend this time.\n  Mr. President, the lack of time allowed for Senate debate on \nreconciliation bills, means in fact that extremely narrow and often \nvery unwise provisions can be easily hidden in these huge \nreconciliation packages. This year's bill for example appears to be \nvery close to a repeat of Reaganomics. What do I mean by that? Massive \ntax cuts for the wealthy, together with a huge military build-up, paid \nfor by devastation in public investments for transportation, education, \nand research, and by steep cuts in medicare.\n  During the campaign for the Republican nomination in 1980, candidate \nBush had said that the Reagan revolution was based on ``voo-doo'' \neconomics. And, we should not forget the warning of Majority Leader \nHoward Baker that the 1981 Reagan tax cut amounted to a ``river boat \ngamble.''\n  Mr. President, we lost that gamble.\n  The Nation is still paying the price for that ``river boat gamble'' \nin terms of the national debt and the interest on it that was run up \nduring President Reagan's eight years. On the day that Mr. Reagan took \noffice, the national debt stood at $932 billion. It took the Nation 192 \nyears and 38 different Presidents (39 different administrations) to \nreach a debt of $932 billion. Yet, on January 20, 1989, the day that \nMr. Reagan left office, the national debt was $2.683 trillion.\n  Mr. President, how much is $1 trillion? How long would it take to \ncount $1 trillion, at the rate of $1 per second? Would it surprise you \nto know that it would take 32,000 years to count $1 trillion at the \nrate of $1 per second?\n  So, the national debt had mushroomed like the prophet's gourd, \novernight, to $2.683 trillion.\n  In other words, after the eight years of the Reagan Presidency, the \nbudget was not balanced, as he had promised. Instead, the ``river boat \ngamble'' had left us with an 8-year string of record breaking deficits \nand a resulting increase in the national debt of $1.751 \n\n[[Page S 16693]]\ntrillion. Yet, we, supposedly intelligent men and women, have embraced \nthat same failed economic theory all over again in this reconciliation \nbill that we just recently passed. Reaganomics was a disastrous policy \nand it is unbelievable that our learning curve is so flat.\n  I have been reading about the poor performance of American students \nin history, American history, and many other subjects, for that matter. \nI noted just a day or so ago in the newspapers--and I can believe some \nof what I read in them--that the performance of American students in \nAmerican history classes is dismally poor--dismally poor. That is not \nto be compared with our own performance, which is much worse. It is \nunbelievable that our learning curve is so flat, so flat that in \npassing that reconciliation bill we would do it all over again. Do what \nall over again? Embrace the same failed economic policies that failed \nduring the administration of Mr. Reagan. But that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  We have dusted off old, tired, discredited Reaganomics, rechristened \nit a ``Contract With America'' and slammed-dunked it into law through \nthis crazy, crazy, convoluted process called Reconciliation. The so-\ncalled Contract With America.\n  Mr. President, among the 1,949 pages of that reconciliation bill, \nthere appeared provisions calling for $245 billion in tax cuts over the \nnext 7 years--$245 billion in reduced Federal revenues at the same time \nthat we are trying to balance the budget.\n  I hear this blather in here practically every morning on the Senate \nfloor by a few Senators who think the reconciliation bill was something \nakin to the Second Coming. We have reached the millennium, to hear them \ntalk about it. They talk about how great this reconciliation bill was, \nhow we have balanced the budget, and how we have lifted the burden off \nour children and grandchildren because we have balanced the budget with \nthis reconciliation bill--they say.\n  Aristotle said of Callisthenes, ``He is eloquent indeed, but he wants \ncommon sense.''\n  So that is the way it is. We hear a great many eloquent speeches \nabout what a tremendous step we have taken in lifting the burden off \nthe backs of our children and grandchildren by passing this \nreconciliation bill. We will have balanced the budget in 7 years. But \nat the same time, out of the same mouths, we hear that we have also cut \nthe taxes, cut taxes for the American people to the tune of $245 \nbillion. How can you do both? How can we possibly balance the budget on \nthe one hand in 7 years, and on the other, hand out $245 billion in tax \ncuts? It does not make sense!\n  I sometimes hear the Senate referred to as the Cave of the Winds--\npretty aptly named. The world record for wind speed was 231 miles per \nhour, and it was recorded on April 12, 1934, the year in which I \ngraduated from high school, 1934. That is the world's record for wind \nspeed, 231 miles per hour. It was recorded on Mount Washington in the \nState of New Hampshire.\n  I know of no recording of the wind speed that we experience in this \nChamber, but I daresay that climbers, who are on their way to the \nHimalayas and the Antarctic, would do very well to get some training in \nthis Chamber because they would be acting under similar conditions as \nto wind speeds. To listen to these eloquent speeches about how much we \nhave done for the American people and for our children and \ngrandchildren in passing the monstrosity that no Senator--no Senator, \nnone, not one--knows the alpha and the omega of what he did or she did \nin passing that legislation--is a joke, but not a funny one.\n  The perpetrators of this fiscal irresponsibility tell us that they \ncan balance the budget and reduce taxes in 7 years. That is one of the \nmistakes that President Clinton also made in coming out for a tax cut. \nNo, he was not going to cut the taxes $245 billion, but he was still \nproposing to cut the taxes--$63 billion over 5 years. That is folly! \nFolly, to think of cutting the taxes under these conditions--by gutting \nMedicare, by raising our Nation's domestic discretionary investments, \nand by spending so-called fiscal dividends, dividends that do not even \nexist, dividends that do not yet exist and may never exist.\n  We have seen the CBO err many times in the past in its projections as \nto future deficits. And over a period of 15 years--over a period of 15 \nyears--it was in error on the average of $45 billion annually. It was \noff in its estimates of the deficits on the average of $45 billion a \nyear. So we cannot believe, on the basis of CBO's projections, that the \nbudget will be balanced in 7 years. And just one recession will knock \nthose projections into a cocked hat. There will not be any dividend. \nBut the tax cut will have been put in place.\n\n  Our Republican colleagues have found a way to claim that they have \nbalanced the budget in 7 years, and provided a $245 billion tax cut--at \nleast on paper. In reality, Mr. President, we do not know what the next \n7 years will bring. And we ought to admit that right up front to the \nAmerican people. We do not know. Nobody knows what the interest rates \nwill be, what the unemployment rate will be, what the rate of growth \nwill be, what the inflation rate will be. Nobody knows. Only God knows. \nAnd there is nobody around here who can claim to be God.\n  We ought to admit that right up front to the American people. We \ncertainly cannot know for sure--despite the imprimatur of the \nCongressional Budget Office--that a $170 billion fiscal dividend will \nrise from the dust like the phoenix from the ashes, from the dust of \nthis budgetary demolition. All we can be sure of is that, if this \nreconciliation bill ever becomes law, there will be a $245 billion tax \ncut--right up front. You can hang your hat on that. Not many people \nwear hats anymore. But if you have one, you can hang it on that. There \nwill be a $245 billion tax cut for the well-to-do. That is all we can \nsay for sure right now in October 1995.\n  Mr. President, I cannot claim to know for certain the intentions of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle who promulgated this \nimprudent tax cut. But I can intuit what appear to be the roots of this \nfiscal irresponsibility. These roots were planted in the so-called \n``Contract With America.'' I did not sign on to it. I have never read \nit.\n  This is my contract with America. I carry it in my shirt pocket. It \ncost 19 cents when I bought it at the Government Printing Office \nseveral years ago. It is the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica. I swore to abide by that Constitution. That is my contract \nwith America! And I have sworn to uphold that contract, to support and \ndefend that contract with America--13 times upon entering into office \nover the past 49 years. That is my contract with America. I did not \nswear on to the impostor, the so-called ``Contract With America.'' My \npeople did not ask me to support the ``Contract With America'' when \nthey elected me last year. I did not get any mandate to support the so-\ncalled ``Contract With America.''\n  The roots of the imprudent tax cut were planted in the so-called \n``Contract With America''--the legislative promissory note used by \nMembers of the other body to ride the tide of voter hostility to power. \nIn fact, many of the numerous tax breaks--such as the ever-popular $500 \nchild credit and the capital gains tax reduction--came directly from \nthat document, I am told, because I have not read it. I have read in \nthe newspapers that it was created by the political pollsters for \npoliticians running for office.\n  I was a politician running for office last year. I did not read it.\n  Now those same politicians are Members of Congress, with a \nresponsibility above and beyond political paybacks. Yet, they continue \nto adhere to the ill-conceived doctrine that tax cuts are more \nimportant than balancing the budget. You see, the so-called ``Contract \nWith America'' contained the promise of a balanced budget amendment. My \ncolleagues in the Senate had the courage to defeat that constitutional \nhoax. And I am proud of it.\n  I am not above amending the Constitution of the United States. \nArticle 5 tells us how this Constitution, this contract with America, \nmay be amended--in article V.\n  So my colleagues in the Senate had the courage to defeat that \nconstitutional hoax called a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, and I am proud of it. It is unfortunate that Senators did not \nfind that same backbone to prevent these reckless tax cuts at a time \nwhen we are running a substantial fiscal deficit with nearly $4.9 \ntrillion in public debt outstanding.\n  Let us all disabuse ourselves of the notion that tax cuts at this \ntime are in \n\n[[Page S 16694]]\nthe best interests of the people of the United States of America. They \nare not. They are not in the best interests of the United States of \nAmerica at this time.\n  It is easy to vote for tax cuts. In my 49 years in public office and \nin voting for tax cuts, I have found from time to time that it is an \neasy thing to do. It does not require any courage to vote to cut taxes. \nI do not believe that tax cuts at this time are in the best interests \nof the people of the United States.\n  They are fiscally irresponsible, akin to feeding chocolate to a \ndiabetic, or like giving an alcoholic a case of bourbon for Christmas. \nWe do the country no favor with this pandering. The voters will pay \nlater with the toothaches of poor social and medical health services, \ndeclining public infrastructure, and the hangover of continuing huge \nbudget deficits. And they are going to remember it.\n  The time will come when they will remember the advocates of this so-\ncalled ``Contract With America.'' They will remember those who \nadvocated the tax cuts. That worm is going to turn! The only question \nis when.\n  I am reminded of Croesus who was defeated by Cyrus the Great at the \nbattle of Thymbra in 546 B.C. Cyrus the Great did not execute Croesus \nbut, instead, he attached Croesus to his court as an adviser. Croesus \nwas one of the richest men in the world, King of Lydia. But he was \nconquered by Cyrus. Cyrus sought to extend his dominions and to enlarge \nthem. He had been very fortunate in numerous battles. And Cyrus sought \nto extend his dominions beyond the Caspian Sea.\n  According to Herodotus, Cyrus prepared to launch a war against the \nMassagetae, whose ruler was a queen, Queen Tomyris. Before Cyrus \ncrossed the river into the dominions of the Scythians, he called his \ngenerals about him, his wise men, and asked them for their advice.\n  He finally asked Croesus for his opinion. Croesus said, ``You have \nbeen very fortunate in adding land to land and dominion to dominion, \nand in winning many battles. There is a wheel on which the affairs of \nmen revolve, and its movement forbids the same man to be always \nfortunate.'' Cyrus invaded and lost the battle. He had been warned by \nthis queen not to invade. She had said, ``Oh, Cyrus, you have been \nfortunate. You have added land to land, province to province, dominion \nto dominion, but don't invade my country. You control a vast empire. \nYou don't need additional land. If you invade my country, I will give \nyou your fill of blood.''\n\n  There was a great battle and Cyrus was beaten. After the battle, she \nsent her men out on the field to look for Cyrus. He was dead. They \nbrought Cyrus to her. She cut off his head. She had a bag of skin \nfilled with human blood, and she thrust the head of Cyrus into that bag \nof blood, saying, ``You wanted your fill of blood. I promised you that \nI would give you your fill of human blood. I have kept my pledge!''\n  So the wheel turns, as Croesus said, and this wheel, too, is going to \nturn. And those who are crowing about this great Contract With America \nand how they have balanced the budget with this monstrosity and how \nthey are giving the American people their money back, a tax cut to the \ntune of $245 billion, how they are lifting the burden from the \nchildren's backs, they are going to eat those words. That is my guess. \nThat is my opinion. The worm will turn. The wheel will turn.\n  I have stated time and time again on this floor that I am opposed to \nany tax cuts at this time--I was led down that parlous path more than a \ndecade ago. But if we in this body are going to approve tax cuts, as we \nhave at this time, I wish all Members had looked a little closer at \nexactly what was imbedded in this mammoth legislation. Mr. President, a \nclose look at the individual components of the Republican-proposed tax \ncuts brings to light some striking revelations. We must pay careful \nattention to a Joint Committee on Taxation estimate that predicts that \nthe tax ``cut'' provisions approved by the Senate Finance Committee \nwill actually raise taxes for all taxpayers earning under $30,000 in \nthe year 2000, and that this tax ``cut'' will result in a tax increase \nfor nearly half of all American taxpayers in that same year. We must \ncomprehend that, according to the same estimate by the Joint Committee \non Taxation, those taxpayers earning over $200,000 in the year 2000 \nwill receive an average tax break of $1,500 that year. It is \ninteresting, even that a large part of these so-called tax cuts would \nnot help our most needy citizens at all, while those same Americans--\nseniors and low- and middle-income working families--will bear the \nbrunt of this reconciliation bill's spending restraints--the classic \ndouble whammy.\n  Mr. President, this reconciliation bill is an abomination. It is a \ntravesty. It is a bad joke.\n  We just rubber stamped what was sent to the Senate by the Budget \nCommittee. It was forced under the law to send to the Senate what was \ngiven to it by other committees in carrying out their instructions from \nthe Senate. We voted for it. I did not, but the Senate adopted it--just \nblindfolded itself. Put the blindfold on. Rubber stamped it.\n  It represents a serious breach of faith. We have played fast and \nloose with the livelihoods and the health care of the very people who \nsent us here. And I doubt, I just have to doubt that any Senator fully \ncomprehends what was in this behemoth package.\n  Some may claim that they knew full well what was in this package when \nthey voted for it, but they did not really know. They did not know. \nYet, whole sections of the House bill that came over here, the first \nHouse bill that came over here had whole sections of it missing on the \nday that we began the debate. We began the vote on this bill with no \ncommittee report, no explanatory statement to guide us and with only 20 \nhours to consider this mountain of paper--this bill and the House bill, \none with 1,949 pages and the other with 1,839 pages. That weighs more \nthan my little dog Billy.\n  The American people are angry, but as Mr. Reagan used to say, ``You \nain't seen nothing yet.'' Wait until they find out, wait until they \nunderstand the hoax that has been played on them by the passage of that \nmonstrosity.\n  I know they are angry. Reportedly, they have had enough of ethics \nproblems, enough of false promises, enough of Government meddling, and \nso on. They have every right to be mad, to use a colloquial expression, \nbut I submit that they are mad about the wrong issues. They ought to be \nmad about what just happened on this floor last Friday, last Friday \nnight past midnight when we passed that bill. They ought to be furious \nabout the fast shuffle we just gave them on this Senate floor that \nnight.\n  If the people fully understood the blatant disregard for any \nsemblance of responsible legislating--that is not responsible \nlegislating--the callous dismissal of any attempt to actually represent \ntheir views or to act in their best interests, they would be out in the \nstreets looking for us! They would be ready to vote an amendment to the \nConstitution saying that Members of the House and Senate could be sent \nto death by a bill of attainder. A bill of attainder sends one to death \nwithout a trial. If the people really understood just what went on \nhere, they would storm this city and dismantle this Chamber brick by \nbrick by brick!\n  Yet, the supporters of this bill will gloriously claim that the \nrevolution has come--long live the revolution! But, make no mistake \nabout it, this is no grassroots revolution. It is, rather a revolution \nrun by the elite. It has been accomplished by the politicians, behind \nclosed doors, for the wealthy and the big contributors, and the \nimportant lobbyists. It is a revolution of the powerful by the powerful \nfor the powerful. Tax breaks for football coaches--can you imagine \nthat, tax breaks for football coaches--tax breaks for motorboat \nenthusiasts, special benefits for a Delaware Power and Light Company, \nspecial exemptions for newspaper companies, so that they won't have to \npay unemployment or payroll taxes for certain employees, tax free \nconversion from trust funds to mutual funds, mineral rights give aways, \nlarge corporate farm loopholes which allow them to receive below-cost \nwater, land sales for nuclear waste dumping, these were in the bill \nthat came to the Senate floor. I do not know how many of them will \nremain in the bill--or remain in it now, as a matter of fact. I did not \nknow what was in the bill when it passed. I voted against it. That was \nthe best thing to do. If one does not know what is in a bill, he ought \nto vote against it. \n\n[[Page S 16695]]\n Do no harm. These are hardly provisions which benefit the beans and \nbacon crowd.\n\n  No, no, this is strictly a caviar and champagne revolution! No \nordinary commoners need apply.\n  And it gets worse when one focuses on the fact that what I have just \nlisted represents only the tip of the iceberg. It is only the small \namount of information on special tax breaks which I so far have been \nable to glean regarding the blue-ribbon character of this very select \nrevolution.\n  So, the rich and the powerful and the oh so very comfortable will \ncontinue to sip their white wine and murmur ever so joyously about \ntheir exclusive little ``gimme gravy'' revolution. But, while this \nprivate tea party is going on in some circles, health care for the \nelderly has been slashed in order to foot the catering bill.\n  So, mark this down as a time when the so-called ``world's greatest \ndeliberative body,'' deliberated very little and produced nothing even \nclose to ``great.'' We tinkered around the edges with amendments, when \nall the while most of us had no real idea of what was buried in the \nunderlying bill and were provided with little time or opportunity to \ninform ourselves or to inform the American people about these far-\nreaching changes.\n  This reconciliation process has been twisted out of all recognizable \nshape. It has become the antithesis of solid thorough legislating, and \nit makes a mockery of minority rights and the tradition of extended \ndebate here in the Senate.\n  This Senator is fond of saying, ``Est deo gratia pro Senatus!'' \n``Thank God for the U.S. Senate.'' But, with regard to this sorry \nspectacle, I will have to alter my usual exclamation and say, ``Thank \nGod for the Presidential veto,'' not the line-item veto, but the veto \nwhich the President is given in the Constitution of the United States--\nthe real contract with America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, was leaders' time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Leaders' time has been reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16691-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16695-S16696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAST-TRACK AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, Congress is now trying to put in place a \nplan that will reduce the tax burden on the American people, produce \ngrowth, create jobs, and put us on a responsible path to a balanced \nbudget.\n  In the midst of this monumental undertaking, President Clinton would \nlike to get Congress to give him new fast-track trade negotiating \nauthority. He wants to negotiate more trade agreements with more \ncountries. In fact, he has already started negotiations for new trade \nagreements even without fast-track authority.\n  Mr. President, I believe it would be a mistake to extend new fast-\ntrack authority at this time.\n  There are a number of good reasons, but in my view first and most \nimportant is President Clinton's complete failure to explain to the \nAmerican people why we need yet another trade agreement at this time. I \nbelieve the President's effort to get new fast-track authority has most \nAmericans shaking their heads, wondering ``Why does the President seem \nto want to rush into more free-trade agreements with as many countries, \nregions, or trading blocks as he can?''\n  Mr. President, the fact is we recently concluded two major trade \nagreements, GATT and NAFTA. I believe it only makes good common sense \nto step back a little and assess the results.\n  The ink is hardly dry on the largest trade agreement in history, the \nUruguay round of the GATT, which came into force on January 1 of this \nyear.\n  We do not really know what the impact of that agreement will be. We \nhad many predictions last year, favorable and unfavorable, about the \npotential impact. But the agreement is unprecedented in its coverage, \ncreating new rules for textiles, agriculture, services. It makes \nmassive tariff cuts and lowers barriers worldwide. It establishes an \nentirely new and untested dispute settlement regime.\n  We need time to assess the impact of what amounts to the largest \nrestructuring of our trading relationships ever.\n  No private entity, no corporation, no small business going through a \nfundamental restructuring would consider a new merger or acquisition in \nthe middle of that process. Indeed it would be irresponsible. It could \nendanger the enterprise. So too for the United States as we implement \nthe recent major restructuring of our trade relationships.\n  Instead of new trade agreements, let us proceed with a proposal I \nmade last year to ensure that our sovereignty is not compromised by the \nnew world trade organization. Although I believe the United States \nstands to gain overall from the GATT Agreement, many Americans remain \nunconvinced that the WTO will benefit them in the long run. Indeed, \nthere is one important way the WTO could be harmful, and that is if the \nnew dispute settlement system runs out of control. We must never submit \nto decisions by an unelected WTO bureaucracy if it oversteps its \nmandate and pursues its own agenda. My legislation, which I had hoped \nto have passed by now, and I hope we can pass in the near future, would \nset up a Dispute Settlement Review Commission that would allow us to \nwithdraw from the WTO if our rights are being trampled by bureaucrats \nin Geneva.\n  This is the kind of legislation we need right now. We need this \nlegislation because it will help to protect American workers and \nAmerican jobs. We need to have this protection in place as soon as \npossible before the first WTO decisions start to come. In fact the \nadministration supports my legislation. And yet the administration has \nbeen silent on this issue. We have had no cooperation in trying to pass \nand enact into law a bill that everyone agrees is good for America, \ngood for working Americans, and good for the multilateral trading \nsystem. It provides insurance against harm, it is an insurance policy \nfor our sovereignty. What could be more important? Certainly not more \ntrade agreements, because we are choking on new agreements right now.\n\n  It was just 21 months ago that we entered into another major trade \nagreement, the North American Free-Trade Agreement. The record for \nNAFTA is a work in progress. The verdict is not yet in. This is so for \na number of reasons. The peso crisis is the most significant, but there \nhas also been significant disappointment with the operation of that \nagreement, and with the level of cooperation we have experienced since \nit went into effect. The operation of the NAFTA dispute settlement \nmechanism for unfair trade cases has also raised serious concerns in \nCongress and in the private sector.\n  So we need time to assess the real results of NAFTA as well. I do not \nknow how President Clinton explains to the American people that the \nprovisions of NAFTA, good and bad, should be extended to other \ncountries when we do not yet have a clear picture of how NAFTA has \nbenefited working Americans. We need to know how this agreement has \nhelped the American family.\n  Mr. President, I believe we need to step back from this unprecedented \nwhirlwind of new trade agreements. We need a cooling-off period, a time \nto digest the results. We need to focus on our domestic house, on the \nactions we can take here at home that will improve our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  But for some reason, the administration seems to be in a great hurry \nto pile on not just one, but many more trade agreements as soon as \npossible from Latin America to Asia to Europe. President Clinton seems \nto be saying ``Don't worry about it--I'll cut a new trade deal now and \nwe'll figure out later if it was good for the American people.''\n  I have no quarrel with any country that, as part of a program of \noverall economic reform, pursues a trade agreement with the United \nStates. I admire and applaud countries that eliminate barriers to \ntrade, that reform their economies, that improve the standard of living \nfor their people, that attempt to open up to world trade, to reverse \nyears and decades of ill-conceived, statist policies. Getting the \n\n[[Page S 16696]]\ndead hand of government off the backs of the private sector results in \nexplosive economic growth. The evidence of this is irrefutable as \ncountries around the world throw off the shackles of protectionism, \nhigh tariffs, and trade barriers, to the great benefit and enrichment \nof their people.\n  The United States is the most desirable market in the world. I \nunderstand why countries seek to gain ever better access to our market \nthrough trade agreements.\n  And no one has been a bigger supporter over the years of breaking \ndown trade barriers worldwide than I have.\n  But Mr. President, a responsible, sober trade policy for America is \nnot measured by the number of trade agreements we conclude with the \nrest of the world.\n  A responsible, sober trade policy for America is measured by the \nbenefit to the American people, to the American worker, and the \nAmerican family.\n  Mr. President, another concern that I have, and that Republicans \ngenerally have, with fast-track relates to our experience during \napproval of the two previous trade agreements.\n  This administration has promised that it will add extraneous issues, \nsuch as labor and environment and maybe other issues, to any trade \nagreement it negotiates. I believe that linking trade to the agendas of \nworker rights and environmentalist activists would be a serious mistake \nand in the end would harm working Americans.\n  Mr. President, I supported the NAFTA and GATT agreements because I \nsupport increased trade and opening foreign markets to U.S. goods and \nservices.\n  However, I did not support the way in which this administration used, \nand some would say abused, the fast-track procedures for those trade \nbills.\n  The fast-track rules were the result of an agreement between the \nCongress and the President. The President agreed to consult with the \nCongress regularly and indepth on the details of trade agreements under \nnegotiation. In return, Congress agreed to give up the right to amend \nlegislation implementing a trade agreement after its submission to the \nCongress, and further agreed to consider the implementing legislation \nin a limited time concluding with an up-or-down vote, without \namendment.\n  The fast-track rules were crafted to provide a sensible way for \nnegotiating the elimination of trade barriers with other countries. The \npurpose of requiring considerable consultation between the President \nand the Congress was to arrive at a consensus on the content of an \nacceptable agreement. If you did that, you did not need a lot of \namendments. That was the original intent.\n  The fast-track rules were never meant to operate as a vehicle for \nmatters that lay well outside any consensus.\n  Fast-track was never meant to be a vehicle for matters on which there \nwas fundamental disagreement.\n  The fast-track procedures were used effectively for a long time. \nThrough four administrations trade agreements were negotiated and \nsubmitted to Congress under fast-track rules, and the process worked \npretty well.\n  But when the Clinton administration arrived, this changed.\n  Despite warnings from Republicans, then in the minority, the \nadministration insisted on labor and environment side agreements \naccompanying the NAFTA. We opposed these side deals for a simple \nreason: linking trade to other issues like these winds up hurting us \nmore than others.\n  Now the President has stated that if Congress gives him fast-track \nauthority, he is committed to extending these labor and environment \nprovisions to other countries in any trade agreement he concludes with \nthem.\n  Mr. President, this is unacceptable. We cannot and must not burden \nour trade relationships with the agendas of any number of special-\ninterest groups. The President seems to want to use fast-track once \nagain to advance interests other than trade. We must not permit that to \nhappen.\n  During the GATT debate, we had a similar experience. Despite numerous \nwarnings from Republicans, the President submitted an implementing bill \nthat was full of provisions that had nothing to do with trade. One in \nparticular was an incredible multimillion-dollar handout for a few \ntelecommunications companies. It had no reason to be in that bill. It \nwas strictly special interests, and some would say really special \ninterests because of their links to certain people in the \nadministration.\n\n  These additional provisions could not be removed, because of the \nfast-track rules. Members of Congress in both Houses were powerless to \nact against this abuse of the fast-track procedures.\n  Mr. President, most of us remember these events very clearly. We \nexplicitly warned the administration at the time that stretching the \nfast-track rules to the breaking point would jeopardize reauthorizing \nfast-track in the future.\n  Well, Mr. President, as they say, the future is now. I do not believe \nCongress should extend new fast-track authority until we have had an \nadequate cooling-off period following the 2 recent major trade \nagreements and until there is no possibility that the fast-track \nprocedures can be abused. I also believe this is the view of the \nmajority of the American people, and I happen to believe it is the \nmajority of those of us in the Senate on each side of the aisle.\n\n  The American economy is the most innovative, most technologically \nadvanced and most productive economy in the world. I want to keep it \nthat way. I want to make sure American goods, commodities, and services \nget a fair opportunity in the world marketplace. I want to tear down \nunfair trade barriers and make it clear to our trading partners that \nunfair trade practices that harm American companies and jeopardize \nAmerican jobs will not be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, we do have an obligation to set a higher standard for \nthe world in the matter of trade relations and economic policy. And in \ndischarging that obligation, we must never give in to the temptation to \nsacrifice real gains for mere appearances.\n  We do have an obligation to demonstrate to our trading partners our \nseriousness of purpose in bringing about a more open world trading \nsystem.\n  But this is not achieved through a haphazard rush to sign more trade \ndeals with more countries as quickly as possible. Trade agreements are \nnot trophies. A policy that treats them as trophies is wrong and is not \nin the best interests of America or of working Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/03/senate-section/article/S16695-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL 5 P.M.
