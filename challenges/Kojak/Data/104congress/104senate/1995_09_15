Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodification of the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object, we are still in the \nprocess of reviewing the modification. If the Senator can start the \ndebate on the amendment, after we review the modification, we hope we \nwill have no objection to it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to do that, Mr. President.\n  This amendment is a very simple, straightforward amendment. I really \ndo not understand how anyone can object to it. It simply puts in law a \nrequirement that the States receiving these block grants under the \nfamily assistance block grant program that is being established in this \nlegislation--that they develop a plan, a plan for how they are to spend \nthat money. The plan is very general in the requirements for what would \nbe in the plan, but we basically say the same planning requirement that \nSenator Dole had proposed for the work force training block grants, \nthat same kind of planning should occur in the case of the family \nassistance programs. Once a State has its program in place, this \namendment, in my view, would help both Federal and State taxpayers and \nofficials evaluate the success of the State programs through State-\nestablished goals and benchmarks.\n  I do not really understand any credible argument against it. The \nproposal here is very consistent with the provisions specified in the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act of 1993, which I know Senator \nRoth had a great involvement in, to establish performance-based program \nmanagement in the Federal Government. This continues to leave the \ndecisionmaking, the substantive decisionmaking, to the States. But \nunder the bill as it presently sits before us, there is virtually no \nplanning required or encouraged or ensured. States need not do any \nlong-range or strategic planning, nor do they need to establish any \ngoals or benchmarks. There is no accountability to State or Federal \ntaxpayers as to those goals actually being achieved.\n  We are talking, in this legislation, about block grants that add up \nto something over $16.8 billion in Federal money each year. In my view, \nit is not unreasonable for us, as stewards of that Federal money, to at \nleast ask for a written document that explains how it is to be spent.\n  So that is the essence of the amendment. I ask the manager of the \nbill if he has had a chance to review the modification and if he sees a \nproblem with it? If not, I ask unanimous consent, again, I be allowed \nto modify the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. We have no objection to the request. In fact, as the \nSenator has modified his amendment, we would be willing to accept the \namendment without a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 2483), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 12, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n       ``(2) Family assistance program strategic plan.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A single comprehensive State Family \n     Assistance Program Strategic Plan (hereafter referred to in \n     this section as the `State Plan') describing a 3-year \n     strategic plan for the statewide program designed to meet the \n     State goals and reach the State benchmarks for program \n     activities of the family assistance program.\n       ``(B) Contents of the state plan.--The State plan shall \n     include:\n       ``(i) State goals.--A description of the goals of the 3-\n     year plan, including outcome related goals of and benchmarks \n     for program activities of the family assistance program.\n       ``(ii) Current year plan.--A description of how the goals \n     and benchmarks described in clause (i) will be achieved, or \n     how progress toward the goals and benchmarks will be \n     achieved, during the fiscal year in which the plan has been \n     submitted.\n       (iii) Performance indicators.--A description of performance \n     indicators to be used in measuring or assessing the relevant \n     output service levels and outcomes of relevant program \n     activities.\n       ``(iv) External factors.--Information on those key factors \n     external to the program and beyond the control of the State \n     that could significantly affect the attainment of the goals \n     and benchmarks.\n       ``(v) Evaluation mechanisms.--Information on a mechanism \n     for conducting program evaluation, to be used to compare \n     actual results with the goals and benchmarks and designate \n     the results on a scale ranging from highly successful to \n     failing to reach the goals and benchmarks of the program.\n       ``(vi) Minimum participation rates.--Information on how the \n     minimum participation rates specified in section 404 will be \n     satisfied.\n       ``(vii) Estimate of expenditures.--An estimate of the total \n     amount of State or local expenditures under the program for \n     the fiscal year in which the plan is submitted.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that willingness to accept \nthe modified amendment. If that concludes debate on this issue, I \nsuggest we go to a vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the remainder of my time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. If there be no \nfurther debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2483), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2484\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on Bingaman amendment No. 2484, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment, amendment No. 2484, I \ngather, is at the desk. I will not ask it be read. Let me explain \nbriefly what the amendment does.\n  The amendment simply provides that we will make our bill, this bill \nthat Senator Dole has proposed here, consistent with the House \nlegislation on welfare reform in that we would provide $100 million for \neach of fiscal years 1997 through the year 2000 to States to help them \nprovide treatment for drug addiction and alcoholism.\n  Let me review the situation we have as I understand it and then \ninvite any correction if the manager of the bill or anybody else would \nlike to correct my impression.\n  This morning I put together a very simple chart which demonstrates my \nskill at calligraphy, but also, I think, makes the point I am trying to \nget at here. These, as I understand it, are proposed losses in Federal \nfunds for drug and alcohol treatment, prevention and education, \nassuming this legislation is passed and assuming we go forward with \nother budget cuts that are contemplated.\n  Let me specify how I get the figures. As I understand it, the \nlegislation we have here proposes to eliminate any funds for \nbeneficiaries under SSI who are there by virtue of having a drug or \nalcohol abuse problem. So they are no longer eligible to receive SSI \nbenefits. That is estimated to save the taxpayers $300 million.\n  Payments to RMA's are also eliminated. These are the organizations, \nas I understand it, that provide services and do monitoring of the \nproblems that alcoholics and drug abusers have throughout the country. \nThat is $100 million.\n  We are eliminating Medicaid eligibility for alcoholics and drug \nabusers. That is another $100 million.\n  Then there are a series of cuts which I am informed have been voted \nby the Appropriations Committee, the Labor, HHS, Education \nAppropriations Committee, on Wednesday. I assume those will be agreed \nto here when they come to the full Senate. Those amount to $108 million \ncut in substance abuse block grant funding, $100 million in drug \ntreatment demonstration programs, $29 million in drug abuse prevention \ndemonstrations, and $166 million in drug-free school money which will \nbe eliminated. The alcohol and other health programs that Health and \nHuman Services runs we are cutting by $242 million.\n  So the total reduction in Federal support to States and to \nbeneficiaries in this area of drug and alcohol treatment prevention and \neducation is $1.345 billion this next year. \n\n[[Page S 13629]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have concerns about that kind of drastic cut. The \namendment I have offered will try to help resolve some of that by at \nleast adding in $100 million. The $100 million is a very, very small \npart of what is being lost. I think that is obvious to everybody. At \nleast it is a good-faith effort. As I understand the agreement that has \nbeen worked out between the leadership on the Republican side and the \nleadership on the Democratic side, the intent is to add in $25 million \na year to offset the $1.345 billion which is being lost. To my mind, \nthat is not a credible effort by the Senate and it is not adequate to \nwhat we are doing. So all I am saying is, let us at least do what the \nHouse of Representatives did, let us at least provide $100 million \nadditional funds for substance abuse block grants in this next fiscal \nyear and each year during the time this legislation is in law.\n  The issue here is not just whether you like people who are \nbeneficiaries of this. The issue is how this impacts on the criminal \nproblems we face in the country. I have a press release here from the \nDepartment of Justice. This is August 9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this press release from the Department \nof Justice, dated August 9, is entitled, ``The Nation's Prison \nPopulation Grew Almost 9 Percent Last Year.'' When you read over on \npage 3 of this it says: More than a quarter of State and Federal \ninmates were imprisoned for drug offenses, that is 234,600 prisoners in \n1993. Prisoners serving a drug sentence increased from 8 percent of the \nState and Federal prison population in 1980 to 26 percent in 1993.\n In Federal prisons--this is a startling statistic; people really \nshould focus on this--inmates sentenced for drug law violations were \nthe single largest group. Sixty percent in 1993 of the prisoners in our \nFederal prisons were there for drug law violations. That was up from 25 \npercent in 1980.\n\n  When you look into how we deal with the problem of more and more \npeople going into prisons for drug offenses, the solution is in this \narea. The solution is in treatment, prevention, and education.\n  There is a publication which recently came out by the National \nAssociation of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors which makes a \nvery compelling case, that where we put these people in treatment, the \nincidence of criminal activity reduces very substantially. In my home \nState of New Mexico, they have estimated that the rate of DWI arrests \nin the year before treatment was 27.8 percent in the group that \nreceived treatment, while in the 1-year post-treatment period, the rate \nwas 9.8 percent. That is an enormous reduction.\n  I know that the majority leader is concerned about how it impacts on \nhis State. The report I am referring to says that Kansas has reported a \nreduction in legal problems on the addiction severity index comparison \ndata between admission and discharge for 2,700 of its clients who \nreceived treatment services in fiscal year 1993. Between admission and \ndischarge, there was a 35 percent decrease in the severity of legal \nproblems for clients in treatment.\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about dealing with the crime \nproblem, we need to maintain some level of funding here. My amendment \nsimply provides $100 million in funding to offset the $1.3 billion \nwhich is contemplated in this legislation and in the appropriations \nbill that I referred to.\n  I know that people are concerned about not spending too much money. \nMr. President, this is a good investment. If we do not spend the money \nhere, we will be spending it down the road in building more prison \ncells. That is the tradeoff, and I believe very strongly that we ought \nto at least support the House level of expenditure for this drug and \nalcohol treatment prevention and education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we are still working on this amendment, \nI think, between the two leaders. And if we could set this amendment \naside temporarily and allow--I believe the Senator from Illinois is \nsomewhere on the floor and may be willing to bring up his amendment at \nthis point, and we will see if we can work this out.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection. I believe the \nSenator from Maine, Senator Cohen, wanted to speak for a few moments.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is time remaining on our side. We could allocate \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I have no objection to putting the amendment aside \nunder those circumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 10 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the Simon amendment No. 2468, to be followed by a \nvote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Illinois is here. \nI would allow him to proceed with his amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2468, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment 2468.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n                 TITLE  --COMMUNITY WORKS PROGRESS ACT\n\n     SEC.   00.

The report \n     shall incorporate information from annual reports submitted \n     to the State by governmental and nonprofit entities \n     conducting projects under the program. The report shall \n     include an analysis of the effect of such projects on the \n     economic condition of the area, including their effect on \n     welfare dependency, the local crime rate, general business \n     activity (including business revenues and tax receipts), and \n     business and community leaders' evaluation of the projects' \n     success.

EVALUATION.\n\n       Not later than October 1, 2000, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Congress a comprehensive evaluation of the \n     effectiveness of community works progress programs in \n     reducing welfare dependency, crime, and teenage pregnancy in \n     the geographic areas in which such programs are conducted.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by Senator \nBrown, Senator Reid, and myself. This is an amendment which would \nauthorize, but not have a set-aside, four demonstration WPA-type \nprojects where people would be on welfare only 5 weeks. After 5 weeks, \nlike the WPA, the local people would pick the projects. They would have \nto work 4 days a week at the minimum wage. The fifth day they would \nhave to be out trying to find a job in the private sector.\n  Why this is important is there is a tendency that is not going to \nchange for the demand for unskilled labor to go down, and an awful lot \nof people on welfare are these people who are unskilled. We are going \nto pay people ultimately either for being productive or nonproductive. \nI think it makes much more sense to pay them for being productive.\n  And this is an amendment, I might add, that was passed last year. And \nI say to the Presiding Officer that the chief sponsor was Senator \nBoren. I was a cosponsor, as was Senator Reid, and I think a few others \non the other side also.\n  The idea is, let us have a demonstration. Let us see what we can do \nif we try this. What is going to happen--and this would be a voluntary \nthing--to the numbers if everyone after 5 weeks is required to work but \nis paid at minimum wage.\n  I would hope this would be accepted. It was accepted by voice vote a \nyear ago. But if it is not accepted, I would require a vote on it.\n  Let me just add one other point while we are talking, Mr. President. \nWe have heard a lot about teenage pregnancy. I took some counties in \nIllinois, and you see a direct correlation between teenage pregnancy \nand the number of people working.\n  The counties in California with a population over 250,000 get the \nsame statistics. The same pattern is here.\n  If we really want to do something about teenage pregnancy, if we can \nput people to work--and I think it is not simply that they are \noccupied; I think it is that they have the spark of hope. Teenage \npregnancy frequently comes with hopelessness. Anyway, I think it is a \nworthwhile experiment. I would hope we could move in this direction, \nand I am pleased to have some supporters on that side of the aisle as \nwell as this side of the aisle.\n  I hope that we can accept this. I would be happy to answer any \nquestions. Otherwise, I would yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, my understanding is the chairman of the \nLabor Committee, Senator Kassebaum, is still opposed to this amendment \neven in the modified form. It sets up a demonstration project with $240 \nmillion in four States. I know the Senator from Kansas believes that \nthere is adequate money under AmeriCorps and other programs existing \nfor these kinds of projects to occur.\n  I do not believe the Senator will be able to make it here to debate \nthat. But my understanding is that we object to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S 13632]]\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, again, I would hope that this would be \nacceptable. I understand that it will require a vote now.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 53 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me just add one other point. We talked \na lot on the floor in the Senate about the crime problem. My instinct \nis, if we guarantee jobs to people and require work--not just guarantee \nbut require work--we will see a change in the crime rate.\n  You show me an area of high unemployment--black, Hispanic, white, \nwhatever the area--and I will show you an area of high crime. I think \nthis makes sense. I hope it could be accepted by the body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we would like to stack a couple of \nvotes, and I see the Senator from Minnesota is here to debate his two \namendments. We have one amendment I believe of the Senator from \nMinnesota we can agree to related to agriculture. The second one will \nrequire a vote. And then we still have outstanding the Bingaman \namendment which may require a vote.\n  How long will the Senator from Minnesota need on his first amendment \non agriculture?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania that I can do this in less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. And on the second amendment there will be 10 minutes \nequally divided? Ten minutes equally divided on the second amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is fine.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Why not have the first vote at around 10 o'clock.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the Simon amendment vote be \npostponed until 10 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could just--I am \nready to go--suggest the absence of a quorum for 30 seconds.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment 2503, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment as modified to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2503), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 229, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following;\n       ``(4) Sunset of election upon increase in number of hungry \n     children.--\n       ``(A) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       ``(i) on March 29, 1995 the Senate adopted a resolution \n     stating that Congress should not enact or adopt any \n     legislation that will increase the number of children who are \n     hungry;\n       ``(ii) it is not the intent of this bill to cause more \n     children to be hungry;\n       ``(iii) the Food Stamp Program serves to prevent child \n     hunger; and\n       ``(iv) a State's election to participate in the optional \n     state food assistance block grant program should not serve to \n     increase the number of hungry children in that State.\n       ``(B) Sunset.--If the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services makes two successive findings that the hunger rate \n     among children in a State is significantly higher in a State \n     that has elected to participate in a program established \n     under subsection (a) than it would have been had there been \n     no such election, 180 days after the second such finding such \n     election shall be permanently and irreversibly revoked and \n     the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be \n     applicable to that State.\n       ``(C) Procedure for finding by Secretary.--In making the \n     finding described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall \n     adhere to the following procedure:\n       ``(i) Every three years, the Secretary shall develop data \n     and report to Congress with respect to each State that has \n     elected to participate in a program established under \n     subsection (a) whether the child hunger rate in such State is \n     significantly higher than it would have been had the State \n     not made such election.\n       ``(ii) The Secretary shall provide the report required \n     under clause (i) to all States that have elected to \n     participate in a program established under subsection (a), \n     and the Secretary shall provide each State for which the \n     Secretary determined that the child hunger rate is \n     significantly higher than it would have been had the State \n     not made such election with an opportunity to respond to such \n     determination.\n       ``(iii) If the response by a State under clause (ii) does \n     not result in the Secretary reversing the determination that \n     the child hunger rate in that State is significantly higher \n     than it would have been had the State not made such election, \n     then the Secretary shall publish a finding as described in \n     subparagraph (B).''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is some history to this \namendment, and I am very pleased it has been accepted.\n  The history is this. Early on in this session, I came to the floor \nwith a sense of the Senate that we would go on record saying we would \ntake no action which could increase hunger or malnutrition among \nchildren in America. That amendment was defeated several times but then \nfinally passed.\n  I believe the Senate is now on record on that question.\n  What this amendment says is that every 3 years, if we are going to \nblock grant food stamps, Health and Human Services develops data on \nchild hunger for each State that gets food stamps as a block grant.\n  What we want to look at is whether or not, after moving to block \ngrants, the malnutrition and hunger among children goes up. HHS reports \nback the data to Congress and also sends a report out to the States and \ngives States a chance to respond. But if Health and Human Services \nfinds out, based upon this survey--and it is two 3-year increments, as \na matter of fact--States have gone to block granting and what has \nhappened is you have seen an increase in hunger among children, then in \nfact it is no longer a block grant and it goes back to the Federal Food \nStamp Program with the national standards.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a kind of proof-in-the pudding \namendment. If in fact there are no problems, then there are no \nproblems, and I certainly would assume that is exactly what Senators \nhope for.\n  My view is that we could very well be making a terrible mistake. My \nview is that we are coming very close, or we have I think moved away \nfrom a fundamental idea that there is a minimal role for the Federal \nGovernment in making sure that every child in America, no matter how \npoor, no matter from what family, no matter in what region of the \nUnited States of America, has some minimal level of assistance. This is \nan amendment that I think provides some check on that.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side for accepting this amendment, \nand I urge its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment 2503, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2503), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2505\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think we now move to the next \nWellstone amendment and the Senator should proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Wellstone amendment No. 2505 \nto be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2505.\n  Mr. President, I think the best way for me to proceed on this--and I \nmust say to my colleagues, I am actually puzzled; this is the amendment \nthat I thought would be accepted without any \n\n[[Page S 13633]]\nquestion--is to let me go through the findings.\n\n       Findings. The potential loss of Medicaid coverage \n     represents a large disincentive for welfare recipients to \n     accept jobs that offer no health insurance.\n\n  Mr. President, we all know that one of the problems when a mother \nwants to move from welfare to workfare is that quite often without any \nkind of transitional support from Medicaid she is worse off than she \nwas before and just as importantly her children are worse off. Please \nremember, of the 15 million AFDC population, 9 million are children.\n\n       Whereas thousands of the Nation's employers continue to \n     find the cost of health care out of reach; whereas the \n     percentage of working people who receive health insurance \n     from their employer has dipped to its lowest point since the \n     1980's; and whereas children are the largest proportion of \n     the increase in the number of uninsured in recent years, it \n     is the sense of the Senate . . .\n\n  I am really puzzled by the opposition. I would say this to Senators, \nthat any Medicaid reform enacted by the Senate this year should require \nthat States continue to provide Medicaid for 12 months to families that \nlose eligibility for welfare benefits because of more earnings or hours \nof employment.\n  Mr. President, we have said in this health care reform bill that we \nwill have an extension of Medicaid for a year. This sense-of-the-Senate \namendment just says the Senate will do what it says it is going to do.\n  I do not understand how there could be any opposition to this \namendment. We have said that real welfare reform means there has to be \nthis transition and there are all these proposed cuts in Medicaid. And \nso what this amendment just says is look, when we take up Medicaid \nseparately, we go on record that the Senate will make sure that with \nthat Medicaid funding there will be 1 year of transitional support.\n  I say to all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, we \ncannot have it both ways. We cannot say that we are in favor of and we \nknow we must provide some transitional coverage so that women and \nchildren are not in worse shape because of reform, and make a \ncommitment to do that and now vote against the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that says we will do what we said we were going to do.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will reserve the remainder of my time to maybe get a \nsense--I am puzzled why this amendment has not been accepted.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the opposition on this side lies in the \nfact that right now we are in negotiations trying to deal with the \nproblem of Medicaid and trying to come up with solutions that will \nprovide services, health care services to the poor in our country and \nat the same time come within the reconciliation targets that are set. \nAnd we believe that if one of the options that is available to us, as \nhas been discussed openly, is the idea of a block grant. A block grant \nwould in fact give flexibility to the States to design their own \nprogram. And we would not be able in that situation to guarantee a \ntransitional benefit.\n  So, what we want to do is maintain the flexibility for us to deal \nwith this issue in a way that the Senate can come together to try to \nprovide these services, health care services for the poor in our \nsociety. And one of the options on the table that we do not obviously \nwant to foreclose is the option of doing a block grant to States to \nhave them provide services. In fact, what we have seen in States that \nhave gotten waivers, which would, in a sense, be similar to a block \ngrant, States like Tennessee where we have seen a dramatic increase in \nthe number of people covered--the Senator from Tennessee, who I do not \nknow if he is around or on the floor, but Senator Frist was one of the \nprincipal architects of the Tenn care plan that provided this \nflexibility, this flexibility from the Federal level, but allowed \nTennessee to redesign their Medicaid Program to cover more people. In \nfact, more people are covered under Medicaid now in Tennessee and at \nless cost.\n  So we have seen State experiments that have worked in reducing health \ncare costs and covering more people on Medicaid. And we do not want to \nforeclose that option for States to be able to do that in the future. \nAnd that is the reason we oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is the Senator saying there is a possibility that we \nwould rescind what we have stated is a major provision of this welfare \nreform bill, namely, the requirement that States extend the Medicaid \ncoverage for a year? Is that what the Senator is saying, that we may \nvery well rescind what we have now passed?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think the Senator from Minnesota knows very well \nthere are discussions with respect to Medicaid and those discussions \nshould not be foreclosed by action taken by the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, then what my colleague from \nPennsylvania has said is that this amendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I do not yield further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator reserve the remainder of his \ntime?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is amazing. I want people in the \ncountry to understand this. We have said we are going to have this \nwelfare reform, it is not going to be punitive. We changed this for the \nbetter. States will be required to carry Medicaid for 1 year. I have a \nsense of the Senate that makes it clear that in the Medicaid debate \nthat comes up we make a commitment that we will do what we said we \nwould do.\n  And now I hear my colleague from Pennsylvania say, we may very well \nturn around and not do that. My amendment asks the Senate to go on \nrecord that we will do what we have said we are going to do in this \npiece of legislation. And now I have colleagues that equivocate on this \nquestion and say, you know what? This might be a sham. We say we are \ngoing to have transitional coverage to make sure that women and \nchildren are not hurt, but that is just for now. When it comes to the \nMedicaid debate, we may very well take away that funding.\n  I do not think the Senators can have it both ways. Are we not going \nto live up to our word as is now stated in this provision of this piece \nof legislation? I hope my colleagues will overwhelmingly support this \namendment because this is all about the Senate's integrity. Are we for \nwhat we say we are for? Will we live up to our commitment?\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 58 seconds left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. For every Senator that is going to vote on this, I am \npuzzled. This amendment says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any Medicaid reform \n     enacted by the Senate this year should require that States \n     continue to provide Medicaid for 12 months to families who \n     lose eligibility for welfare benefits because of more \n     earnings or hours of employment.\n\n  That is exactly what we said we are going to do for reform in this \nbill. Otherwise, there will not be any funding and then this will be \ntruly punitive.\n  So we should go on record voting for what we said we were going to \ndo. I hope every Senator will vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? \n\n[[Page S 13634]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2484\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have not \nbeen able to reach an agreement on the Bingaman amendment, which would \nthen require a rollcall vote. I do not see anybody else on our side \nlooking for time. All I would suggest is, the Bingaman amendment deals \nwith a subject we have dealt with in the Daschle-Dole compromise. The \nDaschle-Dole compromise provided $100 million for drug treatment over \nthe next 2 years. It was a compromise between what Senator Cohen and \nSenator Bingaman had sought, which was $100 million per year. We came \nup with $100 million over the next 2 years. It was intended to be a \ncompromise.\n  As compromises are, we compromise, and hopefully when you compromise \nyou do not go forward and offer the amendment that we compromised on. \nBut, unfortunately, that has occurred in this case. It is going to cost \n$300 million more for this drug treatment. And I hope that, given the \nfact that this bill is far under the reconciliation target that we need \nto meet to balance the budget, this is another $300 million that we \nwill have to take out of Medicaid or Medicare or somewhere else in the \nFinance Committee. And I think the Finance Committee has a hard enough \nburden as it is without adding more money for drug treatment for \npeople, for people who are taken care of with $50 million a year for \nthe first 2 years.\n  Obviously, this is something that we can come back and visit in the \nfuture. But we are well over. And I hope that Senators will recognize \nthat we have got some tough decisions to make in the future. This is \ngoing to make it much tougher.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that votes occur in the order in which they \nwere debated, starting at 10 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2484, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I ask a question of the manager?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have made some modification in the \namendment to accommodate concerns that were raised on the other side. \nIs it permissible for me to send the modification of the amendment and \nhave that voted on?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is seeking unanimous consent to \nmodify his amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes. I do seek unanimous consent to modify the \namendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we have no objection to the modification \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 127, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following \n     new subsection:\n       (d) Supplemental Funding for Alcohol and Substance Abuse \n     Treatment Programs.--\n       (1) In general.--Out of any money in the Treasury not \n     otherwise appropriated, there are hereby appropriated to \n     supplement State and Tribal programs funded under section \n     1933 of the Public Health Service Act, $100,000,000 for each \n     of the fiscal years 1997 through 2000.\n       (2) Additional funds.--Amounts appropriated under paragraph \n     (1) shall be in addition to any funds otherwise appropriated \n     for allotments under section 1933 of the Public Health \n     Service Act and shall be allocated pursuant to such section \n     1933.\n       (3) Use of funds.--A State or Tribal government receiving \n     an allotment under this subsection shall consider as \n     priorities, for purposes of expending funds allotted under \n     this subsection, activities relating to the treatment of the \n     abuse of alcohol and other drugs.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nmodified amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2550\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask we temporarily set aside the Kennedy amendment No. \n2564 and move to the Kohl amendment No. 2550.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 10 minutes of debate \nequally divided on the Kohl amendment No. 2550, followed by a vote on \nor in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that Senator \nLeahy be added as an original cosponsor to this amendment No. 2550.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we should not need to debate this amendment \nfor very long. It is straightforward. This amendment would exempt the \nfood stamp benefits that go to children, the elderly and disabled from \nthe optional State block grant program set up in the bill.\n  I want to emphasize to my colleagues that the House in its welfare \nreform bill did not choose to block grant food stamps at all.\n  The argument for this amendment is simple. If it is not broke, do not \nfix it. Welfare is broke, financially and philosophically, but by \n``welfare,'' what we have always meant are the federally driven \nprograms that pay benefits to able-bodied adults who are not working.\n  Most of us and most Americans want to see the welfare programs \nredesigned to emphasize moving recipients to work rather than paying \nthem to stay home. And many of us believe that such work-based welfare \nprograms can best be managed at the State and local level where \nofficials understand the local economy and the specific needs of those \nin the community who are without jobs.\n  But Federal nutrition programs that serve the elderly, the disabled \nand children are not broken. In all the meetings that I have held \nthroughout Wisconsin on welfare reform, no one has complained to me \nabout Federal programs that have provided a hot meal to elderly \nretirees or a school lunch to children. No one has suggested that we \nought to make these populations work for their food stamps.\n  So we should not lump food stamps to the elderly, disabled and the \nchildren in with the welfare programs that so many Americans want \nended. In ending welfare as we know it, we should not end successful \nnutrition programs that keep our children, the disabled, and the \nelderly from going hungry. This amendment would still leave States with \nthe ability to take as a block grant food stamps and money that go to \nadults that can and should work. However, children, the elderly, and \nthe disabled would retain the assurance that nutritional assistance and \nFederal nutrition standards will be there when they are needed. And, \nagain, I want to remind my colleagues that the House did not block \ngrant food stamps at all.\n  This amendment has been endorsed by the Children's Defense Fund, the \nFood Research & Action Center, and Bread for the World. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letters I have in support from these antihunger groups be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Bread for the World (A Christian Citizens' Movement in \n           the USA),\n                            Silver Spring, MD, September 11, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: Bread for the World, a nation-wide \n     Christian citizen's movement against hunger, opposes the \n     optional food stamps block grant found in the Work \n     Opportunity Act of 1995, S. 1120. We hope there will be \n     attempts to remove the Food Stamps Program from the welfare \n     reform legislation and urge you to support an amendment that \n     would do so. However, in the absence of such an amendment, we \n     would support your amendment to exempt children, the elderly \n     and disabled from the optional food stamps block grant.\n       Current nutrition programs need to be strengthened in order \n     to assure access to a nutritious diet for every person. Bread \n     for the World supports proposals by the Department of \n     Agriculture to make improvements in the Food Stamp Program. \n     But deep funding cuts and the option to block grant would \n     inevitably spawn more hunger in this country, particularly \n     for children.\n       The Food Stamps Program is this nation's leading defense \n     against hunger in this country and ensures those in need \n     access to an adequate diet. The program targets some of the \n     most vulnerable members of society, including children and \n     elderly persons. Over eighty percent of benefits go to \n     households with children and sixteen percent of food stamp \n     households contain at least one elderly person.\n       Tufts University released a study in July of this year \n     showing that the federal Food Stamp Program greatly impacts \n     diets of poor children in this country. The study found that \n     food stamp participation reduces dietary deficiencies among \n     poor children by 30-50% for certain nutrients, and over 70% \n     for others. Over half of all food stamp recipients are \n     children.\n       We strongly believe that federal standards on eligibility \n     and benefit levels are important to the food stamps program \n     to ensure it is available on an equitable basis for all who \n     need it. However, at the very minimum, we must as a nation \n     ensure that our children do not go hungry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David Beckmann,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Food Research\n\n\n                                              & Action Center,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: We write to urge your support for the Kohl \n     amendment to S. 1120 (amendment #2550) which could exempt the \n     elderly, disabled persons, and children from the proposed \n     optional food stamp block grant. FRAC supports this amendment \n     as necessary to protect the ability of the Food Stamp Program \n     to serve the most vulnerable in our society.\n       FRAC strongly opposes the optional food stamp block grant \n     as it would eliminate the assurance of assistance for all \n     eligible persons in need when they need assistance. The Food \n     Stamp Program has been successful in alleviating hunger \n     precisely because of its ability to respond automatically, \n     especially in times of recession or natural disaster.\n       It is because of the vital role the Food Stamp Program \n     plays in feeding the most vulnerable among us, particularly \n     children, the elderly and the disabled, that FRAC strongly \n     supports the amendment to exclude these populations from a \n     block grant. We thank you for your consideration.\n       The Food Research and Action Center.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: I am writing in support of your \n     amendment, #2550, to the welfare reform bill currently being \n     debated on the Senate floor. The amendment would exempt \n     children and people who are elderly or disabled from the \n     proposed optional food stamp block grant.\n       While we oppose the proposed optional food stamp block \n     grant, if the block grant is passed this amendment would be a \n     significant step in the right direction towards protecting \n     vulnerable children from hunger.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            Marian Wright Edelman.\n\n\n[[Page S 13636]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. So, Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support this change \nto guarantee that children, the elderly, and the disabled do not go \nhungry. I urge my colleagues to support the Kohl-Leahy amendment.\n  I thank the President.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Aside from the administrative nightmare that would be \ncreated for the States to give them a block grant for some people and \nan entitlement for others and the administrative problem, this costs \n$1.4 billion over the next 7 years.\n  As we have said many times, we are well under our reconciliation \ntargets. This is money that is going to have to come out of other \nprograms. We simply cannot afford this amendment. I urge rejection of \nthe Kohl amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13628-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to emphasize to my colleagues \nthat the House, which passed a very small welfare reform bill, which in \nmany respects is really good, took a look at food stamps. They decided \nthat the country could not afford, from a humanitarian and social point \nof view, to block grant food stamps at all.\n  Now we have decided we should block grant food stamps. I agree that \nfor the population that we are attempting to move from welfare into \nwork we should block grant food stamps and be very different how we \nparcel out food stamps. But when we talk about children, the disabled, \nand the elderly, to block grant food stamps, it seems to me, is not \nwhat welfare reform is all about and not what we are trying to \naccomplish here. And that is why I am arguing that this population \nshould be exempt from having their food stamps block granted and \nultimately rationed out to them when that is not the intention of what \nthis welfare reform bill is to accomplish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have no quarrel with the Senator from \nWisconsin, but it is about $1.4 billion. We tried to accommodate some \nof the concerns on child care. And we have lost some savings on this \nside. And every time we accommodate one of these amendments, it means \nwe are going to have to cut somewhere else in Medicare to reach the \nbudget request because I understand we are going to be scored on this \nnext week. And we are going to have to take our lumps, because we have \nmade some accommodations.\n  So I hope we can defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. KOHL. I yielded back my time.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2550\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be so \nmodified.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2617), as modified, is as follows.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESTRICTIONS ON TAXPAYER FINANCED LEGAL CHALLENGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--No legal aid organization or other entity \n     that provides legal services and which receives Federal funds \n     may challenge (or act as an attorney on behalf of any party \n     who seeks to challenge) in any legal proceeding--\n       (1) the legal validity--\n       (A) under the United States Constitution--\n       (i) of this Act or any regulations promulgated under this \n     Act; and\n       (ii) of any law or regulation enacted as promulgated by a \n     State pursuant to this Act;\n       (B) under this Act or any regulation adopted under this Act \n     of any State law or regulation; and\n       (C) under any State Constitution of any law or regulation \n     enacted or promulgated by a State pursuant to this Act; and\n       (2) the conflict--\n       (A) of this Act or any regulations promulgated under this \n     Act with any other law or regulation of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) of any law or regulation, enacted or promulgated by a \n     State pursuant to this Act with any law or regulation of the \n     United States.\n       (b) Legal Proceeding Defined.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``legal proceeding'' includes--\n       (1) a proceeding--\n       (A) in a court of the United States;\n       (B) in a court of a State; and\n       (C) in an administrative hearing in a Federal or State \n     agency; and\n       (2) any activities related to the commencement of a \n     proceeding described in subparagraph (A).\n     \n[[Page S 13637]]\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2564, as modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk of my \namendment No. 2564.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2564), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 292, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       On page 292, line 11, strike the period and insert a \n     semicolon.\n       On page 292, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following \n     new subparagraphs:\n       ``(F) the Head Start program (42 U.S.C. 9801); and\n       (G) programs specified by the Attorney General, in the \n     Attorney General's sole and unreviewable discretion after \n     consultation with appropriate Federal agencies and \n     departments, which (i) delivers services at the community \n     level, including through public or private nonprofit \n     agencies; (ii) do not condition the provision of assistance, \n     the amount of assistance provided, or the cost of assistance \n     provided on the individual recipient's income or resources; \n     and (iii) are necessary for the protection of life, safety, \n     or public health.''\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the Kennedy \namendment No. 2564, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators wish to debate the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Wyoming \nfor his able assistance in working out this compromise.\n  Mr. President, we all agree that illegal aliens should not be \neligible for Federal programs. The only exception is when the \nassistance is in the nature of emergency services. Both the Dole bill \nand the Democratic bill underscore this policy.\n  But the situation is very different with respect to legal immigrants. \nThey are lawfully in this country, and they make substantial \ncontributions to our communities and to our Nation. They work, they \ncreate jobs, they pay taxes, they promote family values, and they \ncontribute to the sciences, the arts and culture.\n  In fact, legal immigrants contribute $25 to $35 billion more in taxes \neach year than they take out in services, including the educational \ncosts of their children.\n  We all want to get tough on illegal immigration. But the Dole \nproposal does so in a way that turns countless churches, synagogues, \nand community groups into immigration police. If they receive \nGovernment funds to operate soup kitchens, food pantries, battered \nwomen's shelters, rape crisis centers, and many other community \nservices, they must now check a needy client's immigration status \nbefore they can provide assistance.\n  This means that priests, ministers, rabbis, social workers, teachers, \nfamily crisis counselors, and community health workers must become \nimmigration police and check for green cards before they can offer help \nor carry out their humanitarian work.\n  Imagine a shattered young girl, brutally raped and requiring \nimmediate care and counseling at a rape crisis center. If the center is \neven partially funded with Government money, under this bill, the \ncenter must first determine if the traumatized young victim is a \ncitizen or noncitizen. They must find out whether she is here legally \nor illegally. If she is illegal, they can't help her.\n  In addition, if she is a legal immigrant, they must determine if she \nhas a sponsor, find out what the sponsor's income is, and determine \nwhether deeming the sponsor's income makes her eligible or ineligible \nfor Government-funded help.\n  This same lengthy and complicated process would be repeated countless \ntimes all across the country. Priests must check the immigration status \nof the homeless and hungry at church soup kitchens. Social workers must \ncheck the status of battered women seeking protection. Teachers must \ncheck the status of children enrolling in Head Start programs. Rabbis \nmust check the status of the elderly for assistance to the homebound.\n  For example, in 1993, Catholic charities provided services to needy \npeople across America--citizens and nonciti- zens alike--including food \npantries, soup kitchens, homeless shelters, family counseling programs, \nand other valuable community assistance. More than 60 percent of the \nfunding for these services came from Federal, State, and local \ngovernments. This assistance is provided on the basis of need. As a \nresult, under the Dole bill, Catholic Charities would be required to \ncheck immigration status before they help anyone.\n  We all agree that Head Start programs give children an effective \nearly start toward a more successful and fulfilling future. But under \nthe Dole bill, Head Start teachers would have to check children's green \ncards before they enter the program.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services offers a partial list of \nnoncash programs under its jurisdiction which would be affected by the \nharsh features of the Dole bill. Significant portions of these programs \nare administered by community-based organizations, churches, and other \nnonprofit groups, who would be required by the bill to check the \nimmigration status of their clients. The list includes:\n  Programs serving abused and neglected children and preventing family \nand domestic violence. Programs providing critical public health \nservices to women and children, including maternal and child health.\n  Early childhood development programs. Youth development and violence \nprevention programs.\n  The Dole bill exempts school lunches, WIC, emergency Medicaid and \ncertain other noncash programs. But if we are to avoid forcing the \nNation's clergy and teachers and social workers to become immigration \npolice by demanding green cards of their clients, we need to do more.\n  Rather than list individually the additional programs which should be \nexempted from the bill, my amendment leaves the decision to the \nAttorney General in consultation with the head of the agency or \ndepartment administering the assistance program. In that way, before a \nprogram is exempted from the bill, the law enforcement perspective of \nthe Attorney General, together with the benefits perspective of the \nagency providing the assistance, will determine the decision.\n  I believe my amendment represents a responsible compromise on this \nissue, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. As I understand it, this amendment is intended to cover \nthose few programs involving little cost in which an individual income \ndetermination is not required.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct. My amendment is intended to cover \nprograms which are in the interest of the community and are needed for \nthe fundamental health or safety of the immigrant or the community. In \ngiving the authority to make the determination to the Attorney General, \nit is my expectation that decisions regarding which programs to \ndesignate under this authority will be made with immigration law \nenforcement interests in mind as well.\n  The kinds of program which I would envision being designated under \nthis amendment are soup kitchens, battered women's shelters, rape \ncrisis centers, and other similar programs. It will not cover \nentitlement programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Kennedy \namendment No. 2564, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2564), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. The next amendment is by Senator Simon and Senator Graham \nof Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2509\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Simon-Graham amendment No. \n2509, to be followed on a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the floor \nmanager on this, Senator Graham of Florida has become a chief sponsor \nof this amendment and is trying to work out an amendment. I do not know \nwhether he is successful in that or not.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as my colleague has just explained, the \nbasic thrust of this amendment is to maintain the status quo and the \nrules of the game under which those people who are currently in the \ncountry as legal immigrants, playing by the rules as they were at the \ntime they entered the country, particularly as it relates to \n\n[[Page S 13638]]\nthat group of legal immigrants who are attending educational \ninstitutions and depend upon their access to things like guaranteed \nloans to be able to finance their education. There has been some \ndiscussion of possibly limiting the scope of this amendment to be more \nspecifically focused on that one issue. As of this point, there does \nnot appear to be interest in that limitation. But I will state to my \ncolleagues that that is an extremely important part of what this \nlegislation would do.\n  It really means the ability for thousands of students across the \ncountry to be able to continue their education and continue their \npursuit of the American dream--coming to America, getting an education, \nbecoming a fully self-supporting citizen.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask for the attention of my colleagues \nhere. Every change we have made in immigration in the past has been \nprospective, not retroactive. That is the way it should be. To say that \nif, for example, Senator DeWine was the chief sponsor for an immigrant \nnamed Senator Ford, and he agrees to be responsible for 3 years, that \nis the way it should be. When we change that to 5 years, we should do \nit prospectively, not retroactively. That is No. 1.\n  The second point is that we should not go back to Senator DeWine and \nsay, sorry, you agreed to 3 years, now we are going to make it 5.\n  This is the point the Senator from Florida has made which is very \nimportant. There are thousands of students who are legal immigrants in \nthis country, who are going to become citizens, and without this \namendment, they cannot get any benefits in this country, and they are \ngoing to have to leave school. Without this amendment, they lose all \neducation assistance. I do not think that makes sense for this country. \nSo I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment with Senator Graham. I \nthink it is important, and I hope it will be adopted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 35 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to reserve that to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have a matter involving the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Simpson. He will be here momentarily. We are also \ntrying to determine the cost of this amendment. I understand it is \nabout half a billion dollars.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, might I inquire as to the time for the \nSenator from Wyoming?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 4 minutes and 29 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, again, as in last night's activity, a \ndifficult and emotional issue, couched in the terms of immigration and \nwelfare--either we do something or we do not. It is very simple.\n  The Dole welfare reform bill would for 5 years require the deeming of \na sponsor's income and resources in the case of a sponsored immigrant \nseeking public assistance. Immigration law is riddled with \ncompassionate loopholes and people are fed up.\n  We must place sensible controls on these continuing conditions or \nAmericans will be in terminable compassion fatigue.\n  This 5-year deeming period is consistent with the 5-year deeming \nperiod for SSI, which we did last year. It is exactly the same as that \n5 years. It is exactly the 5-year deeming period for AFDC and food \nstamps proposed by the President of the United States in his own \nwelfare reform bill, the President's proposal. The sponsor's assets and \nincome are deemed to be those of the immigrants when you come to the \nUnited States.\n  The only immigrants affected by this 5-year deeming period are those \nwho have already entered within the last 5 years and who apply for or \nare already receiving public assistance of some form or amount. Please \nhear that. Remember, please--and you cannot miss this point--the people \nwho are admitted as immigrants to the United States, to this very \ngenerous land, are here only after their sponsors convinced the visa \nofficer that the immigrant would not require public assistance at any \ntime--not just for 5 years or the first 3 years or any year, but at any \ntime, and that they would not become a public charge.\n  Under the Graham-Simon amendment, sponsored immigrants who have \nentered within the past 5 years could continue to receive assistance \nunder programs which they already benefit and could apply for and \nreceive assistance under many other programs immediately, and several \nothers in less than 3 years.\n  Most other Americans would certainly question that fairness, when \ntheir own children cannot get in those programs because they happen to \nbe native born.\n  Keep in mind, now, these persons were admitted only--only--because \nthey were able to convince, to make a promise to the visa officer that \nthey would not become a public charge, and the law says ``at any \ntime.''\n  This amendment would therefore have the purpose of relieving the \nimmigrants and his or her sponsor from that promised obligation to give \nthe required assistance, and the good old American taxpayers would then \ntake over to the tune of $623 million over 5 years.\n  I want to emphasize that clearly again. Before an immigrant can be \nadmitted, it must be established that he or she is not likely to become \na public charge, that the real contract the immigrant and the sponsor \nhave with the American people, the real promise of America, is keeping \npromises. Whether the affidavit of support is for 3 years or 5 years is \nmuch beside the point. The understanding was the immigrant would not \nbecome a burden on the public of the United States, especially not in \nhis first 5 years in the United States.\n  What would the American taxpayers say if they knew we were admitting \npersons as immigrants who they knew would then be covered under this \namendment, would be able to receive public assistance so soon after \ntheir arrival, even within 3 years?\n  My colleague from Florida is honestly concerned about college \nstudents in his State who are recent immigrants who may want to receive \npublic-funded college assistance. It is good and in our national \ninterest that the newcomers seek to improve themselves through \nadditional education and training, but the agreement of admission, the \npromise made was that the immigrants and his or her sponsor would take \ncare of the cost of that education and not the American taxpayers.\n  A sponsor is a sponsor is a sponsor. If the Senator says that we must \nmaintain the status quo and not change the rules of the game, there is \na good way to do it: reject this amendment because the rule of the game \nis the newcomer must be self-supported, not likely at any time to \nbecome a public charge. Those are the words of the immigration law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 1 minute and 25 \nseconds. All time is expired on the other side.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This amendment keeps the status quo, particularly as it \nrelates to students who are using Federal programs, such as the \nguaranteed student loan to continue their education.\n  The Senator from Wyoming talks about holding sponsors responsible. If \nwe had been able to hold sponsors responsible, we would not have to \nhave the change in the law that is contained in the underlying \namendment. The fact is that we have a policy which has been to set a \nperiod of time within which we would deem the sponsors' income. We are \nnow about to change that in a prospective manner.\n  Our previous policies relative to changing immigration law as it \nrelates to legal immigrants have always been to do it for the future, \nnot to change the rules of the game for those people who are here in \nAmerica today.\n  I believe this goes to two fundamental principles. One is we play by \nthe rules of the game as those rules were set when the game begins. If \nyou change the rules, you do it for the next game.\n  Second, we want to encourage these people to get an education so that \nthey can become, to the maximum possible extent, participants in the \nAmerican dream, participants in building their families, communities, \nand this Nation.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment. \n\n[[Page S 13639]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2568\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Graham amendment No. 2568 to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pryor \nbe added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the structure of this bill establishes \nobjectives that States are to meet, particularly in the area of \nplacement of people in work, 25 percent in 1996 rising to 50 percent in \nthe year 2000. Those are laudable objectives.\n  There are also some very serious sanctions against States that do not \nmeet those objectives. A State is subject, for instance, to losing 5 \npercent of its Federal grant if in any year it fails to meet the \nstandard that has been set.\n  What is the problem? The problem is that we are distributing to \nStates wildly different amounts of Federal resources in which to meet \nthose consistent objectives. We are telling, for instance, the State of \nMississippi that it will have to use 88 percent of its Federal money in \norder to meet the mandates of this bill. Other States will be able to \nmeet the mandates for less than 35 percent of the Federal money that \nwill be made available.\n  That seems inherently unfair, to have 50 States, each of which has a \nmuch different position at the starting line in terms of the kind of \nsupport they are going to meet but then say that each one has to get to \nthe finish line at exactly the same point and, if they fail to do so, \nbe subject to significant financial personality.\n  What this amendment says is that the Secretary of HHS should look at \nthe national standards and make adjustments based on the amount of \nFederal support that each State will receive and the number of minor \nchildren in poverty in that State, so that if we are going to have the \nstarting line different from State to State we at least ought to have \nthe finish line adjusted to those States' realistic capabilities. If we \ndo not do this, I can tell you without question there are going to be \nsubstantial numbers of States that will be almost subject to automatic \npenalty. There will be virtually no chance that they can reach the same \nfinish line, the same standard, for instance, of job placement, with \nthe heavy commitments that that means in terms of training, support \nservices, and child care, as the more advantaged States.\n  It is a simple, straightforward amendment of fairness.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I hope Members listen to this because \nthis is a gutting amendment. I heard a lot of comments on the other \nside of the aisle, even from the President, about how the Republican \nbill was weak on work. What the amendment of the Senator from Florida \ndoes is eliminate all the work requirements. What he does is say that \nit makes all the participation rates of people getting into work \nvoluntary. It eliminates any of the work requirement.\n  This is the 1988 act back with you again, which, of course, required \nwork but did not sanction anybody if they did not work.\n  What has happened? Four percent of the welfare recipients work in \nthis country today. This is the nuclear bomb on this bill which would \nbasically say no one will have to work; you will not be penalized as a \nState if you do not get people to work. It makes work completely \nvoluntary on the part of the States. Anyone who has come up here and \nsaid they are for welfare recipients to work, if you vote for this \namendment, you are not for welfare recipients to have to go to work.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I must say that I range between being \nsomewhat offended by that description or concerned about our \ncolleague's ability to read the English language because that is not \nwhat this does.\n  The amendment retains the participation levels as stated in the bill. \nThen it directs the Secretary of HHS to make such adjustments in the \nrate. That is, a State, instead of being asked to meet a 50-percent \nstandard, may be asked to meet a 55-percent standard, if it is one that \nis receiving a substantial amount of funds above the national average, \nas happens to be the case with the State of our colleague who just \nspoke, or it might be something less than 50 percent if you are getting \nsubstantially less than the national average in terms of Federal \nresources.\n  It just seems to me patently unfair to start 50 States in such \ndifferent positions in terms of their Federal resources per poor child \nand then say but at the end of the day they all have to get to the same \nend position. We retain the mandatory provision. We retain all of the \nrequirements to work.\n  I am proud to come from a State which has one of the demonstration \nprojects which has already gotten in the first few months of operation \nalmost 10 percent of its welfare beneficiaries in jobs, and it is \nmoving toward the goal of having 50 percent of its welfare \nbeneficiaries to work.\n  I support that as an important principle, but I also recognize there \nare resources required to reach those objectives, and if you have made \na decision that we are going to allocate resources in a differential \nmanner, then I think fairness says we have to look at what will \nconstitute success in a differential manner. Failure to do so is just \ngoing to mean that those who start poor are going to not only end poor \nbut they are going to be beaten around the head and neck with penalties \nand sanctions because they have failed to achieve unrealistic \nobjectives given the resources that were provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I will read from the Senator's \namendment.\n\n       A State to which a grant is made under section 403 shall \n     make every effort to achieve the national work participation \n     rate goals.\n\n  This is not a mandate--shall make every effort to achieve the goal. \nIt does not mandate that they have to participate. They do not get \nsanctioned if in fact they do not meet these participation rate goals. \n\n[[Page S 13640]]\n\n  It is the 1988 act all over again which says we want you to do it, \nbut if you do not do this you do not get any sanction. This is the \nnonwork amendment. And I urge its defeat. I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I can reclaim my time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, could I ask one question of either the \nSenator from Pennsylvania or the Senator from Colorado.\n  Would they please read the last page of the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if I can can respond to the Senator from \nFlorida, what it says is that the Secretary shall consult with the \nStates and establish a goal. It does not say what that goal is. It \ncould be 2 percent. It could be 5 percent. It does not say anything \nabout any kind of goal of 35 or 50 percent, which is what this bill \ndoes. You make it all arbitrary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I guess the Senator will not understand it then.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It eliminates the participation rates that are in the \nbill today. And I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida has very good intentions, and he is known as a very thoughtful \nMember. I merely would add this for Members' consideration.\n  In the 1988 act, we billed that as a requirement to either work or \ntrain or go to school, and what happened is without penalties we ended \nup with only 4 percent of the entire population in welfare in this \nNation in work programs. In other words, when given an option and \nwithout penalties, work did not happen.\n  The surest way to end the potential of getting people back in the \nmainstream by getting real work experience is to eliminate the \npenalties for not complying with the work requirement. If you leave \nthis without a strong penalty for not working, you will eliminate our \nability to get people back into the mainstream.\n  I am convinced this may be the most important amendment that we have \nconsidered. I hope the body will vote resoundingly to retain those \nstrong penalties because, believe me, without them our experience \nindicates it will not happen.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the Graham amendment. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding \nthe consent of September 14, that a vote occur on the Dole modification \nfollowing the debate, and following the disposition of the two leaders' \namendments, one of which will be a Dole motion to strike the Bradley \namendment, the underlying Dole amendment No. 2280, as amended, be \ndeemed agreed to.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Reserving my right to object, is there a time for debate \non the motion to strike the Bradley amendment?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There is no time limit at this point. We will be \nwilling to enter into a time agreement, but there is no time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Gramm \namendment No. 2617 be moved ahead of the Gramm amendment 2615, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2617\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes for debate equally divided on the Gramm amendment No. 2617, to \nbe followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the amendment before us is a very, very \nsimple amendment. Let me just relate some facts about the amendment.\n  On January 1, 1995, Indiana started a welfare reform pilot program in \nwhich welfare recipients were required to work or lose their benefits. \nThe Legal Services Corporation of Indiana filed a lawsuit to block the \nimplementation of that law.\n  On October 1, 1991, Michigan, the first State in the Nation ever to \ncomprehensively reform welfare, began its program to deny general \nassistance to nonworking, able-bodied, single adults without children. \nThe Legal Services Corporation of Michigan filed a lawsuit to try to \nblock the implementation of that law.\n  In 1992, the New Jersey Family Development Act, which among other \nthings, denied additional AFDC payments to mothers for children \nconceived while on welfare. Five federally funded New Jersey Legal \nServices grantees filed lawsuits to block the implementation of that \nlaw.\n  In 1994, Pennsylvania law ended welfare benefits for nonworking, \nable-bodied recipients. The Legal Services Corporation in Pennsylvania \nfiled a lawsuit to block the implementation of that law.\n  Not one single State in the Union has tried to reform welfare, has \ntried to implement a mandatory work requirement, has tried to set up a \nlimit on the amount of time you can be on welfare, or has tried to deny \nadditional benefits to people on welfare who have additional children \nwithout being challenged at the taxpayers' expense.\n  Not one such State action has failed to be challenged by Legal \nServices Corporation in the courts. These lawsuits have been long and \nprotracted. They have been funded by Federal taxpayer funds.\n  So this amendment says, very simply, this: No Federal taxpayer funds \nshall be used to block the implementation of this welfare reform bill, \nany State welfare reform bill, or any regulation emanating from those \nlaws.\n  Now, let me make it clear. Legal Services Corporation can fund a \nlawsuit where a recipient argues that the rules or the law are not \nbeing fairly implemented with regard to their claim. But taxpayer \nfunding from the Federal Government cannot be used to try to overturn \nthe law or overturn the regulation.\n  It is a very simple amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S 13641]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yields myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes. First of \nall, this is not just about Federal funds. The Senator's amendment \nincludes all funds. It says if any advocacy group for disability or for \nchildren, as well as at Legal Services, receives a nickel from Legal \nServices, they cannot challenge any provision under this act, which is \ntargeted on the most vulnerable individuals.\n  Now, we have provisions in here dealing with adoption. We have \nprovisions in here on child support. We have provisions in here on day \ncare, and we have requirements on the States to make sure that those \nprovisions are going to be effective.\n  Under the Gramm amendment, if a mother in any of our States found \nthat the State law was insufficient for the purposes of this law, she \nwould be precluded from going ahead and challenging that rule or \nregulation or State law that otherwise should be meeting the \nrequirements of this law. I mean, that absolutely makes no sense. Here \nwe are putting in provisions on child care, provisions on disability, \nprovisions affecting older Americans, making States go ahead and \ndevelop their own laws to implement those, and we are saying, even \nhere, if they are not strong enough, we are denying any of the advocacy \ngroups that they receive a nickel of Legal Services money or private \nmoney, if they receive a nickel of Legal Services money from protecting \nthose vulnerable people.\n  The Senator from Texas usually talks about the ``strings'' that are \ngoing on as a requirement of various Federal programs. He is putting \nstrings on the private sector. In my State, in Boston, MA, about 35 \npercent of the funds for Legal Services in Boston are Legal Services \nfunds. But the others come from the private sector. He is saying you \ncannot even use a nickel of the private sector funds, from private \ncompanies, from private individuals, to protect the most vulnerable in \nour society. Child support, adoption, disability--his amendment would \ndeny that. We will have a chance to debate this issue next week on the \nAppropriations Committee on Commerce. Why do it now?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to be the concluding speaker on \nthe amendment. I ask Senator Kennedy to go ahead and use his time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will yield a minute--how much time do I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 20 seconds to Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be very brief. This is the wrong place to consider \nthis. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, the committee is \ngoing to be taking up this question about the whole scope of Legal \nServices. I know that my friend from Texas has a problem with the \nentire entity of Legal Services. He would like to wipe it all out, \nperiod, under any circumstances, for any reason. This is not the place \nto do this.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote against it, or if it is a \ntabling motion, vote to table it. Let us fight this out on the whole of \nthe future of Legal Services, not on a welfare bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this does not just go to Legal Services \nrepresenting poor people. This goes to protection and advocacy groups \nrepresenting disabled citizens of the United States. Many times, Legal \nServices entities in our States provide funds to protection and \nadvocacy groups which we have set up under the law. These are legal \nentities set up to represent and to help people with disabilities to \nget through administrative procedures and legal proceedings.\n  If you read the amendment of the Senator from Texas, it says that no \nlegal aid organization, or other entity--other entity--so protection \nand advocacy groups for the disabled would be cut out. If you look at \nthe last paragraph, defined is ``legal proceeding.'' In a court of the \nUnited States, court of the State, in an administrative hearing, in a \nFederal or State act. You might as well tell every disabled person in \nthis country that they have no right to go into a court or no right to \ngo into an administrative hearing to challenge the validity of a State \nregulation.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Senator from Texas \nwould want to pick on the most vulnerable in our society. Forget just \nabout Legal Services. Focus on the disabled. This is going to cut every \ndisabled person in this country of low-income means. Obviously, if you \nhave the money, if you have the money, you can hire any lawyer you \nwant. If you are disabled and poor, you will not be able to challenge \nthe validity or legality of any regulation in any State regardless of \nhow onerous it may be. For that reason, it ought to be defeated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have spoken before in the debate----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 15 seconds to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I actually will defer to the Senator from Maryland. We \ndefeated a similar amendment last session.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I do not understand how you can profess \nto be a nation that believes in equal justice under the law and not \nmake legal services available to people who are too poor to afford \nthem. How do you make our legal system work, and how do you make the \nrule of law equitable and have a real system of justice?\n  I very strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, current law allows any Legal \nServices Corporation grantee in America to file a lawsuit on behalf of \nany client, using taxpayers' funds, regardless of whether or not the \nindividual is being treated fairly under the Federal law or the State \nlaw or Federal regulations or State regulations emanating from the law. \nBut what my amendment says is that taxpayer funding cannot be used to \ntry to block the implementation of laws that the American people are \nfor in overwhelming numbers.\n  It is time that we stop taxpayer funds from being used to circumvent \nthe will of the people who pay those taxes.\n  Second, the lamenting that we are not funding advocacy groups--if \nthey want to advocate, God bless them, but let them advocate with their \nown money, not the taxpayers' money.\n  Finally, State law and Federal law cannot be challenged with Federal \ntaxpayer money, but that does not keep the ACLU from challenging it. It \ndoes not keep private groups from doing it.\n  My amendment is very, very simple. It stops what is going on all over \nAmerica. Federal tax dollars, through the Legal Services Corporation, \nare being used to try to block every effort to force able-bodied \nwelfare recipients to go to work. Every effort to try to reform welfare \nhas been challenged using taxpayer money. I want to bring that to an \nend. If people oppose welfare reform, let them run for public office or \nput up their own money to challenge it in the court. But do not take \nthe money of the people who do the work, pay the taxes, and pull the \nwagon in America to try to stop the implementation of law, which they \nstrongly support.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] and \nthe Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily absent.\n \n[[Page S 13642]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2615, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Gramm amendment No. 2615, as \nmodified, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2615), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 792, strike lines 1 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1202. REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall reduce the Federal workforce within the Department of \n     Health and Human Services by an amount equal to the sum of--\n       (1) 75 percent of the full-time equivalent positions at \n     each such Department that relate to any direct spending \n     program, or any program funded through discretionary \n     spending, that has been converted into a block grant program \n     under this Act and the amendments made by this Act; and\n       (2) an amount equal to 75 percent of that portion of the \n     total full-time equivalent departmental management positions \n     at each such Department that bears the same relationship to \n     the amount appropriated for the programs referred to in \n     paragraph (1) as such amount relates to the total amount \n     appropriated for use by each such Department.\n       (b) Reductions in the Department of Health and Human \n     Services.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take such \n     actions as may be necessary, including reductions in force \n     actions, consistent with sections 3502 and 3595 of title 5, \n     United States Code, to reduce the full-time equivalent \n     positions within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services--\n       (1) by 245 full-time equivalent positions related to the \n     program converted into a block grant under the amendment made \n     by section 101(b); and\n       (2) by 60 full-time equivalent managerial positions in the \n     Department.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Does the Senator from Texas wish to modify his amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I believe, Mr. President, the amendment has already been \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is a very important principle. The \nnumber of positions that are affected by the amendment are relatively \nsmall, but let me explain why the principle is important.\n  We are in the process, in this welfare reform bill, of doing \nsomething that we have not done in 40 years. Rather than power and \ndecisionmaking authority residing Washington, we are sending it back to \nthe States, counties, cities and to the people.\n  We are, in fact, in this bill, eliminating a Federal program known as \nAFDC [aid to families with dependent children]. We will be debating, \nlater, the elimination of Federal job training programs where the money \nfor those programs will be given back to the States. We will allow each \nState to conduct job training in such a way that the State believes \nwill be most successful within its borders.\n  Here is the question. Given that we are eliminating Federal programs, \nwhat about the people who are employed by the Federal Government to run \nthose programs? What happens to the jobs in AFDC when we eliminate \nAFDC? What happens to the jobs in these training programs when we \neliminate the training programs?\n  What I am proposing is a very modest amendment. I am sure it will be \nstrongly opposed by people who believe that immortality in a temporal \nsense is defined as a Government program or a Government position. But \nwhat I am saying is this: If you eliminate a program, you cannot keep \nmore than 25 percent of the people who work directly on that program \neven though they have nothing to do. Second, you have to take the \noverhead of the department that the program is part of and you have to \nreduce that overhead proportionately because that program no longer \nexists.\n  I think we have a legitimate right to be concerned--when giving power \nback to the States and eliminating Federal programs--about all of these \nGovernment employees who were running the old programs remaining \nGovernment employees and undercutting what the States are doing.\n  In any other city in America, this would be an amendment in which \nanybody who opposed it would be laughed out of the room. Unfortunately, \nthis is Washington, DC. We are talking about Government positions.\n  And what I am saying is simply this: If you eliminate a Government \nprogram, you have to eliminate at least 75 percent of the positions. I \nthink it ought to be 100 percent. You also have to lower the overhead \nfor that portion of the program by 75 percent.\n  It is an eminently reasonable amendment. It may make too much sense \nto be given consideration in the U.S. Senate. We shall see. But I \nwanted to offer it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, that all sounds very good. In transferring \nthis back to the States there will be a block grant except for one \nthing. For people in Washington, DC, we have loaded down the department \nwith all sorts of requirements for monitoring and evaluation and advice \nto prevent some of the abuse of the States, among other things. With \njust a casual look at what current responsibilities are, the \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government still remain.\n  Under the Dole bill, it indicates that the Dole bill expands the jobs \nin Washington, not contracts. Less than 1 percent of the total staff \nadministering welfare is employed at the Federal level--State, Federal, \nand local. Administrative costs account for less than 1,000 of the \ntotal 4(a) and 4(f) expenditures.\n  We have assumed new responsibilities under the Dole bill to provide \ntechnical assistance to hundreds of tribes to design and implement new \ncash assistance programs; also, to gather, compile, evaluate, and \ndisseminate data on a larger scale and with greater case specific \nvariables.\n  We are assuming new program analysis, and dissemination of \ninformation responsibilities. This is particularly true in the child \nsupport enforcement area.\n  We have put all sorts of monitoring requirements on here that, if \nanything, a case could be made for needing more people to do it.\n  Let me break this down more. Technical assistance to States: We have \na whole series of new requirements under the Dole bill which most of us \ndo not disagree with at all.\n  Under tribal issues, supporting tribal efforts in designing \nassistance programs; reviewing and approving temporary assistance \nplans; we are collecting and evaluating some data collected \n\n[[Page S 13643]]\nfrom the States, including all sorts of things that we were not \nrequired to do before. Under data collection and evaluation where there \nare five requirements now in existing law, under the Dole bill we now \nhave 16 different--in other words 11 brandnew--data collection and \nevaluation requirements on this.\n  In other words, on HHS we are giving them all these things to do and \nsaying but it is an unfunded mandate. We are not going to give you the \nmoney to do this. We are going to cut the position to do the things we \nare telling you to do which does not make any sense at all to do this.\n  I could go on with this if we had an hour or so. I would like to go \ninto each one of these in detail. Policy and planning accounts, the \nsame thing; accountability, all of these things. We do not want to cut \nback on accountability now. We have to review State and tribal audits, \nreview and rank State performance, establish penalties, and administer \nappeals process.\n  We are going to have to develop and program outcome measures at the \nsame time we are cutting the people that are required to do all these \nthings. And for each of these I have a paragraph reference in the bill \nitself.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield at this point 30 seconds to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio has pointed out \nclearly something I find painful. In the very long time that I have \nbeen in this city I have never seen legislation imposing more \nregulatory requirements on State governments by the Federal Government \nthan this bill.\n  And I would simply respond, if I may. In a little bit of a caricature \na couple of days ago when one of the these new regulatory provisions \ncame along, I stood on this side of the aisle and said, ``Mr. \nPresident, as one who dearly loves Federal regulations imposed on \nStates in minute, indecipherable detail, I accept this amendment with \ngreat gusto.''\n  I could not say it better. It is going to be a great generation for \nregulators, but not very great for poor people and certainly not great \nfor poor children.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 35 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just a reminder that the amendment that is \noffered by the Senator from Texas has been modified.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you Mr. President.\n  I rise in support of the amendment. One of the taxes on poor \nAmericans, people who are truly needy, is a bureaucratic tax. As a \nGovernor, I can testify that the more the bureaucracy proliferates in \nWashington the greater the percentage of the resource at the State \nlevel that has to be used to respond to the bureaucracy in Washington \nrather than to meet the needs of the truly needy.\n  I believe, to the extent that we can reduce the bureaucratic tax on \nthe poor which is represented by Washington bureaucrats who are no \nlonger needed because we cut the program, that we ought to do that, and \nfor that reason I believe Senator Gramm's amendment is in order and \nought to be supported by Members of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 35 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Read the Dole bill. It puts more requirements on the \nFederal Government. I went through some of it here, a whole host of \nthem, and at the same time we are saying we give an unfunded mandate to \nHHS we say you have to do more, you have to do more analysis, do all of \nthese additional things that are listed right here. This is not \nfictitious stuff. We say you have to do a lot more in the way of \nanalyzing, and so on. Yet, we are going to cut the people who do it. \nHow on Earth are we going to prevent abuse in these programs if we do \nthat kind of Government operation? It does not make any sense at all. \nIt will not work this way. We are setting up a recipe for disaster, if \nwe do it that way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that we are \neliminating this Federal program, that the money is going back to the \nStates, and they are going to run the program. Yet, the Senator from \nOhio says that a case can be made supporting the need for more \nemployees in Washington, even once we have eliminated the program. \nThere is nothing so immortal as a Government program.\n  We celebrate here our giving back of funds to the States to run the \nprogram, and yet we are arguing that we have to preserve the Federal \njobs in a program that no longer exists. No wonder the American people \nare outraged that Government grows like a cancer.\n  My amendment is a very modest amendment. It says you have eliminated \nthe program. Eliminate 75 percent of its jobs. It seems to me that we \nought to eliminate 100 percent of them, but instead, I say keep 25 \npercent of the people in an agency that no longer carries out a \nfunction, a function that is now run by the State.\n  I see this as a very modest amendment. We ought to be eliminating \nevery one of these positions, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 2615. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] and \nthe Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the pending matter be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Motion to Strike Amendment No. 2496\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I intend to make a motion to strike the \npreviously agreed to amendment No. 2496, which was offered by the \nSenator from New Jersey, Senator Bradley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator is \nauthorized to make that motion.\n  Mr. DOLE. First, I want to apologize to my friend from New Jersey. I \nwas so anxious to be accommodating, because I always have been, but I \ntook the amendment before I realized that it had some points that were \nnot what I thought they were. I do not suggest that he said anything, \nbut I did not read it carefully enough.\n  What the Bradley amendment would do is amend the plans that States \nmust submit to receive Federal block grants. It does three things. It \nrequires the State to define who is eligible and who is not eligible \nfor cash assistance, and this creates the invitation for welfare \nlitigation against the States over who is eligible for assistance. It \ncreates an individual entitlement by requiring States to provide \nbenefits to all individuals that the States deem eligible.\n  This amendment shifts the time limit from the Federal Government to \nthe State government. The cycle of dependency created by the \nentitlement must be broken. We do not want to shift that from the \nFederal to the State government.\n  Finally, the amendment creates an unfunded mandate by possibly \nrequiring States to provide unmatched funds to individuals. We do not \nwant to create additional unfunded mandates.\n  The point of this exercise, all the debate we have had, is to provide \nStates with the needed flexibility to address welfare reform and not to \ncreate a possible unfunded mandate on the States or, as I said, second, \nanother entitlement. We do not know what the cost of this amendment \ncould possibly be. For the reasons stated, I should not have accepted \nthe amendment.\n  I now move to strike the amendment, and after the debate I will ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I do say to the distinguished majority \nleader that I was a little surprised when he said he would accept the \namendment. I thought it was perfectly appropriate, because I would not \ncharacterize the amendment exactly as he has characterized the \namendment.\n  It does not create a Federal entitlement. It, first, does not add any \nadditional spending. It does not touch the block grant. CBO has told us \nthat it would not result in a penny of additional Federal outlays.\n  Second, it does not entitle anyone to anything. A State can deny any \nindividual--practically any person--benefits. It can deny benefits if \nyou do not work. A State can deny benefits if you have additional \nchildren. It can deny benefits if you do not comply with the \nrequirements of your individual agreement. The State can deny benefits, \nunder this proposal, practically for anything. But what the State \ncannot do under this amendment is deny you benefits for no reason at \nall if you are a poor family who is eligible under the State's own \nrules.\n  To those who object to this amendment, I just simply would like to \nask, what is it that you want States to be able to do that they would \nnot be able to do under this amendment? I, frankly, cannot imagine. I \ncannot imagine why States should not be required simply to say what \ntheir rules are for eligibility, what the benefits are, and who gets \ncut off, and then simply follow the rules.\n  The only right that is created here is not a right to money, it is a \nright to know what the rules are. How do you determine who gets any \nbenefits, unless the State has written rules that clearly state who is \neligible? How do we decide that someone who fits the category of \neligibility should not be given benefits if there are no rules?\n  So I simply say that this is a very straightforward amendment. It is \nan attempt to add clarity to what will be a confused policy in States. \nI think it illustrates, once again, the problem of a block grant with \nno rules to implement the block grant. This came through in very vivid \nterms yesterday when we had an amendment--a well-intentioned \namendment--that said in order to reduce illegitimacy, which is what all \nof us would like to do, a State that reduced illegitimacy would get a \nbonus, but the amendment read that the State would have to reduce \nillegitimacy without increasing abortions.\n  So those are both pretty good intentions. But what that means, as I \nread that amendment, is that every woman in a State has to be asked if \nshe has had an abortion.\n  Otherwise, how do you determine how many abortions were performed in \nthe State? The result of the amendment is a direct involvement of the \nState government in the lives of every woman in the State asking the \nquestion, have you or have you not had an abortion?\n  Unless that is asked to every woman, how do you determine whether \nabortions have gone up or gone down? If you do not know whether \nabortions have gone up or gone down, how do you determine the offset \nagainst the illegitimacy rate?\n  Mr. President, that amendment is another illustration of the problem \nwith a block grant that has no requirement of any rule.\n  This amendment would simply say that the State has to establish rules \nof eligibility and has to apply those rules of eligibility for every \nperson who fits into that category. It is as simple as that.\n  This is, again, not a new Federal entitlement. It is simply common \nsense.\n  Mr. President, I am ready, if the majority leader would like to make \nthe motion to strike at this time, to have the vote on the motion to \nstrike.\n  Mr. DOLE. I make a motion to strike the amendment numbered 2496.\n  The Bradley amendment amends the plan that States must submit to \nreceive Federal funds under the new block grant.\n  Specifically, the amendment does three things:\n  It requires the State to define who is eligible and who is ineligible \nfor cash assistance. This creates the invitation for welfare litigation \nagainst the States over who is eligible for assistance.\n  It creates an individual entitlement by requiring States to provide \nbenefits to all individuals that the States deem eligible. This \namendment shifts the entitlement from the Federal Government to the \nState government. The cycle of dependency that is created by the \nentitlement must be broken.\n  Finally, the Bradley amendment creates an unfunded mandate on the \nStates by possibly requiring States to provide unmatched funds to \nindividuals.\n  Mr. President, the point of this exercise is to provide States with \nthe needed flexibility to address welfare reform, not to create another \nunfunded mandate on the States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been made. Is there further \ndebate?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on the motion to strike the previously agreed-to \nBradley amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Dole \namendment be set aside in order to accommodate one final amendment. It \nwould be my understanding I will offer this amendment and then we would \nhave two votes, perhaps three votes stacked, at least two votes, \nfollowing debate on the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2682 to No. 2280\n\n (Purpose: To permit States to provide noncash assistance to children \n       ineligible for aid because of the 5-year time limitation)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  We have had a good debate about a number of issues relating to \nwelfare. The one that I do not think we have talked enough about, and I \nwill be brief as we talk about it this afternoon, is what happens to \nchildren under circumstances that are not of their control. I believe \nwe have to ensure, regardless of what else we do, that children do not \npay for the mistakes or circumstances of their parents. Of the 14 \n\n[[Page S 13645]]\nmillion people on AFDC, 9 million are children. They did not ask to be \nborn into these circumstances. They cannot get their parents out of \nthese circumstances. Most importantly, these 9 million children are \npart of our future.\n  We talk a lot about State flexibility, but the pending bill does not \nallow States to provide any assistance to children after 5 years.\n  What my amendment does is simply say we will not prohibit the States \nfrom providing care for children if they so desire. If ever there was \nan argument for State flexibility, this is it. We are simply giving \nStates the option to assist poor children, clothe children, or help \nchildren to stay off the streets. We are not telling States they have \nto do it; we are simply saying we will not prevent them from doing it.\n  You have heard a lot about making people get out of the cart and pull \nit. That is right. We should make people get out of the cart and pull \nit when they can take responsibility. Able-bodied adults should work. \nBut children, infants, and toddlers cannot be expected to pull the \ncart.\n  This really just gives States the opportunity to recognize that fact. \nThe amendment is very simple. It provides States with flexibility. It \nallows States to use block grant funds to provide vouchers for goods \nand services for children and their needs once the time limit hits, to \nensure that children are protected. I do not understand why Washington \nshould make such a critical decision about what is best for a State \nwhen it comes to children.\n  We have talked about flexibility. We have talked about the need to \nprotect kids. It would seem to me that simply saying we will not \nprohibit the States from issuing vouchers if they choose to do so and \nsee it as in their best interests is reasonable. I think we ought to \nallow them to do that.\n  Once the time limit hits, hopefully families will be off welfare, but \nwe do not know. Maybe yes, maybe no. Children, however, did not cause \nthis situation. Children cannot rectify it.\n  This amendment is pretty harmless, but the ramifications for children \ncould be great if we do not have this State option. Nine million kids--\nit is simply a matter of giving the States the flexibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator seek to call up the amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have an amendment at the desk that I call up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] for Mr. \n     Kennedy, for himself and Mr. Daschle proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2682 to amendment No. 2280.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 40, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4) Non-cash assistance for children.--Nothing in \n     paragraph (1) shall be construed as prohibiting a State from \n     using funds provided under section 403 to provide aid, in the \n     form of in-kind assistance, vouchers usable for particular \n     goods or services as specified by the State, or vendor \n     payments to individuals providing such goods or services, to \n     the minor children of a needy family.''.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say very briefly, maybe I misunderstood. \nWe thought this was part of the agreement. We increased the hardship \nexemption from 15 to 20 percent because this was a request earlier of \nthe Senator from South Dakota. We could not agree on that.\n  We thought we agreed to raise the hardship exemption which would take \ncare of some of these cases. I hope the amendment would not be adopted.\n  We thought we had an agreement, and we want to stick with that \nagreement. Maybe the Senator from South Dakota had a different \ninterpretation, but I am still willing to leave the hardship exemption \nat 20 percent, but if we have an agreement--if not, maybe it ought to \ngo back to 15 percent.\n  In any event, I hope we defeat this amendment and also strike the \namendment of the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Bradley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield back our time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Dakota wish to \noffer his second amendment before the rollcall begins?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that concludes my list of amendments. I \nhave no others to offer.\n\n\n                  Motion to Strike Amendment No. 2496\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that we return to the motion to \nstrike the Bradley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion has been made to return to the \nmotion to strike the Bradley amendment. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to strike the amendment \nnumbered 2496.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask that these be strictly 10-minute votes. We have \nMembers on each side that want to leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A reminder to the Senators that these will be \nstrictly held at 10 minutes for each vote.\n  The question now is on agreeing to the motion to strike the Bradley \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], the \nSenator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. \nNickles], the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], and the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Thomas] are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWyoming [Mr. Thomas] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2526\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be added as a \ncosponsor to Senator Shelby's amendment No. 2526 relating to an \nadoption tax credit which was approved yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                           amendment No. 2568\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support the objective of moving \njust as many adult recipients or potential recipients of welfare into \nwork and self-sufficiency as we possibly can.\n  I have some large questions about some of the specific provisions and \nmethodologies employed in the bill before us, and have supported \namendments designed to increase their effectiveness and fairness. I am \nconcerned that because most of those amendments have failed, in several \nimportant respects the bill will have a punitive effect and will leave \nmany jobless adults without work; without adequate help in preparing to \ncompete for, secure, and keep employment; and therefore with incomes \ninadequate to support themselves and their children. I also am \nconcerned that as we act to have the Federal Government relinquish its \nprimary responsibility for dealing with the needs of impoverished \nfamilies and impose a much greater responsibility in that respect on \nState governments than they previously have borne, we have in several \nkey ways failed to provide the states with adequate resources to meet \ntheir newly expanded responsibilities.\n  Nonetheless, I support the bill's objective of moving Americans from \nwelfare to work, and do not want to weaken the bill's ability to \nproduce that outcome.\n  I regret that the amendment of the Senator from Florida has been \nmischaracterized as weakening the bill's ability to move welfare \nrecipients off the rolls and into work, because that is not its \nintention, nor would that be its effect. The Senator's amendment leaves \nintact the very same work participation standards contained in the \nunderlying Dole bill. It leaves intact the penalties the bill provides \nfor States that fail to meet the standards that apply to them.\n  The amendment simply seeks to treat States more fairly in applying \nwork participation standards than does the underlying bill, in \nrecognition of the fact that the formulas for funding distribution \ncontained in the bill result in considerable variation among the States \nin the amounts of Federal block grant funding per poor minor child the \nStates receive. To achieve that end, the amendment provides for the \nFederal Government to ``adjust the national participation rate \n[standards]'' as they will apply to each State each year so that they \n``reflect the level of federal funds [each] state is receiving * * * \nand the average number of minor children in families having incomes \nbelow the poverty line that are estimated for the state for the fiscal \nyear.''\n  This does not give the Federal Government carte blanche to waive the \nwork participation requirement contained in the bill. This does not \neviscerate that requirement. The requirement remains. The penalty to be \nimposed on a State for failing to meet it still remains. The amendment \nonly injects the ability for some human judgment to be applied in \nsecuring fairness among the States in applying the work participation \nrequirement when the Secretary determines that the funding a State is \nreceiving is not adequate to reasonably permit it to meet the national \nwork participation standards set by the bill. No matter which party \ncontrols the administration at any point, political reality will not \npermit any administration to disregard the strongly evident intent of \nthe Congress that all States be subject to work participation \nrequirements assuming this bill becomes law.\n  I support a strong work requirement. I support providing States with \nsufficient resources to enable them to meet that requirement. And I \nsupport this amendment to let good judgment be reflected in imposition \nof the work requirement on the States.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding, now that we have \ncompleted action on all the amendments, with the exception of the Gramm \namendment No. 2615--there was a motion to table that amendment. It was \n49-49. It was not tabled. I think we have agreed that that vote can \noccur Tuesday.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2683\n\n         (Purpose: To make modifications to amendment No. 2280)\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I am now prepared, if the Democratic leader is prepared, \nthe two of us, to send up the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     No. 2683.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2683) is as follows:\n       On page 17, strike lines 13 through 22 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), a \n     State family assistance grant for any State for a fiscal year \n     is an amount equal to the sum of--\n       ``(i) the total amount of the Federal payments to the State \n     under section 403 (other than Federal payments to the State \n     described in section subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of \n     section 419(a)(2)) for fiscal year 1994 (as such section 403 \n     was in effect during such fiscal year), plus\n       ``(ii) the total amount of the Federal payments to the \n     State under subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) of section \n     419(a)(2),\n\n     as such payments were reported by the State on February 14, \n     1995, reduced by the amount, if any, determined under \n     subparagraph (B), and for fiscal year 2000, reduced by the \n     percent specified under section 418(a)(3), and increased by \n     an amount, if any, determined under paragraph (2)(D).\n       On page 77, line 21, strike the end quotation marks and the \n     second period.\n       One page 77, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 419.

Mr. President, I know there are some of our colleagues that \nwant to make statements this afternoon on that. I would go over that \njust very quickly.\n  I think we agree on the child care, the first provision, with a set-\naside in 1994 of $1 billion. Then we provide an additional $3 billion \nover 5 years for child care to be distributed among the States based on \nthe funds for the title IV-A at-risk child care program.\n  Job training. I will get that agreement, which I think has been \ncleared by the Democratic leader, which will be handled under a \nseparate freestanding agreement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. The contingency grant fund. This is in addition to the loan \nfund. We keep the loan fund at $1.7 billion. The contingency fund is $1 \nbillion over 7 years. Funds must be matched at Medicaid matching rates, \nand States must have maintained their 1994 level on spending on title \nIV-A and IV-F programs.\n  Limited additional funds are available for those States whose base \nyears do not fully reflect subsequent adjustments related to emergency \nassistance. I understand that affects 12 States. I am not certain of \nthe total cost of that provision, but I think around $900 million.\n  The hardship exemption has been increased from 15 percent to 20 \npercent.\n  There is $75 million per year for abstinence education.\n  Program evaluation authorizes $20 million per year for evaluation.\n  Food stamps. We worked out a provision which will save about $1.6 \nbillion. In the food stamp program, the standard deduction for all food \nstamp recipients will be reduced from the original S. 1120. It stages \nfrom its current level of $134 in increments of $2 per year down to \n$124 in fiscal year 2000. This modification will reduce the standard \ndeduction to $132 in fiscal year 1996, as in the original S. 1120, and \nthen immediately down to $124 in 1997, where it remains through fiscal \nyear 2002. CBO gives this change a preliminary savings estimate of $1.1 \nbillion in additional savings.\n  SSI. The SSI provision is the one, $50 million per year for 2 years \nfor treatment, funded under the substance abuse block grant, a matter \nof interest to Senator Cohen and Senator Bingaman.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this \npoint a letter from the National Governors' Association. As the \nDemocratic leader knows, we received letters asking for more child care \nfunding and contingency grant funding and a number of other things.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: As you consider legislation to block \n     grant key welfare and child care programs, we urge you to \n     keep in mind the lessons states have learned over the last \n     decade of experimentation in welfare reform. As Governors we \n     know what it takes to reform the welfare system because we \n     are already doing it in our states--through state waiver \n     initiatives and through implementation of the Family Support \n     Act. Our experience tells us that three elements are crucial: \n     welfare must be temporary and linked to work; both parents \n     must support their children; and child care must be available \n     to enable low income families with children to work.\n       Governors do believe that greater flexibility could aid \n     significantly our efforts to reform the welfare system. We \n     appreciate and support the changes that have been made \n     recently to your bill to ensure that states have the ability \n     to design their own welfare systems. These changes include a \n     state option to count vocational educational training toward \n     welfare-to-work participation rates and the ability to exempt \n     families with very young children from work requirements.\n\n[[Page S 13650]]\n\n       As the Senate considers welfare reform legislation, we \n     believe you should address several remaining key issues:\n       Child Care. Child care represents the largest part of the \n     up-front investment needed for successful welfare reform. We \n     appreciate the flexibility that Title I of S. 1120 provides \n     for states to design child care services for families who are \n     participating in welfare-to-work activities or who have left \n     welfare for work, and the working poor. Further we are \n     pleased that the mandate to provide child care to mothers \n     with children under age six contained in the Senate Finance \n     Committee bill has been removed.\n       We are concerned that unless adequate child care funding \n     continues to be provided at the federal level, the work \n     requirements in the bill could represent a significant \n     unfunded mandate on the states. While Governors differ on the \n     exact level of child care funding needed to implement the\n      work requirements, we all agree that states will need \n     substantially more funding than is currently in your bill.\n       We believe that if the following changes were adopted, the \n     federal-state partnership could be preserved for meeting \n     increased needs due to welfare work requirements and \n     increased child care needs could be minimized:\n       Give states access to a limited amount of additional \n     federal matching fund for child care. These funds would be \n     available to states at the Medicaid match or 70 percent, \n     whichever is higher. Only states that were maintaining their \n     state levels of spending could qualify for these funds to \n     ensure that federal funds do not supplant state spending. \n     Funds would be allocated to states in the same way that At-\n     Risk Child Care funds are currently distributed.\n       To ensure protection for child care funding, fund the Child \n     Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG) as an entitlement to \n     states and eliminate prescriptive earmarks that limit state \n     flexibility in administering programs. Quality set-asides and \n     mandated resource and referral programs detract from states' \n     ability to provide needed child care services. Currently the \n     CCDBG is a discretionary program. The CCDBG is a critical \n     source of funds for child care assistance to poor families, \n     particularly for the working poor, and states will need the \n     assurance that these funds will be available at the level at \n     which the program is authorized.\n       Give states the option of limiting required hours of work \n     to 20 hours per week for families with children under age \n     six. This would allow states to minimize the amount of child \n     care assistance needed by families with young children and \n     would allow states to set work expectations for low income \n     mothers with young children that are consistent with what our \n     society experts of other mothers with young children. The \n     bill approved by the Finance Committee did not require more \n     than 20 hours of work per week; S. 1120, however, mandates 35 \n     hours per week by the year 2000. This is a major factor \n     behind estimates that by the year 2000 states will have to \n     spend several billion dollars annually, above and beyond \n     current spending, to meet the costs of providing child care \n     for welfare recipients.\n       Contingency Grant Fund. Economic downturns can derail \n     welfare reform by sapping state revenues just when need for \n     assistance is rising. The greater flexibility of block grant \n     will allow states in normal economic times to control their \n     own welfare costs through eligibility, benefit and work \n     program decisions. We believe, however, that if a deep \n     economic recession occurs, the need for economic assistance \n     may well overwhelm the fiscal capacity of some states to \n     respond to that need. We urge you to include a contingency \n     grant fund that gives states that experience sharp increases \n     in unemployment access to federal matching grants. \n     Contingency funds would have to be matched at the Medicaid \n     match rates and states would only have access to these grants \n     if they have maintained their own level of state spending.\n       Restrictions on Aid. In the past federal restrictions on \n     eligibility have served to contain federal costs given the \n     open-ended entitlement nature of federal cash assistance \n     funding. Governors believe that such restrictions have no \n     place, however, in a block grant system where federal costs \n     are fixed, regardless of the eligibility and benefit choices \n     made by each state. Accordingly we oppose any provisions that \n     prohibit states from aiding such groups as legal aliens, teen \n     parents, or additional children born to welfare recipients. \n     These decisions are most appropriately made at the state \n     level.\n       Direct Funding to Tribes and Localities. Under current law, \n     federal welfare funds flow through state governments which, \n     in turn, add state matching funds and send the combined state \n     and federal funds to localities, including countries and \n     tribal reservations. S. 1120 would change this system by \n     allowing tribal governments to apply for direct federal \n     assistance, bypassing any state role. In addition, we \n     understand a floor amendment will be offered that would \n     similarly allow counties to bypass the state government. We \n     believe any direct funding to tribes or localities would be a \n     serious mistake. First, by eliminating the state role, it is \n     likely to lead to the end of future state funding to those \n     tribes and localities receiving direct federal funds. Second, \n     in the case of tribal families, it would be very difficult to \n     sort out who is responsible for serving families in areas \n     outside of reservations where tribal and nontribal families \n     live interspersed. Third, direct funding to localities will \n     prevent states from undertaking statewide reforms.\n       State Penalties. As Governors we expect to be held \n     accountable for the use of any federal block grant funds, and \n     are fully committed to repaying any funds that the federal \n     government determines to have been misspent. We are \n     concerned, however, about the punitive nature of the \n     penalties in S. 1120. It goes beyond requiring states to \n     repay any misspent funds by creating a three-tier penalty \n     which 1) requires repayment of misspent funds; 2) imposes a \n     five percent reduction in a state's block grant allotment; \n     and 3) requires states to pay the five percent penalty out of \n     state general revenues rather than through any reduction in \n     program spending. These provisions should be modified.\n       Performance Bonuses. Whether or not final welfare reform \n     legislation includes state penalties, we believe that it \n     should include bonuses for states with exceptional \n     performance. We support the proposal to give states \n     performance bonuses for each recipient they place in work. \n     States that have been successful in putting welfare \n     recipients to work should be rewarded and allowed to use such \n     bonuses for additional investments in child care for the \n     working poor and welfare-to-work programs.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Tommy G. Thompson,\n       State of Wisconsin.\n     Governor Bob Miller,\n       State of Nevada.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Before I yield--if I could get this--I ask as part of the \nunanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to consideration of S. \n143, Calendar No. 153, that it be considered under the following time \nlimitation: The committee-reported amendment be withdrawn, the managers \nbe allowed to offer a substitute amendment; further, that the debate \ntime be limited to a total of 9 hours equally divided between the two \nmanagers, with the only amendments in order to the bill be the \nfollowing first-degree amendments, with no second-degree amendments in \norder, and that each amendment be limited to 45 minutes in the usual \nform.\n  The amendments are: An amendment to strike the repeal of trade \nadjustment assistance; a Specter amendment regarding Job Corps; a \nBreaux amendment regarding dislocated workers; a Jeffords-Pell \namendment regarding adult education; a Dodd amendment regarding \nnational set-asides for migrant workers, dislocated workers, and \nothers; five relevant Kassebaum amendments; and five relevant Kennedy \namendments.\n  This agreement was worked out with my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that the summary of the leadership \namendment, the Dole-Daschle amendment, be printed in the Record. I \nstated just briefly what the summary entails.\n  And there will be a record vote on this amendment; is that right?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Leadership Amendment\n\n\n                             1. Child care\n\n       a. Set aside 1994 Title IV-A child care federal amount \n     (approximately $1 billion) annually to be used for child care \n     as currently provided in bill (as modified by Kassebaum). \n     Allocate based on state's 1994 spending on Title IV-A child \n     care.\n       b. Provide additional $3.0 billion over 5 years for child \n     care. To be distributed among the states based on the funds \n     for the Title IV-A at-risk child care program. To be \n     eligible, state must have maintained 1994 Title IV-A spending \n     on child care. Must match under the medicaid matching \n     formula.\n       c. At state option, single parents with children age 5 and \n     under may not be required to work more than 20 hours per \n     week.\n\n\n                            2.

Hardship Exemption\n\n       Increase current hardship exemption in the bill from 15 \n     percent to 20 percent.\n\n[[Page S 13651]]\n\n\n\n                        5. Abstinence Education\n\n       Increase funding for Title V Block Grant by $75 million per \n     year to be earmarked for abstinence education.\n\n\n                         6. Program Evaluation\n\n       Authorize $20 million per year for evaluation.\n\n\n                             7. Food Stamps\n\n       In the Food Stamp Program, the standard deduction, a \n     deduction from income given to all food stamp recipients, was \n     reduced, in the original S. 1120, in stages from its current \n     level of $134 in increments of $2 per year down to a level of \n     $124 in FY2000. This modification would reduce the standard \n     deduction to $132 in FY1996 (as in the original S. 1120) and \n     then immediately down to $124 in FY1997 where it would remain \n     through FY2002. CBO gives this change a preliminary savings \n     estimate of $1.1 billion in additional savings.\n\n\n                                 8. SSI\n\n       1. All recipients identified with substance abuse problem \n     must be referred for treatment.\n       2. $50 million per year for 2 years (97-98) for treatment. \n     Funded under Substance Abuse Block Grant.\n       3. For the next year, current recipients enrolled with RMAs \n     will continue with RMA.\n       4. Conform age for eligibility to social security \n     retirement age.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me thank the majority leader for his cooperation in \nbringing us to this point. Obviously, this was a matter of a great deal \nof discussion over the last several days, and I think it represents our \nbest effort at attempting to reconcile a number of issues for which \nthere is interest on both sides.\n  Obviously, child care was the most significant. As the distinguished \nleader indicated, this bill provides for $3 billion over 5 years for \nchildcare services to be provided by the States. That is in addition to \nthe $5 billion over the next 5 years that was originally contemplated \nin the original Dole bill as well as the Democratic bill that we voted \nupon earlier.\n  So it represents, in my view, the most significant commitment the \nSenate has made thus far to the realization that there is a very \nimportant investment required in child care if, indeed, we want the \nrecipients of welfare ultimately to find work and to obtain the job \nskills necessary to work.\n  In my view, as many of us have indicated, this is the linchpin to \nmaking welfare work better. Good child care means better participation, \nmeans greater success at what it is we are trying to do. So this is \nreally the key of this amendment as well. Not only is it the key of the \nbill, but it was critical to finding some resolution to the issue. And \nas a result of a good deal of discussion and negotiation on both sides, \nwe have now come to this point.\n  I am very pleased that we can say with some satisfaction that we are \nproviding States with resources that will be critical to their success \nin making welfare work.\n  In addition, of course, we have had a good debate about what ought to \nbe the level of maintenance that will be required of States over the \nnext 5 years, what will be required of them, not just what will the \nFederal Government do, but what will the States do.\n  We offered an amendment for which there was a very close vote in \nrecognition of the need to require States to do a certain level of \nresponsibility. We have agreed that an 80-percent real maintenance of \neffort is something that is prudent and something for which there ought \nto be strong bipartisan support.\n  We also, as we have just indicated with this unanimous-consent \nagreement relating to job training, taken out those segments of the \noriginal Dole bill that would have authorized job training outside of \nthe welfare context.\n  Our view is that it is important for us to find ways to ensure that \npeople who are not on welfare have good job training, people who have \nlost jobs who otherwise would be productive citizens may need to be \nskilled in new jobs. This whole section of the bill is designed to \nprovide opportunities for that to happen. But it is not a welfare \nprogram, so we do not want to give it that welfare connotation.\n  That is really, in essence, what this agreement does. It allows us to \nseparate out job training and provide for the necessary legislation, as \nsoon as we dispose of this bill and the appropriations bills, to return \nto job training and allow us to do that.\n  Fourth, and just as importantly, we recognize that States on many \noccasions will find that the current allotment is not going to work. I \nam very concerned about whether the provisions in this bill will allow \nthat to be addressed adequately. We provide $1 billion over 5 years. I \nrecognize we are working under constraints in resources, but I am \nconcerned that we may have to revisit this issue at some point in the \nfuture. But $1 billion is better than none at all. States have \nindicated they need it. This provides it.\n  So we also, in a bipartisan way, I think, recognize that there will \nbe emergencies, and this fund will allow us to deal with them in a \nmeaningful way.\n  It also provides a change in the time limits that are provided under \nthe exemption. The original Dole bill allowed Governors a 15-percent \nexemption. This raises it to 20 percent. We provide $75 million per \nyear in abstinence education and then, finally, at least $50 million \nover the next 4 years each year for substance abuse treatment. That was \nthe Cohen amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is a good compromise, a good amendment. I hope \nthat it enjoys broad support next Tuesday when we have the opportunity \nto vote on it. I propose we have a little bit of time to revisit the \nissue, maybe 10, 15 minutes on a side prior to the point we vote on \nfinal passage and on this amendment. It is worthy of our support, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides of the aisle who \nbrought us to this point this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to compliment the two leaders for \ntheir leadership in helping to bring about this agreement. I hope \neverybody will support the leadership amendment. Not everybody is \npleased. That is what compromises are all about. But I have to tell \nyou, a lot of people felt when we started this debate that it would \ndrag out for weeks; that there would be no effective resolution; that \nwe could not bring both sides together, because there are too wide \nviewpoints: One side wants more and more for welfare and wants it for \nthe best of reasons. The other side believes balanced budgets are the \nprime effort that we should be taking at this time, because if we do \nnot, the moneys we have will not be worth anything anyway.\n  If we go to $10 trillion in the national debt, who cares what is \ngoing to happen. What happened here because of the two leaders is we \nhave been able to work together and bring together a package that is \ngoing to make a whale of a difference for the whole society. It is a \nsavings package, a compassionate package. In other words, it is a \npackage that points toward a balanced budget in a reasonable period of \ntime by the year 2002.\n  In particular, I want to talk a second or two about our majority \nleader. This has been one of the more difficult problems that I have \nseen on the floor. There are so many varying beliefs, so many varying \ndifficulties in managing this bill. It has taken great patience, great \ntolerance, sometimes pretty tough talk, and an awful lot of leadership \nto bring this bill to this point where next week we are going to pass \nit, one way or the other, and we are going to pass it with this \nleadership amendment.\n  There are a lot of very, very important parts of this bill. You \ncannot really say any one part was the linchpin or the only key part \nthat really made this bill possible. We have had everything ranging \nfrom abstinence education to food stamps to program evaluation to SSI. \nJob training has been set apart, mainly because we know it is a very \nhot issue and a very difficult one to resolve with 150 different job \ntraining programs in the Federal Government. What is being done here is \ntrying to consolidate them to make them work better, more efficiently \nand give the States a little more leeway to be able to solve some of \nthese problems.\n  On child care, let me tell you something, without the effective work \nof the majority leader, that would not have been brought about. He had \nit within his power and was pushed at one time to stop it, to cut out \nadditional \n\n[[Page S 13652]]\n\nfunds for child care above the $5 billion originally in the bill. But \nhe worked with both sides, cajoled both sides, tried to resolve the \nproblems and, ultimately, we have done what really is right here.\n  We provided an additional $3 billion for child care. First of all, we \nset aside the 1994 title IV-A child care Federal amount, which is \napproximately $1 billion, so that it will be used for child care as it \nshould be. That was something that had to be solved. That was an \namendment that I pushed very hard.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kansas displayed a significant--both \nSenators from Kansas, but I am talking about, in this case, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nWithout her, we would not be anywhere near having a child care bill \nthat is the integral part of this bill. She has done a terrific job, \nalong with Senator Snowe from Maine, and others, that I would like to \nmention, but for want of time will not.\n  I have to compliment the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. These Senators \nwanted more money. They wanted to do more in this area, but they also \nhad to recognize that there is a limit, that there are not the moneys \nthere and that it is really wrong, basically and fundamentally wrong, \nto promise to the American people, especially those single heads of \nhousehold who depend on child care, that there is going to be another \n$10 billion of child care there, when we are only talking about an \nauthorization and there is no way to get that kind of money. It would \nhave sent out a signal and sent out a message and would have \ndemoralized a lot of people.\n  What happened is we brought it all together under the leadership of \nSenator Dole. I have to say to my good friend from South Dakota as \nwell, the distinguished minority leader, what a tremendous job these \ntwo leaders have done. As usual, the majority leader has consistently \ntaken these tough, hard issues day after day, week after week, \nsometimes having more trouble on our side, but always having plenty of \nchallenge on the other side and getting it done.\n  In this case, I just cannot compliment these two leaders enough. I \nwould feel badly leaving here today without at least expressing my \nfondness and my regard for them and their leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me also commend and congratulate the \nSenator from Utah, Senator Hatch, because we were in some very tense \ndiscussions yesterday.\n And we have tense discussions around here from time to time. It was \nover how do we do the right thing and still save enough money and \nchange the system. I think we ended up right on track in all three \nareas. Much of it was due to the efforts of Senator Hatch working with \nSenators on the other side and working with a number on this side of \nthe aisle and working with the majority leader. I, in turn, went to the \nDemocratic leader, and we were able to come together after a little \nmisunderstanding late in the afternoon about whether it was $2 or $3 \nbillion.\n\n  In any event, we have now accomplished that, and I think we will have \na little debate on Tuesday before the vote. I hope that the two leaders \nwill have 5 minutes each so we can make a closing statement on the \nbill.\n  I would expect broad bipartisan support. We have had 95 hours, I \nthink, on this bill, and 38 votes, tough votes. There were a lot of \nvotes today. In fact, there were 10 today. I think we have had a good \ndebate. Everybody has had an opportunity to express their views. I \nbelieve when a final vote is taken, there will be a strong bipartisan \nsupport for changing welfare as we know it, giving power back to the \nStates. I think that is a big step in the right direction.\n  There are a number of amendments that have been cleared, and I will \noffer those at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside amendment No. 2683 \nso that I may offer these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\nAmendments Nos. 2552; 2567; 2499; 2580, As Modified; 2585, As Modified; \n                   2544; 2486, As Modified; and 2684\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to consider and \nadopt the following amendments, en bloc, that any amendment be \nconsidered as modified where noted with the modifications I send to the \ndesk, and that any statements accompanying these amendments be inserted \nat the appropriate place in the Record as if read.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreconvenes at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday--and we will be here Monday, but \nthis is after the policy lunch Tuesday--the Senate proceed to 30 \nminutes of debate to be equally divided in the usual form, to be \nfollowed immediately by a vote on the Gramm amendment No. 2615, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the Dole modification, to be followed by adoption \nof the Dole amendment No. 2280, third reading and final passage of H.R. \n4, as amended, with 2 minutes for debate between the second and third \nvotes, to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. For the information of all Senators, at 2:15 p.m., there \nwill be 30 minutes for debate, under the control of the leaders or \ntheir designees, for wrap-up statements with respect to the welfare \nbill, and then the Senate will proceed to three back-to-back votes on \nthe Gramm amendment No. 2615, the Dole modification, and final passage \nof H.R. 4.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, just for the \ninformation of Senators, is it still the majority leader's intention to \nbring up the Agriculture appropriations bill on Monday?\n  Mr. DOLE. If there is no objection, we would like to proceed to that. \nIn fact, I think I have it here. At the hour of 10 a.m. we will proceed \nto calendar No. 186, H.R. 1976, the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The unanimous-consent agreement does include a reference \nto when votes will take place?\n  Mr. DOLE. Not prior to the hour of 5:15.\n  Again, candidly, I know some of our Senators have official business \non Monday. So we are trying to accommodate their wishes. We are also \ntrying to finish that bill by Tuesday. I have talked to Senator \nCochran, the committee chairman. He believes it can be done. There is \none particular amendment that will take 2 hours of debate on Tuesday \nmorning, concerning chickens, chilled chickens. It is a matter \ninvolving three different States. Kansas is not one of them. It will be \ninteresting.\n  I hope we can complete action on that following final action on the \nwelfare bill. We had hoped to go to the State, Justice, Commerce \nDepartment appropriations bill today. I do not believe we can do that \nnow. I assume we will take that up following the Agriculture bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13636-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

This outrageous debt--\nwhich will be passed on to our children and grandchildren--averages out \nto $18,861.66 for every man, woman and child in America.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13653-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13653-S13654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       COMMENDING OSEOLA McCARTY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a Mississippi woman \nwho is a role model for all Americans, Ms. \n\n[[Page S 13654]]\n\nOseola McCarty. Ms. McCarty, of Hattiesburg, has spent her life as a \nlaundress. Due to her compassionate nature, she quit school in the \nsixth grade to take care of her ill aunt who was unable to take care of \nherself. At that time she began to wash and iron clothes for people in \nthe Hattiesburg community and began to put money in the bank, dollar by \ndollar. But she was not thinking of herself. She only took one vacation \nas a young woman to Niagara Falls and, despite the heat of summer in \nMississippi, she just recently purchased a window air-conditioning unit \nfor the home she has lived in for most of her life. She only made the \npurchase at the insistence of her friends at the bank.\n  She is no longer able to iron clothes due to her arthritis, but she \nhas given the University of Southern Mississippi $150,000 in order to \nset up a scholarship for needy black students in her name so someone \nwill have the education she had to give up. She made the statement, ``I \njust want it to go to someone who will appreciate it and learn. I'm old \nand I'm not going to live always.'' She gave 60 percent of her savings \nto the university near her home. The business community in Hattiesburg \nis overwhelmed with her generosity and has come together to match her \ndonation. Ms. Oseola McCarty has been recognized by local and national \nmedia alike, and I am proud to have this opportunity to share this \nremarkable story of generosity with everyone here today.\n  Not only should we commend Ms. McCarty, but also her community. At \nthis time of budget cuts and welfare reform, we should use the people \nof Hattiesburg as a model for our future.

Mr. President, I rise today both to congratulate the \nClinton administration for having taken the lead in the search for \npeace in the former Yugoslavia and, at the same time, to offer words of \ncaution, even warning.\n  Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin once wrote. ``There never was a good \nwar or a bad peace.'' These sentiments are indeed seductive, for no one \nwho has seen the carnage of war could wish for anything more fervently \nthan an end to the bloodletting.\n  Yet, for all his wisdom, Franklin was ultimately wrong. There are \ngood wars. The American Revolution that gave birth to our country was \nbut one example. And there are bad peace settlements. Most historians \nagree that the Versailles Treaty that ended World War I was fatally \nflawed and was one of the fundamental causes of World War II.\n  The point obviously is that a good, sensible peace settlement that \neliminates the root causes of conflict--or at least ameliorates the \nworst injustices--can prevent future war.\n  Conversely, a peace settlement unduly influenced by important, but \nsecondary considerations such as perceived world opinion, a passionate \nyearning for an end to hostilities, or deference to sensibilities of \nallies or even enemies, all at the expense of hard realities, will only \ntemporarily halt the fighting and postpone the attainment of a lasting \npeace.\n  Mr. President, it is profoundly unfortunate that for more than 4 \nyears, two administrations abdicated this country's leadership in \nsolving Europe's bloodiest crisis since 1945.\n  The dismal series of broken promises, aborted cease-fires, and \nongoing atrocities in the former Yugoslavia attests to the stark fact \nthat unless the United States takes the lead, no foreign and security \nproblem will be solved in Europe. I do not say this to brag; this is a \nsimple fact echoed by many Europeans.\n  So I applaud President Clinton for having broken the Balkan logjam \nthis summer through an energetic combination of military action and \ndiplomacy.\n  Let us recall, however, that in this effort we have paid a grievous \nprice. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of three \nimmensely talented and patriotic Americans--Joseph Kruzel, Robert \nFrasure, and Nelson Drew--who last month gave their lives on the Mount \nIgman Road near Sarajevo in the pursuit of peace.\n  And now, thanks to the efforts of these men, and to the labors of \nAssistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke and his new team, we are \non the brink of another Bosnian cease-fire. This one is being praised:\n  For having secured a promised withdrawal of Bosnian Serb heavy \nweapons around Sarajevo and for opening land and air routes into the \ncity--in return for a halt in the NATO bombing campaign.\n  For thereby having prevented a split in the Atlantic Alliance that \nreportedly was developing because of the bombing campaign.\n  For having put a stop to a potentially dangerous confrontation with \nRussia.\n  For allowing a framework for a peace settlement to be fleshed out.\n  And yet, Mr. President, despite the apparent merits of this agreement \nand of the peace framework, I am worried.\n  I am worried precisely because I fear that too much attention has \nbeen given to secondary considerations at the expense of primary ones.\n  I am worried because fundamental principles appear to have been \nsacrificed for short-term gain.\n  In other words, I am worried that we may be seeing the beginnings of \nwhat Benjamin Franklin could not envisage--a bad peace that will \ninevitably lead to another bad war.\n  More specifically, I am worried that Assistant Secretary Holbrooke \nhas misjudged the character of the Serbian strongman Milosevic and has \nunnecessarily and unwisely involved, or even considered involving, \nRussian troops in the most delicate aspect of the proposed agreement.\n  Finally, I fear that the administration has seriously overestimated \nthe willingness of this Congress to support the emerging settlement \nwith massive development aid and the commitment of American troops to \nthe former Yugoslavia as peacekeepers.\n  The joint statement issued on September 8, in Geneva, despite \nvigorous denials by Assistant Secretary Holbrooke, manifestly abandons \nthe ideal of a multiethnic, multireligious, democratic Bosnia.\n  Instead, the so-called Republika Srpska, of Karadzic and Mladic--two \nindicted war criminals--is accorded status equal to the legitimate \nGovernment of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose territory \nmust be divided between the Pale Serbs and the Moslem-Croat federation. \nThis, Mr. President, is a huge concession.\n  And what is gotten in return? The Bosnian Serbs agree to only 49 \npercent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This acceptance has \nbeen trumpeted as a major concession on their part, usually described \nas sacrificing one-third of the territory they currently occupy.\n  In actuality, however, it has been weeks since the Bosnian Serbs have \ncontrolled 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the persistence \nof the media in erroneously describing it as such.\n  At the time of the Geneva signing they controlled perhaps 62 percent; \nthis week they lost another 6 or 7 percent.\n  In short, Mr. President, the military fortunes of the Bosnian Serbs \nhave been on the wane. The NATO bombing campaign has contributed \nmarginally to their difficulties by disrupting their communications, \nbut the Bosnian Serbs' problems run much deeper.\n  The Serbs' capture of the supposedly safe U.N. areas of Srebrenica \nand Zepa in July was actually a desperate gamble by General Mladic and \nhis Serbian patron Milosevic to halt their military reverses. The \nBosnian Serb Army is outmanned and is plagued by rapidly sinking \nmorale. In the west and north it has lost is allies with the ouster of \nthe Krajina Serbs by the Croatian Army.\n  The Bosnian Serb Army retains a strong base in Eastern Bosnia and, of \ncourse, the capability to indulge in its favorite maneuver, lobbing \nartillery and mortar shells at defenseless civilians, as shown by the \nlatest massacre in the Sarajevo market.\n  So it is highly probable that within the near future the situation on \nthe ground would have dictated a willingness of the Bosnian Serbs to \nsue for \n\n[[Page S 13655]]\n\npeace--without our offering the formal recognition which they have \ncraved for so long.\n  Now we face the prospect of a recognized, ethnically cleansed Bosnian \nSerb entity in a shotgun marriage with the part of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina that is struggling to maintain the ideals of multiethnic \ntolerance and compromise. Can one blame the citizens of Sarajevo, \nMoslems, Croats, Serbs, Jews, and other nationalities, for feeling \nbetrayed?\n  What is the lesson that other potential ethnic cleansers will learn \nfrom this carve-up?\n  Assistant Secretary Holbrooke was quoted in the New York Times as \nworrying about the implementation of the details of this strange and \ncontradictory government structure. And well he should worry. But it is \nthe violence done to fundamental principles of decency and democracy \nthat is the real tragedy, not how the mugging is accomplished.\n  In conceiving both the peace framework and the latest cease-fire, \nAssistant Secretary Holbrooke has relied on Milosevic to deliver. \nAccording to the same New York Times article, Mr. Holbrooke praised the \nSerbian strongman as a peacemaker.\n  Mr. Holbrooke is, of course, entitled to his opinion, which is no \ndoubt well-informed. However, I also have dealt personally with Mr. \nMilosevic, and I much prefer the portrayal of him given by our former \nAmbassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman: A habitual liar who \ncondoned and organized unspeakable atrocities.\n  Mr. President, these are not just harmless differences of opinion. \nRather, they impact directly on the chances for the cease-fire and the \npeace settlement succeeding.\n  Because I consider Milosevic to be a liar and a war criminal, I am \nnot at all surprised that he has continued to support the Bosnian Serbs \nwith weapons, training, and vital infrastructural assistance--even \nduring the NATO bombing campaign of the last 2 weeks--all the while \nassuring us that he has abandoned Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs in \nPale.\n  I would ask, what is the next step? Are we to reward Milosevic's \nbrazen duplicity with further sanctions of relief for Serbia?\n  Assistant Secretary Holbrooke was quoted as saying that we did not \nsell out the Bosnian Moslems. ``They wanted this agreement,'' he \nassured the New York Times. ``They knew this was a good deal.''\n  Well, I hope so, but pardon my skepticism. Other than having to \nabandon their ideal of a unitary, multiethnic State, the Moslem-led \nBosnian Government has had to put up with criticism this past week for \nhaving had the nerve to launch an offensive with their Bosnian Croat \nallies to try to liberate parts of western Bosnia that were ethnically \ncleansed of Moslems and Croats in 1992.\n  And we certainly do not want to offend the Russians. These are the \npeople who this week accused NATO of genocide for its bombing campaign \nspecifically targeted to avoid civilian areas, even when it meant \nsparing legitimate military targets.\n  Other than desecrating the memory of millions of people who really \ndid die as a result of genocide, the Russians with their apoplectic \nrhetoric and big lie techniques make even the most well-disposed \nAmerican wonder if much has changed since the bad, old days of Soviet \nrule in the Kremlin.\n  So what do we do? If one is to believe press reports, we contemplate \na deal that puts Russian forces around Sarajevo to enforce the \nwithdrawal of the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons.\n  This would be a master stroke! We would now put the fate of the long-\nsuffering citizens of the Bosnian capital in the hands of people for \nwhom Bosnian Serb war crimes are allegedly part of a people's struggle \nfor existence.\n  Suppose, just suppose, that the unthinkable happens and the Bosnian \nSerbs cheat on the deal and the Russians back them up. Now instead of \nhaving the option of resuming the bombing of the Bosnian Serbs, we \nwould have to worry about hitting Russian soldiers.\n  Mr. President, this reported part of the deal is so incredible that \nat first I could only believe that it was some sort of a trial balloon. \nThis morning the White House told my staff that it may have been a \ndeliberate piece of disinformation by the Russians. I hope so, because \nthe idea is a nonstarter.\n  What is the role of Congress in this peace process? In order to \ncement the bargain the Congress apparently will be asked to pony up \nhalf-a-billion dollars as a downpayment on an even larger aid package \nto follow.\n  And, as the final stroke, we will be asked to send American soldiers \nto Bosnia and Herzegovina as apartheid cops to enforce the destruction \nof the unitary, multiethnic State.\n  Well this Senator is frankly revolted at the whole thing. Will we be \nasked to bankroll the fiefdom of the war criminals Mladic and Karadzic \nwho orchestrated vile ethnic cleansing, mass rapes, and mass murder all \nacross Bosnia?\n  Moreover, now that our pilots have bombed the Bosnian Serbs--as they \nrightfully have done--does anyone seriously think that Americans would \nbe treated by the Bosnian Serbs as just any old neutral peacekeepers?\n  Mr. President, I realize that Mr. Holbrooke and his team have worked \nlong and hard and in good faith. I also understand that we are \ndescribing work in progress.\n  But let these concerns that I have raised today be viewed \nunambiguously as a shot across the bow of the administration's Bosnian \npeace flotilla: Do not come to Congress with a bad peace to end a bad \nwar.\n  It has not worked in the past. It cannot work in the future. And \nCongress, I am confident, will not approve it this time.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13654-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13655-S13656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE STAFF REPORT ON TURKEY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, during the August recess two members of the \nForeign Relations Committee minority staff traveled to Turkey at my \ndirection to assess a range of issues related to United States-Turkish \nbilateral relations. Turkey, one of the largest recipients of United \nStates military assistance, is an important United States ally in a \ndangerous and unstable region. It is therefore, incumbent upon us to \ntake a close look at what is occurring in Turkey--the threats to its \nsecurity, its political struggles, and its human rights situation. In \nparticular, I asked my staff to focus on Turkey's Kurdish problem, \nwhich has broad implications for regional stability, as well as \nTurkey's relations with the West.\n  Among the staff's findings is that the Kurdistan Workers' Party [PKK] \nposes a grave threat not only to Turkey, but to regional stability as \nwell. At the same time, the Government of Turkey is unable--or \nunwilling--to distinguish the genuine threat posed by the PKK from the \nlegitimate rights and aspirations of the Kurdish people. Turkey is \nresponding with a heavy-handed, indiscriminate military campaign \nagainst the Kurds, even as it shuts off opportunities for nonviolent, \nKurdish political expression. Consequently, Turkey may be fomenting, \nrather than preventing Kurdish separatism.\n  I believe this report makes an important contribution to the \nCongress' consideration of the United States approach toward Turkey. I \nask unanimous consent that the ``Summary of Key Findings'' be placed \ninto the Record at this point, and would commend the full report, which \nis a available at the Foreign Relations Committee office, to my \ncolleagues' attention.\n                        Summary of Key Findings\n\n       Turkey, which places a high priority on good relations with \n     the West in general and the United States in particular, is \n     an important U.S. ally in a dangerous and unstable \n     neighborhood: Three of its immediate neighbors--Iran, Iraq, \n     and Syria--are on the U.S. list of state sponsors of \n     terrorism; it is engaged in an economic and political \n     competition with Russia for influence in and access to the \n     resources of Central Asia and the Caucasus; there is ongoing \n     conflict to Turkey's north--in Georgia and between Armenia \n     and Azerbaijan. Turkey is not, however, a disinterested in \n     neutral party, it is openly sympathetic to Azerbaijan's \n     position, and although it has opened an air corridor to \n     Armenia, Turkey maintains a road and rail blockade; it \n     continues to spar with Greece over Cyprus and other issues, \n     in particular, a dispute over maritime boundaries in the wake \n     of Greece's ratification of the Law of the Sea treaty \n     threatens to bring Turkey and Greece into outright conflict.\n       The Kirdistan Workers' Party (PKK) poses a grave threat not \n     only to Turkey, but to regional stability as well. The PKK--\n     which employs deadly terrorist tactics against innocent \n     noncombatants in Turkey and \n\n[[Page S 13656]]\n\n     against innocent civilians elsewhere in the Middle East and \n     Europe--bears direct responsibility for much of the tensions \n     in southeast Turkey and for prompting the recent Turkish \n     invasions of Iraq.\n       Operation Provide Comfort, the allied humanitarian and \n     security operation in Northern Iraq, is a critical element of \n     U.S. and Western strategies with regard to Iraq, and may be \n     the only thing preventing tens of thousands of Kurds from \n     pouring into southeastern Turkey. Although some Turkish \n     officials recognize these facts and military officials at \n     Incirlik have provided splendid cooperation to their British, \n     French and American counterparts, other Turkish military and \n     political officials (including parliamentarians) argue that \n     Provide Comfort offers the PKK protection and cover in \n     Northern Iraq. This rather schizophrenic view of Provide \n     Comfort makes Turkey appear a relucant participant in the \n     allied effort, which Turkey has exploited to its advantage in \n     dealings with its allies.\n       In keeping with traditions established during the days of \n     Mustafa Kemal Attaturk, Turkey has an almost paranoid fear of \n     losing its Turkish identity. The government of Turkey \n     accordingly is unable--or unwilling--to distinguish the \n     genuine threat posed by the PKK from the legitimate rights \n     and aspirations of the Kurdish people. As a result, Turkey \n     refuses to engage in a political dialogue with nonviolent \n     Kurdish representatives, and is executing a heavy-handed, \n     indiscriminate military campaign to eradicate what it views \n     as a monolithic threat to the unity of the country.\n       The city of Diyarbakir, which symbolizes the ethnic \n     difficulties that persist within Turkey, has become a haven \n     for rural Kurds forced to evacuate neighboring towns and \n     villages destroyed by the Turkish military. By some \n     estimates, the city's population has grown from roughly \n     300,000 to more than 1,500,000 during the past five years. \n     Although Turkish officials, local residents, and some \n     independent observers suggest that tensions have subsided \n     during the past two years, it is evident that any existing \n     calm is tenuous and the result of Turkey's overwhelming--and \n     at times oppressive--security presence, which has exacted a \n     high cost in terms of human rights violations.\n       Turkey's government refuses even to acknowledge that there \n     is a ``Kurdish problem,'' and thereby is ignoring the real \n     issue. By equating all Kurdish aspirations with the terrorist \n     designs of the PKK, Turkey effectively has eliminated outlets \n     for nonviolent Kurdish political or cultural expression. As a \n     consequence, Turkey unintentionally may be contributing to \n     the PKK's appeal.\n       Turkey desperately wants to join the European Union's \n     Customs Union, and is making some effort to meet the European \n     Parliament's minimum demands regarding democratization and \n     human rights in order to achieve membership. It may even make \n     some modifications to Article 8 of the Anti-Terror law (which \n     prohibits the advocacy of separatism). Turkey will not, \n     however, take any action which it perceive as comprising the \n     Turkish identity, so there are limits to the amount of \n     genuine change it will make to gain membership in the Customs \n     Union. It is equally unclear that the West would have much \n     impact on Turkish behavior by withholding benefits such as \n     Customs Union membership.\n       Despite claims that it regards fundamentalism as a threat \n     to its secular heritage, the government of Turkey appears to \n     be encouraging and even sponsoring Islamic activities in an \n     attempt to bind the country together and defuse separaist \n     sentiment. Such a strategy--which parallels efforts of \n     governments in the Near East seeking to counter radical \n     lefist groups during the 1970s and early 1980s--could \n     backfire and inadvertently provide a foothold for Islamic \n     extremists.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13655-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       1441.

The crime epidemic sweeping across our country--\ngrowing with each passing year--can be attributed, \n\n[[Page S 13657]]\n\nin significant part, to the steady increase in serious and violent \ncrimes committed by juveniles.\n  Between 1988 and 1992, juvenile arrests for violent crimes increased \nby 47 percent, while adult violent crime arrests increased by 19 \npercent. Specifically, juvenile murders increased 26 percent, forcible \nrapes increased 41 percent, robberies increased 39 percent, and \naggravated assaults increased 27 percent. These statistics are \nalarming. But in order for Congress to provide a real solution, it must \nfirst understand the nature of the problem. Until that occurs, \nlegislative initiatives coming out of both Houses of Congress will \ncontinue to miss the mark.\n  Just last year, Congress passed the Omnibus Violent Crime Control and \nLaw Enforcement Act, a bill intended to control crime. Although the \nbill contained some provisions directed at youth violence, they were \namendments to the Federal criminal code. The reality is that a very \nsmall number of juveniles are tried in Federal proceedings. In 1990, \nthere were 197 such proceedings; in 1991, 166; in 1992, 109; in 1993, \n64; and in 1994, 92. Therein lies the major weakness in the 1994 crime \nbill. Any amendments strengthening the federal criminal code regarding \njuveniles are limited to those offenders, a minute number, who happen \nto find themselves in federal juvenile proceedings. If the goal is to \nreduce juvenile crime, then fundamental changes must occur at the state \nlevel. This is because States and local governments handle the vast \nmajority of juvenile offenders.\n  The problem of juvenile violence is occurring everywhere in the \nUnited States.\n  In Rockland, MA, four teenagers beat a man to death with a baseball \nbat and bottle while he was waiting for his girlfriend. The assault \nfollowed the death of two men who were shot by a teenager for a leather \njacket.\n  In Jacksonville, FL, when the victim could find only $5 in his pocket \nto appease the two 16 year olds robbing him in 1994, he asked: ``You're \nnot going to shoot me over $5, are you?'' They did, and he died.\n  In St. Louis, MO, two female college students were out on a weekend \nnight when they were abducted by two suspects, ages 16 and 19. The lone \nsurvivor was raped, shot in the face three times, and abandoned. The \nother, Melissa Aptman, who pleaded with the teenagers not to hurt them, \nwas shot and killed. Both suspects had previous criminal records. In \nfact, the 16 year old was on probation at the time of the abduction.\n  In Washington, DC, 11 blocks from the Capitol, a 14 year old stopped \na young man during rush hour who he thought had stolen his jacket a few \ndays before. He whipped out a pistol and blazed away. One bullet killed \na father of two. The teenager got the maximum sentence: 2 years in the \nDistrict of Columbia detention center.\n  In Detroit, MI, six teenagers decided to carjack a motorist by \ndragging a tree across a road. When the driver tried to run their \nblockade, one of the thugs shot him dead. The gunman, a 16 year old, \nwas sentenced as a juvenile, and, unless the prosecutor's wins an \nappeal, he will go free at 21. The judge was quoted as saying, ``I'm \nnot concerned about whether or not this makes anybody safer.''\n  Law and order in our neighborhood communities have yielded to crime \nand disorder. For its part, the current juvenile justice system \nreprimands the crime victim for being at the wrong place at the wrong \ntime, and then turns around and hugs the young criminal, whispering \never so softly into his ear, ``Don't worry, the State will protect \nyou.'' The critical question facing us Americans, as asked by the late \nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, is: ``Are we to stand idly by while \nfierce young hoodlums--too often and too long harbored under the glossy \nmisnomer of juvenile delinquents--roam our streets and desecrate our \ncommunities?'' We cannot afford to stand idly by, not when the homicide \nrate committed by teens ages 14-17 has more than doubled, increasing \n165 percent from 1985 to 1993; not when juvenile arrests for weapons \nlaw violations increased 117 percent between 1983 and 1992; not when \none out of every 13 juveniles reported being a victim of a violent \ncrime in 1992; and not when the number of juvenile violent crime \narrests is expected to double by the year 2010. We must challenge this \nculture of violence and restore the culture of personal responsibility.\n  Having examined the juvenile justice system, having analyzed the \nefficacy of different philosophical approaches, having had \nconversations with representatives from school districts, law \nenforcement, and citizens' organizations, I have devised a \ncomprehensive approach that will control violent juvenile crime by \nencouraging States to enact sweeping reforms. This legislation provides \nFederal funds to States and local governments to assist them in \nreforming their juvenile justice systems. The bill identifies violent \nand hard-core criminals, imposes stiffer penalties, and deters crimes.\n  First, serious, violent, and chronic juvenile offenders would be held \naccountable.\n  The juvenile justice system's primary goal is to rehabilitate the \njuvenile offender. Such a system can handle runaways or school truants, \nbut is ill-equipped to deal with chronic, serious offenders. Even the \nNational Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, a membership \norganization for juvenile justice professionals, is hard-pressed to \nadmit: Rehabilitation has been remarkably successful for most juvenile \noffenders. It has not been successful for the small number of chronic \nand serious offenders. For them, strict accountability appears \nnecessary. Studies have found that a small percentage of juveniles are \nresponsible for the vast majority of serious offenses committed by \njuveniles. The bill identifies this group of juvenile offenders.\n  Traditionally, the juvenile court judge decides whether to transfer a \njuvenile to adult criminal court. In making this decision, the juvenile \njudge has broad discretion. Thus, the judge is able to abuse his \ndiscretion. The bill would replace the subjectivity of the juvenile \ncourt judge with the objectivity of the seriousness of the crime \ncommitted and the age of the offender. The bill would encourage States \nto prosecute juveniles, age 14 and older, who commit: First, murder; \nsecond attempted murder; third, forcible rape, fourth, serious drug \noffenses--as defined by Federal law, or fifth, serious offenses while \narmed with a dangerous or deadly weapon, namely, robbery, assault and \nbattery. Such a system is not a radical idea. In fact, more than 25 \nStates legislatively exclude certain serious offenses from the juvenile \ncourt's jurisdiction. Those States include Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, \nand Maryland. Moreover, the automatic referral of certain serious cases \nto the criminal justice system will free up limited resources in the \njuvenile court system.\n   The criminal justice system, not the juvenile justice system, can \nemphasize that adult criminal acts have real consequences. The purpose \nof the criminal justice system is to punish, that is, to hold \ndefendants accountable. Studies show repeatedly that punishment reduces \nboth frequency and seriousness of offenses by young criminals and is \nmost effective when it is consistently imposed for every offense, \naccording to University of Southern California psychologist Sarnoff \nMednick. Therefore, since research studies have confirmed that criminal \npunishment of young offenders will reduce further criminal activity, \nthen serious offenders should face adult prosecution.\n  In addition, the bill contains what I like to refer to as the \n``three-strikes-and-you're-out'' provision for chronic offenders. It \nprovides that juveniles, who have two prior felony adjudications, will \nbe subject to transfer to adult criminal court on their third, \nsubsequent charge for a felony offense. A 1988 study on the court \ncareers of juvenile offenders found that juveniles referred to juvenile \ncourt for a second time before age 15 are likely to continue their law-\nviolating behavior. The study further found that juveniles who \ncommitted a violent offense were the most likely to return to court \ncharged with a subsequent violent offense. The legislative proposal \ndraws from these findings. The bill seeks to intervene early in the \nlives of the hardened career criminal and places them in the criminal \njustice system.\n  Second, States would create and maintain juvenile criminal records.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, in the 1967 landmark decision, In re Gault, \nsaid: ``The summary procedures of juvenile courts are sometimes \ndefended by a statement that it is the law's policy to hide youthful \nerrors from the full gaze \n\n[[Page S 13658]]\n\nof the public and bury them in the graveyard of the forgotten past. \nThis claim of secrecy, however, is more rhetoric than reality.'' In \nother words, in rhetoric we are protecting juveniles from the stigma of \na record but in reality we are coddling criminals. We must divorce the \nrhetoric from reality by lifting the veil of secrecy. The bill \nencourages States to create and maintain records on juveniles, age 14 \nand older, for offenses that if committed by an adult would be \nclassified as a felony. And, juveniles under age 14 adjudicated \ndelinquent of any of the enumerated crimes I mentioned earlier will \nhave their conviction recorded and made available to necessary parties. \nThe bill would also encourage States to transmit juvenile criminal \nrecords to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for inclusion in the \ncriminal identification database. That way, when young criminals and \ngangs move from State to State, their records will follow them. The \njuvenile records would be made available to law enforcement agencies, \nschool officials, and judges.\n  Third, juvenile criminal records would be made available to adult \ncourts for purposes of adult sentencing.\n  According to the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional \nFacilities, nearly 40 percent of prison inmates had a prior record as a \njuvenile. That is approximately four in 10 prison inmates. The \nsignificance of this statistical information is illustrated in \nArmstrong Williams' book ``Beyond Blame'' in which he writes about the \nreal-life experience of a 29-year-old former drug dealer named ``Brad \nHoward.'' Mr. Williams gives a vivid description of how society suffers \nthe consequences when the criminal justice system fails to hold \ncriminals accountable:\n\n       Brad, staring at a sentence of thirty to sixty years in \n     prison for violating Federal drug trafficking laws, used his \n     drug money and the help of his parents to hire a good lawyer. \n     He was able to beat the charge. The judge, Brad explains, \n     looked favorably on his story to such an extent that even \n     Brad is surprised that he got off. Obviously, the judge \n     thought that Brad was just another young man who \n     inadvertently ended up on the wrong end of the system--\n     probably for lack of real opportunity. In a sense, you can't \n     blame the judge. Brad did not have a criminal record as an \n     adult, since his youthful encounters with the law were hidden \n     from the legal system under rules that prevent juvenile \n     criminal history from being reopened once the person turns \n     eighteen. . . . After the trial was over, Brad returned to \n     the streets.\n\n  This is a typical problem with many State statutes that seal juvenile \ncriminal records. Our laws view juveniles through the prism of kids \ngone astray. When in fact those juveniles who commit serious and \nviolent crimes are criminals who happen to be young. Young criminals \nknow what Brad Howard knew in his former life as a street hustler--that \nthey can commit crimes repeatedly as juveniles because their juvenile \nrecords are kept hidden under the veil of secrecy. These young \ncriminals know that when they reach 18 years of age they can begin \ntheir second career as adult criminals with an unblemished criminal \nrecord. The time has come to discard the anachronistic idea that \ncrimes, no matter how heinous, by juveniles must be kept confidential. \nUnder the bill introduced today, the Brad Howards in this nation would \nbe held accountable for their criminal acts. The Brad Howards would be \nheld accountable in their juvenile years because they would be tried as \nadults for selling illicit drugs. The Brad Howards would be held \naccountable in their adult years because their previous juvenile court \nrecords would be made available to State and Federal courts at adult \nsentencing. No longer will the Brad Howards of this country be able to \nact like neophytes to the criminal justice system. Our message will be \nclear, cogent, and convincing: Serious acts have serious consequences.\n  Fourth, school officials would have access to juvenile criminal \nrecords.\n  This past spring, I received a letter from a seventh grader who wrote \n``Sometimes I wonder what people think crime really is. It's much worse \nthan that. My definition is bringing drugs and guns to school so that \nother classmates wake up with the question: Will I be safe today?''\n  Following receipt of this letter, I met with school officials to \ndiscuss school violence. A school teacher recalled an actual incident \nin which a student came to school with an electronic ankle bracelet and \nno one had any knowledge of what that a student had done and, more \nimportant, no way of finding out.\n   Students and teachers spend the greater part of their day at school. \nStudents and teachers have a right to a safe, educational environment. \nYet students are challenged to learn in an environment in which \nchronically violent students roam the halls terrorizing them during \nclass exchange periods and after school. Teachers are challenged to \ncarry out their duties and responsibilities in a seriously disruptive \nwork environment. Under my bill, school officials would have access to \njuvenile criminal records to assist them in looking out for the best \ninterests of all students. If schools know the identity of a violent \njuvenile, they can respond to misbehaviors by imposing stricter \nsanctions, assigning particular teachers, or having the student's \nlocker near a teacher's doorway entrance so that the teacher can \nmonitor his conduct during the changing of class periods. In short, \nthis bill would allow schools to take measures to prevent violence.\n  Fifth, the sharing of juvenile records would assist law enforcement \nAgencies.\n  The bill would assist law enforcement agencies in criminal \ninvestigations and apprehension. It encourages States to share juvenile \nrecord information within their subdivisions and with other States. \nWhile visiting with several law enforcement officers I heard the same \nrecurring problem--when police officers arrest juveniles they have no \nidea with whom they are handling because the records are kept \nconfidential. This veil of secrecy undermines law enforcement efforts. \nLaw enforcement agencies need to know the prior records of individuals \nwho are subsequently arrested. Under the bill, if a juvenile is \narrested, the police will be able to access other state criminal \nhistory records. With more information, law enforcement officials will \nbe able to make more intelligent decisions, like whether to detain or \nrelease a juvenile arrested for a serious crime.\n  Additionally, the interstate sharing of accurate and up-to-date \nrecords would assist police departments in criminal investigations. For \nexample, suppose a young offender is found guilty of burglary in \nOklahoma. The court sentences him to 7 months in a detention center. \nFollowing his release, he travels to Texas where he robs an elderly \nlady who upon being accosted refuses to give away her purse. Angered by \nher refusal the young offender stabs her to death. He opens her purse, \ntakes the wallet, and flees the crime scene. Assume further there are \nno eyewitnesses to the murder. The police, however, are able to lift \nfingerprints from the purse. If the bill were enacted, the Texas police \nwould be able to identify the assailant because the juvenile would have \nbeen fingerprinted and photographed immediately following his \nconviction for burglary in Oklahoma.\n  Sixth, school officials would be able to treat all students equally.\n  Consider the case of Morgan versus Chris L.: In May 1992, Chris L. \nwas diagnosed as suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity \ndisorder. As a result, he was being treated with prescription \nmedication. Throughout the 1992-93 academic year, his behavioral \nproblems continued. On May 11, 1993, Chris allegedly kicked a water \npipe in the school lavatory until it burst--a crime against public \nproperty. The Knox County School District filed a petition in juvenile \ncourt. Chris' father filed for a due process hearing under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] to review the filing \nof the petition in juvenile court. The hearing officer concluded that \n``[t]he filing of a petition in Juvenile Court shall be considered as \nthe initiation of a change in placement and/or a disciplinary action \ncommensurate with expulsion or suspension for more than 10 days. * * * \n[B]efore a school files a petition against a child in Juvenile Court, \nit must follow the same procedures as for expulsion or suspension for \nmore than 10 days.'' A Federal district court judge upheld the hearing \nofficer's conclusion of law. IDEA is a grant funding statute that \ncontains special due process procedures for children with disabilities. \nThe problem is that the special due process procedures for disabled \nstudents take several months, and sometimes a year, to complete. \n\n[[Page S 13659]]\n\nThe practical effect of the judge's ruling is that schools, as a matter \nof law, cannot unilaterally refer disabled children to juvenile court \nunless parents consent to the filing of the juvenile court petition. \nThe bill makes it clear that those disabled students who commit \ncriminal acts on school property are not protected under IDEA's special \ndue process procedures.\n  Seventh, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nwould provide assistance to States to implement serious habitual \noffender comprehensive action programs.\n  The bill would allow State and local governments to use Federal \nfunding to implement serious habitual offender comprehensive action \nprograms [SHOCAP]. SHOCAP is a multiagency program that is intended to \nimprove the effectiveness of jurisdictions in handling serious habitual \njuvenile offenders. The program enlists police, schools, prosecutors, \nprobation officers, juvenile courts, family and youth services, \ndetention and corrections officials to collaborate more effectively and \nutilize their collective resources to identify serious, violent \nhabitual juvenile offenders. SHOCAP targets the top 2 to 3 percent of \nthe most serious habitual offenders and puts them under intense \nsupervision.\n  The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, a division \nof the U.S. Department of Justice, conducted five test pilots of \nSHOCAP. Oxnard, CA was of the selected sites. SHOCAP was implemented in \n1983. Four years later, Oxnard's violent crime dropped 38 percent. By \n1989, rape decreased 30 percent; robbery decreased 41 percent; and \nmurder decreased 60 percent. The statistics demonstrate that SHOCAP can \neffectively control juvenile crime.\n  SHOCAP is also instrumental in apprehending young criminals. Take, \nfor example, the murder of the British tourist in Monticello, FL. If \nyou recall, four teenagers age 13-16 were charged with murder in the \n1993 slaying of a British tourist at a highway rest stop and attempted \nmurder of his companion. The killing occurred while the juveniles were \nriding around in a stolen car. Because 3 of the 4 teenagers were \nserious habitual offenders, they were arrested within a matter of days. \nWhat is more, the 13-year-old reportedly had more than 50 offenses on \nhis record.\n  SHOCAP works, and through word of mouth in the law enforcement \ncommunity: 16 States have at least one experienced site implementing \nthe SHOCAP process; 150 sites have been reported as implementing SHOCAP \nbased on the technical assistance provided by experienced SHOCAP sites; \n5 States (Florida, Virginia, Oklahoma, California, & Illinois); and 3 \nStates are reportedly considering SHOCAP legislation.\n  The bill would make support for SHOCAP available in all \njurisdictions.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, if enacted, the Violent and Hard-Core Juvenile \nOffender Reform Act of 1995 will effectively address the problem of \njuvenile violence.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1246. A bill to amend titles 5 and 37, United States Code, to \nprovide for the continuance of pay and the authority to make certain \nexpenditures and obligations during lapses in appropriations; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  the furlough protection act of 1995\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I offer legislation to safeguard \nFederal and military pay in the event of a Government shutdown due to \nan appropriations funding lapse. This bill is titled ``The Furlough \nProtection Act of 1995.''\n  Mr. President, during the past several weeks, hundreds of civilian \nand uniformed personnel of the Federal Government have contacted my \noffice to express their dismay over prospects of a budgetary train \nwreck and possible employee furloughs.\n  While I am a strong supporter of the balanced budget resolution and \nthe reconciliation process, I am deeply concerned that the Federal \nemployees could potentially be held hostage to the politics of the \nbudget process as Congress and the administration work out their \nrespective differences in the appropriations process.\n  The most recent furlough of Federal employees occurred over the \nColumbus Holiday weekend of 1990. President Bush vetoed a continuing \nresolution to provide stopgap funding for Government operations. This \naction was the result of the President's dissatisfaction with \ncongressional progress on the fiscal year 1991 budget.\n  After the furlough, several Members of Congress asked the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] to examine the taxpayer costs of the 1990 \nColumbus Day weekend shutdown. The GAO's findings were published in a \n1991 report titled, ``Government Shutdown: Permanent Funding Lapse \nLegislation Needed.'' The GAO found that of the 22 executive branch \nagencies surveyed, 7 reported significant shutdown costs totaling about \n$3.4 million.\n  The GAO report states that the costs and disruptions of a Government \nshutdown would have been much more severe if the furlough had occurred \nduring a normal workweek. Twenty of the twenty-two agencies estimated \nthat an average of 506,500 Federal employees would be furloughed daily \nduring a funding lapse. The GAO report goes on to state that the total \ncost of such a 3-day workweek shutdown would range from $244.6 to \n$607.3 million. Mr. President, in this time of tight budgetary \nconstraints, such irresponsible actions do not make for good public \npolicy.\n  Our Nation's dedicated civilian and uniformed personnel should not be \npenalized for the inability of Congress and the administration to agree \non spending priorities. Consequently, I am offering legislation to \nensure that uniformed and civilian Federal employees will continue to \nbe compensated during a funding lapse.\n  Mr. President, my intent in offering this legislation is to provide \nsome measure of financial reassurance for the hundreds of thousands of \nFederal employees and their families that would be affected by a \nGovernment shutdown. It is my hope that Congress and the administration \nwill work together to resolve our respective differences without \nholding Federal employees hostage to the politics of the budget \nprocess. In the best of all worlds, Congress and the President will \nagree to a continuing resolution to provide limited funding for \ncontinued Government operations, however, if an agreement cannot be \nreached and a funding lapse occurs, my legislation will protect our \nNation's dedicated civilian and uniformed personnel and their families \nfrom undue financial hardship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for contributions to a medical savings account by any \nindividual who is covered under a catastrophic coverage health plan; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the family medical savings and investment act\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last year we had a long, \ncontroversial, debate about health care reform. When the dust had \nsettled, a number of things were clear. The American people want health \ncare cost containment. They want to choose their own physician. They \nwant portable health insurance. They don't want to worry about losing \ntheir health insurance if they lose or change their jobs. Finally, they \nwant more equitable treatment under the tax code. Mr. President, today \nI am introducing a medical savings account [MSA] bill which can help \nachieve each of these goals.\n  The basic MSA concept is simple and straightforward, and similar to \nindividual retirement accounts: Reduce premium costs by selecting a \ncatastrophic, high-deductible policy. Use the premium cost savings to \nestablish special medical savings accounts. Pay medical costs below the \ndeductible amount from the medical savings account. And provide \nfavorable tax treatment of these accounts.\n  Wider use of medical savings accounts would reduce health care costs. \nIt would do so by reducing administrative costs. Those with MSA's would \npay most of their low dollar, under $3,000, health care claims from \nthese accounts. The administrative cost of such claims would be \nnegligible.\n  It would do so also by making consumers more selective in the use of \noptional health care services.\n  Most importantly, it would cause them to be more selective in \nchoosing competing providers. This competition among providers for the \nbusiness of those who hold MSA's should reduce the prices they charge \nfor their services.\n  It is true, as critics of medical savings accounts have charged, that \na relatively small percentage of people spend a majority of the health \ncare dollars. By implication, since MSA's would pay only for relatively \nlow dollar claims, they will not have a major impact on health care \ncosts. However, it is the case that substantial sums are spent for \nrelatively low dollar claims under $3,000. Thus, wider use of MSA's \ndoes offer the potential of lower health care costs.\n  Second, MSA's put the patient back into the health care equation. \nPatients will make more cost-conscious decisions for routine health \ncare expenses. Those who hold medical savings accounts would be able to \nchose their own physicians for routine medical expenses under the \ndeductible limit. Since the money they spend for health care up to the \ndeductible would be their own, no one else could tell them what \nphysician they could see, or what services they could pay for. It \nshould also be clearer, in an MSA context, that the money spent for the \ncatastrophic health plan is\n the individual consumer's money. Organizations providing health care \nthrough the catastrophic coverage policy necessarily will have to \norient themselves toward satisfying the individuals purchasing those \npolicies.\n\n  Third, wider use of medical savings accounts would make health care \ncoverage more dependable. Individuals with MSA's would no longer have \nto worry about losing insurance when changing jobs or when experiencing \ntemporary unemployment. Their MSA's would follow them to their new \njobs, or would continue to protect them when they become unemployed.\n  Fourth, it follows that medical savings accounts should increase \nhealth care coverage. Fully half of the approximately 40 million \nAmericans who are uninsured at any given time are uninsured for 4 \nmonths or less. Only 15 percent are uninsured for more than 2 years. \nFor most, these uninsured periods occur between jobs. Widespread use of \nmedical savings accounts would reduce the number of uninsured, since \nindividuals would be able to pay health expenses during periods of \nunemployment from those accounts.\n  Fifth, wider use of medical savings accounts would promote personal \nsavings. Since pre-tax moneys are deposited in medical savings \naccounts, there is a strong tax incentive to use them.\n  Finally, it would make the tax treatment of health insurance more \nequitable. Currently, the tax system allows employers who pay for \nhealth insurance for their employees to deduct it from the income on \nwhich they pay Federal taxes. It permits the employees who receive such \nan employer-provided benefit to exclude its value from their taxable \nincome. The better paid the employee and the richer the benefit \nprovided by the employer, the bigger the tax benefits to employer and \nemployee. In contrast, smaller employers who do not offer health \ninsurance and their employees, the self-employed, and the unemployed \nreceive no tax benefit. This is manifestly unfair.\n  This bill, if enacted, would help to correct that situation. Any \nindividual capable of contributing to a medical savings account would \nreceive favorable tax treatment. Amounts contributed by individuals to \nan MSA could deduct those contributions from income for Federal tax \npurposes. Or, if their employer contributes to an MSA \n\n[[Page S 13661]]\n\non their behalf, the employee can exclude the contributed amount from \nincome for Federal tax purposes.\n  The medical savings account bill I am introducing today is a revision \nof H.R. 1818, the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act of 1995, \nintroduced by Congressman Archer on June 13 of this year.\n  This bill would permit individuals to maintain a medical savings \naccount. They could do so if they are covered at the same time by a \ncatastrophic health plan. Contributions to the medical savings account \nwould be excludable from gross income if made by an employer on behalf \nof an employee. They would be tax deductible if made by the individual. \nThe total amount that could be excluded or deducted from income would \nbe the lesser of the deductible amount under the catastrophic policy, \nor $2,500 for an individual and $5,000 for a family.\n  An individual could withdraw from this medical savings account to pay \nfor qualified medical expenses. Such withdrawals would be excludable \nfrom gross income for tax purposes.\n  Mr. President, the medical savings account bill I am introducing \ntoday, if enacted, would achieve a number of the most important health \ncare reform goals the American people desire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Grassley Family Medical Savings and Investment Act\n\n       How The Grassley Bill Works: It would allow MSAs equal tax \n     treatment with other types of employer-provided health \n     insurance, and it would allow individuals and the self-\n     employed the ability to contribute to a Medical Savings \n     Account (with certain restrictions) and receive a 100% \n     deduction for their contribution. The Grassley bill will end \n     the current tax-code discrimination against MSAs by ending \n     the taxation on MSA deposits. Interest build-up in MSAs, \n     however, would be taxed as ordinary income.\n       How MSAs Work: MSAs are flexible, and could work like this: \n     an employer would create the option for employees to choose \n     an MSA by purchasing a high-deductible policy. The employer \n     would then deposit funds in the MSA. The amount of the \n     deposit in the MSA under Grassley is limited to the lesser \n     amount of either the deductible amount of the insurance \n     policy, or to $2,500 for an individual, or $5,000 for a \n     family. Below is a chart which explains the changes the \n     Grassley bill makes in current law.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Insured                                                              \n   premium                 MSA contribution              High-deductible\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEmployees      Allows deposits of up to $5,000 for      Retains current \n with           families and $2,500 for individuals      law: premium   \n Employer-      and excludes deposits from taxes.        costs are 100% \n Provided                                                excluded from  \n Insurance.                                              taxes.         \nSelf-Employed  Allows deposits of up to $5,000 for      Retains current \n                families and $2,500 for individuals.     law: 30%       \n                100% tax deductible for qualified        deduction for  \n                medical expenses.                        self-employed  \n                                                         for premium    \n                                                         costs.         \nIndividuals..  Allows deposits of up to $5,000 for      Retains current \n                families and $2,500 for individuals.     law: allows    \n                100% tax deductible for qualified        deduction for  \n                medical expenses.                        medical        \n                                                         expenditures if\n                                                         they exceed    \n                                                         7.5% of gross  \n                                                         income.        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Roll Over of Funds: The money in the account is the \n     family's money, and they have complete control over it. The \n     account is portable, and accessible for any medical expense. \n     The funds in the MSA roll over from year to year for future \n     medical expenses or for retirement needs.\n       Long-Term Care: The Grassley bill allows individuals and \n     families to pay for long-term care premiums from the account. \n     Over the longer term significant portions of the population \n     will use funds from the MSAs to purchase private insurance \n     for long-term care coverage. This coverage will in turn \n     decrease the demand on the Federal government for such \n     services, as will the savings that build up in MSA over time \n     which can be used for health care and other retirement costs.\n       Cost: The House companion bill, Archer-Jacobs, has been \n     scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation as costing $1.8 \n     billion over seven years.\n       Support for the 10% Penalty on Non-Medical Withdrawals: In \n     addition to taxing these funds as income, the Archer bill \n     imposes a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals. The \n     Business Coalition strongly supports the 10 percent penalty \n     since we believe it will encourage savings and discourage \n     frivolous consumption. One of the key indirect effects of \n     MSAs will be to increase our nation's abysmally low savings \n     rate, which in turn will help lower interest rates.\n       MSAs Have a Strong Appeal to Low-Income Wage Earners: \n     Companies that have MSAs have found MSAs are most popular \n     among lower income employees. Under conventional insurance \n     plans, low-income employees would have to meet their $250 or \n     $500 deductible with after-tax dollars before they could \n     access their insurance. A single mother earning $14,000 or \n     $15,000 a year may find it difficult to meet the deductible \n     when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery bills and other \n     needs for her children are pressing. An MSA allows these low \n     income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them to get \n     medical care when they or their children need it.\n       MSAs Enhance Portability: Should an employee change jobs or \n     be laid off or fired, the money in his MSA goes with him. \n     This feature of MSAs allows the individual to continue to pay \n     for his health care premium until he finds another job or is \n     accepted into his new employer's health care plan. Indeed, \n     according to the above cited article in the Journal of \n     American Health Policy, ``forty-one percent of persons losing \n     private health insurance have an uninsured spell that ends \n     within one to three months, and 71 percent have a spell that \n     ends within four months.'' MSAs are a perfect tool to help \n     bridge this gap.\n       MSAs Allow Total Freedom of Choice of Doctor: MSAs allow \n     patients to shop around, choose their own doctors, and tailor \n     their health care expenditures to suit their own needs.\n       MSAs Encourage Savings for Retirement Care Costs: According \n     to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans most \n     likely to need long term care (85 years and older) will \n     double in the next 25 years, and the number of Americans over \n     90 will triple. Allowing individuals in their late thirties \n     and early forties to have an MSA in which they could build up \n     two or three decades of savings, would give these individuals \n     the funds to pay for drug therapies, nursing home care, and \n     in-home care.\n       MSAs Will Stimulate Administrative Savings: When paying for \n     routine health care costs, the MSA patient has no forms to \n     fill out or claim forms to file. The patient would simply \n     write a check to the provider from his MSA, or the doctor \n     would bill the employer or insurance company, depending on \n     how the MSA patient's plan is administered. In most cases, \n     the doctor receives payment immediately. The patient's \n     insurance company would not have to incur the cost of \n     adjudicating a small, say, $30 claim.\n                                                                    ____\n\nSignificant Changes to the Archer-Jacobs Bill as Introduced by Senator \n                                Grassley\n\n       The Grassley MSA bill incorporates six significant \n     improvements to the Archer bill.\n       FEHBP Employees Are Eligible: The Grassley bill allows \n     federal employees in the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan \n     (i.e. Hill staff, Senators, and Representatives) to have an \n     MSA. Legislation is needed to make this possible.\n       Withdrawal at 59\\1/2\\ years old: Retirement withdrawal at \n     59\\1/2\\ years old is provided for in the Grassley bill, and \n     the provision for withdrawal is similar to the current rules \n     for IRAs. This provision was not in the original Archer-\n     Jabobs bill because of the uncertainty of how MSAs would be \n     structured for Medicare.\n       One Family MSA Per Family: $300 million will be knocked off \n     the official score of the bill by restricting one family to \n     only one $5,000 MSA. The Archer bill as written could have \n     allowed one family a $10,000 MSA.\n       Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Savings from Changes in \n     the treatment of Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs): Several \n     hundred million dollars will be saved by not allowing the FSA \n     to rollover into an MSA during the first year of this MSA \n     legislation.\n       Total Cost Savings for Grassley Bill: With the restriction \n     of one MSA per family, and with the change in the treatment \n     of FSAs in the Grassley bill, the cost of the bill will be \n     $500 million cheaper than the Archer-Jacobs bill. The \n     Grassley bill score will be about $1.8 billion over 7 years.\n       New Minimum Deductibles for High Deductible Policies: The \n     minimum high-deductible policy in the Grassley bill is $1,500 \n     for individuals, and $3,000 for families, as opposed to \n     $1,800 for individuals and $3,600 for families in the Archer-\n     Jacobs bill.\n       No spending from the MSA for high-deductible health care \n     premiums: Unless an employee is laid off, MSAs will not be \n     used to pay for health care premiums for working employees. \n     The MSA was never designed to operate as a fund for the high-\n     deductible premium, only as a source of funds for medical \n     costs below the deductible level of the high-deductible \n     policy.\n       Note: The bill Senator Grassley will introduce in the \n     Senate will include these changes. The above changes to the \n     Archer-Jacobs bill will likely be made to the Archer-Jacobs \n     bill in mark-up since Senator Grassley's office worked \n     closely with the House Ways and Means Committee staff and the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation in making these changes.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1248. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe alcohol fuels credit to be allocated to patrons of a cooperative in \ncertain cases; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    alcohol fuels credit legislation\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators \nPressler, Harkin, Kerrey, Conrad, and Dorgan, I am introducing a bill \nto correct a discrepancy in the Tax Code which acts to discriminate \nagainst a type of enterprise that Federal policy should actually be \nencouraging: small, cooperatively owned ethanol plants. \n\n[[Page S 13662]]\n\nThe bill would allow these plants to utilize the existing small ethanol \nproducers credit by passing the credit through to their owner/members.\n  I am confident that it was never the intention of Congress to \npreclude cooperatives from making full use of this credit. Rather, the \ncurrent obstacle facing co-ops is a result of legislative oversight at \nthe time the original small producers credit was passed. Farmer-owned \ncooperatives simply were not a prominent part of the ethanol industry \nlandscape in 1990, whereas today they certainly are.\n  Indeed, I am extremely pleased that Minnesota leads the Nation in \nsmall, cooperatively owned ethanol plants. We have two already in \noperation, and four more under construction in our State. Still another \nMinnesota cooperative ethanol plant has been so successful that it has \nexpanded in our State beyond what the small producers credit considers \na small plant, and its owner/members have even constructed an \nadditional cooperative plant in Nebraska.\n  These plants produce a clean fuel which is essential to the \nachievement of Clean Air Act objectives in American cities. They create \njobs in rural communities. By utilizing agricultural commodity crops, \nthey bolster the price of those crops and thus reduce the cost of \nFederal farm programs. And because they are owned by farmers, small \nethanol-producing cooperatives allow farmers to do what is becoming \nmore and more necessary: Move up the food chain and capture the value-\nadded dollars in processed agricultural products.\n  Not only farmers benefit from this retention of value-added \nprocessing dollars; entire rural communities do. Farmer-owned \ncooperatives help make sure that precious renewable resources \ncontribute to the local rural economy and are not merely removed for a \nlow price and processed in other locations.\n  Mr. President, Congress has recognized the importance of promoting \nthe development of domestically produced, renewable clean fuels. In \naddition to the economic and environmental benefits I have mentioned, \nwe in Congress also consciously have decided for energy-security \nreasons to promote domestic renewables. The relatively young ethanol \nindustry has received needed assistance. That assistance is especially \njustified in view of the decades of assistance and preference that the \nFederal Government has provided\n for the nonrenewable fossil fuels industry, much of whose product \ntoday is imported.\n\n  The assistance we have provided to the ethanol industry is paying \noff. It is allowing the industry to grow, and it is making the industry \nbetter. It has helped the ethanol industry become more economically \nefficient and more energy efficient. A study released by the Department \nof Agriculture this summer concludes that ethanol yields nearly 25 \npercent more energy than is used in the growing, harvesting, and \ndistilling of the corn that is the feed stock for most American ethanol \nplants--plants which convert that corn to a premium liquid fuel. USDA's \nstudy found that each gallon of domestically produced ethanol displaces \n7 gallons of imported oil. That is a remarkably positive statistic.\n  One criticism of Federal support for ethanol is that the industry has \nin its recent history been dominated by a single large corporation. The \nsmall producer credit and the extension of that credit to cooperatively \nowned plants acts directly to address that concern. In Minnesota, \ncooperatively owned plants are the leading ethanol producers. That \ntrend can and should be further encouraged.\n  The existing small ethanol producer credit allows ethanol plants \nwhich produce fewer than 30 million gallons annually to collect a 10-\ncent-per-gallon tax credit for the first 15 million gallons of their \nproduction. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has judged that \nthe way the provision of the Tax Code is currently written, \ncooperatives cannot pass the credit through to their patrons. Thus, a \nco-op which distributes all income to patrons in the form of dividends \ncannot utilize the nonrefundable credit because it lacks taxable income \nto which the credit can be applied. Farmer-owners, who are taxed on \ntheir share of the cooperative's income, are denied the credit. The \nbill would correct this unintentional negative outcome by explicitly \nauthorizing the passthrough of the credit to patrons of a cooperative. \nThose few cooperatively owned ethanol plants which retain income at the \ncooperative level, usually due to the business' relationship to another \ncooperative business, could continue to collect the credit at the \ncooperative level.\n  Mr. President, it is no time to stand still regarding Federal policy \nwhich affects the economic health of our rural communities. This bill \nlinks positive effects for the rural economy to sound energy and \nenvironmental policy. It is endorsed by the National Council for Farm \nCooperatives, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the National Farmers Union, and the American Corn \nGrowers. It has been introduced with bipartisan cosponsorship in the \nHouse of Representatives, and I hope we can pass it here in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish medical savings accounts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  medical savings accounts legislation\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I introduce legislation aimed at \ncontrolling skyrocketing health care costs in America today. \nSpecifically, this legislation creates medical savings accounts [MSA's] \nwhich are designed to give individuals another choice in the health \ncare market. MSA's also serve to change provider and consumer behavior \nby decreasing the role of third party payors, while increasing \nindividual awareness of health care costs.\n  Today, there is little, if any, incentive for patients to be cost-\nconscious consumers of health care. Imagine if you were required to pay \nonly 20 cents of every dollar you spend on food, clothing, consumer \ngoods, and transportation. Essentially, imagine that an \n\n[[Page S 13663]]\n\n80 percent off sign was posted above every product you buy. If this \nwere the case, you'd probably eat more, buy more, and own more, \nprobably much more than you need. This may sound too good to be true--\nbut it's exactly what is happening in our health care system today.\n  On average, every time a patient in America receives a dollar's worth \nof medical services, 79 cents is paid for by someone else--usually the \nGovernment or an insurance company. The result is that we grossly \noverconsume medical services. Everyone wants the best--whether it is a \ndeluxe hospital room, the latest in nuclear medical imaging, or an MRI \nscan for a headache--and the result is that health care costs are going \nthrough the roof.\n  Medical savings accounts are a solution. MSA's would give individuals \nmore choice in the health care market. MSA's would stem rising health \ncare costs without decreasing the availability and quality of patient \ncare by empowering individuals to purchase medical services directly. \nThese personal accounts would encourage patients to make prudent, cost-\nconscious decisions about their health care needs, and would force \nhospitals and physicians to compete for patients on the basis of the \ncost and quality of care.\n  What are Medical savings accounts? Medical savings accounts are tax-\nfree, personal accounts which can be used by an individual to pay \nmedical bills. Take, for example, the employee of a company: today an \nemployer might pay three or four thousand dollars for a medical \ninsurance policy with a $500 deductible. The employee has no incentive \nto be cost-conscious. In contrast, with my legislation, if medical \nsavings accounts were available, the employer would deposit an amount \nup to $2,500 tax free in the savings account, which would belong to the \nemployee. The employee would buy an inexpensive, catastrophic-type \npolicy which would cover all medical expenses above $2,500 per year. \nFor medical expenses up to the $2,500 annual out-of-pocket cost, the \nemployee would use money from the savings account. Any savings account \nmoney not spent on health care expenses that year would grow in the \nemployee's account and would accumulate year to year. The money could \nbe used to pay for health care expenses, insurance premiums during \nperiods of unemployment, and long-term care expenses.\n  Furthermore, as owner of the account, the individual has a strong \nincentive to become a cost-conscious consumer of medical care. He will \ndemand quality care at competitive prices. The system will respond with \nbetter outcome measures and lower unit prices for health care. We will \npotentially save billions of dollars in health care costs because \nindividual patients will modify their health care habits to consume \nhealth care services prudently.\n  Medical savings accounts--and this is usually overlooked by policy \nmakers in Washington--will change provider behavior as well. Throughout \nmuch of my practice as a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I would \nperform a transplant, submit the bill, and it was paid--no questions \nasked. However, one day an individual--who was actually paying for his \ntransplant from his own pocket--came into my office with a list of five \nor six transplant centers, morbidity data, infection rates, and prices. \nHe asked me why I charged what I charged, why my success was different \nthan others on his list, and how our program at Vanderbilt differed \nfrom its competitors. That one individual caused me to totally reassess \nhow\n our multiorgan transplant center operated. For the next 2 weeks, each \nof the transplant teams at our facility worked together to determine \nwhere we could improve the quality of care and become more efficient \nand ultimately lower our prices in a competitive market.\n\n  Because someone else usually pays the bills, many patients forget \nthat they are consumers. They don't ask providers to be accountable. If \none individual empowered because he was responsible for his own health \ncare dollars could transform my entire transplant center by asking \nquestions, imagine what could happen if we empowered hundreds of \nthousands of individuals across the county similarly.\n  Finally, let me describe how my legislation differs from previously \nintroduced MSA bills. Previous bills have defined only a catastrophic \nplan by the dollar amount of the deductible. These bills, by their very \nnature, would exclude other types of plan designs which focus on \nsignificant cost sharing. If our goal is to allow individuals greater \ncontrol of their health care dollars, it makes sense to allow \nindividuals a choice of MSA plan options to best meet their unique \nneeds. The real value of our U.S. health care market lies in its \nresponsiveness and opportunity for innovation. My legislation is \ndesigned to encourage this innovation. My legislation defines a \ncatastrophic health plan as any health plan which has an annual ``out-\nof-pocket expense requirement'' which is not less than $2,500. With \nthis definition, in addition to traditional indemnity insurers, a broad \nrange of coordinated care plans will also be able to offer an MSA plan. \nIn turn, competitive market forces will spur innovation to meet the \nneeds of the market, and individuals will benefit from a variety of MSA \nplan options to choose from. For example, one individual may choose a \nhigh deductible plan for which MSA dollars would fund 100 percent of \nthe first $2,500 of care. However, another individual may choose a \ndifferent plan requiring 50 percent cost sharing for the first $5,000 \nof care. Both plans will encourage cost-conscious behavior.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the introduction of my medical savings \naccount proposal today be viewed as a fresh start. As I have explained, \nsome of my colleagues in the Senate and House have proposed that \nmedical savings accounts be linked only to high-deductible, \ncatastrophic health policies. I, however, believe that my proposal will \nincrease the choices available to individual consumers. This will not \nonly increase choices available to individuals, but will reduce the \npotential problem of adverse selection and will promote a level playing \nfield in the health care system.\n  Mr. President, in closing, we in America are fortunate to have the \nabsolute highest quality health care in the world. When the leaders of \nthe world become seriously ill, they do not go to Great Britain or \nCanada to seek treatment, they come to the United States. And while \nthere are those who would like to stifle our technological advances and \nallow bureaucrats to tell us how much and what kind of health care we \ncan receive, the American people have loudly and clearly rejected this \nnotion.\n  No one can predict what will happen in medicine in the first 50 years \nof the 21st century. Fifty years ago, when my father was a young doctor \nin Tennessee making house calls, he could not have envisioned what \nmedical practice today would be like. The technological advances are \nsimply mind-boggling. Mr. President, the challenge for us is to \nmaintain the highest quality health care in the world and to continue \nto make it available to all Americans. But this can only be done if we \nfirst change the basic framework through which medical services are \nconsumed, and build on a market-based system. I believe my legislation \nwhich creates the use of medical savings accounts will be a major step \nin that direction.\n  I would welcome any suggestions my colleagues or others may have for \nimproving this legislation and hope we do not forgo the opportunity to \nestablish MSA's this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LARRY MURRAY ON HIS RETIREMENT AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF \n              THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING OF WESTERN MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nLawrence L. Murray, Jr. In so doing, I join with the members of his \ncommunity who are honoring Larry Murray on September 21, 1995, during a \nreception commemorating his 21 years of service and his retirement as \nexecutive director of the Area Agency on Aging of Western Michigan.\n  Larry is a native of Pittsburgh, PA, and a proud graduate of Duquesne \nUniversity. A member of the World War II generation, to whom our Nation \nowes so much, Larry served in the U.S. Army Air Corps from 1942 to \n1946.\n  Following his discharge from the service, Larry pursued a career in \nbusiness and sales. In the early 1960's his work brought Larry and his \nfamily to Grand Rapids. A decade later Larry ended the first stage of \nhis professional life when he retired as vice president of U.S. Gypsum, \nInc.\n  With prophetic vision focusing on the challenges of a growing senior \npopulation, Larry prepared the documentation for designation which \ncreated Region VIII, the Area Agency on Aging of Western Michigan and \nwas appointed the agency's first executive director.\n  Over the years Larry has led region VIII through many changes and \nchallenges, always ensuring a continuous flow of services for older \npersons. He was responsible for making it the first computerized area \nagency on aging, and successfully obtained numerous State and Federal \ngrants which have allowed for its expansion and success. Additionally \nLarry spearheaded the efforts to erect a new building for the agency \nthat includes a state-of-the-art kitchen for its Meals on Wheels \nProgram.\n  In 1986 in recognition of his outstanding leadership and many years \nof dedicated service, Larry was given the award for the Distinguished \nArea Agency Director of the United States of America.\n  Also active in his church and community, Larry has been a volunteer \nor member of many boards and organizations over the years among them: \nthe Ancient Order of Hibernians; the Knights of Columbus; the St. \nVincent DePaul Society; the Michigan Society of Gerontology, and a host \nof others.\n  Serving his country, church, and community throughout his entire \nlife, Larry Murray has been an example to others embodying the highest \nideals of his faith and his country. Mr. President I ask you along with \nall of my colleagues in the Senate to join with me in honoring this \noutstanding citizen. His legacy of unselfish service is something all \nshould strive to emulate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13671-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in August, Gov. Roy Romer of \nColorado proclaimed October 22 to 29 ``World Population Awareness \nWeek'' for the State of Colorado. I would like to express my support \nfor this proclamation, and for population awareness activities.\n  I support noncoercive international family planning programs as much \nas possible, given budget constraints. Other countries need our support \nto control population growth and raise standards of living. Family \nplanning programs help control population growth in overcrowded \nnations, reduce infant and maternal mortality rates, and decrease the \nrates of starvation and poverty. These developments in turn help lower \npressures on inadequate, severely stressed health services in many \ncountries.\n  By promoting long-term, sustainable economic and human growth, I \nbelieve family planning programs serve U.S. interests in environmental \nprotection, resource conservation, global economic growth, immigration, \nand international stability.\n  World Population Awareness Week will help promote public awareness of \nthe causes and costs of overpopulation, and effective policies to \nreduce population growth voluntarily and rationally.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Governor Romer's proclamation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n                         Honorary Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the world's population has reached 5.7 billion and \n     is growing at a reported rate of 100 million each year; and\n       Whereas, rapid population growth can overtake the capacity \n     of human societies to provide food, housing, education, \n     employment and basic health services and may undermine \n     economic development as well as social, cultural and \n     political stability; and\n       Whereas, population growth can place strains on the \n     environment and our natural resources; and\n       Whereas, many groups will recognize October 22-29, 1995, as \n     World Population Week to increase public awareness of what \n     many view as a need to find a balance between population \n     development and the natural environment;\n       Now, therefore, I, Roy Romer, Governor of Colorado, \n     proclaim October 22-29, 1995, as World Population Awareness \n     Week in the State of Colorado.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13671-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13671-S13672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO DEA SPECIAL AGENT ROBERT A.

Mr. President, it is an honor and privilege for me \nto rise in the well of the Senate today in recognition of Special Agent \nRobert A. Aiu of the Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], Honolulu, \nwho has been named the 1995 National Law Enforcement Officer of the \nYear. This is a singular honor which is awarded to but one out of the \nthousands of law enforcement officers of Federal enforcement agencies, \n\n[[Page S 13672]]\n\nincluding the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the \nCIA. Agent Aiu has the further distinction of being the first to be so \nhonored in the DEA.\n  Special Agent Aiu, who has served in the DEA since 1970, has been \nrecognized and honored for his outstanding service in marijuana \neradication, seizure, and forfeiture of assets derived from drug \ntrafficking, and for the assistance he has provided to the U.S. \nMarshals Service in the apprehension of fugitives. Like many other law \nenforcement officers, he puts his life on the line in the performance \nof his duties and we are deeply grateful to him for his continuing \nefforts to make our society a safer and better place for all of us.\n  In behalf of the people of Hawaii and our country, I commend Special \nAgent Robert A. Aiu of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Honolulu, \n1995 National Law Enforcement Officer of the Year, and express our deep \nand heartfelt gratitude to him for his exemplary performance, and \nselfless and untiring dedication to duty.\n  Congratulations and mahalo, Bob.

Mr. President, let me make a couple of additional points \non the agreement we have reached with regard to modifying the original \nDole bill.\n  A lot of people deserve recognition this afternoon for their \ncontribution. I think on our side there are two Senators who certainly \ndeserve special recognition for the contribution and leadership they \nhave shown.\n  Of course, I refer to Senators Dodd and Kennedy. First on children's \nissues and, second, on work. On a number of the legislative provisions \nrelating to work and job skills, they have done a remarkable job over \nthe years and have certainly shown, again, their leadership, and the \ntremendous effort they have put forth to allow us the progress that we \nhave made this week on welfare reform. But, in particular, on child \ncare itself, it would not have been possible were it not for their work \nand their effort. I applaud them and publicly want to thank them for \nall of the help and leadership that they have given on that issue.\n  Let me also say we will have some time to talk about the overall \nagreement next week. I intend to vote for this bill. I do so with mixed \nfeelings, frankly. I think there are many things in the bill we can \ncite with some satisfaction. There are many concerns that I have, as \nwell.\n  I hope as people take a look at the overall context of what it is we \nhave attempted to do, that they appreciate the difficulty that we have \nunder any circumstances to come to agreement and to actually accomplish \nas much as we have done here.\n  In my view, it goes a long way to doing what we all want to do: \nfundamentally reform the welfare system. It does not go anywhere near \nas far in some areas as we would like it to, but that is the essence of \ncompromise. I will have more to say on that on Tuesday.\n  I appreciate the good work that everyone has put forth to get us to \nthis point this afternoon. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13672-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, just down the hall from my office, the POW/\nMIA flag stands in the Capitol rotunda. That flag flies as a sad, but \nproud, reminder of the sacrifices which brave people made in the \ndefense of our country--in Vietnam, in Korea, and in World War II. As I \nam sure my colleagues know, today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day--\na day for all Americans to reflect on those who faithfully served this \nNation but whose ultimate fate remains unknown. America must never \nforget those who have gone missing in the battles to defend our \nfreedom.\n  I opposed President Clinton's decision to establish diplomatic ties \nwith Vietnam. Shortly before the took office, then president-elect \nClinton said that ``there will be no normalization of relations with \nany nation that is at all suspected of withholding any information.'' \nAnd while Vietnam may have selectively cooperated here and there, all \nsigns continue to point to the fact that Vietnam is still willfully \nwithholding information.\n  We are still watching the Vietnamese Government. We are still \nexpecting total cooperation. And we will not close the book until we \nare certain that we have the fullest possible accounting of every \nAmerican POW and MIA.\n  Today, let us look up to the POW/MIA flag in the rotunda, and really \nreflect. Many here have answered this country's call to arms, but \ntoday, let us remember those who endured a heavier burden as prisoners \nof war. Let us recall the pain felt by the families and friends of \nthose who didn't come back, and those who remain missing in action.\n  By honoring our POW'S and MIA's, we honor the freedom and peace they \ndefended. We can take inspiration from their example and courage from \ntheir actions.

Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment on the \nwelfare reform bill to strengthen the work requirement in that bill. I \nhave long believed that work requirements should be clear and should be \nstrong and should be applied promptly. Able-bodied welfare recipients \nwho are not in school or in job training should work--period. My \namendment required that able-bodied individuals either be in job \ntraining, in school, or working in private sector jobs within 6 months \nof receipt of benefits, or else be offered and be required to accept \ncommunity service employment. This requirement would be phased in over \n3 years in order to give States an opportunity to adjust \nadministratively.\n  This was a strengthening provision that was added relative to work \nand, while States are given the option to opt out of this particular \nrequirement by notification to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, I hope and would expect that pressure from the American \npeople, who overwhelmingly support strong work requirements, will \nconvince their States to enforce this provision and not opt out. \nSenator Dole, the bill's sponsor, accepted the principle and the goals \nof my amendment and it was adopted by a voice vote.\n  A few moments ago, on behalf of myself and Senator Dole, a \nmodification was sent to the desk and was adopted by voice vote. This \nmodification to my earlier amendment will strengthen the amendment by \nrequiring that work requirements apply to recipients 3 months after \nthey begin to receive benefits instead of 6 months; and this \naccelerates the requirement by 3 months. That is the maximum. So if \nsomebody is not in school or job training or in a private sector job \nand is able-bodied, under this requirement States will put in place \nwithin the next 3 years a requirement that community service jobs be \noffered to, and that welfare recipients accept, community service jobs \nwithin no more than 3 months of the receipt of their welfare benefit.\n  This modification of this amendment will also put this requirement \ninto law 1 year sooner, after 2 years rather than 3 years. That also is \na strengthening requirement.\n  The Daschle amendment, which was narrowly defeated last week, \ncontained an even stronger provision which was added as a modification \nat my request.\n  Experience has shown we must be more aggressive in requiring \nrecipients to work. As I said earlier, I believe this amendment is a \nfirm step in the right direction.\n  I make a parliamentary inquiry, just to make sure. The modification I \nreferred to in fact was not only adopted as part of the package, but \nalso I ask whether or not there was a motion to reconsider which was \ntabled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With regard to the parliamentary inquiry, the \nSenator will suspend for a moment.\n  The answer is yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13673-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13673-S13674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE DOLE-DASCHLE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Dole-Daschle agreement. \nThis modification restores the Federal commitment to child care as an \nessential step in moving people from welfare to work. It also prevents \nan unacceptable tradeoff between job training for dislocated workers in \nthe changing economy and workfare for those on welfare unable to find \njobs in the private sector.\n  Provisions on child care help to improve one of the most troubling \nfeatures of this bill. Rather than end the Federal commitment to child \ncare and put the funds into a general pool, we have reached agreement \nthat a specific allocation of funds to child care is essential if we \nare serious about moving people from welfare to work.\n  As a result of this agreement, fewer children will be left home alone \nand more families will be able to obtain the child care they need in \norder to take jobs to become self-sufficient.\n  I am hopeful the progress we have made on this issue will be \npreserved in conference with the House of Representatives. For welfare \nreform to be worthy of the name, it must not punish innocent children \nbecause they happen to be born poor. It must provide genuine \nopportunities for their parents to find jobs.\n \n[[Page S 13674]]\n\n  The agreement to drop the job training provisions from the welfare \nreform package is a major victory for America's workers. We have made \ngood progress on separate legislation to consolidate and reform the \nexisting Federal job training system.\n That effort will continue on a separate track. And I am optimistic \nthat we can reach bipartisan agreement on this needed, far-reaching \nreform.\n\n  I commend Senator Kassebaum for her leadership.\n  The current agreement enables us to keep faith with America's workers \nand keep the promises that we have made to dislocated workers. Large \nnumbers of men and women have lost their jobs or have been laid off as \na result of international trade agreements, base closings, corporate \ndownsizing, environmental protection, and other economic disruptions. \nThey deserve the chance to pick up the pieces of their lives and start \nanew, and sensible job training and job education programs can make \nthat possible.\n  Senator Kassebaum and many others on the other side of the aisle have \nworked closely with us in this effort, and I commend them for their \nleadership.\n  I remain deeply troubled by the potential consequences for the most \nvulnerable in our society--poor children--if this so-called welfare \nreform bill passes, but these modifications are certainly an \nimprovement. These major amendments on child care and job training have \neased some of the most objectionable features of the welfare bill, but \nI continue to have serious reservations about the remaining provisions.\n  I commend the leaders on both sides for their leadership shown on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13673-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13674-S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE MEDICARE PRESERVATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk, I hope \nfor the Presiding Officer's sake, briefly about the proposal--the \ngeneral outline of the proposal--made yesterday by the Republican \nleadership called the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995. The details \nare not yet available. It is a general outline.\n  Mr. President, I must say had I given this speech 7 or 8 hours ago, I \nprobably would have been a lot hotter than I am right now. I have \ncooled down since I watched the video replay of Speaker Gingrich's \nrather remarkable--and I would argue and observe, distasteful--\nrepresentation of the Democratic view of Medicare.\n  At one point he said that Democrats are morally bankrupt. That is as \nif saying we ought to approach the American people about the truth, \nwith the facts, with the courage and with trust, that they have the \ncapacity to take the truth. I agree with that. I believe, in fact, if \nwe are going to have the debate about Medicare that leads to \nconstructive reform, that saves the system--and, by the way, as \nimportantly, slows and fixes the percent of growth of all entitlements \nas a percentage of our budget--then we are going to have to come \ntogether present facts, tell the truth, and have the courage to do so. \nI do not disagree with Speaker Gingrich's observation in that regard.\n  But, as I said, I was somewhat provoked when he said that Democrats \nare morally bankrupt, and that all we are trying to do is frighten 85-\nyear-olds who are concerned about this program.\n  Well, Mr. President, 85-year-olds are quite nervous and concerned \nabout what politicians are going to do with their Medicare Program, and \nI think understandably so. But it is not Democrats that are causing \nthem to be fearful. They are fearful, I would argue, principally \nbecause they know something needs to be done, and they are not in the \nmain sufficiently well funded personally to be able to cover the costs \nof nursing home care or, for that matter, most of the cost of modern \nhealth care. And they are nervous. They are fearful. They are no longer \nable to produce and enjoy income, and, as a consequence, they are \nextremely vulnerable to all kinds of statements.\n  So, again, I do not disagree with Speaker Gingrich and other \nRepublican leaders that were talking yesterday about the need to \npresent facts, the need to present the truth, the need to have courage, \nand the need to trust the American people that they can handle the \ntruth and the facts presented by politicians.\n  But, Mr. President--I want to be clear on this--my criticism of the \nRepublican proposal is not that it does too much; I am critical of the \nRepublican proposal because it does not do enough.\n  Let me emphasis that, Mr. President. I believe that the proposal, the \ngeneral outline of the proposal, because it sees the problem through a \n7-year budget deficit plan--and that is what it is--it sees this \nMedicare problem through the view of the next 7 years. There is a need \nto produce a sufficient amount of savings over the next 7 years, and in \norder to meet the balanced budget targets in the budget resolution, the \nlaw now requires that be done. There are instructions for the Finance \nCommittee to produce legislation that will get that done.\n  There is a recommendation that will probably, all in all, in the end, \nbe considered in reconciliation, unfortunately. But when you look at \nthe problem for the next 7 years, you do not see the full size of the \nproblem.\n  Indeed, the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 says that it will \npreserve the system for current beneficiaries, protect it for future \nbeneficiaries, and strengthen it through reforms that have worked in \nthe private sector.\n  It may preserve it for current beneficiaries; it may strengthen it \nthrough reforms that have worked in the private sector. Both of those \nappear to be in the general outline. But by no measurement, unless you \nconsider that the future only includes the next 7 years, does this \nproposal protect it for future beneficiaries. It does not do that. It \nsees this as a 7-year problem. It does not see it as a problem beyond \nthat 7 years.\n  The problem that we have with entitlements--if anybody doubts that a \nDemocrat is willing to propose something that solves this problem, \nformer Senator Danforth and I last year, after the conclusion of the \nentitlement commission recommendation, made proposals that would have \nfixed this problem long term, that would have fixed not only the \nMedicare trust funds but would have fixed it so that we do not see \nhealth care entitlements as well as other entitlements continuing to \ngrow and erode our entire Federal budget. Mr. President, that is the \nmost important problem.\n  I think we are closer to consensus on many more things around here \nthan would sometimes meet the eye given the intensity of the political \nrhetoric. One of the things I believe that Democrats and Republicans \nnow share, at least in a general sense as to what our policies ought to \nbe, is that our policies ought to promote economic growth. We now \nunderstand that unless we have gains in productivity, unless we have \neconomic growth, it is rather difficult for us to do anything.\n  We see it in a recession. If you are in a recession, the revenues are \ndown; you have to cut your budget; you do not have money for roads; you \ndo not have money for schools; you do not have money for health care; \nyou do not have money for retirement.\n  The source of our revenue, whether it is for retirement or health \ncare or any other program that we fund, is the goods and services that \nare manufactured and produced by the American people, 117 million \npeople in our economy. If they are productive and they are selling and \nour economy is growing, that is the source of our revenue. It is the \nsource of Medicare revenue.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair knows, not only a gifted \nsurgeon but designated as a lead Senator I believe for the Republicans \nin coming up with some recommendations, understands that the entire \nsource of revenue for part A comes from a payroll tax. We have a tax on \npayroll. We also have income taxes that provide currently about 69 \npercent I believe of the total revenue of part B, the physician \nservices. In both of those cases, we have to have income. People are \nout there working in the workplace. We tax their wages to generate the \nmoney for part A, to pay hospital bills, and we tax their income to pay \nabout 60 percent, or almost 70 percent--it was 75-- \n\n[[Page S 13675]]\n\nabout 70 percent of the physician payments come from taxes on people's \nincome.\n  I make this point because it is that income that people produce in \nthe private sector which is our source to pay the doctor bills, to pay \nthe hospital bills. If we were in a recession, if we were not enjoying \na recovery right now, if rates of productivity were not up, we would \nnot have nearly as much money as we have to pay those entitlement \nobligations for hospitalization and for physician services.\n  A very important beginning observation, Mr. President, very \nimportant, because what is happening in the Federal budget--and, again, \nthere is consensus, I believe, amongst Republicans and Democrats. \nAlthough we may disagree at the margin on some programs as to whether \nor not they are useful or necessary, I think there is general agreement \nthat some expenditures on the part of the Federal Government, some \ncollecting of revenue that we do of taxpayer revenue and spending that \nwe do increases our productive capacity.\n  I am 52 years of age and started in business in 1973 officially. I \nmade a lot of money as a consequence of my parents having built the \ninterstate highway system with cash. It lowered my cost of doing \nbusiness. It enabled me to get products that I otherwise would not have \nbeen able to get. My customers could get to me easier than others. It \nincreased my business. That was an investment. That was a collective \ninvestment made with revenue we collected at the Federal level. We made \nit at the local level.\n  It is not the only one. Many of us believe that investments in \neducation, in infrastructure, in sewer, in water, in research, many of \nus believe that there are other investments that we can make, \nexpenditures in people for their work out there--we collect the money \nand we spend it--that some of these expenditures do in fact produce \nincreases in productivity and growth in our economy, thus providing us \nwith the revenue to fund entitlements.\n  The year that the current chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Hatfield, arrived in the U.S. Senate--and he is one of the best \nSenators that I have had the privilege to meet and to get to know--the \nyear that he arrived in the Senate, as you look at the Federal budget, \n70 percent of the budget was voted on and appropriated and 30 percent \nwas entitlement and net interest. This year, it is 67 percent \nentitlements and net interest and 33 percent appropriated, voted on and \nauthorized.\n  At the end of this budget resolution, at the end of the 7-year \nperiod, we will be down to 25 percent for appropriated accounts and 75 \npercent for entitlements and net interest, and when the baby boomers \nstart to retire some 6 years after this budget resolution, it drives \nclear off the charts. In approximately 15 years, we will have converted \nthe Federal Government into an ATM machine. All we will be doing is \ntransferring money. All we will be doing is paying doctors or paying \nhospitals or writing checks to retirees. That is all we will be doing. \nThere will be no money left for defense, no money left for the courts, \nno money left for law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, it is an unsustainable trend. It is an unsustainable \ntrend. And we have to interrupt it, as the Speaker said, with courage \nand with honesty, although I saw some evidence of his unwillingness, I \nthink, to hold to a very important standard in this entire debate.\n  The Republican proposal solves a 7-year problem, a budget problem for \nthe next 7 years. It is going to be very interesting to see what the \ntrustees say as far as how many years' additional slack we get as a \nconsequence of these changes. Is it going to push the default date or \nthe bankruptcy date, or whatever name you want to put on it, from 2002 \nback to 2005 or 2006? I guarantee it will not go much beyond 2008.\n  Mr. President, as I said, worst of all, the proposal does not say to \nthe American people that we have to fix the cost of all entitlements--\nand health care is the biggest and most rapidly growing of all of \nthem--we have to fix the cost of these entitlement programs so we have \nthe resources to be able to do--God willing, if Congress gets the \ncourage--the equivalent of the GI bill, the equivalent of the \ninterstate highway system, if we are willing to truly make those kinds \nof investments that produce long-term benefits to future generations. \nToday we could not afford to do it, and in the future we are going to \nbe able to afford even less.\n  Mr. President, this proposal does not go far enough. And I emphasize \nthat. I do not want any American--I watched the news today and the \nsound bites, Speaker Gingrich and leader Dole, and then leader Daschle \nand leader Gephardt, and Haley Barbour, on where are the Democrats and \nwhere are the Republicans. The general perception is being created \nearly in the debate that Republicans have a proposal and the Democrats \nare opposed to it.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to changing Medicare at all. There is \nan urgent need to do so. But I feel very strongly on this issue that \nthis proposal does not go as far as we ought to. I will not resist it \nbecause it cuts too much; I am going to resist it because the focus is \ntoo narrow of a timeframe.\n  Mr. President, we do not have time on our side. The earlier we make \nadjustments on this, the easier it will be to fix the overall costs of \nentitlements and the more likely we will give beneficiaries a time to \nplan.\n  I will give you an example. If we can reach agreement that we ought \nto fix the overall cost of entitlements, if we are going to say that to \nthe American people, let us say we are going to fix it at 70 percent. \nThat is still three points more than it currently is. Let us presume \nthat the Democrats and Republicans and Congress can get together and \nsay entitlements and net interest should not be more than 70 percent of \nour total interest. That is approximately where Senator Danforth and I \nended up with our proposal.\n  When you get into that, you are talking about the need to phase in a \nchange in the eligibility age from 65 to 70, perhaps providing an \nearlier eligibility, as we did to 62, requiring a larger payment for \nit, and allowing people to get insured, not making them wait until they \nare 70 to be eligible, but for full program benefits, if you want to \nsolve this long-term problem before the baby boomers start to go out.\n  God help us if we wait. I mean, we do not have the productive \ncapacity to generate the payroll tax revenue nor the income tax revenue \nto get that done. When the baby-boom generation starts to retire, the \npeople working per retiree is going to drop again. It is almost a 25-\npercent increase in the number of retirees in a single decade in \nNebraska while the population in general grows less than 2 percent.\n  We have got a tremendous new class of retirees in my--and I do not \nknow how old the occupant of the chair is. The occupant of the chair is \nsort of on the other edge of the baby-boom generation. When we retire, \nthe people supporting us will say, ``Oh, my gosh, you guys are \nexpensive.\n I didn't realize you cost so darn much.'' We are going to say, ``Well, \nwe have a COLA on our retirements, health care is more expensive now, \neven in the managed care environment.''\n\n  I heard on C-SPAN today the distinguished occupant of the chair was \nfiddling, I guess, not long ago with a member of the press and had a \npacemaker that he had invented and was trying to come up with a device \nthat was small enough to get into a baby's heart, because that is the \nkind of surgery he does.\n  Even in a managed environment, that is going to be expensive. I hope \nyou are successful in being able to discover a way to make that smaller \nfor those babies that need pacemakers. No matter what you do, if you \nwant high quality care, and I believe most Americans want high quality \nhealth care, even in a managed environment, it is likely to be \nexpensive.\n  Mr. President, we are going to need people in the work force \nproducing higher wages, producing higher output to have the revenue \nthat we need to pay for all of that. I daresay, if we do not do more \nthan what is in this Medicare Preservation Act of 1995, we are going to \nwish we had.\n  I am here on the floor, Mr. President, to say here is one Democrat \nthat does not look at the proposal and say you have done too much. This \nis one Democrat that comes to the floor to say we have not done enough.\n  I have looked at the general outline and see there are no changes in \nwhat the beneficiaries have to pay, other \n\n[[Page S 13676]]\n\nthan I suspect 7, 10, 12--there is going to be a higher part B premium \nin this thing and a means test that drops down to $75,000 a year.\n  I hope this does not degenerate to a situation where we are attacking \nthat kind of proposal and try to score points. It seems to me we have \nto come to the American people and say, ``All right, you made a good \nfaith effort to fix this thing inside the budget resolution, but for \nthose of us who have looked at this problem for a bit longer period of \ntime and a longer period of time out in the future, it behooves us to \ncome and say, ``I want to join this battle but not on the outside only \nhaving to make a criticism.''\n  I hope that the Republican majority will try to enlist people like \nmyself rather than trying to score this as a Republican victory saying \nthe Republicans alone are doing it. I hope you reach out to us. I hope \nleader Dole is either listening or staff is listening to this. Speaker \nGingrich, I forgive you for your intemperate remarks yesterday. I am \nnot going to stand on the floor of the Senate and say I am permanently \nangry, will not sit down and meet with Speaker Gingrich because he said \nI and other Democrats are morally bankrupt. We have a problem to solve. \nDeal us in and bring those of us--and there are others on this floor. I \nknow Senator Nunn feels this way, Senator Robb feels this way, Senator \nLieberman feels this way. There are many others. I am by no means an \nall-inclusive list.\n  We know we have a problem and we know the problem is much more than a \n7-year budget problem. We are able to look at the numbers. Let us \npresent the American people with the truth. Let us give them the facts \nas the Speaker said we should. Let us have the courage to give them all \nthe facts. Otherwise, Mr. President, in very short order, we will not \nhave Pell grants at all, we will not have student loans at all, we will \nnot have chapter 1, we will not have Head Start--all the sorts of \nthings this year we are anguishing because we do not have enough money \nto provide young people with, money they need to go to college--by the \nway, a cost that has gone up even faster than health care. We have \nfamilies in Nebraska taking out second mortgages on their homes so they \ncan go to college. We are cutting all that while we are funding larger \nand larger increases for retirement and health care.\n  Mr. President, we cannot continue it. I am standing here as a \nDemocrat saying I am willing to join with Republicans if you go \nfurther. Let us not retreat from this proposal. Let us take it further \nto solve this long-term problem, not only so that Medicare is preserved \nfor the long term, but so that we preserve our capacity to invest in \nthese young people who watch this occasionally who ask us what we are \ngoing to do for their future.\n  Let us make certain at the Federal level we have the capacity when we \nreach agreement, and very often we do, that education gets a job done; \nthat there are ways for us to increase productivity; that when we reach \nagreement on what ought to be done, that we have the fiscal capacity to \ndo it.\n  Unless we take this proposal and make it larger, I fear that all we \nare going to do is spend the next 60 days scoring perhaps some terrific \nand effective political points on who is doing what to whom on \nMedicare, but we will not have done what I consider to be an urgent \ntask, and that is fixing this entitlement problem once and for all.\n  I thank the distinguished occupant of the chair for his patience. \nAgain, I appreciate very much his personal work in health care and his \npolitical work now in health care. I hope, in fact, that the leadership \nwill open the doors a bit so those of us who do care deeply about this \nthing, who are willing to present facts, who are willing to tell the \ntruth, who are willing to suck up and use a little bit of our political \ncapital and courage are given an opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/15/senate-section/article/S13674-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1995, AT 9:45 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
