Mr. President, this morning I want to talk briefly about \ntwo subjects in morning business.\n  The first is the issue of Bosnia. I believe that President Clinton \nhas made the right decision in the last couple of days with respect to \nthe introduction of American troops into Bosnia. I know there was \ndiscussion by the White House and others about the potential of \ncommitting American troops under certain circumstances, particularly if \nUnited Nations peacekeepers need to redeploy within Bosnia. However, in \nthe last few days the administration has been saying that they have no \nintention of introducing American troops into Bosnia under that \ncircumstance.\n  Frankly, I think the moving of United States troops to Bosnia would \nbe a very serious mistake. It is true that the war in Bosnia is an \ninternational tragedy. It is also true, I think, that sending American \ntroops to Bosnia will do very little, if anything, to resolve that \ntragedy. This country's support of the efforts by the United Nations in \nBosnia has been significant. It has included flyovers and logistical \nsupport and other things. We should continue that kind of support. But \nI think the support should not include the sending of American troops \nto Bosnia. I believe it poses enormous risks to our troops and our \ncountry with the potential of very few gains for Bosnia.\n  We should expect, I think, that the Europeans, through NATO, will \nplay a significant role in responding to the issue of Bosnia. It is not \nas if this issue does not matter and it is not as if our country should \nbe isolationist. We are not isolationist, and what is happening in \nBosnia does matter. But under the term of internationalism, it ought \nnot [[Page S7652]] be suggested that this country must send troops \neverywhere in the world.\n  Bosnia is in the European neighborhood. We have spent a great deal of \nmoney and offered a great deal of support over the years to NATO. It \nseems to me that under the aegis of NATO and in the European Community \nwe should be able to expect a substantial commitment from the Europeans \nto try to resolve the issue of the current role in Bosnia. I notice \nthat is essentially what is now happening. The European countries are \ncommitting more and are getting involved in a more aggressive way to \nrespond to this, and I appreciate that because I think that is the way \nthis needs to be resolved.\n  I most especially do not think it is wise or appropriate to send \nUnited States troops to the ground in Bosnia. I think a couple of \ncenturies of history in the Balkans ought to tell us that foreign \npowers attempting to achieve certain goals in that region of the world \nhave generally paid a terrible cost and with none of their goals \nachieved.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the President of the United States has \nmade the right decision in the last couple of days. I support that \ndecision, and I hope that will remain the decision of the \nadministration as the months go by.\n  I do hope and pray for the sake of the people in that region that \nsomehow and some way this war can be stopped. As I have said, I think \nthe United States has participated and will participate in an \nappropriate way to the logistics and equipment, overflights, and other \napproaches under the aegis of the United Nations.\n  I think war is a tragedy always, but in this circumstance--I have \nbeen to what was formerly the country of Yugoslavia. I recall, in fact, \nwhen I was there, there was a forest fire in the country. I recall the \npeople of that region coming together, as people do in crisis \nsituations, and working together to try to respond to a natural \ndisaster.\n  It occurred to me that people of the then Yugoslavia are very much \nlike the people I grew up with in North Dakota, like the people of the \nUnited States--good, wonderful, hard-working people. Yet that society \nhas split apart, and we see in that former Yugoslavia now unspeakable \nhorrors of war visited upon so many families and innocent people. I \nhope and pray that one day there will be peace in that region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7651-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7652-S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HELP FOR THE FAMILY FARMERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week, when the Senate was not in \nsession and we had no votes, I was in North Dakota. In part of my visit \nto North Dakota, I visited my home county of Hettinger County, a \nrelatively small county in southwestern North Dakota. It is down in \nranching country, and there are also small farms. They raise a \nsubstantial amount of wheat.\n  I was reminded of the circumstances of rural America again. My home \ncounty lost 20 percent of its population in the 1980's, and it lost \nanother 11 percent of its population in the first half of the 1990's. \nThe fact is that rural counties--and, yes, Hettinger County, ND--is \nshrinking like a prune.\n  The farm bill that we have in this country to try to help family \nfarmers is not working. At least it is not working to keep family \nfarmers on the farm and make a decent living doing so. We are losing \nground in rural America.\n  It is a paradox that our cities are more crowded and exhibit all of \nthe problems of overcrowding at the same time that my home county, and \nvirtually every rural county throughout the Farm Belt, is losing \npopulation.\n  We are told that this is a global economy and that there are these \ndislocations. In a global economy, we are told, there are some winners \nand there are some losers, and rural areas are losers. I do not \nunderstand why a global economy means that the big get bigger and the \nrich get richer and the rest somehow get hurt; the small do not make \nit. I do not understand that. That is not an economy that makes sense \nto me. That is not an economy that equates reward with effort.\n  It seems to me that we ought to have an economy that rewards less \nspeculation and rewards more real production. Yet, the economy does not \nseem to do that. It is a high time these days on Wall Street, as all of \nus know, but it is hard times on Main Street of Hettinger County and \nsmall towns trying to make a go of it.\n  We have in a global economy the spectacle of American jobs going \noverseas, and those jobs that are left here are jobs paying less with \nfewer benefits. It is, we are told, a function of the global economy, \nthe economy of economic realities.\n  Well, it is not an economic reality which I am prepared to accept. I \ndo not think the people of the Farm Belt are prepared to accept it \neither.\n  We learned long ago in this country that just like the wagon trains \nthat forged west, you do not move ahead by leaving some behind. That \nwas a good lesson from the wagon trains because it is the only way they \ncould survive, and it is still a good lesson for our country today. We \ncannot, as a country, move ahead while leaving some behind.\n  I think that as we discuss this year the construction of a new 5-year \nfarm bill, we ought to think about that, what works to give family \nfarmers in America a decent opportunity to make a living so that we do \nnot see this exodus of the family farm to the major cities where \novercrowding already exists.\n  Well, the farm bill will be written now in the next 60 or 80 days, \nand the question is: What will it be? If it is like the last two farm \nbills, it will be the same but less of it. So it will be less of the \nsame. So you take something that simply does not work and say let us do \nless of it. It is a concept that does not make much sense to me.\n  The farm bill ought to be a farm bill that cares about family farmers \nand, if it does not, we ought not to have a farm bill at all; we do not \nneed it. The U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded under Abraham \nLincoln in the 1860's with nine employees. That behemoth now has over \n100,000 employees. In the last 15 years, we had about a 25-percent \ndecrease in farm population--that is, the number of people living on \nfarms--and about a 28-percent increase in the number of people running \nthe farm program. It not only does not work, it is so frightfully \ncomplicated that nobody in this country fully understands it.\n  So why do we not do it differently and construct a new farm program \nthat has as its preamble one central tenet, which is that we have a \nfarm program in this country to try to give an opportunity to family-\nsize farms to make a living.\n  Why is that necessary? Well, corporate agrifactories can farm \nsuccessfully because they have the economic strength to withstand two \nrisks that farmers face. The first is the risk that you may not get a \ncrop. You might have excessive rain or hail or insects. You might plant \na crop and get nothing.\n  The second risk is, if you get the crop, you may not get a price, \nbecause, in the meantime, international grain prices for wheat or \nbarley may have plummeted, and so you have a crop but no price. Those \ntwo risks are risks that the big agrifactories can stomach and can \novercome, but family-size farms do not have the financial strength to \ndo so.\n  So if we want in this country family farms producing our food, then \nwe must have some kind of a farm program. It is that simple.\n  Now, should the farm program be one that rewards the big folks at the \nexpense of the little folks? I do not think so. We have had a \nfundamental disconnection in the kind of farm program that we have had \nin this country.\n  We have believed that we can control the supply of grain and \ntherefore increase price. In order to do that, you want all of the \nfarmers in the country in the farm program, which means you especially \nwant the big farmers. If you get the big farmers in the farm program, \nyou spend most of your money on the big farmers. So most of the money \nfor the farm program has gone to the big farmers.\n  The fact is that we have not controlled supply and we have not \naffected price. Why? Because we plant less in this country and Canada \nplants more,\n Argentina plants more, the French plant more. So, it is a \nfundamentally flawed strategy.\n\n  We should decide now to disconnect from it and not do any of that. We \nshould decide that the farm program ought to be a mechanism by which we \nwill provide decent prices to the output of a family-size farm. \n[[Page S7653]] \n  In the current farm program there is a circumstance where the Prince \nof Liechtenstein was paid farm program benefits to a farm in Texas. \nDoes anybody think the Prince of Liechtenstein is a Texas farmer? Of \ncourse not.\n  We had a bunch of Texans, a farmer coalition, so they could farm in \nMontana. They plowed a bunch of ground and seeded it by helicopter. \nThey were not farming the land. They were farming the farm program, so \nthey could get $20,000, $40,000, or 50,000 payments each.\n  We have a national newsman in this country that everyone probably has \nread about recently--who I assume lives in Washington, DC--gets $90,000 \nunder the wool and mohair program. I bet that newsman does not live \nwith the sheep most of the year. He is living in Washington, DC, or New \nYork City. It seems to me the farm program ought to be targeted to \nfamily-size farms.\n  Now what I propose is a new approach, and I hope the Senate \nAgriculture Committee will look at it. I think it will do the right \nthing and save the Government money. I propose we structure farm \nprogram price benefits or farm program price supports or the safety net \nfor farm programs, so that the strongest price goes to the first \nincrement of production.\n  We say if a farmer raises 20,000 bushels of wheat, we provide a price \nof $4.50 a bushel. We hope the farmer gets money from the marketplace, \nbut if not, we provide $4.50 for the bushel for the first 20,000 \nbushels of wheat, and that is all the money we have. We are sorry. If \nthey want to farm the whole county, God bless you, they have every \nright to farm the whole county, but the Federal Government does not \nhave to be the financial partner beyond the first 20,000 bushels. If a \nfarmer wants to farm beyond that level, they are on their own.\n  That ought to be the case in all farm programs.\n  In the dairy program, I have never understood, for example, why there \nis need to support a dairy operation in California that milks 3,500 \ncows every day. I do not know if anybody here has milked a cow. I have \nmilked a cow, but if you milk 3,500 cows a day and get a price support \nunder every gallon of milk you pull from the cows, that just does not \nmake sense.\n  It seems to me if we have price supports for milk, we say we might \nprovide a decent price support for the milk from 80 cows. That is hard \nwork for a farmer running a farm. However, if a farmer wants to buy the \n81st cow, guess what? When they sit on the milk stool, do a little \nmilking, those farmers would be milking on their own risk.\n  I think that is what we ought to do with the farm program. If we are \nnot willing to recognize that the farm program is one that is designed \nto try to help the family farmers stay on the farm--and those are \nimportant things to care about from social and economic policy \nreasons--if that is not the purpose of it, I say we should get rid of \nthe farm program.\n  We do not need to provide a stimulant for corporate agrifactories to \nplow. They will plow. Corporations will plow the whole country. As soon \nas they have plowed the whole country and cornered the supply of food, \nguess what? Go to the grocery store and see what the price of food will \nbe. The corporations of this country will darn sure make certain that \nconsumers would be paying well above the cost of production for food.\n  Of course, now we do not do that. We go to the store and buy a box of \nelbow macaroni. Let us see how that relates to the price of durum \nwheat. Somebody out on a farm raises durum wheat and he grinds it into \nsemolina flour, and the semolina flour is produced into elbow macaroni.\n  I can show when the price of durum wheat goes down 2 bucks a bushel, \nthe price of elbow macaroni goes up. I can show when the price of wheat \ngoes down the price of cereal goes up. I can show that the snap, \ncrackle, and pop in Rice Krispies often brings more to the people that \nproduce the snap and the crackle, than the person that produces the \nrice.\n  It is the same with puffed wheat. The puffer gets more than the \nwheat. It is the same with corn flakes. The flaker gets more than the \nperson that rides the tractor and raises the corn.\n  That is the way things have worked. It is not right.\n  We have an opportunity this year to write a farm program that \nproduces the right result. Now for social and economic reasons, this \ncountry ought to care about who produces its foodstuffs. It ought to \ncare about the Farm Belt. It ought to care about preserving a network \nof family farmers. For that reason, we ought to have a safety net--not \nfor a set of golden arches or for the largest agrifactories--but, a \nsafety net for family farmers.\n  We can do that. We can do it in a responsible and reasonable way--and \nwe can save the taxpayers' money at the same time--if we simply decide \nthe current farm program is not working and we construct a new farm \nprogram, a better farm program, one that gives some hope to family \nfarmers for a change.\n  It is interesting that with all the discussion around this town about \nreform and reinventing, the odds are that unless things change in the \nnext 60 or 80 days, we will see the same old tired, failed policies \nwith respect to agriculture.\n  I hope that the proposal that I am making this year--the legislative \nproposal for targeting farm program support prices to family-sized \nfarms--and the roles by others that try to really substantially reform \nthe farm program will this year give us a change. It does not make \nsense to do less of the same, when the same does not work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have just returned from my State of \nSouth Dakota, where I listened to the farmers, small businessmen, \nstudents, wives, and citizens of South Dakota for 9 days. I found many \nwere thanking me for voting for the balanced budget resolution, the \nDomenici-Dole budget that passed the U.S. Senate about 2 weeks ago. The \npeople of our country want change. They want us to do something about \nthe huge deficit that has been built up and they feel we have taken the \nfirst step. The message I heard loud and clear was, ``Please take the \nsecond and third steps now.''\n  For the first time since I have been in the Senate, this body passed \na real budget that will move us toward a balanced budget in the year \n2002. But even with a balanced budget in 2002, we will still have a \nhuge deficit. In some of my high school graduation speeches, I \npredicted they will have to pay a tax surcharge on their income taxes \nfor most of their lives to help pay down the Federal deficit, or at \nleast pay interest on it.\n  I know the dullest story in the world probably is the Federal \ndeficit, but cattlemen are aware that our budget that we passed here, \nif we stick to it, will result in lower interest rates. It will also \nresult in a stable dollar so that there can be international trade. \nSenior citizens understand that the cuts in Medicare are merely a cut \nin the rate of increase. Medicare has been increasing at a 10-percent \nincrease. This budget allows about a 7-percent increase, and it \nprovides for streamlining, doing away with fraud and abuse, and other \nsteps within Medicare and Medicaid so they can still provide solid \nservice.\n  Even the Democrats' study predicted that Medicare would go bankrupt \nby the year 2000 unless something is done. I find it very strange that \nmany are criticizing the Domenici-Dole budget but they did not provide \nan alternative here on the Senate floor. There was the alternative of \nPresident Clinton which every Member of this Chamber voted against.\n  I do not mean to be partisan, but I would say I am very proud and I \nhave found my constituents thankful that Congress has finally started \nto address the budgetary deficit problem. There is also a strong \nfeeling among senior citizens that to keep our currency solvent, our \ndollar stable, and to avoid inflation is worth a great deal to them. \nThis budget will start to do that if we stick to it. [[Page S7654]] \n  So the message I got from my constituents was, ``Thank you for the \nvote on the balanced budget that went through the Senate.'' But they \nare a little nervous about us. They say, ``You are on second base. Keep \ngoing.'' So that is the message I bring back from my constituents. I \nthink it is an important one to our Nation, because it is our No. 1 \ndomestic problem, the unbalanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the Senate passed a budget \nresolution designed to eliminate the Federal deficit over the next 7 \nyears. The House passed its version of that budget the week before.\n  While there are some major differences in those budgets, particularly \non tax cuts and defense spending and domestic discretionary spending, \nthere is one common feature, and that is a proposed drastic cut in \nFederal support for civilian research and development. That is across \nGovernment.\n  There has been very little attention paid to this part of the budget \nbalancing effort so far. The public attention has been concentrated on \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, and tax cuts for the wealthy. But this \nissue, these drastic cuts in Federal support for civilian research and \ndevelopment, may be the place where the Republican budgets that have \nbeen passed through the two Houses will do the most damage to our \nNation's future well-being and prosperity.\n  Overall, civilian research and development spending will be cut 30 to \n40 percent by the year 2002 to a four-decade low as a percentage of our \neconomy. Some agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, \nperhaps the National Institutes of Health, may be cut only at the \ninflation rate during the next 7 years, but all others--that is, NASA, \nthe Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, EPA--all appear \nto be slated for much deeper reductions.\n  For those who are not familiar with the budget process here--I am \nsure there are some who are watching who may not be--let me explain why \nwe cannot be more specific about the effect of these budgets at this \npoint. The budget resolutions that are still being considered in \nconference make many assumptions about Federal programs. The only \nbinding assumption which came out of what we did here in the Senate and \nin the House is the assumption that affects civilian-applied research \nwith regard to the domestic discretionary spending cap. In fiscal year \n1995, this current year, that cap is $257 billion for total domestic \ndiscretionary spending. Under the Senate version of the budget in 2002, \nit will be $234 billion, or a 10-percent reduction. That is a 10-\npercent reduction coupled with 7 years of no inflationary adjustment. \nUnder the House version, the domestic discretionary spending total in \n2002 is even lower. In the House version, it will be $229 billion.\n  If civilian research is treated on average like all other programs in \nthis larger category, this domestic discretionary spending category, \nwhich I would assume is really the best case that we could hope for, if \nthat were to be the case, then that research and development funding \nwould be cut 30 percent in real terms. If other programs, such as \nhighway funding, law enforcement, and veterans programs are protected \nfrom cuts when funding is finally allocated by the Appropriations \nCommittees, the cuts in research and development could reach 40 percent \nin real terms.\n  Mr. President, I am tempted to ask what the research community in \nthis country has done or failed to do to deserve this type of treatment \nat this stage in our Nation's history. The research community won the \ncold war for us. They put men on the moon, they revolutionized \nmedicine, they invented computers, they pioneered electronics and \nsemiconductor devices. They invented a myriad of new materials that \nhave fundamentally changed our lives.\n  This is just as Vannevar Bush, who was one of the giants in the post-\nWorld War II generation in science, predicted in his report, ``Science: \nThe Endless Frontier,'' about half a century ago. Bush had the wisdom \nto know nearly 50 years ago that new scientific and technological \nfields would emerge that he could not yet imagine --semiconductor \nelectronics, for example, or molecular biology and the material \nsciences, just to name three. Bush had the vision to see that Federal \ninvestments in science and technology could transform our lives and \ncontribute to our health and the standard of living and the security of \nall Americans.\n  Federal investment in civilian research and development did not cause \nthe Federal deficit. In fact, it is quite the opposite.\n  Mr. President, here is a chart that I want to direct my colleagues' \nattention to. It shows civilian research and development as a \npercentage of gross domestic product during the 40-year period from \n1961 through the year 2001 or 2002. In 1969, which is the last Federal \nbudget that we had that was in balance, Federal civilian research \nspending was .76 percent of gross domestic product, about in this \nrange. With the sole exception of the Bush administration, it has \ntrended lower for the last quarter of a century. In 1995, it is \nestimated at about .46 percent of gross domestic product, the same as \nit was in 1992.\n  In the year 2002, under this budget resolution that passed both the \nHouse and now a different one in the Senate, but the same in this \nregard, in the year 2002, it will be about .27 percent under these \nRepublican budgets. That assumes the best case, as I mentioned earlier; \nthat is, that research is treated on averages the same as other \ndomestic discretionary programs.\n  It is not just that our civilian research investments have not caused \nour current deficit. More importantly, there is almost universal \nrecognition that these investments have paid for themselves many times \nover by the growth that they have contributed to our economy. It is not \nan accident that American industries, from aerospace to agriculture to \nelectronics to pharmaceuticals, enjoy world leadership. Federal \ncivilian research investments are truly investments in the Nation's \nfuture. Mr. President, in my view, it is folly to be cutting them to \nthis extent over the next 7 years as we enter this new century.\n  The cuts in Federal support for civilian research will almost surely \nnot be made up in the private sector. The Wall Street Journal on May 22 \nreported on deep cuts being made by AT, by General Electric, by IBM, \nKodak, Texaco, and Xerox in their research budgets. The reason: \nPrivate-sector firms have an ever narrower focus and an ever greater \nunwillingness to invest in long-term research projects, the benefits of \nwhich are uncertain, and usually the benefits of which are not \ncapturable by any single firm alone.\n  The governments of our major economic rivals, Japan and Germany, \nrecognize the importance of civilian research investments. Let me show \nyou another chart, Mr. President. This chart compares the three \ncountries in 1992. It shows that in 1992, the German Government \ninvested .9 percent of gross domestic product that year in civilian \nresearch, over in the right. The Japanese Government invested .5 \npercent, directly and indirectly. Neither [[Page S7655]] country shows \nany sign that it is joining us in planning to slash investment in \nresearch spending. It is quite the opposite. They and the other \nindustrial countries around the world are seeking to emulate the \nsuccessful American model of the last half century in science and \ntechnology, just as we seem bent on abandoning that model.\n  Our research universities, our Federal laboratories, and our \ninvestments in small business research and innovation are the envy of \nthe world. Under the Republican budgets, we risk losing a generation of \nresearch and of young researchers, since the best students will be \ndiverted to other professions by the grim job prospects awaiting them \nin research careers.\n  Mr. President, it is worthwhile to ask how we got ourselves into this \nfix, and how we can get out of it. That is something I believe will be \ndiscussed here in the coming months as we talk about these budgets.\n  What we have seen over the last 2 years is the almost complete \nfracturing of bipartisan consensus which was forged during the Reagan \nand Bush administrations on the appropriate Federal role in civilian \nresearch and development. The consensus was that the Federal role \nshould stop at precompetitive development activity, which should be \nconducted on a cost-shared basis, with industry putting up at least \nhalf the money. One test of the precompetitive nature of the research \nwas whether some of our industry's intense rivals, such as Intel and \nMotorola, in the case of Sematech, which most of us are familiar with, \ncould collaborate in a single effort. Everyone agreed that the Federal \nrole should not include helping individual firms to get specific \nproducts to the commercial marketplace.\n  Indeed, the very term, ``precompetitive development,'' was \nfirst coined by President Bush in a speech that he gave to the American \nElectronics Association in February of 1990. He was seeking to \ndistinguish the technology policy that he was pursuing in his \nadministration from the industrial policies of his predecessors in the \n1970's--for example, the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, supersonic \ntransport, and the Synfuels Corporation.\n  President Bush spoke proudly during the 1992 campaign of his efforts \nto expand civilian applied research through a series of new, high \npayoff investments in critical technologies:\n  A high performance computing and communications initiative; an \ninitiative to improve the manufacturing and performance of materials; \nan expanded program in biotechnology research; the establishment of the \nU.S. advanced battery consortium, which was to be funded for 4 years; a \nsignificant increase in our aeronautics research budgets; and the \nestablishment of seven regional manufacturing technology centers for \nthe distribution of modern manufacture of tools and know-how.\n  This notion of what the appropriate role of the Federal Government in \nresearch is and is not was supported in numerous pieces of legislation \npassed since 1980 with bipartisan sponsorship and with the blessing of \nthe Reagan and the Bush administrations. The vast majority of that \nlegislation passed this body unanimously.\n  Indeed, the American bipartisan consensus of 1992 on the appropriate \nrole of Government in civilian research and development was \nincorporated in late 1993 into the Uruguay round subsidies code, and it \nis now the world norm that governments can fund the full cost of basic \nresearch, they can fund up to 75 percent of the cost of applied \nresearch that is relevant to industry and up to 50 percent of the cost \nof precompetitive development. They can do all of that without risking \ntrade sanctions. Any development subsidies beyond that precompetitive \nstage are fully sanctionable, as they should be.\n  Unfortunately, by late 1993, this bipartisan consensus that I have \nreferred to had been fractured. As President Clinton and Vice President \nGore pursued a science and technology policy almost identical to \nPresident Bush's and did so with real commitment, which I commend them \nfor, our debate suddenly reverted to the sort of bumper sticker level \nwhich we had mistakenly thought was behind us. Charges of industrial \npolicy, charges of picking winners and losers were affixed to a broad \nrange of civilian research programs.\n  By early this year, the bumper sticker pejorative had become \ncorporate welfare. That is a phrase which, unfortunately, was \npopularized earlier this year when Secretary of Labor Bob Reich used it \nto refer to tax incentives, tax subsidies of various kinds.\n  Republican leaders argued, mistakenly, that Federal support for \nresearch in areas from aeronautics to computers to health to energy to \nagriculture and the environment was somehow illegitimate, either \nbecause it was corporate welfare or it represented some type of \nindustrial policy. It was merely seen as a duplication of private \nsector efforts.\n  As David Sanger, who has reported on these issues for many years, \npointed out in an article in the business section of the New York Times \non May 23--this is a quote from his article:\n\n       Such arguments underscore the sharp difference in the way \n     technology and trade policy is dealt with in Washington and \n     in the capitals of its major economic competitors, where \n     trade is considered national security and ``picking winners \n     and losers'' is a phrase with no political resonance.\n\n  Mr. President, the overall budget prospects facing civilian research \nin this country in the years ahead demonstrate just how high a \npolitical resonance this issue seems to have taken on today, at least \nin some parts of the political spectrum.\n  I do not believe this course we have charted for ourselves in these \nbudget resolutions makes sense for the Nation, and as my colleagues \nknow I led an effort during the debate on the budget to make spending \non research, technology and related trade promotion and trade law \nenforcement programs a high priority in the allocation of funds for the \nnext 7 years. The amendment would have put the Senate on record in \nfavor of maintaining the overall fiscal year 1995 level for these \nprograms. It would have conceded that there would be no inflationary \nadjustment during that period. But it would at least have tried to keep \nin place existing funding. It would have put the Senate on record \nagainst any net tax cuts unless we could first achieve that goal.\n  The amendment did not seek to allocate funds within any of the \nvarious civilian research agencies. That would have been left, as it \nshould be, to the authorizing and appropriating committees.\n  By the year 2002, even under the amendment I offered, Federal \ncivilian research and development investments would be at a four-decade \nlow as a percentage either of Federal spending or of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Mr. President, this first chart I put up before makes that point very \ndramatically. It shows that we would have the lowest level of spending, \nthe lowest percentage of spending of our gross domestic product on \ncivilian research we have had in four decades.\n  It would not have fixed the problem of sustaining our investments at \nthe level that our economic competitors will be investing. Even if the \namendment had been adopted, in 2002 we would still be spending slightly \nmore than half of what the Japanese Government spends and about a third \nof what the German Government spends as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Unfortunately, this very modest effort was defeated here on the \nSenate floor by a vote of 53 to 47, with all Republicans except Senator \nJeffords voting in opposition and all Democrats voting in favor.\n  I also supported a comprehensive fair-share budget, which was a \nsubstitute offered by my colleague, Senator Conrad, that would have \nbalanced the budget while preserving funds for domestic discretionary \nprograms. The fair-share budget provided $36 billion in additional \ndiscretionary funds in 2002 for research, education, and other \npriorities by limiting the growth of tax loopholes for wealthy \ncorporations and individuals. That also failed on a 60-to-39 vote, \nlargely along party lines.\n  Almost a century ago, in 1899, the head of the Patent Office, Charles \nDuell, is purported to have proposed to close up shop at the Patent \nOffice because, in his opinion, ``everything that can be invented has \nbeen invented.'' A half century later, Vannevar Bush laid out his \nstarkly different vision for the Federal role in science and \ntechnology.\n  Now, as we prepare to enter the 21st century, we face a choice \nbetween those two competing visions. Because I believe that the \nscientific and the technological frontier is still endless, just \n[[Page S7656]] as it was 50 years ago, and because I do not want to \nrisk condemning our children and grandchildren to a less prosperous and \nless healthy and less secure future, I intend to continue fighting for \nFederal research investments even as we continue working toward a \nbudget resolution.\n  I hope we can restore the bipartisan support for these programs that \nwas there until very recently, and I hope we can do so before serious \ndamage is done to the programs. I am afraid this is going to take not \njust months but perhaps even years.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak. I yield the floor, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7654-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE LATE JAMES C.

On May 4, James \nC. ``Jim'' Self--successful businessman, committed public servant, \nconcerned community leader, and dedicated family man--was tragically \nkilled in a traffic accident which no one could have anticipated.\n  Respected for his position as chairman of the board of Greenwood \nMills Inc., Mr. Self was born and raised in Greenwood and went on to \nearn a bachelor of arts degree from Clemson University and a masters of \nbusiness administration from the University of South Carolina. \nThroughout his life, Mr. Self established a well deserved reputation as \na civic leader whose activities included service on the Greenwood board \nof Bankers Trust, the State board of NCNB, and the boards of Benedict \nCollege, Junior Achievement, and the Greenwood YMCA. In addition, Mr. \nSelf served on the Governor's Review Board under John West, for which \nhe was awarded the South Carolina Order of the Palmetto. He was also a \nmember of the First Baptist Church of Greenwood.\n  Let us make certain that we remember with respect and admiration the \nsubstantial contributions this outstanding citizen made to his family, \nhis community, and the State of South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for all those who knew Jim Self when I \nsay that he will be missed greatly. My deepest sympathies go out to his \nwife--Linda Coleman Self--and children--Linda Elizabeth Self, James C. \nSelf III, and Furman Coleman Self--and the entire Self family, \nincluding his distinguished father--Mr. James C.

Mr. President, during my tenure as a Member of this \ndistinguished body, I have had the pleasure of serving with many \nindividuals of impressive character and ability. Few, however, \npossessed the unwavering commitment to principle and public service \ndemonstrated by Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who passed away this week \nat her home in Skowhegan. I would like to offer her family and friends \nmy deepest condolences for their loss, a loss suffered by our entire \nNation.\n  After an accomplished career of 8 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, Mrs. Smith was first elected to the Senate in 1948 and \nserved four consecutive terms. A political leader of national stature, \nher substantial talents earned her a prominent role in Republican \nPresidential contests.\n  Mrs. Smith brought grace and wisdom to this Chamber as a dedicated \nrepresentative of the people. An intrepid spirit characterized her work \nas a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on which I had the \npleasure of serving with her. At all times, the safety and prosperity \nof the Nation were her sole objectives, and she worked to ensure that \nthe United States was always prepared to defend liberty against any \nenemy.\n  When our Nation was gripped in turmoil, Mrs. Smith was quick to \nsupply raging debates with needed perspective and calming insights. She \npersonified the very best qualities that define the American character \nand applied those commendable attributes to all of her work as a Member \nof this institution.\n  Mr. President, I am confident I speak for all of us who knew Margaret \nChase Smith when I say that she will be greatly missed. Her legacy is a \nstandard of public service toward which every Member of the U.S. Senate \nshould strive, and my sympathies go out to all those touched by her \nwarmth and intelligence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7656-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE LATE JAMES BOYD ``JIM'' KLUTTZ\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

His tenure with the paper began in 1966, and Mr. Kluttz \nphotographed and reported upon the people and places of Laurens County \nfor the next 15 years.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 735) to prevent and punish acts of terrorism, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Hatch Amendment No. 1199, in the nature of a substitute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1199\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues that we hope to \ncomplete action on this bill very quickly, and I am asking my \ncolleagues on each side--I think there are 67 amendments on the \nDemocratic side, 30-some on the Republican side--to see if we cannot \nlimit the number of amendments. We will also file cloture today and try \nto get consent to vote on that cloture motion tomorrow in an effort to \nexpedite this bill.\n  Immediately after the tragic events in Oklahoma City, I wrote to \nPresident Clinton expressing my hope that we could put aside \npartisanship and develop an antiterrorism plan all Americans could \nsupport. Just as partisan [[Page S7657]] politics stopped at the \nwater's edge during World War II, it has always been my view that \npartisan politics should stop at ``evil's edge'' in our war against \nterrorism.\n  During the past several weeks, I have had the opportunity to discuss \nthis issue directly with the President. Our staffs have shared ideas. \nWe have introduced our own legislative plans. And Senator Hatch, \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, has had several important \nhearings. The proposal now before the Senate is a culmination of all \nthese efforts: Democrats, Republicans, the President, staff input. This \nis a bipartisan plan. It reflects many Republican ideas, and it \ncontains many of the initiatives endorsed and sought by President \nClinton himself--prohibitions on fundraising for foreign terrorist \norganizations; the Alien Terrorist Removal Act, which is designed to \ndeport alien terrorists in a prompt manner without disclosing vital \nnational security information; and increased funding for the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies.\n  Now, last week we brought this up before the recess first, I think, \nfor the record. So we had this almost filibuster on the budget with \ntons of amendments that took, I do not know how many, 10, 20 hours to \nvote on the amendments. That lost us 24 hours in the process. By \ndesign? I do not know, but it happened and we wasted a lot of time.\n  I told the President I wanted to pass this bill on the Senate side \nbefore the Memorial Day recess, and we did bring it up. And then we \nwere flooded with amendments, again maybe by design and maybe not. But \nthe President is the leader of the Democratic Party. He said last week, \n``There are too many amendments (to the Senate bill) that threaten too \nmuch delay.''\n  I happen to agree with the President on that, but I have not seen any \nevidence of any active engagement by the White House in the legislative \nprocess on the other side of the aisle. The last count was, as I said, \n67, 69.\n  The bottom line is that words of complaint will not be enough. \nComplaining about delay may make for good politics, but what we need \nfrom the President is not words but leadership.\n I want to fulfill the President's request. I want to pass the \nantiterrorism bill promptly, without delay. But if we are going to \naccomplish this goal, the President will have to move off the sidelines \nand get into the game, as we need his help. It is not enough to make \nthe speeches, not enough to make the radio addresses, not enough to say \nwhatever. We ought to pass it. But particularly in the U.S. Senate, \nwhere any group of Senators can slow things down--and we have had \nalmost a record performance this year by my colleagues on the other \nside--this happens to be a bill that is not partisan. It is bipartisan. \nIt is something that the President claims credit for. It seems to me it \nwould be in his interest to have somebody up here trying to make \ncertain that we pass the bill.\n\n  If we do not complete action by the close of business tomorrow, I \nwill have no other choice but to withdraw the antiterrorism bill and \nmove on to other legislative business. If we can get consent to vote on \ncloture tomorrow, we will find out how many people really want this \nbill, or whether this bill will become a Christmas tree where everybody \nhas a political agenda and they want to put it on the antiterrorism \nbill. I believe that would be a grave mistake. We have a full plate \nhere in the Senate. We have telecommunications, and I promised both \nSenators Pressler and Hollings for the last 2 or 3 weeks that we would \nlike to finish that this week. We have welfare reform and regulatory \nreform, just to name a few. All of these will take some time.\n  We do not have time to get bogged down for 3 weeks on a very \nimportant bill with amendments that are not important at all, for the \nmost part, and just making statements or having votes when the \namendments could be accepted. I have heard that many of the amendments \nwill be accepted. Let us not waste 20 or 30 minutes on rollcall votes \non 15 or 20 amendments that can be accepted. It seems to me that if our \ncolleagues want to pass this bill, accepting it is just as good as \nhaving a vote, and we can save a lot of time.\n  We will be in late tonight, and votes will start at 5 o'clock. It is \nnot in the interests of the American people to delay. We can always \nreturn to the antiterrorism bill, and this might be something to do \nduring the August recess if we cannot get it done now. We are going to \nbe here for part of August, no doubt about it. Maybe this will be a \npriority during the first 2 or 3 weeks during what might have been the \nAugust recess.\n  Mr. President, of all the antiterrorist proposals under \nconsideration, habeas corpus bears perhaps most directly on the tragic \nevents in Oklahoma City. If we really want justice that is ``swift, \ncertain, and severe,'' as President Clinton urged, then we must stop \nthe endless appeals and endless delays that have done so much to weaken \npublic confidence of our system of criminal justice.\n  According to Princeton Prof. John Diiulio, more than 330,000 \nAmericans were murdered during the 16 years between 1977 and 1993. Yet, \nduring the same period, only 2,716 people were placed on death row and \nonly 226 convicted killers have actually been executed. In America, \ntoday there is clearly a big disconnect between crime and punish.\n  Our habeas corpus reform proposal seeks to bridge this gap by \nimposing a 1-year filing deadline on all death row inmates, State or \nFederal. It limits convicted killers in State or Federal court to one \nhabeas petition. That is one bite at the apple. In contrast, under \ncurrent law, there is virtually no limit to the number of petitions a \nconvicted killer may file. It requires the Federal courts, once a \npetition is filed, to complete judicial action within a specified \nperiod of time.\n  In fact, if the Federal Government prosecutes the Oklahoma City case \nand the death penalty is sought and imposed, the execution of the \nsentence could take as little as 1 year if these reforms are enacted \ninto law. Otherwise, it might take 5, 10, 15 years. It seems to me it \nis a step that ought to be taken, a step the President talked about on \n``60 Minutes.'' Somebody said he wanted habeas corpus reform. Habeas \ncorpus reform is an essential component of any serious antiterrorism \nplan. The relatives of some of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing \nhave traveled all the way to Washington today to make this very point. \nIn fact, I think there is a press conference going on as I speak. They \nwant Congress to act on these reforms and act now. That is the view \nalso shared by a bipartisan group of State attorneys general, including \nDrew Edmondson, the Democratic attorney general of Oklahoma.\n  In a recent letter to President Clinton, these attorneys general \nwrite:\n\n       Expedited consideration of [habeas corpus reform] \n     legislation in the context of the antiterrorism bill is \n     entirely appropriate. Unless habeas corpus reform is enacted, \n     capital sentences for such acts of senseless violence will \n     face endless legal obstacles. This will undermine the \n     credibility of the sanctions and the expression of our level \n     of opprobrium as a Nation for acts of terrorism.\n\n  Despite his positive comments about habeas reform in a ``60 Minutes'' \ninterview, President Clinton has written me urging me to exclude habeas \ncorpus reform. One day he is for it, and the next day he says exclude \nit. Do not bring it in now because it might upset some of the liberals \non the other side of the aisle.\n  The President has publicly chided Members of the Senate for refusing \nto endorse his ``emergency wiretap'' proposal; yet, strangely enough, \nthe President himself refuses to endorse the one proposal that will \nbear most directly on the Oklahoma City tragedy--and that is habeas \ncorpus reform.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the American people deserve the straight \nstory, and the straight story is that America is not an impregnable \nfortress. No legislation, no matter how well-intentioned, no matter how \nwell-conceived, can guarantee absolute security. We can take every \npossible precaution. We can pass tough laws. But in a free society \nthere will always be risks--a fact of life vividly demonstrated by the \nrecent breaches of White House security.\n  I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, \nfor his leadership in developing an antiterrorism plan. During the past \nseveral weeks, he has provided the intellectual glue that has kept this \neffort together. I also thank my distinguished colleagues from \nOklahoma, \n[[Page S7658]] Senators Nickles and Inhofe, for their input and for \ntheir role in developing this antiterrorism plan. We all know this has \nbeen a very difficult time for them and their constituents. So we are \nespecially appreciative of their invaluable help.\n  I had a conversation with Senator Biden from Delaware before we went \nout for the recess. I believe he wants to complete action on this bill \nas quickly as possible. I think with his cooperation, and with some \nhelp from the White House and with help on this side on Republican \namendments, we can wrap this bill up. There is no reason we could not \nfinish it today, or certainly by tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I sent to President Clinton \nlast Thursday be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DOLE. The letter suggests that the President should help us out \non this bill. He could call his Democratic colleagues, maybe have a \nWhite House meeting, and see if we cannot complete action on this bill. \nThe House has not acted. But that does not mean we cannot act. We can \nact first for a change.\n  I say to my colleagues, let us expect a number of votes. I do not see \nthe managers here, but I think they are in a press conference with some \nfamily members of the victims of the Oklahoma City tragedy. I say, \nagain, if the amendments can be accepted and if there is no problem \nwith the amendments, let us not have votes like that at 7, or 8, or 9 \no'clock tonight.\n  With all the good will I can muster, I believe this is an important \nbill, important for the American people, important for the victims' \nfamilies and those involved in Oklahoma City. Also, it is important \nthat we get it done. I am certainly willing to work with the President \nin an effort to do that by the close of business tomorrow.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 1, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you may know, the Senate is \n     currently scheduled to resume consideration of the anti-\n     terrorism bill when we return on Monday, June 5. Under a \n     unanimous consent agreement adopted last Friday, a total of \n     99 amendments to the bill are in order (32 Republican \n     amendments and 67 Democratic amendments).\n       I am now in the process of urging my Republican colleagues \n     not to offer any unnecessary or unrelated amendments. \n     Hopefully, these efforts will pay off and we will be able to \n     reduce the number of Republican amendments to a manageable \n     level. During the remainder of this week, it is my hope that \n     you will exert similar pressure on the Democrats in the \n     Senate, particularly in light of your complaint yesterday \n     that ``there are too many amendments that threaten too much \n     delay.''\n       Mr. President, if you really want Congress to pass the \n     anti-terrorism bill as promptly as possible, words will not \n     be enough. Your active involvement in discouraging Democratic \n     Senators from offering unnecessary and unrelated amendments \n     is absolutely essential.\n       I hope you would also call upon Congress to pass meaningful \n     habeas corpus reform as part of the anti-terrorism proposal \n     now pending before the Senate. Of all the anti-terrorism \n     initiatives under consideration, it is perhaps habeas corpus \n     reform that bears most directly on the tragic events in \n     Oklahoma City. In fact, if the federal government prosecutes \n     the Oklahoma City case and the death penalty is sought and \n     imposed, the execution of the sentence could take as little \n     as one year if the reforms in the pending legislation are \n     enacted into law.\n       Not surprisingly, a bipartisan group of State Attorneys \n     General, including Drew Edmondson, the Democratic Attorney \n     General of Oklahoma, has written that ``expedited \n     consideration of [habeas corpus reform] legislation in the \n     context of the anti-terrorism bill is entirely appropriate. \n     Unless habeas corpus reform is enacted, capital sentences for \n     such acts of senseless violence will face endless legal \n     obstacles. This will undermine the credibility of the \n     sanctions, and the expression of our level of opprobrium as a \n     nation for acts of terrorism.''\n       Finally, I was struck by how your radio address last \n     Saturday characterized the anti-terrorism legislation now \n     pending before the Senate. The address described the \n     legislation in very personal terms, as ``my proposal,'' ``my \n     anti-terrorism bill,'' ``the legislation I proposed.'' With \n     all due respect, Mr. President, this legislation is a \n     bipartisan product, incorporating many initiatives proposed \n     by Republicans and Democrats alike. The simple fact is that \n     the anti-terrorism plan now before the Senate does not belong \n     to any one party or any one political figure. It belongs to \n     the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Dole.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7656-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7658-S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me indicate I will be speaking with the \nDemocratic leader to see if we cannot have a vote on this tomorrow. I \ndid not file the motion on the Friday before we went out because I \nthought at that point there would be a lot of progress made during the \nrecess. I am not certain what progress has been made, but this is just \nthe final attempt on the part of the majority leader to try to pass \nthis bill.\n  We will find out how many people really want to pass the \nantiterrorism bill when it comes to a cloture vote. There will be other \nbills this year to offer amendments on. This is not the last train to \ncome through the Senate. I hope we can pass a good bill, and I hope the \nHouse follows suit very quickly and that we get it to the President in \nthe next week or so.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have just come from a press conference \nwhere a significant number of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing \nappeared. It was a very moving experience for me to hear these people \ntalk about their loved ones who were killed in the bombing and to meet \nsome of them who were actually maimed and harmed during the bombing.\n  At that particular press conference were Diane Leonard, whose \nhusband, Don, a Secret Service agent was killed in the bombing; Glenn \nSeidl, who lost his wife, Kathy; Kay Ice, who lost a brother, Paul, a \nCustoms agent; Mike Reyes, who lost his father and was injured himself; \nJason Smith, who lost his mother, Linda McKinney; Dan McKinney, Linda's \nhusband; Gary Bland, who lost his wife, Shelly; Suzanne Britten, who \nlost her fiance, Richard Allen; Earl Adams, who lost a nephew, Scott \nWilliams; Alice Maroney Dennison, who lost her father, who gave me this \nribbon and pinned it on me personally, representing the tragedy, or I \nshould say tragedies that occurred in the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  I very proudly will wear this ribbon and will keep it after this \ndebate, as well. And I want to thank Alice Maroney Dennison for \nthinking of me and being kind enough to give me these ribbons, \nrepresenting various aspects of the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  Beverly Rankin was also a survivor who lost many friends in the \nbombing.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Lee Chancellor were there, as well, and of course he is \na strong force in one of the national organizations trying to get some \nfinality in the habeas corpus laws.\n  I have to say I was very impressed by these victims of this bombing. \nThey stood there and told their stories and begged the U.S. Senate and \nthe Congress as a whole to get this bill through and to keep the true \nhabeas corpus provisions in the bill as they are currently written.\n  The habeas corpus provisions of this bill happen to be the only part \nof the bill and really, the only thing we can do, to make up to those \nwho have lost family members and those who have been hurt and maimed, \nas a result of the Oklahoma City bombing. It is the one reform Congress \ncan pass which will affect this case.\n  [[Page S7659]] It is the one thing we can do something about. We can \nstop these incessant, frivolous appeals, that cost the taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars--billions over the extended period of \ntime--in frivolous litigation, that keeps these people alive for 5, 10, \nusually an average of almost 10 years, sometimes as long as 18 to 20 \nyears. Some of them die in prison before the final judgments are \ncarried out.\n  The reason that the far left in this country is fighting habeas \ncorpus reform is because they hate the death penalty. They feel they \ncannot win the battle over public opinion so they have adopted a \nstrategy to make death penalty litigation so costly and so protracted \nthat capital punishment is eliminated de facto. Now, I have to admit \nthat I believe the death penalty is proper, but I hate it, too. I wish \nwe never had to use it. I wish there would be no heinous murderers in \nour society. But there are occasions where it is appropriate and just. \nIt is a deterrent, as much as the opponents of the death penalty argue \nagainst it.\n  However, I would suggest that instead of throwing up frivolous appeal \nafter frivolous appeal and allowing this system to distort and disrupt \nour society and putting these victims and their families through \nfrivolous appeal after frivolous appeal, I would suggest that if they \nhate the death penalty, argue the issue straight up, argue against the \ndeath penalty. Make their philosophical points. Fight it throughout \nsociety if they want to, but do not make a mockery of justice by \nkeeping a system alive that literally is thwarting justice.\n  The fact of the matter is some have argued that habeas reform applied \nto the State is not germane to this debate. These individuals, \nincluding my distinguished colleague and friend from Delaware, contend \nthat a reform of the political overview of State convictions is \nmeaningless in the context of the debate we are having. They are \nwilling to admit that some revision of the collateral review may be in \norder, but they contend that reform of Federal collateral review of \ncases tried in State court is unnecessary. This position is simply \nincorrect.\n  I would like to read from a letter written by Robert H. Macy, \ndistrict attorney of Oklahoma City, and a Democrat. By the way, at this \nmeeting today, representatives from the attorney general for the State \nof Oklahoma, a Democrat, were there, and one came up to me afterwards--\nRichard Winnery--and said, ``Thank you for what you are doing.'' Drew \nEdmondson has been one of our strongest supporters as a Democrat of \nhabeas corpus reform, and there are a number of other Democrat attorney \ngenerals, and I might say many prosecutors who are Democrats throughout \nthe country, who agree with what we are doing here.\n  Robert H. Macy, as district attorney of Oklahoma City and a Democrat, \nsaid:\n\n       Immediately following the trial or trials in Federal court, \n     I shall, working in cooperation with the United States \n     Department of Justice and the Federal law enforcement \n     agencies investigating the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \n     Building, prosecute in Oklahoma State court the cowards \n     responsible for murdering innocent people in the areas \n     surrounding the Federal building. And I shall seek the death \n     penalty. We must never forget that this bombing took several \n     lives and injured dozens of persons in the neighborhoods and \n     businesses near the building. The State of Oklahoma has an \n     overwhelming, compelling interest to seek and obtain the \n     maximum penalty allowable by law for the senseless and \n     cowardly killings.\n\n  That is a statement of Robert H. Macy, the district attorney for \nOklahoma City, a Democrat.\n  In our reaction to the destruction of the Federal buildings in \nOklahoma City, we may overlook the fact that the bomb also caused the \ndeath of people not inside the building at the time, that were not \ninside the building itself, or even on Federal property. The State of \nOklahoma, not the Federal Government, will thus prosecute those \nresponsible for the bombing that killed people outside of the Alfred P. \nMurrah Building.\n  In those instances, Federal jurisdiction may not obtain and it will \nthus be necessary to prosecute the killers under State law, as well as \nFederal, court.\n  A failure to enact a complete, meaningful, reform of habeas corpus \nproceedings may enable the individuals in this case, provided they are \napprehended and duly convicted, to frustrate the demands of justice. \nThe blood of the innocent men and women are on the hands of the evil \ncowards who committed this terrible tragedy. Justice must be, as \nPresident Clinton declared, ``swift, certain, and severe.''\n  Moreover, failure to enact meaningful, comprehensive, habeas reform \nwill permit other killers who have terrorized their communities to \ncontinue to frustrate our judicial system in this country.\n If we adopt this view, we will create a schism between State and \nFederal capital law. In other words, murderers tried in Federal court \nwill face imposition of their final penalty more swiftly than persons \ntried for capital crimes in State courts--that is, if we adopt the \namendments that apparently are going to be put forth by the ranking \nminority member on this committee. So, in other words, if we adopt any \namendment that changes the habeas corpus reform bill within this bill \nthat would provide that it applies only to Federal courts, that will \ncreate a schism between State and Federal capital law.\n  Murderers tried in Federal court will face imposition of their final \npenalty more swiftly than persons tried for capital crimes in State \ncases. Why should we adopt such a piecemeal approach to reform, one \nthat will leave such a gap between State and Federal cases? It simply \nmakes no sense to reform habeas proceedings for cases tried in Federal \ncourt but leave the current disastrous system in place for cases tried \nin State court.\n  As of January 1, 1995, there were some 2,976 inmates on death row. \nYet, only 38 prisoners were executed last year, and the States have \nexecuted only 263 criminals since 1973.\n  Yet, keep in mind, 2,976, almost 3,000, are sitting there on death \nrow. Many more have died while in prison from natural causes, and some \neven from unnatural causes, while waiting for imposition of their \npenalty, because of frivolous habeas corpus appeals.\n  I might add, some of them have committed further murders while the \ndelays have occurred, murders that would not have been committed had \nsentences been carried out.\n  Abuse of the habeas process features strongly in the extraordinary \ndelay between the sentence and the carrying out of that sentence. In my \nhome State of Utah, for example, convicted murderer William Andrews, \nwith his partner, murdered a number of people in the hi-fi murder case, \nbut only after they had tortured them by ramming pencils through their \nears and pouring drain cleaner down their throats, destroying their \nvocal boxes and their esophageal areas.\n  There, the imposition of a constitutionally imposed death sentence \nfor over 18 years. The State had to put up millions of dollars in \nprecious criminal justice resources to litigate his meritless claims. \nHis guilt was never in question. He was not an innocent person seeking \nfreedom from an illegal punishment. Rather, he simply wanted to \nfrustrate the imposition of punishment his heinous crimes warranted.\n  This abuse of habeas corpus litigation, particularly in those cases \ninvolving lawfully imposed death sentences, has taken a dreadful toll \non victims' families, seriously eroded the public's confidence in our \ncriminal justice system, and drained State criminal justice resources. \nThis is simply not a just system.\n  Justice demands that lawfully imposed sentences be carried out. \nJustice demands that we now adopt meaningful habeas corpus reform. \nJustice demands that we not permit those who would perpetuate the \ncurrent system to steer us from our course. We must do as the victims, \nfamilies, and friends of those who have asked us to do: enact \nmeaningful, comprehensive, habeas reform now.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is in session today debating the specific \ntopic of habeas corpus reform, as well as other aspects of this \nantiterrorism bill. I have been devoting my time to habeas corpus \nreform because of, and in honor of, the witnesses, the victims, and the \nfamilies of victims who appeared here today.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from California is here. Does the \nSenator desire to take the floor and speak?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In response to the Senator, I would like to send an \namendment to the desk. I was going to do it at 11:30.\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. That will be fine. I will hold off on any further comments \non this until after the distinguished Senator has a chance to present \nher amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1202 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To amend the bill to authorize requirements for tagging of \n                explosive materials and other purposes)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], proposes an \n     amendment (No. 1202) to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 152, strike line 6 through line 17 on page 153, and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. STUDY AND REQUIREMENTS FOR TAGGING OF EXPLOSIVE \n                   MATERIALS, AND STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR \n                   RENDERING EXPLOSIVE COMPONENTS INERT AND \n                   IMPOSING CONTROLS ON PRECURSORS OF EXPLOSIVES.\n\n       (a) the Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a study and \n     make recommendations concerning--\n       (1) the tagging of explosive materials for purposes of \n     detection and identification;\n       (2) whether common chemicals used to manufacture explosive \n     materials can be rendered inert and whether it is feasible to \n     require it; and\n       (3) whether controls can be imposed on certain precursor \n     chemicals used to manufacture explosive materials and whether \n     it is feasible to require it.\n       In conducting the study, the Secretary shall consult with \n     other Federal, State and local officials with expertise in \n     this area and such other individuals as shall be deemed \n     necessary. Such study shall be completed within twelve months \n     after the enactment of this Act and shall be submitted to the \n     Congress and made available to the public. Such study may \n     include, if appropriate, recommendations for legislation.\n       (b) There are authorized to be appropriated for the study \n     and recommendations contained in paragraph (a) such sums as \n     may be necessary.\n       (c) Section 842, of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after subsection (k), a new subsection \n     (l) which reads as follows:\n       ``(l) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, \n     import, ship, transport, receive, possess, transfer, or \n     distribute any explosive material that does not contain a \n     tracer element as prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to \n     regulation, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe \n     that the explosive material does not contain the required \n     tracer element.''.\n       (d) Section 844, of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after ``(a) through (i)'' the phrase \n     ``and (l)''.\n       (e) Section 846, of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by designating the present section as ``(a)'' and by \n     adding a new subsection (b) reading as follows: ``(b) to \n     facilitate the enforcement of this chapter the Secretary \n     shall, within 18 months after the enactment of this Act, \n     promulgate regulations for the addition of tracer elements to \n     explosive materials manufactured in or imported into the \n     United States. Tracer elements to be added to explosive \n     materials under provisions of this subsection shall be of \n     such character and in such quantity as the Secretary may \n     authorize or require, and such as will not substantially \n     impair the quality of the explosive materials for their \n     intended lawful use, safety of these explosives, or have a \n     substantially adverse effect on the environment.''.\n       (f) The penalties provided herein, shall not take effect \n     until ninety days after the date of promulgation of the \n     regulations provided for herein.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is \nan amendment to require the use of taggants. Now, what is a taggant? A \ntaggant is a tiny, microscopic, color-coded plastic or ceramic piece \nwhich can be mixed with explosive materials to allow law enforcement \nagencies to trace a batch of explosives like we currently do with car \nserial numbers. In other words, it might be possible, therefore, to \nidentify the place of purchase of these explosives and therefore to, \nquite possibly, trace the purchaser.\n  Why is this important? It is important because we have seen in this \nNation a rising incidence of bombs. In my own State in the last few \nyears, there have been about 500 bomb incidents. The Department of \nJustice tells us that about 80 percent of these result in an actual \ndetonation. Consequently, there has been major loss of life from \nbombing incidents. I think this was brought home to every American by \nthe incident in Oklahoma City.\n  It is a complicated amendment because it is actually two parts. \nFirst, it requires the Secretary of the Treasury to do a study within \n12 months, and then within 18 months to implement the results of that \nstudy or put into place a system by which taggants can be included in \nacross-the-counter explosives. The affected explosives would include \ndynamite, water gels, slurries, emulsions, and black powder.\n  Second, it would require a study on the use of diffusers in another \nbody of agents used in explosives, and those are common chemicals such \nas the ammonium nitrate fertilizer that was used in the Oklahoma City \nbombing--common chemicals, these kinds of chemicals, as well as pool \nchemicals that can be utilized. This part of the amendment would only \nrequire a study, however, as to how these chemicals can be made inert \nor diffused or nonexplosive. The amendment also has language so that it \nwill not impair the effectiveness, the safety, nor the environmental \nimpact of the explosive materials which are covered.\n  This past Friday in Los Angeles, I met with members of the Los \nAngeles County bomb squad, the Orange County bomb squad, Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms bombs experts, and FBI experts, and \nvirtually everyone in the room supported the use of taggants as a \npossible viable law enforcement tool.\n  Taggants have been available for use in the United States and \nelsewhere for some 20 years but, frankly, special-interest groups have \nprevented their use. The current bill only provides that a study be \ndone on the feasibility of using these taggants. There is no deadline. \nThis means that 16 years of delay that has already taken place could be \nfollowed by another 16-year period of delay. My amendment includes two \nreal deadlines. First, the report must be done in 12 months; and, \nsecond, after 18 months, the use of taggants would be required.\n  I think the potential effectiveness of taggants was highlighted by a \nstudy conducted in the late 1970's when ATF seeded a very small portion \nof explosives, 10,000 pounds, with taggants. Despite this relatively \nsmall sample, these taggants actually helped solve a bombing in \nMaryland. In other words, by seeding just 10,000 pounds of explosives \nwith taggants, they actually got leads to one bombing which led to the \nconviction of the individual responsible.\n  If we had required taggants years before, we could have had crucial \nevidence in about 17 percent of the bombs cases that occurred between \nthe years of 1987 and 1993. People will say taggants do not work or \nshould not work. They will say they should not be included. But I will \ntell my colleagues that Switzerland for some time has incorporated \ntaggants into explosives, and it has resulted in the conviction of many \nwho have perpetrated bombings.\n  I should say that, although ammonium nitrate was used along with \ndiesel fuel, the people I have spoken to also believe there had to have \nbeen another accelerator included in that explosive batch of materials, \nand that accelerator most probably could have been tagged with a \ntaggant.\n  I believe the amendment before my colleagues is well thought out, Mr. \nPresident, and I believe it can and should be supported by both sides \nof this Chamber.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. And I also retain \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to add my support of the \nComprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995, which is the bill \nbefore us.\n  For many years, it seemed to many Americans that the United States \nwas immune to terrorism, that somehow it could not reach our shores. \nPerhaps it is because we are surrounded by oceans [[Page S7661]] on the \nwest and the east, by friendly neighbors to the north and to the south. \nWe may have fooled ourselves into a false sense of security, somehow \nthinking that we live on an island and that no terrorist would reach \nus.\n  We were long ago disabused of any such notion about our safety \nabroad. The hijackings and hostage takings of the 1970's and 1980's \ntaught all Americans that we could be the victims of foreign terrorists \nwho were prepared to use violence to advance their causes. We have \nexpended much time, effort and money to improve the safety of our \nairlines and our Embassies and to ensure the cooperation of other \ngovernments in combating terrorism. But for many, home seemed a refuge, \na haven from the political violence that has plagued so many other \nparts of our world. But we can no longer comfort ourselves with such \nillusions--and illusions they are. What was once unthinkable here in \nAmerica is today a reality. Terrorism can strike us here at home. It \ncan strike with massive deadly force, and it poses a most fundamental \nthreat to our freedoms--the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. So that is why we must act, and that is why we must take \naction on this bill today.\n  In the wake of Oklahoma City, there is a new imperative--a bipartisan \nconsensus on the need for tough, comprehensive antiterrorism \nlegislation that can move through the legislative process and become \nlaw quickly. So I would like to commend the distinguished majority and \nminority leaders, as well as the Senator from Utah and the Senator from \nDelaware, who are the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, for acting expeditiously to bring this bill to the \nfloor.\n  The purposes of the legislation are clear: To make it more difficult \nto carry out acts of terrorism, to toughen the penalties for committing \nor abetting acts of terrorism, and to strengthen the hands of our law \nenforcement authorities to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism.\n  Terrorists do not wait to get caught. It is our job to give our law \nenforcement agencies the authority and ability to seek out terrorists \nbefore they act. We must find them before they find us. It is that \nsimple and that important.\n  I believe that terrorism, the ultimate act of cowardice, actually \nthreatens our life, our way of life, and jeopardizes our most \nfundamental liberties. With all that at stake, it is important that we \nact today.\n  One of the most important sections of this bill, in my view, is a \nsection that toughens restrictions on access to explosives, and \nincreases the penalties for possessing stolen explosives, for \ntransferring explosives with knowledge that they will be used to commit \na crime, for conspiracies involving explosives, and for using \nexplosives to commit a crime. These provisions are long overdue and \nwell-considered. Oklahoma City taught us what the people of Beirut and \nLondon, Tel Aviv and Buenos Aires have known for far too long: Bombs \nkill. That is their sole purpose--to blow up buildings and kill people. \nWe should be doing everything possible to make it harder for terrorists \nto get their hands on explosives.\n  I have a very personal interest in the issue of bombs. You see, Mr. \nPresident, I myself was the target of a terrorist bombing less than 20 \nyears ago. An extremist group, the New World Liberation Front, tried to \nblow up my home, and failed only because the type of explosive they \nused does not detonate when the temperature drops below freezing and \nSan Francisco experienced a rare frost that night. I was lucky, but so \nmany others have not been.\n  The proliferation of bombmaking materials has reached astounding \nproportions. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, \nfrom 1983 to 1993 bombings in the United States more than tripled, from \n910 to 2,980. The Department of Justice now puts out an annual Bomb \nSummary each year--who ever thought such a thing would be necessary?--\nand in 1993 summary, we learn that the 2,980 bombing incidents, 541 of \nwhich were in California, caused 49 deaths and 1,323 injuries \nnationwide. Whether or not all of these bombing incidents can be \nclassified as terrorist attacks, these appalling statistics clearly \ndemonstrate the need to restrict access to bombmaking materials.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the problem is not merely with bombmaking \nmaterials. In my opinion, there is altogether too much information too \nreadily available on how to conduct terrorist attacks. Books and \nmanuals, some of them posted on the Internet, teach everything one \ncould want to know about picking locks, stealing chemicals, building \nbombs--all the skills you need to be a successful terrorist. Later, I \nintend to offer an amendment that will strengthen this legislation by \nmaking it a crime to teach or disseminate bombmaking information with \nknowledge that it will be used in a crime.\n  Mr. President, another extremely important section of this bill deals \nwith the problem of aliens who are members of terrorist organizations. \nIt should be clear, that the risks of allowing alien terrorists to work \ntheir way through ordinary deportation hearings, which are often \nlengthy and slow-moving, are unacceptable. Yet this is the case under \ncurrent law. In terrorist cases, our law enforcement authorities must \nbe granted expedited procedures for deportation.\n  I am pleased that the pending legislation provides for a special \n``terrorism court,'' composed of U.S. district court judges appointed \nby the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, that would be able to deport \nexpeditiously alien terrorists without risking the disclosure of \nnational security information and techniques. In the rare cases where \nevidence against an alien is highly classified, a summary of the \nevidence will be provided to the alien. In addition, the pending \nlegislation would make membership in a terrorist organization a \nsufficient basis for exclusion from the United States.\n  The point of this provision, is that when the Government has reliable \ninformation regarding terrorist activities of specific aliens, we \ncannot afford to wait until they commit crimes to deport them. The \nspecial court will hear evidence, and if it makes a compelling case \nthat the alien is a member of a terrorist organization, the alien will \nbe deported. I am confident that we can trust a panel of five Federal \njudges, appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, to fairly \nweigh the evidence disclosed. And importantly, there is provision to \nnot fully disclose sensitive information that could lead to the deaths \nof Americans and others. Such disclosures should not be necessary just \nto deport someone dangerous.\n  Mr. President, one of the most serious problems we face is that \ninternational terrorist groups use the open environment of the United \nStates to raise funds for their terrorist activities. The President has \nalready delineated a list of organizations--such as Hamas and \nHizbullah, and Jewish extremist groups like Kach and Kahane Chai--that \nraise funds in the United States for terrorist activities that \nundermine the Middle East peace process. The legislation before us will \nhelp put an end to that, by making it illegal to raise funds for any \nactivity conducted by an organization deemed by the Secretary of State \nto be engaged in terrorist activities.\n  Some have raised the objection that certain groups, that may conduct \nterrorist operations, also run humanitarian or social service \noperations, like schools and clinics. But I simply do not accept that \nso-called humanitarian works by terrorist groups can be kept separate \nfrom their other operations. I think the money will ultimately go to \nbombs and bullets, rather than babies, or, because money is fungible, \nit will free up other funds to be used on terrorist activities.\n  Mr. President, we have all witnessed over the years the harm done to \nU.S. citizens and U.S. interests by international terrorism. The \nbombings of United States Embassies, the slaughter of 241 U.S. marines \nin Beirut, the hijacking of American airliners, the bombing of Pan Am \nflight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, the holding of American hostages. \nAll of these images are deeply imprinted on our national psyche.\n  These incidents, and the hundreds of others like them, aimed at \nAmericans and non-Americans alike, pose one of the greatest threats \ntoday to international stability and security. Terrorism, as we have \nseen in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Hebron, can wreak havoc on \n[[Page S7662]] the Middle East peace process. It undermines moderate \nregimes, such as Egypt, and exacerbates social tensions. It disrupts \nthe lives of ordinary people, the flow of commerce, and the policies of \naffected governments.\n  The State Department's Patterns of Global Terrorism report tells us \nthat in 1994, there were 321 international terrorist attacks, over one-\nfifth of which were anti-U.S. attacks. And although this figure \nrepresents a 23-year low, it still means that there was an average of \nnearly one terrorist attack per day in 1994. All told, these attacks \nkilled 314 people and left another 663 wounded.\n  In the face of this problem, the United States should demand, and has \nevery right to expect, full cooperation from all friendly governments \nin the battle to combat international terrorism. Cooperation today is \nby and large quite good, although some nations are not as cooperative \nas we would like. The pending legislation would increase the incentive \nfor other governments to cooperate in our antiterrorist efforts by \nprohibiting U.S. assistance to countries that provide aid or military \nequipment to terrorist states. The seven state sponsors of terrorism--\nCuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria--do not deserve \nsuch assistance until they can justifiably be removed from the list of \nstate-sponsors.\n  The bill would also expand the type of assistance that we can provide \nour allies under the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program. With the \nexpansion of such programs, and the increased incentive for other \ncountries to cooperate with us, the United States can help forge even \ngreater international consensus on combating terrorism.\n  But again, Mr. President, the primary lesson of the World Trade \nCenter and Oklahoma City bombings is that from now on we face the \npossibility of a serious terrorist problem here at home. In addition to \ninternational terrorist groups that may set up cells in the United \nStates, there is a growing danger of armed extremist groups of \nAmericans, who hold antigovernment views, using violence to pursue \ntheir agenda. We have all heard the inflammatory statements of some \nmembers of militia and other right-wing extremist groups attacking \nreligious or ethnic groups, predicting violent revolution against the \nGovernment, or slandering Federal law enforcement officers, who risk \ntheir lives to protect the very freedoms that allow the extremists to \nmake their outrageous statements. But we have been warned. When heavily \narmed people with the ability to make bombs make threats, we ignore \nthem at our peril.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, perhaps the most important provisions \nof this legislation are those that strengthen the ability of Federal \nlaw enforcement officers to monitor extremist and potential terrorist \ngroups. These provisions grant Federal law enforcement agencies \nenhanced access to credit, telephone, financial, and certain commercial \nrecords in counterterrorism cases. It will no longer be required to \nhave evidence of criminal activity, but it will allow officers to \ninvestigate groups whom they suspect may be engaging in criminal \nactivity.\n  The effect of these changes in law will effectively be to untie the \nhands of our law enforcement officials. Currently our agents are unable \nto be proactive--they are only able to react to criminal activity, and \nlaunch an investigation of suspect individuals or groups after there is \ncredible evidence of wrongdoing. These changes will allow our law \nenforcement officials to take steps to stop terrorist attacks before \nthey happen. By investigating, monitoring, and infiltrating groups that \nmay be involved in terrorism before a crime is committed, our agents \ncan actually help prevent terrorist acts, and perhaps prevent the kind \nof horror we all witnessed last month.\n  Passive investigation by the FBI of any group with terrorist \npotential is absolutely necessary in this day and age. As FBI Director \nLouis Freeh testified before the Judiciary Committee earlier this \nmonth, we ``can't afford'' even one terrorist nuclear incident. \nInfiltration and court-ordered surveillance are critical to preventing \nthat doomsday scenario from becoming a reality at some point in time. \nAs long as the FBI and police do not encourage illegal conduct or \notherwise entrap group members, we simply have to have the information \nthat good surveillance--and only good surveillance--can provide.\n  I want very much to make a few comments on the habeas corpus \nprovisions. I suspect that these provisions are often complicated, that \nthey are not always well known. But I believe very strongly in the \nprovisions of this bill. As President Clinton recently said--and I \ncould not agree more--``swift punishment, including the death penalty, \nwhere appropriate, is critical in efforts to combat terrorism.'' I \nstrongly believe that the death penalty can act as a deterrent to the \nmost violent of crimes and is an appropriate punishment for those who \nknowingly take another life.\n  There has been a lot of discussion as to whether the death penalty is \nor is not a deterrent. But I remember well in the 1960's when I was \nsentencing a woman convicted of robbery in the first degree and I \nremember looking at her commitment sheet and I saw that she carried a \nweapon that was unloaded into a grocery store robbery. I asked her the \nquestion: ``Why was your gun unloaded?'' She said to me: ``So I would \nnot panic, kill somebody, and get the death penalty.'' That was \nfirsthand testimony directly to me that the death penalty in place in \nCalifornia in the sixties was in fact a deterrent.\n  But the deterrent impact of the death penalty is weakened when it \ncannot be imposed swiftly after a verdict has been reached in a fair \ntrial. As the Senate Judiciary Committee heard at its hearing on habeas \nreform last March, the extraordinary delay in carrying out capital \nsentences is in effect a form of terrorism against the survivors of \nmurder victims, traumatizing them year after year by preventing justice \nfrom being carried out.\n  Let no one doubt, Mr. President, that habeas reform should and must \nbe an integral part of this legislation.\n  Indeed, I spoke a few days ago with Oklahoma Attorney General Drew \nEdmondson, and a number of surviving family members of the men and \nwomen who lost their lives in Oklahoma City in that blast. It was a \nmoving conversation and one that I will not forget. In sum, each of the \nsurvivors with whom I spoke, as well as the attorney general, urged the \nswift adoption of the habeas proposals in this legislation. Each \nconveyed to me that justice will not fully have been done until those \nresponsible for the bombing have been tried, convicted, and the death \npenalty imposed and swiftly carried out.\n  As Alice Maroney Dennison, the daughter of Mickey B. Maroney, a \nspecial agent with the Secret Service, said to me: ``I'm 27 years old \nand they took my father. I cannot be 47 when this man goes to death. \nThat's not fair.''\n  Mr. President, Alice Maroney Dennison's plea, and indeed the voices \nof all of the family members of Oklahoma City's victims, a number of \nwhom just about a half-hour ago held a press conference in front of \nthis Capitol, must be heard,\n and their loved ones must not have died in vain.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time for meaningful habeas corpus reform. This \nbill contains it. Let no one doubt that comprehensive reform is \ncritical, and particularly in capital cases.\n  Much has been said about the case of Robert Alton Harris in \nCalifornia, a vicious murderer, and what he did when he was out of \nprison in San Diego. He went to a drive-in. He wanted to take a car. \nThere were two 16-year-old boys in the car eating hamburgers. He took \nthe car with the boys in it. He took the youngsters to a remote \nlocation. He killed one. The other dropped to his knees crying and \nbegging for help, and he killed the second. Then he ate their \nhamburgers and went on to commit other robberies.\n  This man actually filed no fewer than 6 Federal habeas petitions and \nanother 10 such petitions in State court before he was ultimately \nexecuted 14 years later for his crime. In all, Harris and his attorneys \nwere able to engineer 14 years' delay of his capital sentence. It was \n14 years of unresolved grief for the survivors of his victims.\n  In California today there are currently 410 convicted criminals on \ndeath row. On June 7, the longest serving member of California's death \nrow population, Andrew E. Robertson, will mark the 17th year of his \nincarceration. He [[Page S7663]] has managed to delay his capital \nsentence by filing habeas petitions for 17 years.\n  In California, since 1978, when the people of the State voted to put \nback into place the death penalty, 18 prisoners on death row have died \nof natural causes or committed suicide. Only 2 have been executed. Only \n2 have had their sentence carried out, while 18 have either committed \nsuicide or died of natural causes, all of them delaying their sentence.\n  Another case deserves attention as well. Clarence Ray Allen committed \nmurder in 1974. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in \n1977. From within prison he ordered the murder of the witnesses to the \nfirst murder. In September 1980, his assassin shotgunned to death three \npeople and gravely wounded a fourth.\n  Six years later, the California Supreme Court affirmed his conviction \nand death penalty. During the next 2 years, it considered and denied a \nState habeas corpus petition in which a prison inmate is permitted to \nattack his sentence on factors outside the appellate record.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court declined review. On September 2, 1988, a \nFederal district judge issued a stay of execution. Over 6 years later \nthat stay remains in effect, and the case is still mired in the \ndistrict court. Unfortunately, this is a typical case. This points out \na need for the habeas corpus reform in the bill before the Senate \ntoday.\n  In fact, according to Attorney General Dan Lungren's testimony before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee in March of this year, there are \n``currently 410 inmates on death row in California. We have had 2 \nexecutions occur since 1992, the only 2 in the last 27 years. The \nnumber of capital cases pending on Federal habeas corpus has more than \ndoubled since 1991,'' when he first testified here on this issue.\n  In 4 years, the number of Federal habeas corpus cases on death row in \nCalifornia has doubled. Mr. President, since the death penalty was \nreinstated in California, as I said, many more prisoners on death row \nhave died of natural causes and suicide than of a carrying out of their \nsentence.\n  This problem is not unique to California. According to the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, during the year ending \nSeptember 30, 1994, there were 11,918 prisoner petitions for habeas \ncorpus review in the U.S. district courts alone. That is the reason \nhabeas corpus reform has been a high priority of the Judiciary \nCommittee. We should do it right and not merely pass a bill labeled \nwith the term ``habeas reform'' for the sake of passing legislation.\n  That is why all 58 California district attorneys opposed the habeas \nprovisions included in Senate bill 1607, the crime bill as originally \nintroduced in 1993, and legislation introduced that year, Senate bill \n1657.\n  I am very pleased to say that the habeas provisions included in the \nbill currently under consideration by the Senate are identical to those \nincluded in the Habeas Corpus Reform Act, Senate bill 623, legislation \nstrongly supported by the attorneys general of California and Oklahoma \nand which, I believe, strikes an appropriate balance between the need \nto assure due process of those both convicted in capital and noncapital \ncrimes and the need of any rational judicial system to bring cases to \nclosure.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, this bill provides habeas \npetitioners with one bite of the apple. It assures that no one \nconvicted of a capital crime will be barred from seeking habeas relief \nin Federal court. In my view, it appropriately limits second and \nsubsequent habeas appeals to narrow and appropriate circumstances.\n  Furthermore, the bill requires States which provide for counsel that \nhabeas appeals must be filed within 6 months of when a State prisoner's \nconviction becomes final, or in States where standard for the adequacy \nof counsel are not adopted, such appeals must be filed within 1 year. \nSo there is an incentive that if there is an adequacy of counsel \nstandard in your State, there is 1 year from which the habeas petition \nmust be filed.\n  Time limits are also imposed upon courts. The bill requires that \nFederal courts must act promptly on habeas appeals and establishes a \nmechanism by which courts of appeals will screen habeas petitions \nbefore they are permitted to go to a Federal district court for \nresolution.\n  Finally, unlike the crime bill proposals that I and the Nation's law \nenforcement officials opposed 2 years ago, the bill does not dictate to \nthe States precisely what counsel competency standards are adopted, but \nrather it properly provides States with an incentive to formulate their \nown plans by making expedited timetables I have just described \navailable for States to do so.\n  I believe there are two things that are an effective deterrent to \ncrime. One of them is the speed of the trial. The other is the \ncertainty of punishment. The habeas corpus reforms in this bill will \nmake much more certain the certainty of punishment. I am very pleased \nto support them. I am very pleased to give my commendation to the \ncommittee chairman, the Senator from Utah, and to support this bill.\n  I think this is an important moment for our country and for this \nCongress. We have an opportunity to take bold action which will go a \nlong way toward increasing the security of our citizens. This \ncomprehensive package of antiterrorist legislation is an important step \nalso in the recovery for the people of Oklahoma City, the people of the \nState of Oklahoma, and the people of the United States. For while the \nwounds of that day will never fully heal, today we begin to act to help \nprevent future sorrows and to help the American people be reassured \nthat their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will \nnot be threatened by the menace of terrorism, whether from foreign \nshores or our own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for her cogent remarks on habeas corpus reform. She is one \nof the leaders in this body in trying to reform these laws, and I want \nto personally compliment her for them.\n  I appreciate the support that she is bringing to this debate. It \nmeans a lot to me personally, as one who has fought for years to try to \nget the habeas corpus bill through. This is the time when I think we \nhave to stand up and do it. I thank her and I appreciate the leadership \nshe has provided.\n  Presently, there are 100 amendments, under our unanimous consent \nagreement, to this bill. Mr. President, 68 of these amendments are \nDemocrat amendments and 32 amendments are Republican. Most of the \nRepublican amendments, I believe, will not be offered. So it is really \ncoming down to the 68 amendments that our friends on the other side \nhave.\n  We have the Feinstein taggant amendment pending, but I want to urge \nmy Democrat colleagues to come to the floor and offer their amendments. \nWe will stack them for votes beginning at 6 o'clock tonight. I believe \nwe also can dispense with several GOP amendments, including the two \nPressler amendments, the Smith amendment, a Brown amendment, and \nperhaps an Abraham amendment today, if we can. I would like to do that.\n  Having said that, I would like to spend a few minutes chatting about \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senator from California which is \ncurrently pending.\n  I have to rise in opposition to that amendment, but I first want to \nemphasize that the bill under consideration, S. 735, already contains a \nrequirement for a study of the feasibility of ``tagging'' all \nexplosives for tracing purposes.\n  Trace tagging, unlike ``identification'' taggants, are actual chips \nmixed in with the explosive. This is certainly an area that merits \nfurther serious study. We have authorized, in the bill, the Departments \nof Treasury and Justice to undertake exactly such a study.\n  Our bill also includes a provision which requires plastic explosives \nto be tagged with a detectable agent, thus helping to ensure that these \ndevises can be detected before they are used in sabotage.\n  A detection taggant is a chemical odorant added to the explosive \nwhich enables security devises to detect the explosive. This particular \nprovision fulfills our obligations under an international convention \nrequiring such legislation.\n  The amendment under consideration, however, goes much further. In \naddition to providing a study of tracing [[Page S7664]] taggants, it \nalso gives regulatory authority to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms to implement the results of the study without congressional \nreview. The amendment thus presupposes that the study will conclude \nthat the use of tracing taggants is feasible, and the amendment \ncriminalizes the failure to include these agents in the manufacturer of \nexplosives.\n  Thus, the Feinstein amendment would require the placement of so-\ncalled traceable taggants--that is, microscopic bits of plastic coded \nto link explosives to a particular manufacturer--in all explosives \nbefore the study of whether this is feasible or safe is concluded, or \neven conducted for that matter.\n This is hardly the type of impartiality and objectiveness the American \npeople would want in a study of this sort.\n\n  Indeed, even if the study reasonably concluded that use of such \nagents was practical, cost effective, and would aid law enforcement, \nopponents of the inclusion of such agents would have the perfect \nargument that the results of the study were preordained and thus \nunreliable.\n  Even the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the agency which \nwould have regulatory authority, has conceded that more study is needed \nbefore implementing procedures and regulations. The BATF's division \nchief for arson and explosives recently stated:\n\n       It would be important for us to at least assess the state \n     of the technology and the research and the development that \n     has been done in the last 15 years. We need to get ourselves \n     up to speed.\n\n  Moreover, this amendment would impose a requirement for regulation \nwithout regard to the need for unbiased study of this issue, or for the \nlegitimate safety concerns raised by the use of these taggants.\n  A 1980 report by the Office of Technology Assessment found \nsubstantial evidence that placing these ``tracing'' taggants in \nexplosives seriously affects the stability of the explosive materials. \nThus, these taggants could increase the risk of injury or death. \nTagging explosives may raise other very important issues, such as \ncontamination of evidence, saturation of tagging agents in places where \nexplosives are used for legitimate uses, and negative effects on small \nbusiness.\n  Given these very important and wide-ranging concerns, it is \nimperative that the Congress, not the BATF, have the ability to make \nthese important decisions regarding tracing taggants once a study is \ncompleted. Requiring the use of taggants before a thorough study of the \neffectiveness and safety implications of their use is conducted places \nthe cart before the horse.\n  The bill now before the Senate provides for a comprehensive study of \nthis issue. Congress should commission and review the study before \nenacting criminal penalties based on the assumed outcome.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator is very sincere in her \namendment and is trying to do what is right here. But I hope the points \nI have raised will persuade colleagues on both sides of the aisle that \nwe ought to approach this with a study first and then see where we go \nfrom there and have congressional action with regard to taggants after \nwe have a thoroughgoing study because of the safety and other concerns \ninvolved in tagging various explosives.\n  It is not just safety; it is effectiveness of the explosives as well. \nBut safety is something that is more important to me. I really believe \nwe ought to do this the right way. Of course, hopefully, do it in a way \nthat ultimately will be pleasing to our friend from California, who is \nvery sincere about her amendment and has the highest of motivations in \nbringing it here. But I hope I have made the case we really should not \naccept this amendment at this time.\n  I am prepared to move to table the amendment with the understanding \nthe vote will occur after 6 p.m. today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I wonder if the Senator would permit me to respond to \nhis statement prior to tabling?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, if I might just very briefly respond? Taggants have \nbeen studied. I am holding up one of these studies entitled ``Taggants \nIn Explosives.'' The date is April 1980. The studying office is the \nOffice of Technology Assessment. You can see the thickness of the \nstudy.\n  On the issue of safety, what the Office found:\n\n       In no case did the addition of encapsulated taggants \n     significantly increase the sensitivity of the explosive \n     materials to the test conditions. No evidence of any \n     decreased stability or other significant changes was found in \n     any of the tests with dynamite, gels, slurries or black \n     powder.\n\n  That is essentially the world that would be affected by taggants. The \ntaggants would affect, really, these areas. In my amendment we do \nprovide for a study, but what we say is at some point you have to say \nenough of studying and make a decision and go ahead. Twelve more months \nof study and then it is implementation, where taggants can be used with \nsafety, with no increase in the volatility of the explosive matter, and \nwhere they could lead to being able to trace suspects in bombings.\n  There have been two constituencies opposed to taggants. Let us be \nbrutally frank. One of them is, once again, our friends in the National \nRifle Association. And the second is the explosives industry. The \nexplosives industry says taggants would add cost to us.\n  In fact, the cost of using taggants in dynamite, water gels, \nslurries, emulsions, and cast boosters, as quoted are, per pound, \n$1.42; $1.47; $1.45, and $7.41 respectively. That is a minimal cost to \nbe able to trace back where an explosive might be used in a bomb that \ncan blow up as many as 168 people at one time.\n  The National Rifle Association has once again opposed the use of \ntaggants. I cannot figure out the reason for the life of me, but I \nsuppose it is because we surround this area with a certain kind of \nanonymity. I think if ever we have seen the need to increase \ntransparency in sales of explosives we saw it at the World Trade Center \nand we saw it once again in Oklahoma City.\n  My amendment would also permit the study, and a study only, of \nchemical fertilizers that are used, like ammonium nitrate, to see if \nthese fertilizers can be made inert. There are countries, for example, \nthat add lime to ammonium sulfate and prevent it from exploding. Should \nwe do that? I think we ought to study it. The amendment in the bill, \nthe original, includes no study in the area of chemical fertilizers and \nchemical components which are increasingly used as bomb materials in \nthis country.\n  In response to my distinguished chairman, I would only say there is a \ntime to study and there is a time to stop studying and take action. \nThis issue has been studied in 1980. In my amendment it will be studied \nfor another year. But then we will move ahead in the areas I have just \nmentioned: dynamite, water gels, slurries, emulsions, and black powder. \nAll of these areas can be successfully tagged. The state of the art is \nthere to do it. Switzerland has done it for a number of years. Other \ncountries are doing it and there is no reason why we should not as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there are a couple of letters I have \nreceived, mailed to the Honorable Christopher J. Dodd and the Honorable \nJoe Lieberman. This is from Unimin Corp. in New Canaan, CT, a \ncorporation or business right in the middle of their State. I will just \nread the letter to Senator Dodd. I ask unanimous consent both letters \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                 Unimin Corp.,\n\n                                     New Canaan, CT, May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: I am writing on behalf of Unimin \n     Corporation to express Unimin's opposition to S. 761 \n     (proposed by the Clinton Administration and introduced by \n     Senators Daschle and Biden) which authorizes the Treasury \n     Department (BATF) to promulgate regulations requiring the use \n     of identification ``taggants'' in explosives manufactured in \n     or imported into the United States. This legislation could \n     devastate our business.\n       Unimin is the world leader in the mining, production and \n     sale of high purity silica powders used both domestically and \n     abroad in the production of semi-conductors. In the \n     [[Page S7665]] initial stage of Unimin's silica purification \n     process, explosives are used to extract the silica-containing \n     ore from the earth.\n       In order to meet the stringent purity requirements of our \n     semi-conductor industry customers, Unimin has gone to great \n     expense using the most advanced technology in the industry to \n     remove nearly all forms of contaminants from our silica \n     products. Unimin has reduced the metal contaminants to levels \n     below 1 part per million. The slightest impurity in our \n     materials can result in costly losses to our customers \n     because they result in defective silicon chips. High purity \n     silica is the hallmark of our international business success \n     and leadership. We produce the world's purest natural silica \n     powder. As a result we are the leading supplier of this \n     essential semi-conductor product to producers in each of the \n     U.S., Europe and Japan.\n       This proposed legislation would force Unimin to introduce \n     contaminants (the taggants to be included in the explosives \n     we use) into our product, and could make our product \n     unsuitable for their intended use--the production of semi-\n     conductors. This legislation would give our foreign \n     competitors (who will not have their products contaminated by \n     taggants from explosives used in silica mines abroad) an \n     enormous opportunity to get our customers in the U.S. and \n     overseas to drop their U.S. supplier, Unimin.\n       Unimin Corporation urges that you oppose this legislation. \n     While everyone seeks to deter terrorism, further study and \n     thorough consideration should be given to this important \n     issue before any action is taken which will have unintended, \n     far-reaching and commercially injurious consequences to \n     Unimin's world leadership in the high purity silica market. \n     There must be some way to meet the objectives of this \n     legislation without requiring a company which depends \n     entirely on the purity of its product to introduce \n     contaminant taggants into our production stream.\n       Unimin urges you to support S. 735, sponsored by Senators \n     Dole and Hatch, which proposes a study of detection and \n     identification taggants for non-plastic explosives.\n       Unimin looks forward to your support in this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Joseph C.

More \nimportantly, I am concerned about the safety of explosives. But this \nraises another issue, and that is whether putting taggants into \nexplosives that are utilized in some of our industries might destroy \nthose industries in this country at a high cost to our society. And I \nwould say the silica chip industry is a very important industry in this \ncountry.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment requires the Secretary of Treasury to \npromulgate regulations requiring the placement of trace elements which \n``will not substantially impair the safety of the explosive.''\n  I would like to ask my colleague one question. Where do we draw the \nline, and what is a substantial or unsubstantial impairment of safety?\n  Does not the Feinstein amendment require the placement of taggants \nwhere doing so may very well impair safety? At least, that is what I \nhave been led to believe.\n  I would be happy to yield for a response.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a \nmoment, the amendment very specifically says so that safety would not \nbe impaired; in other words, in the study that would be done in the \nensuing 12 months that there not be an adverse environmental impact, \nnot impair the stability of the explosive materials, and that safety \nnot be impaired.\n  Those are the three criteria in the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. The study that the distinguished Senator from California \nhas cited was conducted, I believe, back in 1980. I am a member of the \nTechnology Assessment Board. That study itself found substantial \nevidence that placing taggants in explosives seriously affects \n[[Page S7666]] the stability of the explosive material. I am reading \nwhat it says here on page 29, in their detailed findings.\n\n       The tests so far conducted are only a small fraction of the \n     total number of tests that must be performed before it can \n     conclusively be determined whether taggants are compatible \n     with commercial explosives and gun powders. Even if the \n     current question of the stability of smokeless powder in \n     boosters is resolved, it is not possible to generalize from \n     the results of the limited tests . . . so far completed.\n\n  And they conclude that the testing has not demonstrated that taggants \ncan be safely added to explosives.\n  Thousands of people come into contact with explosives every day \nduring the manufacture, storage, transportation, and use of explosives. \nAccidents involving explosives can have extremely severe consequences \nto these thousands of people. Therefore, safety must be demonstrated, \nand a carefully administered qualification program for analysis, \nsafety, testing, and manufacturing procedures, control, and experience \nis necessary before a new explosive or an explosive with a significant \nexchange in composition can be considered safe.\n  In addition, each type of explosive product requires individual \nevaluation and testing, the type of qualification program considered \nnecessary before safety can be demonstrated as shown in table 12 and \ndiscussed in detail in chapter 4. A particularly important aspect of \nthat qualification testing is the effect of long-term storage.\n  It goes on. The point is that recently, the ATF itself asked for \nfurther studies recognizing that technologies had changed substantially \nsince the original study was conducted. It is pretty apparent that I \nand those on my side of this issue do not oppose taggants per se. \nRather, we oppose granting regulatory authority to an agency before an \nupdated study can be done which may solve some of these very important \nissues.\n  Even though the distinguished Senator requires a study, as do we, she \nrequires without further congressional approval that taggants be placed \nautomatically at a certain time. It makes no sense to grant regulatory \nauthority before an updated study is conducted. Indeed, I think that \nthis legislation proposed by Senator Feinstein would seriously \nundermine our confidence in the studies that have occurred thus far and \nour confidence in explosives in general.\n  So there is a lot of use of explosives in our society--legitimate, \nhonest, decent use. The Unimin letter is a perfect illustration of \nperhaps thousands of businesses or companies or people who might be \naffected by this. We should not compromise the integrity or the \nobjectivity of the study conducted by OTA.\n  So I, therefore, oppose this amendment, and with the Senator's \npermission, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays, with the understanding that it will not be voted upon until after \n6 o'clock tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Feinstein \namendment No. 1202 be laid aside, and at 6 p.m., we have a vote on my \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is a very special day to Oklahoma. We \nhave a very distinguished group of people from Oklahoma who are at this \nvery moment visiting with various Senators who oppose the idea of \nhabeas reform. I cannot think of any stronger message that we can take \nto these people than from those who are the survivors and those who \nhave families lost in the tragic explosion in Oklahoma.\n  I just came back from my 76th town hall meeting out in Oklahoma. I \nthink I probably have more of those than any other Member of this body. \nA question always comes up when I have these meetings. They say \nsomething to the effect, ``Why is it that people in Washington are more \nconcerned about the criminals than they are the victims?'' I try to \nexplain to them--and I know that this is rather controversial to say, \nbut I really believe it in my own heart, Mr. President--that at least \nprior to this new Congress coming in, the majority of people in both of \nthese bodies did not honestly in their own hearts believe that \npunishment is a deterrent to crime.\n  It is one that I look at, and it seems very logical that when you \ntake a tragedy such as we experienced in Oklahoma, when the \nperpetrators of that crime were preparing this explosion and what they \nwere going to do, the bombing and the attack on the Federal building in \nOklahoma City, this is not something that they did just overnight. This \nis something they planned--not for days, not for weeks, but maybe even, \nwe feel, for several months.\n  During the time that something like this is happening, those \nindividuals who are making the plans to detonate a bomb that will \nmurder many, many people have to be thinking what is the worst thing, \nwhat is the downside of this, what is the worst thing that can happen \nto me if I get caught? The worst thing that can happen, as they look at \nit, might be to sit around in some air-conditioned prison cell watching \ncolor TV, eating three good meals a day for 10 years, 15 years, 20 \nyears. And I suggest to you, Mr. President, that is not much of a \ndeterrent.\n  I think particularly some of the people from maybe the Middle Eastern \ncultures, and others, people who are trained terrorists--most of them--\ndo not think they are going to be around for 10 years, anyway. Here in \nAmerica, it takes an average of 9\\1/2\\ years between conviction and \nexecution. I suggest that takes away all of the deterrent value.\n  This happens because we have things built into our system. I am sure \nthat they were put in there in the sense of trying to be fair to \neveryone, and to make sure no chances are taken that someone might be \nexecuted who was not actually the one who committed the crime. But they \nsit in there through appeal after appeal after appeal.\n  Roger Dale Stafford, in the spring of 1978, murdered a Sergeant \nLorenz, then he murdered his wife, then he murdered Sergeant Lorenz' \nsmall son. Then he turned around and drove 60 miles to Oklahoma City, \nwhere he went into the Sirloin Stockade Restaurant.\n He rounded up six employees at gunpoint, bound them, took them into a \nrefrigerator, and murdered them execution style.\n\n  That was in 1978. Roger Dale Stafford is now still in McAlester in \nour State prison in Oklahoma. By the way, he is now over 100 pounds \nmore than he was when he went in, so you know they are feeding him \npretty well. He has been sitting in his cell for 17 years and probably \nliving better than he lived before anyway. And I suggest to you that is \nnot just an inhumane thing to do to the families of those victims of \nhis murders, but it is no deterrent for other people who may be tempted \nto do the same thing.\n  What is interesting about this is that the attorney who is so \nsuccessful in getting all of these appeals and all these delays in the \nultimate execution which still has not taken place of the guy who did \nkill those nine people back in Oklahoma in 1978, that attorney is a \nvery competent and capable attorney named Steven Jones from Enid, OK. I \nhappen to know him personally. I suggest to you that Steven Jones is \nalso the attorney for Timothy McVeigh, one who is held right now as \npossibly one who is responsible for the tragedy in Oklahoma City.\n  So today we have a number of people who are here from Oklahoma. We \nhave Diane Leonard, whose husband Don, a Secret Service agent, was \nkilled in the bombing in Oklahoma City. We have Glenn Seidl, who lost \nhis wife, Kathy, in the bombing. I talked to Kay Ice just a few minutes \nago, who lost her brother, Paul. He was a customs agent; Mike Reyes, \nwho lost his father and was injured himself in the explosion. I believe \nhe is the one who actually fell four stories and was able to survive. \nBut he lost his father; Jason Smith, who lost his mother, Linda; Dan \nMcKinney. That is Linda's husband. He was here today; Gary Bland, who \nlost [[Page S7667]] his wife, Sally; Suzanne Britten, who lost her \nfiance.\n  It is very significant that we understand what these people are doing \ntoday. We had a news conference at 10:30, and we stood down there in \nfront of the Senate and they described the types of deaths that their \nloved ones had been subjected to, how there was no longer any facial \ncharacteristics left; they could not really identify them as they \nnormally would; and being exposed to this, they are going through all \nthis for one reason. That is, they know the way to deter this type of \nthing from happening again is to have swift justice.\n  We had a President who came out and said we want swift and sure \njustice. I call upon the President right now to stand up before these \nOklahomans who are up here today and say, yes, I support Senator \nHatch's habeas reform as in the bill. Frankly, as a Senator from \nOklahoma, I am going to support the Kyl amendment for a stronger habeas \nbill. It is very moderate and very fair, but it is a habeas reform that \nwill not allow these things to go year after year after year, 10 years, \n15 years and 20 years, where all deterrent value is lost.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that those Senators who are being visited \nright now by Diane Leonard, and by Glenn Seidl, and by Kay Ice and Mike \nReyes and Jason Smith and Dan McKinney and Gary Bland and Suzanne \nBritten will stop and realize that they have an opportunity to preclude \nsomething like this from happening again, allow the message that will \ngo out to all who might be considering such an act that in America we \nare not going to allow someone to sit around for 8 years or 10 years or \n20 years before an execution takes place. We will in fact have swift \njustice.\n  Maybe, Mr. President, I am old fashioned, but I really believe in my \nheart that punishment is a deterrent to crime, and sitting around for \n10 years is not cruel punishment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1203 to Amendment No. 1199\n (Purpose: To make technical changes in section 102 of the Dole-Hatch \n                              substitute)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for and on \nbehalf of Mr. Smith and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. Smith, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1203 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, line 6, strike ``25 years.'' and insert the \n     following:\n       ``25 years; Provided, however, That the damages to property \n     that were caused, or would have been caused if any object of \n     the conspiracy had been accomplished, must exceed, or must be \n     reasonably estimated to exceed, $25,000.\n       On page 7, at the end of line 17, add the following:\n       ``Provided, however, That the damages to property must \n     exceed $25,000;''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have just sent up the amendment for and \non behalf of Senator Smith. This is an amendment of a technical nature. \nThis amendment simply places a dollar floor on cases that can be \nbrought in Federal court in acts of terrorism. This amendment will \nprevent Federal courts from having to try minor cases in Federal court. \nFor example, we would not want a case involving a mere broken window or \na smashed door to be tried in Federal court.\n  So this amendment basically says, ``* * * 25 years; provided, \nhowever, that the damages to property that were caused, or would have \nbeen caused if any object of the conspiracy had been accomplished, must \nexceed, or must reasonably be estimated to exceed, $25,000.'' So that \nis basically what this amendment does.\n  This amendment makes a great deal of sense in the context of this \ndebate so I would urge my colleagues to support this Smith amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Smith amendment be \nset aside so that I can call up a Pressler amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1204 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To designate the Federal building at 1314 LeMay Boulevard, \n   Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD, as the ``Cartney Koch McRaven Child \n                         Development Center'')\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I am proud to offer this amendment along \nwith my South Dakota colleague, Senator Daschle, to S. 735, the \nComprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act, to designate the child \ndevelopment center at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota as the \nCartney Koch McRaven Child Development Center.\n  It was just slightly more than a month ago that terrorist thugs \nbombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Among \nthe victims inside was Cartney Koch McRaven. Stationed at Tinker Air \nForce Base and having just been married the previous weekend, Cartney \nwas in the Murrah Federal Building to register her new married name on \nFederal documents. Tragically, her life was cut short by the savagery \nof domestic terrorism.\n  It is only fitting that we honor Cartney at Ellsworth Air Force Base. \nSpearfish was her home. And she chose to begin her adult life by \njoining the Air Force and serving her country. And serve she did, with \nhonor, with devotion, with dignity.\n  It is even more fitting that her name appear on the child development \ncenter at Ellsworth. A1c Cartney Koch McRaven served in Haiti, where \nthe stark poverty had an enormous impact on her. Cartney's heart went \nout to the children of Haiti. She devoted her time in Haiti to an \norphanage, offering a warm smile and a kind, loving word to young \nfaces. The mission of our Armed Forces in Haiti was to ensure peace and \noffer hope to the people of Haiti--young and old. Cartney took her \nmission to heart.\n  Even her family honored Cartney's commitment to young people by \nurging that donations be made in Cartney's memory to the orphanage in \nHaiti.\n  But we do more than honor a person. We honor the values she \npersonified and practiced in her daily life. The values of service, of \nduty, of compassion and caring for the underprivileged young--values \nthat are at the core of South Dakota and of America. [[Page S7668]] \n  It is my hope that by passing this amendment and the underlying bill, \nCartney Koch McRaven forever will be remembered as a symbol of these \ncore values and an inspiration to the young people in South Dakota and \nAmerica to honor and serve their family, community, and country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of \nmy colleague, Senator Pressler, the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota. This amendment would designate the child development center at \nEllsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota as the ``Cartney Koch McRaven \nChild Development Center.''\n  This amendment intends to honor the dedication and service of a young \nAir Force airman from South Dakota who was killed in the Oklahoma City \nbombing. U.S. Airman First Class Cartney Koch McRaven, a South Dakota \nnative stationed at Tinker Air Force Base outside Oklahoma City, was \namong those killed in the April 19, 1995 bombing.\n  Last year, while serving in Haiti, Cartney devoted her free time to \nan orphanage. Her family asked that in lieu of flowers, donations be \nmade to the orphanage in Haiti. This amendment seeks to honor her \nmemory by designating the child development center at Ellsworth Air \nForce Base the ``Cartney Koch McRaven Child Development Center.''\n  I believe we can get unanimous consent on this amendment honoring \nthis young Air Force airman. My colleague from Delaware is not here to \ncomment on this amendment, so I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment now be set aside so that we can call up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1205 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 18 of the United States Code regarding false \n                       identification documents.)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. Pressler, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1205 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to explain the false ID amendment \nI have proposed to S. 735, the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act.\n  According to several national news sources, Timothy McVeigh, the \nprimary suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing, allegedly used a false \nSouth Dakota driver's license to rent the Ryder truck which exploded \noutside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building on April 19 of this year. \nAgain, the driver's license used by McVeigh was a fake. Timothy McVeigh \nis not a resident of South Dakota, nor do I believe he ever has been a \nresident of my State. My understanding is the fake license contained \nhis picture, but a different name. To add insult to injury, the \nbirthdate listed on the license was April 19, the same date as the \nbombing. This example illustrates how easily a terrorist can obtain an \nauthentic-looking driver's license, and operate in our society under an \nassumed name.\n  It is not clear at this point exactly how McVeigh obtained the false \nSouth Dakota driver's license. However, the sad fact is, false \nidentification documents [ID's] are easy and cheap to obtain given the \nadvanced state of computer technology today. Counterfeiting a driver's \nlicense is child's play for sophisticated computer users. Modern color \nprinters can produce stunningly accurate reproductions of driver's \nlicenses, Social Security cards, and other ID's. Even \nanticounterfeiting measures, such as holographic images and magnetic \nstrips, are being duplicated with relative ease.\n  A vast underground industry has emerged to meet the growing demand \nfor false ID's from underage drinkers. Just last week, two young men \nwho were students at George Washington University here in Washington, \nDC, plead guilty to operating a sophisticated fake driver's license \noperation. They sold the fake licenses to college students for $65 \neach. They even gave a discount for ordering 10 or more fake ID's. I \nask that a news article describing that operation be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Most States have laws against the use of false ID's to \npurchase alcohol, but those laws only target the underage drinker. \nNothing prohibits anyone from mailing false ID's from another State. \nTough Federal action is needed to really make a difference. Congress \nneeds to crack down on the suppliers--those in the industry of \nproducing and distributing false ID's.\n  Last year, and again this year, I introduced legislation designed to \ndeal with this situation. The amendment I have offered today is similar \nto this legislation. It seeks to target and punish those in the \nbusiness of producing and distributing false identification documents \nnationally.\n  Anyone convicted of distributing false ID's under this provision \nwould face a prison sentence of up to 1 year, a fine, or both. The \namendment also would reduce from five to three the number of false ID's \nthat must be in a person's possession to trigger penalties under \nFederal law.\n  These two changes are needed if we are to make a dent in the volume \nof false ID's being offered and sold throughout our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 2, 1995]\n\n           Two Plead Guilty to Selling Fake Driver's Licenses\n\n                             (By Toni Locy)\n\n       A student and a former student at George Washington \n     University pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court yesterday to \n     running a sophisticated fake driver's license operation, \n     using computers to make nearly perfect copies to sell to \n     underage students in several states so they could buy liquor.\n       Prosecutor Joseph B. Valder described Ronald Stewart \n     Johnson, 20, as the mastermind of the scheme and Said C. \n     Kiwan, 19, as the legman who drummed up business and \n     [[Page S7669]] made deliveries for the illegal enterprise. \n     They sold the licenses for $65 each or at a discount of $55 \n     each for 10, making about $8,000 in less than six months.\n       Valder said Johnson, as a high school student in Durham, \n     N.C., discovered the wonders of computers and learned how to \n     alter valid driver's licenses. He said Johnson used scanning \n     equipment to enter a driver's license into a computer and \n     shading and texture devices to make changes.\n       In 1994, Kiwan and Johnson, who were friends when their \n     families lived in Rio de Janeiro when they were both 10, \n     became reacquainted and began selling the licenses to make \n     money, Valder said.\n       Though the prosecutor and defense attorneys lauded their \n     cooperation with authorities after they were caught, U.S. \n     District Judge Ricardo Urbina rejected a request by Kiwan's \n     attorney to forgo the normal procedures and sentence him \n     immediately.\n       Attorney Thomas Abbenante said GWU officials will decide \n     next week whether to expel Kiwan, as they have done with \n     Johnson. If Kiwan's case is resolved, Abbenante said, he has \n     a chance to remain in school.\n       But Urbina refused to give Kiwan such a consideration. \n     ``This is an episode in his life that carries the potential \n     of two years of incarceration. I would not want to send you \n     the wrong message by having you walk in here, plead guilty . \n     . . and walk out with probation that you may not deserve,'' \n     the judge told Kiwan, who is a citizen of England and \n     Lebanon.\n       ``You are a privileged young man with lots of education, \n     lots of advantages in life, with no need for money, and yet \n     you engaged in this enterprise, which probably resulted in a \n     lot of young people getting booze and possibly driving under \n     the influence,'' Urbina said. ``If ill consequences develop \n     because of it, then that is your problem. You are here \n     because you committed a crime, and you have to deal with the \n     consequences, whatever they are.''\n       Kiwan pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts for sending \n     fake driver's licenses to a student at Vanderbilt University, \n     in Nashville, and to a high school student in Durham. \n     Johnson, who was born in Brazil but is a U.S. citizen, \n     pleaded guilty to a felony charge of unlawful production of \n     false identification. He faces up to five years in prison.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I also believe this is another technical \namendment that probably will be accepted by unanimous consent. I think \nmany of the Republican amendments are of this nature. I do not believe \nthis amendment needs to delay the debate on this matter.\n  What this amendment does is that it is similar to S. 507, the False \nIdentification Act of 1995, which has the support of Senators Grassley \nand Daschle. It would make the following two changes in our current \nlaw:\n  First, it would reduce from five to three the number of false \nidentification documents--that is, ID's--that must be in a person's \npossession to trigger penalties under Federal law.\n  Second, it would require a prison sentence of up to 1 year, a fine, \nor both, for anybody convicted of distributing false ID's through the \nmail.\n  The amendment seeks to target and punish those producing and \ndistributing false identification documents nationally. According to \nnew sources, Timothy McVeigh used a false identification to rent the \nRyder truck used in the Oklahoma City bombing. This illustrates how a \nterrorist can obtain an authentic-looking driver's license and operate \nin our society under an assumed name.\n  False ID's are obtained far too easily and cheaply today. \nCounterfeiting a driver's license is child's play for sophisticated \ncomputer users. Modern color printers can produce stunningly accurate \nreproductions of driver's licenses, Social Security cards, and other \nidentification documents.\n  Even anticounterfeit measures such as holographic images and magnetic \nstrips are being duplicated with relative ease. A vast underground \nindustry has emerged to meet the growing demand for false ID's for \nunderaged drinkers. Most States have laws against the use of false ID's \nto purchase alcohol, but they only target the underaged drinker. \nNothing prohibits mailing false ID's from another State.\n  Tougher Federal action is needed to really make a difference. \nCongress needs to crack down on the suppliers, those in the industry \nproducing and distributing false ID's.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Pressler amendment be set aside so \nthat another amendment can be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment I have sent to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Specter simply authorizes assistance to foreign \ncountries to procure explosives detection devices and other \nsophisticated counterterrorism technology.\n  I believe that, in time, we can unanimously accept this amendment. \nThat is why I have sent it to the desk. I compliment Senator Specter \nfor his work on this amendment. I also compliment Senator Pressler for \nthe work on his two amendments and Senator Smith for the work on his \namendment, all of which are before the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Specter amendment be set aside so \nwe can call up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, referring to the current debate on the \ntaggants amendment of Senator Feinstein, Senator Simpson has asked me \nto get a letter into the Record from ARCO Coal Co. This is a letter to \nthe Honorable Alan K. Simpson dated June 5, 1995.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Alan K. Simpson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Simpson: I understand that the Senate will be \n     discussing S. 735 as early as June 6. As noted in earlier \n     correspondence we support the concept of the bill. However, \n     we have learned that Senator Feinstein will probably be \n     introducing an amendment that broadens the scope of the bill \n     to include such explosive agents as ammonium nitrate with \n     fuel oil (ANFO). I am writing to urge you to resist this \n     amendment as unnecessary and very costly. Following is most \n     of the letter that was previously sent to your attention, and \n     believe that it explains the problems with the Feinstein \n     amendment.\n       In the wake of the tragedy in Oklahoma City, I have learned \n     of Senate legislation that has been introduced to address the \n     issue of domestic terrorism (S.735). ARCO Coal Company \n     supports legislation that reduces or eliminates these \n     horrific acts, but urges against any over reaction that would \n     adversely impact the legal and responsible use of explosive \n     materials, including ANFO.\n       Before discussing the proposed legislation in more detail, \n     let me first explain the importance of this issue to the coal \n     industry in Wyoming. Thunder Basin Coal Company (TBCC) is our \n     subsidiary in Wyoming, operating the Black Thunder (BTM) and \n     Coal Creek Mines. In order to mine efficiently, safely and \n     cost effectively, the overburden and coal is ``shot'' with an \n     ANFO/emulsion [[Page S7670]] blend. Blasting operations at \n     BTM safely and legally consume about 75 to 85 million pounds \n     of ANFO on an annual basis (with plans to increase the usage \n     to nearly 100 million pounds annually). The ammonium nitrate \n     prill is manufactured at the fertilizer plant near Cheyenne, \n     Wyoming and is transported to the mine by Wyoming trucking \n     companies.\n       In reading about the proposed legislation we concur with \n     the requirement for a ``detection agent'' (or taggant) in \n     ``plastic explosives''. However, we oppose any broader \n     requirements that explosive material, which would include \n     ANFO, to contain ``taggants'' or ``tracer elements'' (to be \n     defined by regulation). We have several key concerns with \n     requiring taggants in ANFO, including:\n       1. Safety--manufacturers of the explosives used by the \n     mining industry have raised the concern that the introduction \n     of taggants will raise safety concerns. For example, the \n     manufacturers are concerned that the introduction of the \n     taggant into an explosives mixture can have an adverse effect \n     on the friction and impact sensitivity and/or the stability \n     properties of the explosives. The Wyoming coal mining \n     industry is among the safest, if not the safest, in the \n     entire world. This admirable safety record has not come about \n     by accident, but rather through careful implementation of \n     safety awareness and programs. We cannot compromise the \n     safety of our employees.\n       2. Cost--a 1993 study by the Institute of Makers of \n     Explosives (IME) conservatively estimated that taggants in \n     ANFO would cost an additional 47 cents per pound. As \n     previously noted, BTM anticipates using 75 to 85 million \n     pounds of ANFO annually. Using the IME study, TBCC's costs \n     would conservatively rise by $35 to $40 million annually on a \n     product that is currently being used in a safe, legal and \n     regulated manner. In a market that is highly competitive, \n     costs have to be controlled.\n       We hope that you will support Title VIII provisions in S. \n     735 and will resist any efforts to expand the scope of the \n     bill to include ANFO. This will help ensure that any new \n     legislative and/or regulatory program meets its specified \n     purpose without compromising safety or punishing industries \n     using the product in a safe and legal fashion. We would also \n     be glad to help you in any manner you desire with regard to \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Greg Schaefer.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Gregg Schaefer is director of Government issues and \nanalysis for the ARCO Coal Co.\n  Mr. President, as I said before, there are presently 100 amendments \nunder the unanimous consent. We have five up. Sixty-eight of those are \nDemocrat amendments; we have one of those up. Thirty-two amendments are \nRepublican; four of those are up. Most of those 32 amendments, I \nbelieve, will not be offered.\n  I am hoping that Senators will get to the floor and offer their \namendments so that we can stack these votes after 6 o'clock p.m. and \nmove ahead with this very important bill.\n  I am wearing this ribbon in honor of the people who died, and their \nfamilies who have survived, the Oklahoma City bombing. It has great \nsignificance to me because one of the survivor's daughters pinned it on \nme earlier this morning. I wear it with honor and with consideration \nfor what these good people suffered and what they are going through \ncurrently.\n  We know that this bill is critical. The President has expressed \ndissatisfaction with the Congress because we did not pass an \nantiterrorist bill by Memorial Day. We are only a little time later \nthan Memorial Day--one week. I believe we can, if we can get the \ncooperation of our friends on both sides of the aisle, I believe we can \npass this bill by tomorrow evening or at some reasonable time this \nweek.\n  I hope that Senators who have amendments will get over here to the \nfloor and offer them. We will stack those amendments until after 6 \no'clock tonight, and if necessary, tomorrow. I would like to debate \nthem now and utilize this time so that we can move ahead on this very \nimportant bill.\n  Regarding a vast majority of this bill, I think a vast majority of \nSenators will agree with. I believe a vast majority of this bill, if \nnot most all of it, the President agrees with.\n  It is a bill that should not have any real controversy except in some \nisolated areas, and of course on the habeas corpus reform provisions.\n  There are people who sincerely believe that we should have no habeas \ncorpus rights in this society. There will be an amendment offered, \nperhaps later today or tomorrow, that will severely curtail habeas \ncorpus appeals, if it is passed.\n  Then there are others who believe we ought to continue the same \nsystem we have now which allows for multiple frivolous appeals, one \nappeal after another, all the way up to the State courts, and then all \nthe way up to the Federal courts, or vice versa. I do not think very \nmany people in this country would agree with either of those extreme \npoints of view.\n  Habeas corpus is a statutory right that was established for the \npurpose of protecting the rights of the accused. Our habeas corpus \nprovision, the Specter-Hatch bill, will protect those rights, but it \nwill put an end to the frivolous appeals that make a mockery out of our \nsystem of justice.\n  I hope that our fellow Senators will get over here and bring their \namendments to the floor so that we can move ahead and get this bill \ndone within a reasonable time, please our President, and certainly do \nso in memorialization of the suffering that these folks from Oklahoma \nCity are undergoing and in memorialization of those who have died, \nbecause we have not done enough to resolve terrorist problems in our \nsociety.\n  I am not sure that any piece of legislation is going to absolutely \nprotect people from terrorist activities. Of course, no legislation can \nbe crafted to do that. But this legislation will put teeth in our \ncriminal laws, our Federal criminal laws, to bring people to justice \nwho might commit terrorist activities and might deter those who are \nconsidering participating in terrorist activities in our society.\n  I am hopeful we can move ahead here today. I am prepared to stay as \nlong as we have to and to debate any issue that any Member cares to \nbring to the floor. I hope those who have the remaining 67 amendments \non the Democrat side and the remaining 28 amendments on the Republican \nside will get to the floor and move ahead on this matter.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very concerned that we are sitting \nhere just wasting time while there have been complaints about not \nmoving ahead on the terrorism bill. So we are moving ahead. We are here \nto go. Frankly, the only real controversial issue that I can see of any \nreal consequence on this bill happens to be the habeas corpus, Specter-\nHatch bill. I am hoping that those who have amendments on that habeas \ncorpus reform bill will bring them to the floor and debate them and let \nus get them out of the way. If they win, they win. If they lose, they \nlose. The fact is let us get out here and use this time and not waste \nit. Thus far, we have had four Republican amendments, one Democrat \namendment. The Democrat amendment is scheduled for a vote at 6 o'clock.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1207 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n    Purpose: To extend U.S. sanctions against Iran to all countries \n    designated as ``terrorist countries'' by the Secretary of State)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send another Republican amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration. I send this up for and on \nbehalf of Senator Brown from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for Mr. Brown, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1207 to amendment No. 1199.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Dole-Hatch substitute, add \n     the following new section--\n\n     ``SEC.  . SANCTIONS AGAINST TERRORIST COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--In conjunction with a determination by \n     the Secretary of State that a nation is a state sponsor of \n     international terrorism pursuant to 6(j) of the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment for and on \nbehalf of the distinguished Senator from Colorado, [Mr. Brown].\n  This amendment will extend the sanctions currently imposed against \nIran to all countries designated as terrorist countries by the \nSecretary of State. Thus, under Senator Brown's proposed amendment, all \ncountries deemed to engage in terrorist activities and designated as \nsupporting international terrorism will be punished to the same degree \nthat Iran is.\n  Now, this is a controversial amendment. I hope that those who are \nopposed to it will come to the floor and be prepared to debate it if \nthey so desire. If not, we will put it in line following the stacked \namendments where either it will be accepted by unanimous consent or \nvoted upon one way or the other. Senator Brown has permitted me to put \nthat amendment into the Record at this point.\n  Now, that makes five Republican amendments. I think it is safe to \nassume that Senator Dole probably is not going to call up his two. I am \nnot going to call up my two. And so that is at least 9 or 10 Republican \namendments disposed of, and I do not believe most of the others will be \nbrought forward either.\n  Major difficulties are going to be over the question of habeas corpus \nreform. And I hope that those who have amendments to that will bring \nthem up here today and let us debate them and go ahead. If there are \nany other amendments that can be brought to the floor at this time, we \nsure would like to encourage our colleagues to do so so we can dispose \nof as many of them today as we possibly can.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Brown amendment be set aside so that \nanother amendment can be called up by any Senator who desires to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, again I encourage my colleagues to get here \nand bring up their amendments. So far, we have five Republican \namendments up, and two Democrat amendments. I believe that Senator Dole \nwill forgo his two. I intend to forgo my two, unless we have to use \nthose. I have been informed by Senator Gramm's staffer that he will \nforgo his two. That is six more.\n  We are moving through this pretty well today. But I would like to get \nas many amendments as can be agreed to or debated over a short term \ntoday as quickly as possible. Of course, we would be happy to take any \nhabeas corpus amendments that there are.\n  As I have been standing here, some people have called in and wondered \nabout the ribbons I am wearing on my lapel that were kindly placed \nthere by one of the family members who lost a member of their family.\n  I think it is important, as we discuss this matter, that we recall \nwhy in the world we are here. There are 167 victims of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing. This morning, along with Senator Inhofe and Senator \nNickles, I met with the families of some of the victims of that \ntragedy. So they presented me with this ribbon I am wearing. Let me \njust explain its significance. It has four ribbons, or four strands. \nThe blue strand right here represents the State of Oklahoma. The white \nstrand represents hope. The yellow strand represents those who were \nmissing in the wake of the bombing. The purple strand represents those \nkilled. Just to make that point a little more dramatically, this chart \nrepresents the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of those names be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 The Murdered Victims of Oklahoma City\n\n       Lucio Aleman, Jr., 33.\n       Teresa Alexander, 33.\n       Ted Allen, 48.\n       Richard Allen, 46.\n       Baylee Almon, 1.\n       Diane E.

These were folks who were working for our country or \nstanding in the street at the time. Many of them have been heroes for \nyears, and they are all heroes today. These ribbons I am wearing \nrepresent these people of the State of Oklahoma--those missing and \nthose killed.\n  These people are crying out for us to get this bill passed and to do \nwhat should be done. There were a number of children who were killed. I \nwould just like to read their names into the Record:\n\n       Almon, Baylee, 1; Bell, Danielle, 1\\1/2\\; Bradley, \n     Peachlyn, 3; Bruce, Gabreon, 4 months; Chavez, Zackary, 3; \n     Cooper, Anthony C., II, 2; Cooper, Antonio A., Jr., 6 months; \n     Coverdale, Elijan, 2; Coverdale, Aaron, 5; Coyne, Jaci, 14 \n     months; Eaves, Tylor, 8 months; Eckles, Ashley, 4; Garrett, \n     Tevin, 1; Gottshall, Kevin Lee, 6 months; Johnson, Domonique \n     London, 2; Kennedy, Blake R., 1\\1/2\\; Smith, Chase, 3; Smith, \n     Colton, 2; and Titsworth, Kayla M., 3.\n  These people are crying out in having been killed. These children and \ntheir families are crying out for us to do what should be done here. I \nintend to see that it is done.\n  Let us get our amendments here and get this bill done. If it can be \nimproved, fine. The people who have amendments, we would like to get \nthem here.\n  Baylee Almon turned 1 year old on Tuesday, April 18, 1995. That day \nher family threw her a birthday party. Her aunts, uncles, and cousins--\nalong with her 22-year-old, single mother Aren--celebrated what was to \nbe her first of many birthdays. Horribly, however, her lifeless body \nwas pulled from the rubble of the Alfred Murrah building in Oklahoma \nCity less than 24 hours later.\n  By now, we are too familiar with the unforgettable image of Baylee \nbeing carried away from the wreckage by firefighter Capt. Chris Fields. \nThis image of Baylee's lifeless body being tenderly cradled by a \nfirefighter was called by Governor Frank Keating ``a metaphor for \nwhat's happened here.'' Baylee was 1 of 19 children murdered by the \nterrorist bomb blast on April 19, 1995.\n  When some suggest that our decision to include habeas corpus reform \nin this bill is unrelated to the murder of children like Baylee or that \nour efforts are politically motivated, we mock the memory of Baylee \nAlmon. Habeas corpus policies and procedures directly and forcefully \nimpact victims. Our debate about habeas reform has traditionally \nfocused on such issues as the rights of petitioning prisoners, \nfederalism, and competency of counsel. But, for those who have buried \nmurder victims, the continued, protracted appeals mean something else. \nJohn Collins, the father of a 19-year-old young woman who was brutally \nmurdered in 1985, may have put it best when he testified before the \nJudiciary Committee in 1991:\n\n       Extended habeas corpus proceedings mean no closure to our \n     grief, no end to our mental and emotional suffering, no end \n     to nightmares, and no relief from the leaden weights that \n     remain lodged in our hearts. It means we continue to bleed.\n\n  Due to our current system of habeas corpus litigation, April 19, will \nnot be the end of the victimization of those [[Page S7673]] who died in \nOklahoma City. Long after the media stops covering the tragedy and \nelected officials stop meeting with the victims, those responsible for \nthis cowardly act will probably be flaunting justice unless we act to \npass habeas reform. The families of those who died will agonize for \nmany, many years to come unless we act to pass true, meaningful habeas \ncorpus reform.\n  For too long, the interests of the convicted murdered have \noutweighted the interests of the families of murder victims. For too \nlong, habeas corpus has been viewed as a tangential issue to the more \nalluring issues of gun control and enhanced mandatory penalties. What \nis ironic is that for many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, it never seems to be the right time to pass habeas corpus \nreform.\n  The time has come to return some balance in the criminal justice \nsystem and nowhere is this more urgently needed than in the capital \nlitigation area. We must recognize that the true concerns of justice, \nin the final analysis, must lie with those who support society and \ngenuinely strive to uphold its law and not those who tear away at \nsociety, mock its laws, and murder innocent children like Baylee.\n  I am concerned about it, and I just think it is time to act. We \nshould quit playing around with these problems. We have a chance of \nmaking a difference right now.\n  Let me just take a second here and read a letter from a woman who was \nat the press conference this morning. This is dated June 4, 1995.\n\n       Re: Dole-Specter-Hatch bill S. 735.\n       My husband of 34 years and the father of our three \n     children, Tim, 24, Todd 22, and Kristi, 19, was a Director of \n     Housing and Urban Development in Oklahoma City. We had only \n     been in Oklahoma for 4 months, had purchased our home only 3 \n     weeks before he was killed on April 19. Our lives were \n     literally ``blown\" apart. He was a wonderful husband, father, \n     son, brother, and human being, kind and caring to everyone \n     and truly a person who believed in observing the laws of our \n     land and also never forgetting how blessed we as Americans \n     are to be Americans and to enjoy the many wonderful freedoms \n     and opportunities available to us when we abide by our laws.\n       That is what I am asking for now: Swift and severe \n     punishment of those responsible for this horrible act. Our \n     President assured the people of Oklahoma and America this \n     would be done. There should not be more consideration for the \n     criminals than the victims. Under our Constitution, the \n     rights of criminals have to be protected in deciding if they \n     are guilty or innocent, but so do the rights of the victims \n     need to be protected. Protecting criminals' rights does not \n     give them the right of 20 years of appeals.\n       I am certain that if any one of you were in my shoes, (and \n     I sincerely hope you never are) you would want nothing less \n     than the death penalty--now--not years from now.\n       I pray with all my heart you will do whatever is necessary \n     to enact legislation that will not allow continuous appeals. \n     Joyce McCarthy, widow of James A. McCarthy, Edmond, OK.\n\n  That letter says it more poignantly than anything I could say. It is \ntime to do habeas corpus reform. We tried for years. We did pass this \nbill through the Senate on the Hatch amendment a number of years ago. \nIt passed overwhelmingly. There is no reason not to face this issue \ntoday.\n  Now, I have to say that I do believe that there are those who very \nsincerely oppose habeas corpus reform in this body. I think they are a \ndistinct minority, and I think they oppose it mainly because they \noppose the death penalty. They are deathly afraid that maybe somebody \nwill be executed who was innocent.\n  They have no information to back them up on that. These cases are \nvery carefully tried. Any person accused of murder and sentenced to \ndeath after this bill is enacted will have every one of that person's \nconstitutional rights and privileges and liberties protected. We will \nstill protect the civil liberties of the people. But the game is over \non multiple frivolous vehicles. They have one trip up and it is \nextensive through the State court, and one through the Federal courts. \nUnless they can show new evidence, or the Supreme Court has made a case \nretroactive in nature, then that is the end of the appeals.\n  That is as it should be. It is time to face this problem. Is time to \nstand up and do what has to be done. There is a lot more to be said \nabout it.\n  I was moved this morning in meeting these families and these people \nwho lost their loved ones in Oklahoma City. I am proud to wear a set of \nribbons which represents the State of Oklahoma, those who are missing \nand those who are dead, as a result of this terrible, horrific bomb.\n  I hope we can move ahead on this bill. We made some headway here \ntoday, but I would like to make a lot more before the day is over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the majority leader today opened the \nsession by criticizing the President and criticizing the Democrats for \nwhat he says are a flood of amendments that are holding up this bill. \nHe said that if the Senate is not finished by tomorrow, we will pull \nthe bill and go on to further matters.\n  Let me point out that in all the years that I have been here--and the \nSenator from Utah has been over here a few years less than I have--one \nof the things delaying action on the bill today is we are coming off of \na recess of a week and half and the Members are not back in town yet. \nThat is one of the reasons there is delay.\n  Let me first say, contrary to the majority leader's representations, \nwe are not trying to delay this bill. Indeed, on the very same day we \nreceived the final version of the Republican bill--and we had started \noff, by the way, with the President's bill. The President introduced a \nbill, or had 3 Members introduce the bill on his behalf.\n  Senators Kohl, Specter, and myself met with the President at the \nWhite House. This was a bipartisan group, including the Republican \nleadership. We were under the impression that the President's bill \nwould be the bill from which we worked.\n  The Republicans, as is their right, introduced their own bill. One of \nthe problems is that we did not see that bill until toward the middle \nof the afternoon the day that we went out of here, I think, or maybe \nthe day before we went out. People had not had a chance to read the \nbill.\n  Notwithstanding that, the very same day we received the bill, we \nagreed to a finite list of amendments. We did not wait around. Once we \ncalmed everyone's concerns--we heard about terrorism, civil liberties, \nnew actions, and everyone from folks who view the interests of the NRA \nas paramount, to folks who view the interests of the civil liberties \ncommunity as paramount--everyone wanted to make sure they knew what was \nin that bill.\n  Notwithstanding that, we ended up with a finite list of amendments \nwhich we have now. No doubt that list would have been shorter from the \nbeginning had the Democrats had any reasonable opportunity to review \nthe Republican bill before it was brought to the floor.\n  Now, having worked hard over the recess, our staffs having worked \nhard, primarily, we have limited the number of amendments we need to \noffer from our side of the aisle, and effectively cut the list by more \nthan half.\n  There is no evidence of any intent to delay the bill. And while talk \nof delay and the need for cloture motions may be good politics, it has \nnothing to do with the reality of the work before the Senate. The \nreality is that we are addressing an important topic that deserves \nserious--not token, but serious--consideration by this body.\n  That is, the threat of terrorism from both at home and abroad. That \nthreat is real. Bombings at the World Trade Center 2 years ago and in \nOklahoma City 2 months ago are proof positive of the need to strengthen \nour responses to this threat.\n  Does not this threat deserve more than 2 days of the Senate's time? \nIt seems to me that while we all want to move forward, we should also \nwant to make sure that we do the job right. The President has sent two \nstrong terrorism proposals to the Congress this year in responding to \ntwo terrible bombings on American soil. His proposals contain many \nneeded reforms to enable law enforcement to better investigate and \nprosecute terrorist acts.\n  The Judiciary Committee and its Terrorism Subcommittee held a number \nof extensive hearings on the President's proposal over the last 6 \nweeks. Many issues have been discussed, debated, and drafted into \nlegislative language. The Republicans have put a bill together, drawn \nin large measure from the administration's proposal, and much of which \nis supported by both sides of the aisle.\n  Unfortunately, the Republicans fail to include in their bills several \nproposals to give law enforcement modest but [[Page S7674]] needed new \nauthority to fight terrorism in the areas of wiretaps, taggants, and \nmilitary assistance in cases of biological and chemical terrorist acts, \njust to name three.\n  There will be amendments to address these subjects, and the \namendments are needed to make this bill a truly effective tool to \nfighting terrorism. Several of the amendments have been identified, and \nseveral of them have already been offered.\n  The suggestion that they are meant to delay this bill is an obvious \nattempt to shift focus from the fact that Republicans oppose \nstrengthening the hand of law enforcement against terrorists, the way \nthe President's proposal is opposed to any attempt to delay.\n  In addition, the Republicans included several provisions in their \nbill that some of Members believe are ill-drafted and are inappropriate \nas part of this bill. We have several amendments to modify these \nprovisions, but this is a Republican bill.\n  Again, the amendments are identified and they have not and will not \nbe offered to delay. They will be shortly offered. They will be voted \non. They are not vehicles for delay.\n  Moreover, I note that the Republicans have identified a number of \namendments as well. As I understood from the list before we went out \nlast week, the Republican Members of the Republican Party suggested \nthey had 32 amendments--32 amendments. Now, maybe some of those were in \nresponse to what they anticipate to be amendments from Democrats. \nDemocrats have amendments that were put forward in anticipation of what \nthey thought the Republicans were doing. Much of this, I think, will \nfall away.\n  Putting this in perspective, if there is delay going on--and there is \nnot delay going on--32 out of 40-some amendments or 70, whatever the \nnumber was that were listed last week, are Republican amendments.\n  In all the talk of delay by Democrats over habeas corpus reform, the \nunanimous-consent agreement under which we are operating identifies 4 \nDemocrat amendments on habeas corpus and 4 Republican amendments on \nhabeas corpus.\n  We have all been around here long enough to know Senators do not \nagree to a unanimous consent agreement limiting the number of \namendments that can be offered on a subject that is allegedly the \nreason for the delay on the bill.\n  There are four amendments offered by Democrats, four amendments \noffered by Republicans. I am sure we can get time agreements on all \nthose amendments at some point along the way when they are proposed. \nThat is it.\n  I might add, by the way, if my Republican friends had wanted to move \non this terrorism bill quickly, all they had to do was leave habeas \ncorpus off this. It would not have attracted all these other \namendments. We could have put it on their crime bill. They have a crime \nbill they want to push. We have plenty of time for that, instead of \ndealing with this issue.\n  It is true that delay on death penalties being imposed could have a \nperverse effect, once we identify and convict the people responsible \nfor the bombing in Oklahoma City. That is prospective, way down the \nroad.\n  We will have Democrats--not me, but other Democrats--who will stand \nup here on the floor and argue that because we have not done more to \ndeal with the ability of people to get explosives, because we have not \ndealt more restrictively with the people and the ability of people to \nget ahold of weapons, because we cannot deal with certain bullets that \ncan penetrate vests, that kill police officers, because they have not \ndone that, they hamper our ability to deal with terrorist acts. That is \ntrue.\n  I plead with my Democrat and Republican friends, keep that stuff off \nthis bill. Move forward on the essential elements of what the President \nsaid and what we all agree is needed to enable the FBI and the law \nenforcement agencies, federally, to be able to have the manpower as \nwell as additional legal authority to both infiltrate, identify, \narrest, prevent--hopefully--prevent future terrorist acts, whether they \nare domestic or foreign inspired.\n  That is not where we are. No matter how much it made sense to do it \nthat way, it does not make a lot of sense for me to spend much more \ntime talking about it other than to put in perspective what has \nhappened here. We could have finished this bill a long time ago.\n  The fact of the matter is that a clear decision was made to take a \nvery important part of the Republican crime bill, their essential \nelimination of Federal habeas corpus, and drop it on this bill.\n  We could probably settle this whole habeas corpus matter very \nquickly, the Senator from Utah and I. The only effect habeas corpus can \npossibly have in this bill is Federal habeas corpus. We have an \namendment to limit their proposal to Federal habeas corpus cases. Let \nus go ahead and do that and drop all Federal habeas corpus amendments, \nvote on that one.\n  That is the only thing that is arguably related to Oklahoma City. \nNothing else has anything to do with Oklahoma City, zero, zero. Nothing \nelse has anything to do with this legislation. This is Federal \nlegislation dealing with terrorist acts. That is Federal court. That is \nFederal prosecutors. That is a Federal conviction. So let us deal with \nFederal habeas corpus, not State habeas corpus.\n  This is a sham. I think we should change habeas corpus. I have been \ntrying to change habeas corpus, differently than my friend from Utah \nhas, for the last 8 years. We have battled over it, and it is a \nlegitimate and serious, intellectual, political, and criminal justice \nissue but it has not a darned thing to do with this. So if we want to \nend all the delay--and there is no delay in terms other than time \nconsuming on each of the amendments--let us just have the debate on \nthat issue. That applies to this legislation. None of the rest does.\n  The point I want to make here, and I am probably overmaking it, is \nthat there is no delay. There is no delay. We have agreed to the \namendment. We have limited the number of amendments that can be brought \nup. We could further eliminate a lot of those amendments, I am sure, if \nwe could agree on focusing on international and domestic terrorism and \nwe could move on. But one thing for certain, this issue warrants \nserious consideration--serious consideration. I note the Republicans do \nnot think their 32 amendments are frivolous. Now I doubt any of these \namendments, Democrat or Republican, are designed as delaying tactics. I \nexpect we can work many of them out and we can proceed on the rest. But \nI believe very strongly that our job involves offering relevant \namendments to make the bill better and debating them fully and \nreasonably. Again, terrorism is not a trivial matter, as we all know. \nThe issue is as vital as it is complicated.\n  Let me just give one example how complicated it is. I will bet that \n90 percent of the American people would have guessed that when Joe \nLieberman, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, and I brought \nan amendment to the floor at the request of the President last week \nthat said we want to give the FBI the same power to use wiretapping \ndevices and wiretapping under the circumstances that we presently allow \nthem to investigate organized crime to organized terrorist threats, I \nwill bet 90 percent of the American people would have thought everybody \nin this floor would vote for that--especially the Republicans. They \ntalk about law and order all the time, like Democrats do these days. \nAnd what happened? We voted on it and it lost. I offer that as a simple \nexample of what is so complicated about this issue. People are \nbeginning to understand when we deal with people's constitutional \nrights and the fourth amendment that maybe it is better to err on the \nside of being very cautious in the power we give the police.\n  I have always been one to be very cautious. But I thought, since we \nhad the ability to do to organized crime what was proposed by Senator \nLieberman and in the President's bill, we ought to be able to do that \nwith terrorists. But, guess what, an overwhelming majority of my \nRepublicans friends did not think that made sense. I do not criticize \nthem for that point of view. I just offer it to point out how \ncomplicated it is. I bet they have trouble explaining that back home. I \ndo not suggest that their action was wrong or had any motivation other \nthan they have a heightened sense of concern about the use of wiretaps. \nI respect that. [[Page S7675]] \n  But guess what, this is not as simple as the majority leader makes it \nsound. If it were simple, that would have passed like a hot knife \nthrough butter here. But it did not. If we could understand how a \nmajority of Republicans do not think we should be able to go after \nterrorists like we do the mob, then we ought to be able to understand \nthat this is a complicated issue. It is important to get the bill \nright. Again, terrorism is not a trivial matter. It is vital, as vital \nas it is complicated. And we have to give law enforcement the tools it \nneeds, even while we maintain protecting our constitutional rights.\n  Now, look, just to give an example, we are going to have an amendment \nhere shortly that is another wiretap amendment. I will give this as \njust one example. That wiretap amendment, if it passes, will allow the \nAttorney General, the Federal Government, to be able to do roving \nwiretaps. That is the second amendment. That says, if you go to a judge \nand say, ``Judge, we have probable cause to believe John Doe is \ncommitting or committed a felony under the existing title 18 of the \nUnited States Code that allows us to ask for a wiretap and we want to \ntap John Doe's phone,'' if the court concludes there is probable cause, \nthen in fact what we do is we go along and we say: All right, the judge \nsays that he will allow a wiretap. Generally what happens is you get a \nwiretap for a specific phone in John Doe's office or John Doe's home. \nBut lots of times what has happened is that John Doe may figure he may \nbe being tapped because he knows he is doing something wrong. He knows \nhe is trying to avoid detection. So he may walk to the corner phone \nbooth and use the corner phone booth all the time. Or he may go use the \nphone in his sister's home.\n  Right now the current authority for what are known as roving or \nmultipoint wiretaps, or wiretap orders--a provision was proposed by the \nPresident, but not included in the Republican substitute, that would \nallow this kind of multipoint order, multipoint wiretap to be used. \nMultipoint wiretaps allow law enforcement officers to obtain a judicial \norder to intercept the communications of a particular person, not just \nfor one specific phone as with most wiretap orders, but on any phone \nthat a person may use.\n  A recent prosecution will help illustrate how the multipoint wiretaps \nwork. In this particular case involving one of the world's biggest \ninternational drug traffickers, agents determined that a courier was \ncontacting his bosses by using a number of randomly chosen public \nphones around his home, public phones outside his home. A multipoint \nwiretap was obtained and up to 25 phones were identified to prepare for \nthe chance that the target would use one of these phones. Any time he \nused one of those phones the agents were able to initiate a wiretap. \nInterceptions obtained in this way led to 53 Federal indictments and 19 \ntons of cocaine that were seized.\n  The wiretap on his phone would not have yielded much at all, but they \nidentified all the phones around this guy's neighborhood because they \nwatched him. They watched the pattern. He would walk out of his house \nand go to a telephone and use that phone. The next time he would use \none two streets down from his home, and then four streets, and across \nthe street, and in the drug store across the street. So they got an \norder for a multipoint wiretap. And they were right. They got the order \nthrough a judge.\n  Under the current law the Government can get a multipoint wiretap \norder only if it can show that the defendant is intending to thwart \nsurveillance, usually by switching from phone to phone. The amendment \nthe President wants, and Senator Lieberman will propose on his behalf, \nwould allow a multipoint wiretap where the defendant's conduct has the \neffect of thwarting surveillance regardless of whether or not the \nGovernment can prove the defendant's intent. Keep in mind they already \nhave a guy they identified as the subject of a legitimate wiretap in \nhis own home. And there is probable cause to believe this guy is doing \nsomething bad that exists as a crime under the law that you can get a \nwiretap for.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Actually, I think the amendment the Senator is talking \nabout is a good amendment. We have some on our side who have some \ntroubles with it, but I probably am going to support this amendment \nbecause, let us be honest about it, all they are saying is they are \ngoing to follow the criminal. That is all this amendment means. The \nPresident is right on this, in my opinion, in that sense.\n  The original amendment written in the President's bill is not as good \nas this one, as I understand. We have even worked with my colleague on \nthe language on it. I am going to talk to our side and see if there is \nsome way we can get them to accept that amendment. But there are people \nwho are so afraid of the Government right now--polls show somewhere \naround 40 percent of the people are afraid of their Government. That is \npathetic. And part of the reason is because of what happened in Waco, \nbecause of what happened at Ruby Ridge, and a whole variety of other \nreasons, because the Federal Government has been too intrusive in all \nof our lives.\n  But I think the distinguished Senator from Delaware and I, working \ntogether, might be able to get this done because I think he makes a \ntremendous point. So did the President. With what the President wants \nto do, the problem was the roving ban semantically had implications \nthat frightened people even more. But all the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, as I understand it, is trying to do for and on behalf of \nthe President and others is say that, if you have a criminal who is \ngoing from phone to phone, you can follow the criminal. I personally do \nnot see anything wrong with that. I see some great value in doing \nexactly that.\n  Once again, I give the Senator from Delaware credit for being one of \nthe astute leaders in criminal law. We agree on a lot more than we \ndisagree on. Frankly, where we disagree--and there are acceptable and \ngood arguments on both sides. I appreciate the way he is approaching \nthis. I want to read the language. But I personally feel pretty \nstrongly that this amendment ought to be supported by both sides. I did \nnot mean to take so much of the time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is fine. Mr. President, I am delighted for the \nintervention. As I said at the outset of my discussion of this, the \nchairman was occupied with the staff for a moment. At the time, I said \nthat I was confident he and I could work this out. I am confident we \ncan work out most of this. The reason I raise this is an illustration \nof the larger point I am making; that is, there is no attempt to delay \nanything here. This provision was not included in the Republican bill. \nI think it is a very important provision.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think there is any attempt on the part of my \nfriend and colleague from Delaware to delay. But by his own comments \ntoday he indicated that if we could get right off the habeas problem, \nwe would not have the problems, we probably would not have 68 Democrat \namendments. My personal belief is that we have to face that problem one \nway or the other.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware has some well-intentioned \namendments in this area. I have to fight against them. But at least he \nis willing to face this issue. It is always easier to take \ncontroversial matters and not deal with them. But in this case, I think \nwe have to do it. It is the only thing that really will make a \ndifference with regard to Oklahoma City.\n  I call my colleague's attention, because of his comments earlier in \nthe day where he said, if we did Federal habeas, that is all that needs \nto be done here. I call his attention to Robert H. Mason's letter dated \nMay 24, 1995. He is district attorney for Oklahoma County, the district \nin which this occurred, where he points out that if you did just \nFederal habeas, it would not solve the problem because there were \npeople who were not Federal workers, who were not in the building at \nthe time, who were also killed and maimed. He intends to bring \nprosecutions in the State courts and to have swift justice in those \ncases also, which would require full habeas corpus reform like we have.\n  I respect my colleague. He knows that. We have been together on too \nmany occasions. We have fought battles together, and we have fought \nthem against each other. There are very few [[Page S7676]] people who \nunderstand these criminal law ramifications as well as my friend from \nDelaware. But I would really urge him to help us on this habeas corpus \nreform because I really believe it is something that has to be faced, \nit is something we need to do, and I think we can do it the way it is \nwritten in a way that protects the civil liberties and rights of those \nwho are accused.\n  I apologize for again interrupting and taking time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Not at all. Mr. President, I welcome--not interruptions--I \nwelcome this colloquy and conversation. I know that there is an \nunderstanding that there will be no votes until 5 o'clock. So the \nlikelihood of anybody other than the most stalwart of the Members of \nthe Senate--I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina here--other than a few, there \nare going to be a lot of folks making their way back from the west \ncoast and the Midwest on airplanes. So the likelihood of anything \nhappening of consequence between now and the time that it was announced \nthere would be a vote is de minimis. So I welcome the discussion.\n  Let me just again, not by way of argumentation but illustration of \nthe confusion surrounding the legislation--understandable confusion. \nEven if the Republican bill had not been introduced, had the \nPresident's bill been introduced and nothing else, there would be \nconfusion surrounding it. I do not mean this in a pejorative way.\n  The letter from the district attorney, as I understand it, from \nOklahoma County, the county in which Oklahoma City is--I have not read \nit yet, but the fact of his rationale of why they need full habeas \ncorpus, to have State habeas corpus included, is because there were \nnon-Federal workers killed--understandably, he misunderstands the bill. \nIt does not matter who is killed in the building. It is a Federal \ncrime. That is what we are establishing. It is a Federal crime. A \nforeign national could be killed in the building, anyone, under current \nlaw, killed in a Federal building that is blown up, it is a Federal \ncrime. It is also a State crime as well. It can be a State crime as \nwell. But it is a Federal crime.\n  So the point raised by the distinguished--again, I am not criticizing \nthe district attorney or the prosecutor in that county. I doubt whether \nhe has had a chance to review the existing Federal law. But at any \nrate, the larger point here is this: I am ready, willing, anxious and, \nhopefully will be able to demonstrate, ``able'' to debate this habeas \ncorpus issue. The reason why I did not want habeas corpus introduced \ninto this issue is because I did not want to also get into a debate on \nguns in this issue. I did not want to debate militia and NRA and ACLU \nand all of these things.\n  Look, I am fearful that, although things have calmed down a little \nbit, if you listen to the rhetoric from Democrats and Republicans on \nthese issues, you would assume that everyone who joined a militia--by \nthe way, we should not use that phrase. They are not militia. There is \nno militia under the Constitution. But anyone who joins these groups \nwho organize themselves and call themselves militia, on the one hand \nyou have everybody making them patriots; on the other hand, all a bunch \nof thugs, depending on who speaks to it. The same with the NRA--the NRA \nputs out an ill-advised letter, and all of sudden everyone in the NRA \nis a ``thug'', a ``bum.'' The vast majority of NRA members in my State, \nthe overwhelming number of NRA members are honest, decent citizens. \nThey join the NRA because that is the outfit that taught them how to \nuse a gun when they were a Boy Scout, how to fire their first rifle, \ntook them to the firing range.\n  I am going to oppose the amendment of Senator Lautenberg. I support \nthe use of that $25 million in funds allowing ammunition to be made \navailable to teach people how to learn to use weapons. That is a \nhealthy thing. That is not a bad thing. Half of the people who join the \nNRA in my State join for the insurance that is offered by the NRA. The \nNRA, the members of the NRA, are good, God-fearing people; some of them \nprobably good atheists; they are good everything. The fact they join \nthe NRA is not because it is a bad organization.\n  But what is going to happen here before this debate is over is we \nstart talking about guns. They are either all going to be superpatriots \nor they are all going to be a bunch of thugs. I think that is a useless \ndebate to have now when what the President says he needs, we all know \nhe needs, is he needs more agents. He needs more money. He needs more \nauthority.\n  So to finish the point--and I will be happy to yield--before I finish \nmy statement, my reluctance about getting into a debate on habeas \ncorpus is that we who have been around here even a year all know that \nis what we refer to in the jargon as a ``hot-button issue.'' Once you \nmention habeas corpus, you bring out everything, left and right and \ncenter. It engages almost a religious debate. It takes on proportions \nlike striker replacement. I mean it brings out everyone's deeply-held \nfeelings.\n  I predicted as soon as habeas corpus was put on this bill that there \nwould be 1, 2, 5, 10 amendments on guns. I suspect my friends would \nacknowledge that, if the Democrats had decided to introduce a terrorism \nbill that was loaded up with gun amendments, they would say, ``Wait a \nminute. What are you doing that for? You are just trying to delay \naction on this thing. Are you just trying to raise everyone's hackles? \nAre you just trying to get into sort of a debate that has nothing to do \nwith the added responsibility and authority that the President wants \nand has?''\n  That is the only point I am making about habeas corpus. But it is \ndone. The reason I even mentioned it now is to explain what I think has \nbeen already demonstrated by the short colloquy we have had thus far \nthat Senator Dole is wrong. This has nothing to do with the intent to \ndelay.\n  The introduction of habeas complicated--did not delay--complicated \naction on this bill. Deletion of more intrusive authority on the part \nof the FBI complicated what already was a difficult debate requiring \nadditional amendments. Additions of some legislation I support, and \nsome I do not relative to firearms complicated consideration of this \ncore legislation.\n  That is the only broad point I wish to make. That does not add up to \ndelay. That adds up to an additional consumption of time out of \nnecessity. It is necessary to use more time to resolve those \ncomplicated problems.\n  I daresay that if, in fact, my Republican colleagues thought that any \none of these gun amendments was likely to pass, there would be, as \nthere was in the past, extended debate. Just like I worried and \nthought--but is not going to happen now--that, if they raised habeas \ncorpus, there would be extended debate. Neither is going to happen. I \npresume the reason it is not going to happen is because they have the \nvotes. It always makes things go quicker when you have the votes. I \nremember the good old days when we used to have the votes. We do not \nhave the votes anymore, my team. So we understand the likely outcome on \nmost of this.\n  But this is not an attempt to delay. That is the only point I wish to \nmake again to my distinguished friend, the Republican leader from \nKansas, who on the Sunday talk show--I think it was Meet the Press, I \nam not certain which one it was--and today directly stated that this \nwas a Democratic effort to delay.\n  The other side of this is that I am going to have, as we say, ``clean \nhands'' in this matter. The administration is putting pressure on the \nRepublican leader asking, ``Why did you not get my bill?''\n Why did you not get it done? Why do we not have this done? I think \npart of that also is done for political reasons.\n\n  And so I just hope that we in this body, once folks fly back into \ntown here and we start debating on the amendments, can agree where we \ncan agree, as the Senator from Utah and I at least think we can agree \non the so-called multipoint wiretapping that the President wants made \navailable to him, or made available to Federal agencies, and I hope we \ncan even go back and revisit the, I think, ill-advised vote defeating \nthe Lieberman amendment on wiretapping because I think once people took \na closer look at it and took off our sort of political blinders here, \nthey would see what was being asked for had nothing to do with anything \nother than what we now allow under our law and have to deal with the \nMafia. Why [[Page S7677]] should the terrorist organizations have any \nmore protection than the Mafia? I do not understand that. And I do not \nthink, in fairness to those who voted against it, they fully understood \nwhat the amendment meant.\n  Again, terrorism is no trivial matter. If it takes a week, then it is \ntime well spent, in my view, to arrive at a serious, significant piece \nof legislation that gives additional tools to the Government without \ninfringing upon any of the civil liberties of the American people and \ndiminishes the prospects that domestic or foreign terrorists will be \nable to succeed in repeating what was done at the World Trade Center \nand what was done in Oklahoma City.\n  So I do not consider this a waste of time. The telecommunications \nbill is an important bill, but I imagine, if you said to the American \npeople, we can do one of two things for you: We can pass a bill that \nwill enhance and make better the way in which the telecommunications \nindustry functions in America and we can do that right away, or we can \npass a bill that significantly strengthens the United States ability to \ndeal with terrorists and to prevent terrorist acts, which do you want? \nMy guess is they would pick--I do not know what they would pick. I \nwould pick doing something about terrorism.\n  So in my view, even if it takes the remainder of the week to work our \nway through these amendments--and I predict it will not, but even if it \ndid, it would not be wrong nor unreasonable. The goal here is we must \nget the best possible bill that we can. We owe no less to the American \npeople. We owe no less to the people in Oklahoma City. We owe no less \nto ourselves. We owe more, much more, to the memory of those who have \nlost their lives at the hands of a madman or mad men and women in the \nunthinkable moment of insanity that we witnessed now well over a month \nago.\n  And so I look forward, once we have a quorum assembled here in \nWashington--and again, I am not being critical of anyone who is not \nhere now. If you represent the State of Utah or the State of California \nor the State of Washington and you went home over the recess, it is \ndifficult to get back here early in the day and still meet your \ncommitments without leaving a day earlier.\n  And so I am confident we can move with some dispatch once we get \nunderway. I just plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand on both sides of the various issues that will be raised here that \nwe should not make the same mistake the authors of the NRA letter made. \nThey figured out they made a mistake and they retracted what they said. \nWe are going to have a tendency, as this debate heats up, to say some \nfairly outrageous things, some of which may even be true. But I do not \nthink this is the circumstance under which we should do it.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I really do believe that we owe it to \nthe people who have been victimized thus far by a foreign and a \ndomestic terrorist act to act with dispatch, in a slightly \ndispassionate way, to come up with hardnosed, serious efforts to enable \nthe Federal Government to legitimately fulfill its primary role of \nprotecting the American people under these circumstances from these \nkinds of actions. So I will try my best to follow my own advice as this \ndebate goes forward and suggest that to vilify any organization, right \nor left, to vilify individuals will not get us very far. What we should \nbe doing is vindicating, vindicating those who have already suffered \ngreatly in an attempt to make sure that we do not have to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate again and deal with a similar circumstance.\n  The President has basically asked for two things. The first thing he \nsaid was give me more people. Give me more FBI agents. Give me more \npeople to do this job. We should do that. We should do that, A, because \nhe is right and, B, because even those who might want to point out that \nthe last President and this President cut people for a while, they did \nnot add as rapidly as they should have--well, for whatever the reason, \nlet us not argue about that. He wants more people. We should give him \nmore people--him and whomever follow-on Presidents will be.\n  Second, he said I need some additional authority. The authority I \nwould like to have as the chief law enforcement officer for the United \nStates of America, as the Chief Executive to give to the law \nenforcement agencies in this country the ability to do some things \nother nations have done with great success, that have diminished the \nability to make these god-awful bombs, give the authority to tag the \nelements of these explosives so that when they blow up, you can \nidentify from whence they came, where they were purchased and, \nhopefully, who purchased them to solve the crime. They are called \ntaggants. We will debate that. There are legitimate reasons to debate \nit. But I think it is a legitimate request on the part of the \nPresident.\n  The President also says I need some additional authority to deal with \nthis new emerging problem of terrorism on American soil, and it is \nauthority that I want expanded for wiretapping in certain circumstances \nunder which they are expanded. I think he should be given that \nauthority, or at least we should debate it and make that decision as a \nbody.\n  I think we should focus on the expanded authority he says he needs, \nand we should focus on the expanded resources he is requesting, and do \nour job for the American people and do it, as I said, hopefully--\nhopefully--by demonstrating to them that we can do something of \nconsequence that is not rooted in political motivation, something of \nconsequence on which we can agree. And, my Lord, if we cannot agree as \na body, Democrats and Republicans, that we should give more authority \nto deal with terrorists in this country, then I am not sure on what we \nare likely to agree.\n  So I look forward to a reasoned, a serious, and hopefully an \nunemotional debate on these issues, and a resolution in the near term \nso that we can send to the President of the United States, after a \nconference with the House, a piece of legislation that is worthy of his \nsignature.\n  I thank the Senate for listening, and I see that Senator Exon and \nothers are in the Chamber. I would be happy to yield the floor for the \ntime being.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I congratulate the managers of this bill, \nthe Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Utah, both very good \nfriends of mine. I have the utmost faith and confidence in their \nabilities. I recognize they do not always agree. But I believe that \nunder the leadership of these two individuals, who have been foremost \nin the Judiciary Committee for a long, long time, we certainly should \nbe able to come up with some workable arrangement to dispose of the \nterrorist bill which the President sent us.\n  As I brought out when we last met here 10 days ago, when the majority \nleader and the minority leader were debating the fact of how fast we \ncould move this bill ahead--we were going to take it up today, and the \nmajority leader said he wanted to complete work on it on Tuesday--for \nthe life of me, I do not know why Tuesday is such a magical date. I \nsimply say there were supposedly some 50 or 60 amendments that were \ngoing to be offered, or proposed to be offered by Members on both sides \nof the aisle. We also remember that in the last week we met here, we \nhad some 55 or 60 amendments to the budget bill. We finally got down to \nwork and completed our deliberations and had our votes in a matter of, \nI believe, 3 days.\n  As important as I think the budget debate was, as important as I \nthink the ever-increasing deficit is, as alarmed as I am about the \never-increasing national debt and the cost to the taxpayers for the \ninterest on that national debt, I do not believe there is anything more \nimportant to the people of United States of America today than \nterrorism.\n  Terrorism is not like the balanced budget that I hoped we could get \nto a few years ago down the road. It is with us today. It was \ndemonstrated in Oklahoma City very vividly most recently. I would \nsimply like to ask my colleagues, if I could get their attention, to \nexplain to this Senator why is it that we cannot make some kind of a \ngood-faith effort by the two leaders of the Judiciary Committee, \nsupported by the majority leader and the minority leader, to come to \nsome kind of an understanding about how many amendments we are going to \nhave, and about [[Page S7678]] how long that is going to take. I would \nthink that if we would try to stay away from the filibuster and \neventually limit debate to 15 minutes a side for most of these \namendments, clearly that would give us an opportunity, in this \nSenator's opinion, to come forth and let the Senate express its will by \nmajority vote on this tremendously important amendment that has to do \nwith terrorism. And I assure all of my colleagues--and they know it \nfull well--that terrorism is unfortunately alive and well in America \ntoday. I believe that the people of the United States expect us to \nstand up and do something about it, not in a foot race fashion, but in \nan expedited process of some kind, to have everyone have a chance, as \nis customary in the Senate, to work their will and maybe offer \namendments.\n  This Senator has no amendments to the bill. That cuts us down to 99 \nother Senators that may have amendments. I simply say to the managers \nthat this Senator wishes to cooperate with them, and if they would put \nout an appeal and if the majority leader and minority leader would join \nin that, I would think that maybe we can focus on this important piece \nof legislation that the President has set up. We do not have to approve \nit exactly like the President wanted it. We can change it dramatically \nin any fashion we see fit by a majority vote here.\n  I simply feel if we can put out this appeal, certainly the majority \nparty, the Republicans, have demonstrated that they march basically in \nlockstep on most of these matters. The Republicans, it seems to me, \nhave the majority and have the responsibility to either vote up or down \non any amendments that could be offered from either side. I am simply \nappealing for some expeditious action on this tremendously important \npiece of legislation. If we have to take until Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, Friday, or even into next week, and if that is necessary, I \ndo not think there is anything more important right now than this bill \nthat is before us.\n  I salute the President for addressing terrorism. A failure of respect \nfor law and order is rampant in our society today. Certainly, the \npolice, the prosecutors, the judicial system we depend on to handle \nthese matters for us, need strengthening, they need additional tools. I \nbelieve that the bill suggested to us by the President of the United \nStates goes a long way into helping these people that need help today \nwith the ever-increasing threat of terrorism.\n  So I simply pose a question for the managers of the bill. At their \nfirst opportunity, I ask them to respond as to whether there have been \nefforts made and are efforts being made now before the vote--as I \nunderstand it, there is a vote scheduled for 6 p.m. this evening. I \nwould certainly be willing to remain here until midnight or 2 or 3 \no'clock in the morning to take up or debate the reason or lack thereof \nof many of the amendments that I understand are to be offered.\n  I hope that we will not do what the majority leader had indicated \nover the weekend--that he would pull the bill down on Tuesday--\ntomorrow--unless we complete action. I feel, though, that the majority \nleader is not irresponsible in asking for some time agreements, some \nway to limit the number of amendments that I think could be \nconstructively moved forward, if it is the will of the majority of this \nbody.\n  I have posed a question, and I will await the response of the \nmanagers of the bill at their first opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware and my distinguished colleague from Nebraska, \nand I appreciate both of their remarks.\n  With all due respect, I have to point out to my distinguished friend \nfrom Delaware that most all of the language in this bill was found in \nthe substitute and it came from S. 3, introduced the first day of this \nsession and S. 390, introduced several months ago. We have had several \nhearings in the full committee and two in the subcommittee. Thus, the \nlanguage in this bill is well known.\n  Second, of the 32 Republican amendments, 12 have either been offered \nor have gone away. I suspect most of the others will as well. I fully \nexpect that many of the remaining Republican amendments will also \ndisappear in short order, once we move pretty quickly here.\n  What I find troubling, however, is the suggestion that habeas corpus \nshould be dropped from the bill. The President--a Democrat, I might \nadd--called for habeas corpus reform in his ``60 Minutes'' interview. \nHis instincts were right. He knows this is the time to try to get \nhabeas corpus reform and that it will make some difference to the \nvictims and survivors of the Oklahoma City incident. In fact, it is the \nonly thing we can do in this bill that will really make any difference \nto them. They have called for this.\n  As I wear this ribbon in their honor symbolizing the four strands--\nOklahoma, hope, those who could not be found, and those who are dead--I \nhave to say that I feel very deeply that we need to do this.\n  So in addition to the President, who has called for habeas corpus \nreform--but, of course, he has been riddled by those on the liberal \nside of his fence for having called for it, and has thus been somewhat \nmuted ever since. I might mention there are other Democrats that are \nvery strong for this habeas corpus provision of the bill. The \nDemocratic attorney general of the State of Oklahoma is one of our \nstrongest supporters. He has called for habeas corpus reform in the \nform this bill has it. The Democratic district attorney of Oklahoma, \nRobert H. Macy, has called for habeas corpus reform. Add to this a \nbipartisan letter from the State attorneys general and the State \ndistrict attorneys.\n  Mr. President, they also have called for habeas corpus reform. You \nhave a pretty good idea that this is a bipartisan appeal. It is a \nbipartisan reform.\n  I just wish that my distinguished friend from Delaware had been with \nme 2 weeks ago when I talked to these survivors and victims and family \nmembers. Just this morning, I have met those people whose lives have \nbeen shattered by the Oklahoma City bombing. Interestingly enough, they \nhave all called for habeas corpus reform in the form that this bill has \nit.\n  I think it is important that we continue to fight for this aspect of \nthe bill. It is about time. We have argued about it for years. We have \na chance of debating it at this particular time, and we should do so.\n  I have to say that I was also interested in Senator Biden's comments \nthat these are Federal crimes. Well, I am not so sure they are with \nregard to the State citizens who were not Federal employees who were \noutside of the building at the time. This bill will not apply \nretroactively and could not be applied retroactively. So those \nmurderers are going to have to be prosecuted in State court. If there \nis no habeas corpus reform applying to the State courts, we will \ncontinue to live with the long, incessant delays and appeals that have \ngummed up this system for years.\n  If we just enact a law that expands Federal jurisdiction over only \nFederal employees, that would not cover those nonfederal employees who \nwere killed outside of the building. It could not be applied to those \ncases against the Oklahoma killers. To do so would be a clear \nviolation. If we tried to apply Federal law to this, it would be a \nclear violation of the constitutional provision of the ex post facto \nlaws. That is the way it appears to me.\n  This body needs to understand that habeas corpus reform, both State \nand Federal, is the only thing we can enact that will directly affect \nthe Oklahoma case.\n  I might mention, also, that rather than exploiting the devastation of \nOklahoma City, I believe that we are protecting the families of the \nvictims from additional unwarranted victimization.\n  Comprehensive habeas corpus reform, as I have said before, is the \nonly legislation Congress can pass as part of a terrorism bill that \nwill have a direct affect on the Oklahoma City bombing. It is the one \nthing Congress can pass to ensure President Clinton's promise that \nswift justice will be kept. [[Page S7679]] \n  President Clinton, recognizing this fact during his April 23, 1995, \n``60 Minutes'' appearance, showed that he understood this. His \ninstincts were right when, in response to a question about whether \nthose responsible would actually be executed without the adoption of \nhabeas reform, he said:\n\n       It may not . . . happen but the Congress has the \n     opportunity this year to reform the habeas corpus \n     proceedings, and I hope they will do so.\n\n  The claim that habeas corpus reform is tangential or unrelated to \nfighting terrorism is ludicrous. Indeed, habeas corpus reform has far \nmore to do with combating terrorism than many of the proposals \ncontained in the administration's own antiterrorism package, such as \nthe proposals to enhancing FBI access to telephone billing records, and \nto loosen standards for use of wiretaps in felony cases.\n  Although most capital cases are State cases and the State of Oklahoma \ncould still prosecute this case, our habeas reform proposal would apply \nto Federal death penalty cases as well. It would directly affect the \nGovernment's prosecution of the Oklahoma bombing case.\n  Indeed, several people were killed just outside the Oklahoma Federal \nbuilding. The terrorists who destroyed the Federal building could thus \nbe tried in State court for the murder of those citizens.\n  The district attorney for Oklahoma City and Oklahoma County is \nplanning those prosecutions. The progress of this bill demonstrates the \nrelationship of habeas reform to the terrorist bombing.\n  No. 1, it would place a 1-year limit for the filing of a habeas \npetition on all death row inmates, State and Federal inmates. No. 2, it \nwould limit condemned killers convicted in State and Federal courts to \none habeas corpus petition where, under current law, there is currently \nno limit to the number of petitions he or she may file. No. 3, it \nrequires the Federal courts, once a petition is filed, to complete the \njudicial action within a required specified time period.\n  Clearly, by passing these provisions, we ensure that those \nresponsible for killing scores of U.S. citizens will be given the swift \npenalty that we in society exact upon them.\n  Now, one last thing. One reason we brought habeas corpus reform here \nis not just because it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing \nto do with regard to keeping off gun amendments. We have asked people \non our side to not get involved in any gun fights today. If there has \nto be a gun fight, we should do it over the crime bill that we will \nbring up in the future. We should keep this bill clean and decent. I \nwould caution my colleagues on the other side, we should not try to \nmake this a gun issue.\n  There is no reason to get into that debate, when we are trying to \npass basically what the President has said he must have, what the \nJustice Department has said it must have, what the FBI Director has \nsaid he must have; that is, legislation that could really give some \nteeth to law enforcement in the area of antiterrorist activities.\n  I think we should concentrate on that goal. We should not get \ninvolved in extraneous debates. We ought to pass this bill as quickly \nand as promptly as we can. If we have to fight it out over habeas \ncorpus reform, we should do it.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Delaware has 67 amendments on \nthat. Fine, bring them up. We will fight them out and see what happens. \nI can live with almost anything if we can get a bill passed that will \nreally make a difference in not only all of our lives, but the people \nspecifically in Oklahoma City whose lives have been devastated by what \nhappened there. I think passing this bill will be as good a \nmemorialization for those who have died as anything we in the U.S. \nCongress can do.\n  I cannot imagine why any Member would fight this bill when we have \nworked our guts out to work with our President, to work with the \nJustice Department, the FBI, and others. And this will beef up law \nenforcement as it should be beefed up, not only from the law \nenforceability standpoint, but from a law enforcement personnel \nstandpoint. It is long overdue. I agree with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  In the last 2 years, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have \nbeen cut back rather than beefed up. Now the President realizes that we \nhave to change course and beef them up. There is about $1.8 billion in \nthis bill that will take care of strengthening our law enforcement with \nregard to antiterrorist activities and other activities that are long \noverdue, in my eyes.\n  I have been complaining about this for quite a while. I have to \nadmit, I think during the Reagan and Bush years, we could have done a \nbetter job of beefing up the FBI and other law enforcement agencies \nourselves. Now is the time to face these issues. I think we should do \nso.\n  We have a number of stacked amendments. The bill is currently open \nfor any other amendments that any Member might file. I hope that our \ncolleagues will bring their amendments to the floor and debate them. We \nstill have 2\\1/2\\ hours before we begin voting. I would like to resolve \nas many of them as we can, and stack as many amendments as we can for \nvoting.\n  I am hopeful that we can get colleagues to withdraw amendments that \nreally do not belong on this bill, and to reduce the number of \namendments we can have so that we can pass this bill by tomorrow \nevening, if we can, or at least within a relatively short time.\n  I understand the majority leader's pressures. There are all kinds of \nimportant pieces of legislation that must be brought before the U.S. \nSenate over the next few weeks and months. He has not had the time to \ndevote excessively to any particular bill. This is one bill that has to \npass. We will pass it. I hope that all Members will cooperate in the \nprocess.\n  I hope our Senators will bring their amendments to the floor and we \ncan move from there. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I came to the floor this afternoon to stand \nin support of the Dole-Hatch substitute to Senate bill 735 that deals \nwith necessary and appropriate redefining of our laws in relation to \nterrorist activities or terrorist type activities in this country.\n But in coming to the floor this afternoon to speak, I also wanted to \nspeak very briefly on the amendment that is pending and will be voted \non this afternoon offered by the Senator from California on the issue \nof taggants.\n\n  The legislation before us deals with taggants, and the question is \nthen, if it does and does so appropriately, why will the Senator from \nCalifornia offer something that is considerably different? Is it a new \nidea? Not at all. In fact, it is really quite an old idea that the \nCongress has looked into before over the years to attempt to identify \nor cause to be identified explosive material so that when they are \ninappropriately used or misused they can be identified and traced. To \nmy knowledge no one in this country has objection to that concept. But \nthe word ``concept'' is what is key in this debate.\n  It is a concept. And there have been studies produced that would \nargue that, while it is well intended, it may be at least at this point \nin time scientifically and technologically impossible to get to the \npoint of putting in explosive materials, that are so designed to \ndevelop to do certain things, an identifiable marker that would still \ncause them to perform as they were tested and manufactured to perform. \nIn fact, the concern is that it might cause them to perform in an \ninappropriate way and cause harm to the individual who was using them \nin a legitimate, legal, and responsible fashion.\n  That is, of course, exactly what the Senate bill 735 substitute \nrecognizes when it proposes that we study this issue and try to bring \nthe community of science and technology together to see whether in fact \nwe can produce an identifiable marker, if you will, within an explosive \nmaterial that tags it, that identifies it, and that would allow it to \nbe used. [[Page S7680]] \n  There was something else said by the Senator from California this \nmorning, that at least frustrated me, which was her very open and \ndirect statement that the NRA opposed it, the National Rifle \nAssociation. I thought it was important that the record be straight, \nthat, in fact, the record be factual.\n  The NRA does not oppose this provision of Senate bill 735. What the \nNRA, as a responsible representative of a variety of people who use \ngunpowders for legitimate reasons, is suggesting is that, if you do not \ndo it right and you do it wrong, you could cause damage to a lot of \ninnocent people and produce unaffordable costs that do not make a lot \nof sense.\n  Let me read to you on the record testimony given before the Judiciary \nCommittee in April of 2 years ago on this issue. Point one proves that \nis an old idea whose time may not have come yet because we do not have \nthe science and technology to allow it to come; and, second, the NRA \nnever did nor does it now have an official position on the issue.\n  Let me quote from that testimony.\n  ``The National Rifle Association does not take an official position \nconcerning the licensing, manufacture and restrictions placed upon \ncommercial high explosives, for that is not an area within our field of \ninterest. However, we would be derelict in our responsibilities to \nAmerica's gun owners and as citizens if we did not point out to this \ncommittee''--meaning the Judiciary Committee of the Senate--``the basic \nflaws and fallacies of the taggants technology.''\n  ``An important point that must be made to the committee is that \ntagging explosives is not a new idea. In fact, the Congress studied and \nrejected the concepts involving identification and detection taggants \nin the latter 1970's and early 1980's. The premise behind that \nexperience has been restricted in the aftermath of the bombing''--this \nwas the World Trade Center hearings that emanated out of that horrible \nexplosion--``that law enforcement officers should be assisted in their \ninvestigation of tagging explosives. But the facilitation that was to \nbe realized is not available.''\n  In other words, the technology, the availability of the science to do \nwhat might be the right thing to do simply does not exist. I ask \nunanimous consent that the entirety of that testimony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\nTestimony of the Institute for Legislative Action of the National Rifle \n                              Association\nsubmitted to the judiciary committee of the u.s. senate, april 22, 1993\n       The Institute for Legislative Action of the National Rifle \n     Association (NRA) would like to thank the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee for the opportunity to submit testimony regarding \n     the issue of explosives tagging.\n       It may surprise the Committee to see the NRA testify on \n     what many consider purely an explosives matter. The fact is, \n     however, that tagging affects not only explosives, but also \n     propellant powders used by the over three million members of \n     the National Rifle Association and millions of sportsmen \n     throughout the country.\n       Current legislative proposals would affect all powder, \n     whether it be blackpowder used by antique and reproduction \n     firearms enthusiasts, or smokeless powder used in modern \n     firearms ammunition and by shooters who reload their own \n     ammunition. While section 845 (a)(5) of Chapter 40 exempts \n     commercial sporting grade blackpowder in quantities of fifty \n     pounds or less, all sporting grade blackpowder would have to \n     be tagged, since blackpowder is manufactured in larger \n     quantity lots. If propellant powders are going to be covered \n     in any legislative mandate that requires taggants be \n     utilized, then this becomes more than an explosives control \n     matter. It is a matter of concern to all gunowners.\n       Explosives tagging to register individual lots of \n     explosives is an idea that sounds wonderful, but like so many \n     wonderful-sounding ideas, it will not work. From a practical \n     perspective, explosives taggants simply will have no \n     significant effect upon terrorist bombers. The only major \n     effect of such a proposal will be to increase the paperwork \n     required by manufacturers and dealers in explosives and \n     propellants; increase the control exercised by BATF over \n     their activities; and to significantly increase the cost to \n     taxpayers and consumers.\n       The National Rifle Association does not take an official \n     position concerning the licensing, manufacture, and \n     restrictions placed upon commercial high explosives, for that \n     is not an area within our field of interest. However, we \n     would be derelict in our responsibilities to America's gun \n     owners and as citizens if we did not point out to this \n     Committee the basic flaws and fallacies of taggants \n     technology.\n       An important point that must be made to the Committee is \n     that tagging explosives is not a new idea. In fact, the \n     Congress studied and rejected the concepts involving \n     identification and detection taggants in the latter 1970s and \n     early 1980s. The premise behind that experience has been \n     resurrected in the aftermath of the bombing of the World \n     Trade Center--that law enforcement officials could be \n     assisted in their investigations by tagging explosives. But \n     the facilitation that was to be realized is now available to \n     BATF and other law enforcement agencies without the use of \n     taggants.\n       Identification taggants were first proposed as a means of \n     pinpointing exactly what type of explosive had been used in a \n     bombing. Detection taggants were intended to provide a means \n     of ``sniffing'' explosives that may be contained in a package \n     prior to detonation. But technology has surpassed those \n     premises. We now possess, and the federal government now \n     uses, machinery that can detect, or ``sniff'' the nitrates in \n     explosives. Additionally, other technologies allow law \n     enforcement officials to ``sniff'' a bomb scene and determine \n     what explosives were employed.\n       If it be the intent of Congress to place additional \n     controls upon commercial explosives, so be it; but Congress \n     should realize that explosives used in terrorist bombings are \n     not necessarily commercial explosives. Any objective analysis \n     would have to conclude, as they have in the past, that \n     terrorist bombings are quite unlikely to be significantly \n     affected by any proposed new requirements of this nature. Let \n     us examine the facts surrounding the incident that served as \n     an impetus for these hearings, the bombing of the World Trade \n     Center in New York City, and what is perhaps the greatest \n     fallacy behind proposal of explosives tagging--that \n     investigations would have been facilitated by the inclusion \n     of taggants in explosives materials.\n       According to the New York Times, the bomb was constructed \n     using urea, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid, all chemicals \n     that are ``inexpensive and widely available at chemical \n     companies,\n      laboratory supply stores or even garden centers. They can be \n     bought in bulk for less than $210 a ton.'' (March 11, \n     1993) Yet there has been no suggestion by BATF or any \n     other government agency to place taggants in these \n     products, or more importantly, in prilled ammonium nitrate \n     for the simple reason that there is no difference between \n     commercial ammonium nitrate used for blasting and the far \n     greater amounts of ammonium nitrate used as a fertilizer. \n     The fact is that there are no components of the bomb used \n     in the World Trade Center bombing that would have been \n     detected or identified had this proposal been in force.\n       One of the most easily made explosive devices is the mixing \n     of ammonium nitrate, or fertilizer, with a fuel oil, even \n     though it is currently prohibited by law. The resulting \n     explosive, commonly known as ANFO, would require a high \n     explosive booster charge, and that booster charge, if \n     obtained commercially, would be tagged under this concept. \n     But, ammonium nitrate may be illegally mixed with a fuel \n     which is itself an explosive, such as gasoline, or \n     nitromethane, the choice among high performance race car \n     drivers as a ``speed fuel'', both of which are technically \n     classified as explosives in standard reference books. If \n     ammonium nitrate and gasoline are combined, the result is a \n     powerful and easily detonated explosive--an explosive that \n     does not require a tagged booster charge. In fact, ammonium \n     nitrate and gasoline may be easily and reliably detonated by \n     a booster charge consisting of the same ammonium nitrate/\n     gasoline ingredients inserted in a pipe or similar container \n     and initiated by nothing more exotic than a conventional \n     firecracker.\n       An explosive consists merely of an oxidizer, which may \n     either be a chemical which during burning produces large \n     amounts of oxygen, or simply oxygen in the air, combined with \n     a fuel. As a case in point, a standard U.S. Army manual lists \n     as a special charge for use in flattening large buildings an \n     explosive which every Member of the Committee has in his \n     home--household flour. The flour is the fuel; oxygen in the \n     air is the oxidizer. Even blackpowder can be manufactured \n     with relative ease using common ingredients in any kitchen in \n     the country.\n      Additional ``recipes'' can be found in other widely \n     available pamphlets and brochures.\n       The reason that it is difficult, if not altogether \n     impossible, to control terrorist bombers by controlling \n     commercial explosives is that the terrorist bomber is not \n     limited to the use of commercial explosives. It is certain \n     that most, if not all, terrorist groups have the ability to \n     make extremely damaging explosives, while easily \n     circumventing the provisions of any technologically feasible \n     legislation. There is no reason to assume that taggants in \n     smokeless and blackpowder would have any effect in \n     controlling terrorist attacks. Information concerning \n     explosives is readily available--and access to that \n     information is impossible to control.\n       There are five basic problems confronting the terrorist \n     bomber: he needs (1) a material which is easy to acquire, (2) \n     safe to prepare, (3) not easily detectable in case of search \n     by police, (4) capable of being detonated after he is well \n     clear of the area, and (5) capable of highly explosive \n     effect. One type of bomb which easily meets these criteria \n     consists of nothing but a container of butane, such as \n     [[Page S7681]] used to fuel home workshop torches, gas lights \n     and similar devices, or even a small container used for \n     filling butane cigarette lighters, and an ordinary candle.\n       A bomber can, with relatively complete impunity, carry \n     those ingredients almost anywhere. And upon obtaining egress \n     to his chosen target site, he can enter an interior restroom \n     or storeroom and quickly produce a time bomb by lighting the \n     candle in one corner of the room, then venting the butane \n     bottle in another corner. The gas-air ratio is so broad, that \n     an explosion is certain to result when the gas reaches the \n     candle's flame. If such a bomb were placed in a central room \n     without windows, thereby confining the explosive force, a \n     large building could be destroyed. In effect, this type of \n     gas bomb duplicates the horrendous damage caused by an \n     explosion of leaking natural gas, with which all of us are \n     familiar.\n       Certainly, a bomb of sorts may be fashioned using either \n     smokeless or blackpowder propellant. However, to make an \n     effective bomb with these substances is far more difficult \n     and requires a more sophisticated knowledge of the \n     intricacies of explosive mechanics. Anyone\n      possessing such knowledge could, with equal ease, make a \n     cheaper, far more efficient, bomb from a myriad of other \n     substances.\n       According to the BATF, black and smokeless powders each \n     comprised 16 percent of criminal bombings in 1991. More than \n     fifteen years ago, in BATF's own testimony before the \n     Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of this \n     Committee on September 12, 1977, Mr. Atley Peterson stated, \n     ``because they (black and smokeless powders) produce a low-\n     order explosion, loss of life, injuries and property damage \n     are small.''\n       Using BATF's statistics, it seems apparent that black and \n     smokeless powder are not a major part of the bombing problem. \n     And, looking again to the issue of the relative ease and \n     rudimentary knowledge required to make ``kitchen counter'' \n     blackpowder, it is unlikely that all incidents involve \n     commercially manufactured sporting grade blackpowder. \n     Undoubtedly, many blackpowder incidents could be traced to \n     homemade powder or non-sporting grade powder such as \n     fireworks or blasting powder, or even kitchen matches, when \n     simply cutting off the heads. Interestingly enough, much \n     blasting grade blackpowder is manufactured for military use. \n     Military explosives were in the past exempt from legislative \n     measures, although there are frequent reports of military \n     explosive thefts.\n       An important aspect of this concept is its feasibility. \n     According to the report ``Taggants in Explosives'' (OTA-ISC-\n     116), produced as a result of the Congressional interest in \n     taggants in the latter 1970s, no reliable method for tagging \n     smokeless powder has been developed, and blackpowder tagging \n     has only been tested with regard to its effects on the grade \n     of blackpowder used for blasting. There is no documented \n     evidence that a single round of tagged powder has been fired \n     from a muzzle-loading firearm. A problem with the \n     compatibility of smokeless powder and taggants was also \n     identified, calling into question the safety of taggants for \n     the thousands of handloaders using powder in \\1/2\\, 1 or 2 \n     lb. cans and the millions of people owning modern ammunition \n     for their firearms.\n       An estimated five million pounds of smokeless and \n     blackpowder propellants are sold to shooters each year, \n     representing perhaps six million individual cans of powder. \n     Giving BATF every conceivable benefit of the doubt, we are \n     talking about a negligible amount of legally manufactured and \n     obtained smokeless and blackpowder being involved in an \n     ``explosives incident'' in which tagging might be of some \n     benefit to the investigators.\n       The FY 1991 arrest figures for explosives incidents as \n     provided by BATF is 177, and the number of actual and \n     attempted explosives incentives was 1,965, giving an arrest \n     rate of 9%. A 1978 BATF cost/benefit analysis projects a 1.5 \n     fold increase in arrests if tagging is mandated, then arrest \n     rates would go to 13.5%--a 4.5% increase. Out of the 589 \n     black and smokeless powder devices recorded in 1991, current \n     arrests must total 53 cases. Tagging would, according to BATF \n     projections, increase this to 80 total arrests. This is an \n     increase of only 27 cases a year.\n       The same study estimated that the then annual taxpayer cost \n     of identification tagging at $10 million dollars, and \n     detection tagging at $9.4 million dollars. Using Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics calculations of the Consumer Price Index to \n     account for inflation, the same estimates today would be \n     $22.65 million and $21.29 million respectively. Using these \n     figures, taxpayers would pay $43.94 million dollars just to \n     arrest 27 more persons. With a projected $22.65 million \n     dollar annual cost, again from the fifteen year old \n     estimations and accounting for inflation, to be absorbed by \n     ammunition and powder consumers, the estimated total cost of \n     the program would be some $66.59 million. For that additional \n     taxpayer and consumer burden, the projected 27 additional \n     arrests would cost an average of $2.5 million dollars each. \n     In fact, BATF's own cost/benefit analysis indicated that this \n     program cannot be justified. BATF stated in the 1970s, with \n     reference to the detection tagging program, ``at present it \n     is impossible to estimate the effectiveness of tagged or \n     untagged detection with any degree of accuracy. Within this \n     large uncertainty, both tagged and untagged detection appear \n     to be, at best, of borderline economic viability.''\n       The BATF-commissioned study succinctly stated that, \n     ``Ideally, the problem of control would be greatly simplified \n     if every ounce of explosive, legally manufactured and legally \n     used, could be completely accounted for.'' But, the study's \n     determination in favor of identification tagging is based \n     upon mere hypothesis, nothing more. Quite simply, BATF does \n     not know if taggants would be effective in apprehending or \n     deterring bombers.\n       Even ignoring the concerns now before this Committee--the \n     illegal manufacture and use of explosives--the sheer burden \n     of tracing every ounce of legal explosives to the purchaser, \n     and the minutely detailed records which would have to be kept \n     by the manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers \n     is staggering. If propellant powders are tagged, this will \n     drastically increase, and in many cases duplicate, the \n     paperwork and records already being kept by federal firearms \n     licensees. And how are we to trace explosives beyond the \n     first non-dealer purchase?\n       In the past, BATF has stated that ammunition recordkeeping \n     was a waste of resources, as ammunition tracing has never \n     solved a crime--the volume of records is just too large. If \n     propellant powders are tagged, every packaged quantity, no \n     matter how small, whether one can of black or smokeless \n     powder, or one box of ammunition, would have to be referenced \n     to manufacturer and lot number. But this recordkeeping would \n     simply do no good at all. One numbered lot of powder can \n     yield several thousand individual cans of powder and \n     literally thousands of boxes of ammunition. Even with \n     detailed records, tracing the end user would be like looking \n     for the proverbial ``needle in a haystack.''\n       Obviously, what the Congress and the American people really \n     want is a means to apprehend and punish those who use \n     explosives in an illegal fashion. It is assumed that this \n     threat of punishment will serve as an effective deterrent, \n     thereby decreasing the number of bombings. Yet, in view of \n     the flimsy evidence presented by the supporters of the \n     tagging program in the past, Congress is considering an \n     unknown quantity, which will have a questionable impact on \n     bombings and an undetermined ballistic effect on propellant \n     powders, not to mention the suspect safety of taggants on \n     handlers and end users. In fact, the only thing that seems \n     sure about this program is that if black and smokeless powder \n     are tagged, it will impose a mammoth recordkeeping burden on \n     small businessmen and drive up the cost of supplies for \n     sportsmen. As usual, the terrorist will blithely ignore the \n     law and the criminal circumvent it--for they are, by \n     definition, people who disobey the law. The law-abiding \n     citizen will once again be the only one affected by the \n     implementation of this concept. That is why the National \n     Rifle Association oppose the concept of tagging, specifically \n     propellant powders, and urges the Committee to reject this \n     concept as ill-conceived. The benefits of doing otherwise are \n     dubious at best, but the costs, in dollars and to the small \n     businessman handler are all too real.\n       We thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony to \n     this Committee.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, so why the amendment? Why not stay with the \nsubstitute bill? If this Congress wants to get the industry that \nmanufactures explosives to a point in science and technology where we \ncould identify the explosive itself, why not pursue it in the way that \nSenate bill 735 suggested? Or is there another reason to pursue it in a \nway that the Senator from California has pursued it; that is, do it now \nand study it later? That is a bit of a strange way to approach \nsomething that, if done wrong or if caused by Government and forced to \nbe done without the proper basis of understanding to be done wrong, \ncould create the kind of damage that could occur if this were the case.\n  So let us today vote to table the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia and stay with the substitute bill which does recognize the \nimportance of developing the science and technology for taggants. I \nsupport that. And I hope we can get there.\n  But the record now shows that the National Rifle Association does not \noppose taggants, and it never has. It most assuredly supports the \nscience and the technology that could lead us to that. What it is \nofficially on the record as opposing is the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California because it simply believes it is too premature. It \nmight well be risky to the science and the technology involved.\n  This Senate I think in a responsible way wants to do it right. The \nright way is the Senate bill that has been appropriately heard with the \nappropriate technology, or the record for technology built into it.\n  With that in mind, I hope as we vote this afternoon on the tabling \nmotion that we would support the committee and the chairman, and the \ntext of Senate bill 735.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. [[Page S7682]] \n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1207 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, earlier today, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah was kind enough to propose for me an amendment to the bill. \nThat particular amendment was designed to extend the sanctions that we \nnow have in place against Iran to all countries designated as terrorist \ncountries by our Secretary of State.\n  Let me add that it is not my intention with this legislation to \nrestrict the President or the Secretary of State. And included in the \namendment is a very extensive waiver provision so that while we would \nhave on our books a provision for adding these sanctions against other \ncountries that have been designated as terrorist countries, it would \nnot necessarily require the implementation of these sanctions, but it \nwould require the waiver of them in the event a terrorist country is so \ndesignated. That waiver is quite broad and gives the President a great \ndeal of discretion. The President, if he so determines for national \nsecurity interests or even humanitarian reasons, may waive the action. \nBut what it does do, Mr. President, it gives some consistency to our \naction. It puts countries that would contemplate using state terrorism \non notice that this country is serious, that there are sanctions, that \nthose sanctions are broad and significant, as in the sanctions the \nPresident has applied against Iran.\n  It also will put them on notice that while these sanctions come with \nbeing designated a terrorist country, it is possible, if they work with \nour President and with the Secretary of State, they can work their way \nout of it.\n  Mr. President, I think this is an important amendment because what it \nsays is we are going to be consistent. If a country chooses to adopt \nthese kinds of terrorist policies, we ought to at least make sure that \nwhen we designate a nation as a terrorist country there are some \nsanctions involved.\n  The final version of the amendment differs slightly from the \nprovision that was introduced earlier today. The waiver provision, to \nbe specific, is different in the final version of the amendment. It \nsimply makes clear that there are very wide discretions on the part of \nthe President. And I would ask unanimous consent that the final version \nof the Brown amendment be entered into the Record at this point and \nsubstituted for the original amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, does the \nSenator have a copy of that so I can take a quick look at it?\n  Mr. BROWN. I do. I would be glad to----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to suggest maybe we could have a short quorum \ncall. I do not want to object. I do not think I will object, but if the \nSenator would allow----\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will withhold my unanimous consent \nrequest until the distinguished Senator from Delaware has had an \nopportunity to review the amendment, and I would at this point note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum having been suggested, \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1209 to Amendment No. 1199\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the distribution of information on the making of \nexplosive materials with intent or knowledge that such information will \n                    be used for a criminal purpose)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1209 to amendment No. 1199:\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following section:\n\n     SEC. ------. PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION \n                   RELATING TO EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS FOR A CRIMINAL \n                   PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new section:\n       ``(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to teach or \n     demonstrate the making of explosive materials, or to \n     distribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole \n     or in part, the manufacture of explosive materials, if the \n     person intends, or knows that such explosive materials or \n     information will likely be used for, or in furtherance of, an \n     activity that constitutes a Federal criminal offense or a \n     criminal purpose affecting interstate commerce.''\n       (b) Section 844 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by designating section (a) as subsection (a)(1) and by adding \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(a)(2) Any person who violates subsection (1) of section \n     842 of this chapter shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I had asked that a quorum call be put into \neffect to determine whether or not I could agree with the unanimous \nconsent request by the Senator from Colorado. I would just ask the \nSenator from California, when we conclude that, if I would be able to \ninterrupt her to allow the Senator from Colorado to amend his \namendment.\n  I do not seek that now, but I would like that so the Senator from \nColorado does not think I have put this off for a couple hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am happy to, or I am happy to wait. \nI am trying to use the time usefully.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would encourage the Senator to proceed. I would ask her \npermission, when we work this out, whether I could interrupt her at \nthat point.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Absolutely. I would be delighted. I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \naddress what I believe is a rather surprising problem in our society, \nand that is the distribution of bombmaking information for criminal \npurposes. This amendment is simple, and I think this cartoon in USA \nToday really describes what the situation is.\n  Here is a youngster sitting in front of his computer learning how to \nput together a bomb. Here is the mother on the phone saying, ``History, \nastronomy, science, Bobby is learning so much on the internet.''\n  This amendment would prohibit the teaching of how to make a bomb if a \nperson intends or knows that the bomb will be used for a criminal \npurpose. Additionally, the amendment would prohibit the distribution of \ninformation on how to put together a bomb if a person intends or knows \nthat the bomb will be used for a criminal purpose.\n  The penalty for violation of this law would be a maximum of 20 years \nin prison, a fine of $250,000, or both.\n  Now, you might ask, how is that possible? How would anybody do this? \nI think the next chart I will put up will show clearly how it is \npossible and what people today are doing.\n  Let me show you this. This is from the internet, entitled ``Stuff You \nAre Not Supposed to Know About.'' It advertises the Terrorist Handbook. \nIt says,\n\n       Whether you are planning to blow up the World Trade Center, \n     or merely explode a few small devices on the White House \n     lawn, the Terrorist Handbook is an invaluable guide to having \n     a good time. Where else can you get such wonderful ideas \n     about how to use up all that extra ammonium triiodide left \n     over from last year's revolution?\n\n  Well, that is just part of it. What that then leads to is a whole \nseries of recipes on how to put together a bomb aimed at killing, \ninjuring, or destroying property. The handbook goes on to give a step-\nby-step instruction on what to do. Let me quote from a section on \nacquiring chemicals:\n\n       The best place to steal chemicals is a college. Many State \n     schools have all of their chemicals out on the shelves in the \n     labs and more in their chemical stockrooms. Evening is the \n     best time to enter a lab building, as there are the least \n     number of people in the building. Of course, if none of these \n     methods are successful, there is always section 2.11.\n\n  [[Page S7683]] And it then tells how to pick a lock to get into the \nchem lab. It tells how to dress to look like a student. It tells where \nthe shelves are that the chemicals are on. The handbook lists various \nexplosive recipes, using black powders, nitroglycerin, dynamite, TNT, \nand ammonium nitrate. It provides explicit instructions for making pipe \nbombs, book bombs, light bulb bombs, glass container bombs and phone \nbombs, just to name a few.\n  Now, I have heard people say, oh, but the Encyclopedia Britannica has \neight pages on explosives, and nobody criticizes that. Well, I have \nread the eight pages on explosives, and it does not say how to make a \ntoilet paper roll booby trap. What legitimate purpose is there for a \ntoilet paper roll booby trap other than to kill somebody? You do not \nblast out the stump of a tree. You do not need it for mining. You need \nit for no civilian or military purpose other than to kill. Or a vacuum \ncleaner booby trap. Again, no civilian or military purpose, no blasting \nout of tree trunks, no mining use. A traffic cone booby trap. A video \nalarm booby trap. A washing powder box booby trap. How to develop this \nthing in a bottle or a box of soap powder.\n  Light bulb bombs. The Terrorist Handbook describes, ``an automatic \nreaction to walking into a dark room is to turn on the light. This can \nbe fatal if a light bulb bomb has been placed in the overhead light \nsocket. A light bulb bomb is surprisingly easy to make. It also comes \nwith its own initiator, an electric ignition system.'' And then it goes \ninto detailed instructions and diagrams of how to put one together.\n  I am not going to repeat those on the floor of the U.S. Senate. But I \ncan assure you that the Terrorist Handbook provides these step-by-step \ninstructions.\n  One of the more appalling descriptions of bombmaking involves a baby \nfood bomb. The following information was taken from the bulletin board, \ncomputer bulletin board off the internet. Baby food bombs. ``These \nsimple, powerful bombs are not very well known, even though all of the \nmaterial can be easily obtained by anyone, including minors. These \nthings are so''--and then there is a four-letter word--``powerful, that \nthey can destroy a car. Here is how they work.''\n  Then it tells how they work. It says,\n\n       Go to the Sports Authority or Herman's sports shop and buy \n     shotgun shells. At the Sports Authority that I go to, you can \n     actually buy shotgun shells without a parent or adult. They \n     do not keep it behind a little glass counter or anything like \n     that. It is $2.96 for 25 shells.\n\n  The computer bulletin board posting then provides instructions on how \nto assemble and detonate the bomb. It concludes with these words:\n\n       If the explosion doesn't get them, the glass will. If the \n     glass doesn't get them, then the nails will.\n\n  I do not think our first amendment, or the framers of the \nConstitution, want to protect the freedom of speech for criminal \npurposes. Clearly, these bombs are there for one reason and one reason \nonly and that is a criminal purpose.\n  Let me give you another example that came through on April 23 of this \nyear on the internet.\n\n       Are you interested in receiving information detailing the \n     components and materials needed to construct a bomb identical \n     to the one used in Oklahoma? The information specifically \n     details the construction, deployment and detonation of high-\n     powered explosives. It also includes complete details of the \n     bomb used in Oklahoma City, how it was used and it could have \n     been better.\n\n  Another examples comes from April 25 on the internet. I will quote \nit:\n\n       I want to make bombs and kill evil Zionist people in the \n     Government. Teach me, give me test files. Feed my wisdom, O \n     Great One.\n\n  That was April 25 on the internet.\n  The forward to the book ``Death by Deception: Advanced Improvised \nBooby Traps'' states:\n\n       Terrorists, IEDs [improvised explosive devices] come in \n     many shapes and forms, but these bombs, mines, and booby \n     traps all have one thing in common: they will cripple or kill \n     you if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n       In this sequel to his best-selling book ``Deathtrap,'' Jo \n     Jo Gonzales reveals more improvised booby-trap designs. \n     Discover how these death-dealing devices can be constructed \n     from such outwardly innocuous objects as computer modems, \n     hand-held radios, toilet-paper dispensers, shower heads, \n     talking teddy bears, and traffic cones. Detailed \n     instructions, schematic diagrams, and typical deployment \n     techniques for dozens of such contraptions are provided.\n\n  Now, none of this is for use in any constructive civilian or military \nproject. All of them are used for criminal purposes.\n  Other titles of books that teach people how to make bombs include: \n``The Guerrilla's Arsenal: Advanced Techniques for Making Explosives \nand Time-Delay Bombs''; ``The Advanced Anarchist Arsenal: Recipes for \nImprovised Incendiaries and Explosives.''\n  Well, there are those who would say this is just a simple first \namendment exploration. Do not worry about it. People are just curious.\n  Well, let me tell you that on Friday, Orange County bomb squad Sgt. \nCharlie Stump told me that a 14-year-old was in his garage making a \npipe bomb with an 11- and 12-year-old watching him do it. The \ninformation to make this pipe bomb came from the Improvised Munitions \nBlack Book, which can be obtained in any gunshop through the Paladin \nPress mail order outlets. So this youngster blew himself up, and right \nnext to him was the handbook that he used.\n  Another example. In Mission Viejo, a 20-year-old junior college \nstudent went into the so-called survivalist movement and accidentally \nset off his own bomb and killed himself. Again, the manual was sitting \nright next to him.\n  So, according to the sergeant, these books tell you in vivid detail \nhow to make bombs, how to kill people, how to destroy cars, how to \ndestroy trains--whatever type of destruction you want to do, these \nbooks will tell you how to do it.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to say that if you know or intend \nthis will be used in a criminal way, you have committed a Federal \ncriminal offense by putting out this information.\n  Other examples include the following:\n  One of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers was arrested with manuals \nin hand.\n  In 1989, four Bethesda teenage boys were killed when a homemade pipe \nbomb subsequently went off. They were following instructions from \nanother manual.\n  In 1987, a California teenager blew himself up with homemade bombs. \nThe ``Improvised Munitions Black Book'' was found nearby.\n  Enough is enough. Common sense should tell us that the first \namendment does not give someone the right to teach others how to kill \npeople. The right to free speech in the first amendment is not \nabsolute, and there are several well-known exceptions to the first \namendment which limit free speech.\n  These include obscenity; child pornography; clear and present \ndangers; commercial speech; defamation; speech harmful to children; \ntime, place, and manner restrictions; incidental restrictions; and \nradio and television broadcasting.\n  I do not for 1 minute believe that anyone writing the Constitution of \nthe United States some 200 years ago wanted to see the first amendment \nused to directly aid one in how to learn to injure and kill others.\n  I believe that the distribution of information on bombmaking, if we \nknow that information will be used for a criminal purpose, should be \nillegal.\n  At a recent hearing of the Judiciary Committee, I asked FBI Director \nLouis Freeh if anyone has a first amendment right to teach someone how \nto build a bomb in this country. He replied that it is a very important \ndebate that very few people have reviewed. He suggested that it is a \nquestion that should be taken up by Congress. That is what we are doing \nthis very day.\n  My amendment is specifically aimed at preventing and punishing the \ndistribution of material that will be used to commit serious crimes \nexternal to the distribution itself, and only when there is intent or \nknowledge that the information will be used for a criminal purpose.\n  In other words, it is not aimed at suppressing contents per se, or \nfashioned as a prior restraint. Its purpose is addressing the \nfacilitation of unlawful criminal conduct.\n  Now, we will talk for a moment about current law. There currently is \na Federal law on the books that is similar to my proposed amendment. \nTitle 18, section 231(a)(1) of the Criminal Code states:\n\n       Whoever teaches or demonstrates to any other person the \n     use, application, or making [[Page S7684]] of any firearm or \n     explosive or incendiary device . . . knowing or having reason \n     to know or intending that the same will be unlawfully \n     employed for use in, or in furtherance of, a civil disorder . \n     . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more \n     than 5 years, or both.\n\n  At least 18 States have similar bombmaking laws on the books, \nincluding Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, \nIllinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nand Virginia.\n  I know that concerns have been raised by some civil libertarians and \nothers about the constitutionality of my amendment, because it in \nessence takes this section which I have just read of the code and says \nif you, additionally, distribute that information with the knowledge or \nintent that it will be used for a criminal act, then you are guilty of \na Federal violation.\n  So if you read information that is within a terrorist handbook, where \nthe beginning page of the handbook says, ``Whether you are planning to \nblow up the World Trade Center, or merely explode a few small devices \non the White House lawn, this is the information you should have,'' \nthat clearly sets, in my view, the purpose and intent of providing the \ninformation.\n  The current law, section 231 of title 18, has already been used to \nprosecute several criminals. It has been constitutionally upheld by the \ncourts. In the United States versus Featherston, 1972, the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals held that the statute ``is not \nunconstitutionally vague'' and affirmed the convictions of two \ndefendants who were prosecuted under the law.\n  The fifth circuit wrote:\n\n       . . . the statute does not cover mere inadvertent conduct. \n     It requires those prosecuted to have acted with intent or \n     knowledge that the information disseminated would be used in \n     the furtherance of a civil disorder.\n\n  I know, though, that the true test of the amendment's \nconstitutionality will be if and when it comes before the courts. And, \nI welcome that opportunity.\n  The last time the Supreme Court directly dealt with the issue of \nfreedom of speech restrictions was over 20 years ago, in Brandenburg \nversus Ohio, 1969. As I understand it, this case involved a Ku Klux \nKlan leader's right to advocate destruction of property and other \nviolence as a means of obtaining political reform. I think it may be \ntime, especially in light of Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center \nbombings, for the Supreme Court to deal with this issue again.\n  In today's day and age, when violent crimes, bombings, and terrorist \nattacks are becoming too frequent--2,900 bombings a year, 541 in \nCalifornia alone in the year 1993--and when technology allows for the \ndistribution of bombmaking material over computers to millions of \npeople across the country in a matter of seconds, I believe that some \nrestrictions on speech are appropriate.\n  Specifically, I believe that restricting the availability of \nbombmaking information for criminal purposes, if there is intent or \nknowledge that the information will be used for a criminal purpose, is \nboth appropriate and required in today's day and age.\n  As Wisconsin District Judge Robert Warren wrote in the Progressive \ncase dealing with the publication of information on how to build an \natomic bomb:\n\n       What is involved here is information dealing with the most \n     destructive weapon in the history of mankind, information of \n     sufficient destructive potential to nullify the right to free \n     speech and to endanger the right to life itself . . . . While \n     it may be true in the long run, as Patrick Henry instructs \n     us, that one would prefer death to life without liberty, \n     nonetheless, in the short run, one cannot enjoy the freedom \n     of speech or the freedom of the press unless one first enjoys \n     the freedom to live.\n\n  I could not agree more with Judge Warren.\n  Enough is enough. I do not believe the first amendment gives anyone \nthe right to teach someone how to kill other people or provide certain \ninformation that will be used to commit a crime. Even our most precious \nrights must pass the test of common sense.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Feinstein amendment \nand suggest that what the Senator from California has raised here, \nparaphrasing director Freeh, is a debate that we should be having.\n  I do not think there are many people, and I do not think there are \nany people here in this body, who would suggest that the examples the \nSenator has given are examples we should not be concerned with. As \nevidenced by the Senator's comments, she also is mindful that although \nthere are exceptions to the first amendment they are few, and we \nshould, in drafting legislation, keep the first amendment in mind.\n  It is in that regard that I rise to discuss very briefly, the case of \nthe United States versus Featherston, the fifth circuit case that the \nSenator mentioned. In that case, the court upheld a conviction of two \nleaders of a militia group who showed their followers how to make \nexplosives. The purpose of the demonstration they put on was to prepare \nthe group for the coming revolution.\n  Now, the statute at issue makes it a crime to teach someone how to \nmake a bomb, knowing, intending or having reason to know that the bomb \nwill be unlawfully used in a civil disorder as defined as a public act \nof violence involving three or more people.\n  In upholding the statute's constitutionality, however, the court read \nthe language in the statute more narrowly than the language appears on \nits face. The court found the statute requires--this\n is the fifth circuit speaking--that those prosecuted have acted with \n``intent or knowledge'' that the information would be used to further a \ncivil disorder.\n\n  Now, the Senator has adjusted the language in her amendment in order \nto strike a much broader intent standard that she had originally \nproposed. The original language she had said, ``a person intends, knows \nor reasonably should know that such explosive material or information \nwill be used. . . .'' She has amended that to say that if the person \n``intends or knows''--let me get the exact language here. I beg the \nChair's pardon. The language now reads, ``intends or knows that such \nexplosive material or information will likely be used for. . . .''\n  I would respectfully suggest that language does not meet the fifth \ncircuit standard requiring intent or knowledge.\n  I see the Senator is understandably occupied at the moment with the \nchairman of the committee, discussing this amendment, but at an \nappropriate point I am going to ask the Senator whether she would be \nwilling to further amend her language to comport with what at least I \nbelieve the fifth circuit's minimal requirements are, and that is to \nsay that if the person ``intends or knows that such explosive material \nor information will be used.'' Put it another way, drop the word \n``likely.''\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I respond?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Please.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The answer to the question is yes. I was just talking \nto the committee chairman, the floor manager on this subject.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I compliment the Senator for that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I suggest that would put it in line with what she intends \nand what the court found.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I move to amend?\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask the Senator to withhold for 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the Senator's willingness to take out the \nprior notification and the word ``likely'' in her response to the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware. But if she would also modify and \ntake out ``or knows,'' in other words if such person ``intends'' and \ntake out ``or knows.'' I will tell her why that is important.\n  There are a lot of explosives manufacturers and personnel who do \nteach others how to make explosives and how to use them legitimately, \nfor legitimate purposes, mining and others. There are a lot of slurry \nmanufacturers [[Page S7685]] in my State. In fact, the chief for slurry \nunderground explosives happens to be the founder of the IRECO Chemical \nCorp. in my home State. If you put ``or knows'' in there, what we are \nconcerned about is if they teach a university class or teach other \npeople in their business or teach other people, in seminars, about how \nto do slurry explosives or some other type of explosives, they could, \nunder this provision, be indicted or prosecuted.\n  I really believe the distinguished Senator does a great favor if she \nsays that the person ``intends that such explosive materials or \ninformation will be used for. . . .'' I think that is the fair way to \ndo it. It is one way of alleviating these difficult legal questions \nthat really make it very difficult for people who are in the explosives \nbusiness to even talk about the business.\n  If the Senator could do that, I will be willing to accept this \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may respond, and perhaps the Senator from \nDelaware, because I think this is a useful discussion. I would like to \nrespond to the Senator from Utah.\n  What concerns me is somebody writes a terrorist handbook. We have \nthat case. And they tell somebody how to steal; how, in detail, to put \ntogether, let us say, a light bulb bomb.\n  You come to them and say, ``You violated a criminal law.''\n  They say, ``I did not intend this to be used for crime.''\n  Then the comeback is, ``You should know it is going to be used for \ncrime because that is the only purpose for a light bulb bomb. It is the \nonly purpose for a toilet paper bomb, for a candy box bomb.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will right away, in just 1 second.\n  What the Senator from Utah is saying is the explosive company that \nmakes the explosive does not intend--that is clear--that it be used for \ncriminal purposes. I agree. The intention of this is not to get at the \nexplosive company. The intention is to get at the person who misuses or \nmispackages, and who does it all for the purposes of committing a \ncriminal act.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I may--and I thank the Senator for her \ninvitation for me to speak to this as well--we have three slightly \ndifferent points of view here. Let me make clear what I would like to \nsee avoided and what I would like to see accomplished. Using specific \nexamples and hypotheticals is not always the best way to do it, but it \nseems to be the only way I have available to me to do it at this \nmoment.\n  None of us wants to have the publishers of World Book Encyclopedia \nindicted because they, in their World Book, tell you how you can make a \nbomb. You can go to a public library and you can find out how to build \na nuclear device. It is a lot more complicated than building a light \nbulb bomb, but you can find that out.\n  The purpose, the knowledge or intention of the publisher of World \nBook Encyclopedia or any other publication is in all probability not \nthe same purpose as that of the publisher of the Terrorist Handbook. \nBut for the purpose of Lady Justice, blindfolded, weighing her scales, \nit is hard to tell the difference sometimes, other than looking at the \nperson or the organization that is publishing the material, to \ndetermine their intent. And we do not want courts getting into that \nkind of business. I do not think the presiding officer wants that to \nhappen, nor do I, nor do I think anyone does, although I sure would \nlike to be able to capture those folks who issued that handbook.\n  So the Senator has narrowed her language, I think appropriately, to \nsay ``know or intends.''\n  Let me tell you why I think ``know'' makes sense to be in there. If, \nfor example, that gruesome example that the Senator gave from the \ninternet, where somebody puts on a bulletin board how to make a \nterrorist device, a bomb, and then someone writes back and says, ``O \nGreat One,'' I am paraphrasing, ``I want to kill Zionists in the \nGovernment. Tell me more. Feed me.'' Or whatever the terminology was.\n  The original publication of that information on the bulletin board on \nthe internet may or may not meet the standard of having known the \ninformation was going to be used for a criminal purpose, or may or may \nnot meet the standard of having intended that it be used. But it seems \nto me it is pretty clear that when that idiot writes back or punches in \nhis code and name and says, ``O Great One, I want to kill people, tell \nme more,'' if the original person who put the information up on the \nbulletin board said, ``All right, Swami, here it comes. If you really \nwant to get Zionists, here is how to do it,'' it seems to me at that \npoint the person knows that the information he or she is disseminating \nis intended for a criminal purpose.\n  The Senator from California said there are some stores, some retail \noutlets that sell the handbook. Or you can write away to get the \nhandbook. If I walk in to you and you are selling the handbook, you \nhave the handbook and I say, ``Ma'am, I would like to buy a handbook \nthat would teach me how to--do you see the cop down there in the \ncorner? I want to put a pipe bomb in that trash can where he stands \nevery morning from 8:30 to 9. I want to blow that SOB up.''\n  And you say, ``I have just the thing for you,'' and you walk over and \nyou hand him the handbook, it seems to me you knew the information that \nis available to you to do something terrible, kill that policeman \nstanding at the corner. It would be awfully hard to prove, though, \nthat, if you sold that handbook to me, you intended for me to kill that \npoliceman. You could know I was going to use it to kill someone without \nhaving intended for me to kill someone. Are you with me?\n  So my concern is, if it gets even narrowed further to say only \n``intends the information to be used in a criminal enterprise or \ncriminal act,'' then it is so narrow that you are not going to catch in \nthat net people who I think we should catch.\n  I have been, for the last 23 years, always listed as one of the two \nor three or four people most protective of the first amendment. You \nknow, all these rating organizations that rate us whether we are \nconservative, liberal, good, bad, or indifferent? I am always, along \nwith Senator Leahy and a few others, listed here as one of the \nstaunchest defenders of the first amendment.\n  So I am not looking to broaden the net the Senator wishes to cast. \nBut it seems to me if you narrow it so much so that you only use the \nword ``intend,'' you do not get the circumstance where I know that the \ninformation I have at my disposal as to how to build a light bulb bomb \nor any other kind of bomb, I know why you are seeking the information. \nYou have told me. You tell me, ``I want to know how to make a bomb out \nof Gerber's baby peaches. I want to know how to do that. Teach me, oh \nGreat One.'' You say, ``I've got just the answer for you. Here is how \nyou do it.''\n  It seems to me that does fall beyond the purview of first amendment \nprotection. It seems to me it is narrow enough and specific enough that \nit warrants to be made unlawful. And it seems to me that it is not at \nall inconsistent with what the fifth circuit and other courts have said \nrelative to the standard required on the part of the person \ndisseminating the information.\n  So in truth, you might also be able to get that very person on a \nconspiracy charge. You might not even need this statute. My friend, who \nis truly--we use this phrase too frequently around here, and it does \nnot always apply, but in this case it does. My friend, who is learned \nin the law could stand and say, ``Well, all right, Joe. I am not trying \nto eliminate the ability to nail the person who is knowingly \nparticipating in an unlawful activity. We can already do that under a \nconspiracy statute.'' Practically, that is true. But I would argue that \nincluding the word ``knows'' as well as ``intends'' here does no damage \nto the first amendment, and makes the case if not easier, equally as \nable to be pursued as a conspiracy theory would be. This is more \ndirect.\n  So my friend from Utah and I have been, the first 15 years of our \nworking together, not always on the same side of these civil liberties \narguments. And it is truly--I mean this sincerely--a pleasure to be on \nthe same side of these arguments with him these days. I do not by that \nin any way imply a change in his motivation at all. I think things have \nchanged, and as the troubles in society, the maturation process, has \n[[Page S7686]] taken place, and we all are seeing different \napplications of old principles to new problems. So I am not being \nfacetious when I say I welcome it. But I respectfully disagree with him \nhere.\n  I will not object to the Senator from California taking out the word \n``knows.'' But I would suggest that her test, her intended purpose, is \nbest served by saying if the person intends or knows that such \nexplosive material or information will be used for or in furtherance of \nan activity that constitutes a criminal, a Federal criminal offense, or \na criminal purpose affecting interstate commerce, I think keeping only \ntwo words ``intends'' or ``knows'' is totally appropriate, and I would \nsupport that.\n  But it is obviously her amendment. If she is persuaded by the \nreasoning of the Senator from Utah, I will not object to it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, Mr. President, I would like to amend the \namendment by removing the word ``likely.'' So that the amendment reads:\n\n       Information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the \n     manufacture of explosive materials, if the person intends and \n     knows that such explosive materials or information will be \n     used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes \n     a Federal criminal offense or a criminal purpose affecting \n     interstate commerce.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator send her modification to the \ndesk?\n  Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. HATCH. May I see the modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could have the attention of the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, the way she has written it is different than the way \nshe read it. It says if the person ``intends or knows.'' But if the \nSenator will read it ``intends and knows,'' I will go along with it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I meant ``or.'' I beg your pardon.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could the Senator change the ``or'' to an ``and''?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I did not mean to. Did I?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will change it to ``intends or knows.''\n  Mr. HATCH. If I can just respond to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, I would prefer ``intends and knows'' rather than ``intends \nor knows'' because I believe that can lead to some mischief in the \ncriminal law. On the other hand, this was a narrow interpretation. I \nagree with the distinguished Senator from Delaware. I am not sure that \nyou can catch them on a conspiracy statute in this area. I do not \nremember the law with regard to the explosives. But whether that is so \nor not, as I understand it, the word likely will be stricken in the \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, is the language ``and'' or \nis it ``or''? If it is ``or,'' I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 1209), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION RELATING \n                   TO EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS FOR A CRIMINAL PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new section:\n       ``(l) It shall be unlawful for any person to teach or \n     demonstrate the making of explosive materials, or to \n     distribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole \n     or in part, the manufacture of explosive materials, if the \n     person intends or knows, that such explosive materials or \n     information will be used for, or in furtherance of, an \n     activity that constitutes a Federal criminal offense or a \n     criminal purpose affecting interstate commerce.''\n       (b) Section 844 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by designating section (a) as subsection (a)(1) and by adding \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(a)(2) Any person who violates subsection (l) of section \n     842 of this chapter shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with that modification, I am prepared to \naccept the amendment, if the distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nlikewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. For clarification purposes, and I think I will accept it, \nI want to read the entire amendment. It will take me one moment. It \nsays:\n\n       Section (a) reads, ``Section 842 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     section:\n       Subsection 1.\n       It shall be unlawful for any person to teach or demonstrate \n     the making of explosive materials, or to distribute by any \n     means information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the \n     manufacture of explosive materials, if the person intends or \n     knows that such explosive material or information will be \n     used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes \n     a Federal criminal offense or a criminal purpose affecting \n     interstate commerce.\n       Subsection B.\n       Section 844 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     designating section (a) as subsection (a)(1), and by adding \n     the following new subsection:\n       (a)(1), any person who violates subsection (1) of section \n     842 of this chapter shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\n\n  That is the end of the amendment. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The ``1'' is an ``l''. It is a lower case.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I beg your pardon. In the last paragraph?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In the first paragraph and the last.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I beg your pardon. It is ``l'', and not ``1.''\n  So it will read, the following new section ``l'', ``It shall be \nunlawful for any person to teach or demonstrate the making of explosive \nmaterial or to distribute by any means information pertaining to'', et \ncetera. Then at the bottom paragraph, it reads ``Any person who \nviolates subsection l of this section.'' Then that is how it reads, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am sorry to do this to you. But also in \nthe third paragraph, it reads:\n\n       Section (a) as subsection (a)(l) and by adding the \n     following new subsection.\n\n  So, in other words, the three places where I thought it was a ``1'' \nit is not a ``1.'' It is an ``l.''\n  So that being the case, that is the only correction of me, not of the \namendment, I have no objection. We accept the amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1209), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator from California \nnever ceases to amaze me. I say that with genuine respect. When she \nzeroed in on this problem when Senator Kennedy came to the hearing and \npresented a \n60-, 70-, 80-page document--I forget how long it was--of information \nthat the staff had pulled off the Internet for him on how to do these \nthings, one of the things that I admire most about her is her \nincredible common sense.\n  I remember her sitting there looking at us and saying, ``You mean you \ncan do this? I mean, why are we allowing this?'' All of us who were \nsupposedly hopefully good lawyers all looked and said, ``First \namendment problem, Senator.'' And we all did say that. We all knew \nbecause of our reverence for the first amendment. Those of us who are \nconservative, liberal, and moderate alike all said, ``First amendment \nproblem.'' We all kind of went on to other things.\n  As she always does, she went back to her office, and I am sure she \nturned to that able staff member next to her and said, ``Wait a minute, \nthere has to be a way to do this. There has to be an answer to this.'' \nAs usual, her instinct is almost always right. And when I have dealt \nwith her, it has been unerring. Not being a lawyer, she went out and \ngot some fine lawyers and said, ``How can I write this thing because I, \nDianne Feinstein, don't want to amend the first amendment either, but I \ndo want to deal with this foolishness.'' [[Page S7687]] \n  She did it. I compliment her. And remind me, if I ever forget, never \nto underestimate her. She always gets it done. We are all better for \nit. I again congratulate her.\n  We have no other amendment on the floor at the moment. What I would \nlike to do, unless someone wishes to bring up an amendment, I would \nlike to because I was not here when the Senator from California spoke \non her first amendment, the taggants amendment, and I would like to \ntake a moment.\n                           Amendment No. 1202\n\n  If anyone has any other thing to bring up, I would be happy to yield. \nI rise at this moment to support the amendment of my friend from \nCalifornia on taggants, if I may, because we are going to be voting on \nthat I think around 6 o'clock.\n  One area we did not address in the legislation before us was the \nissue of taggants. The President wanted to see it addressed, and I did \nas well and spoke very briefly with my friend from California and \nencouraged her to move the amendment on taggants.\n  I feel it is very important in the battle against terrorism to \nenhance our ability to identify, following detonation, the source or \norigin of the explosives used in an act of violence against our fellow \nAmericans. Key Federal law enforcement officials recognize that to \nprovide for enhanced tracing capabilities is a logical and, I would \nargue, overdue response. The administration included a tracing \nprovision in their antiterrorism proposal, and it was section 803 of S. \n761.\n  Now, I want to make it clear to those of our colleagues who may be \nlistening in their offices, I am not inadvertently substituting the \nword ``tracing'' for ``taggant'' because that is what this is all \nabout. We want to be able to trace the manufacture of the material \nused, not for purposes of prosecuting the manufacturer, unless the \nmanufacturer violated the law intentionally in to whom they sold the \nmaterial, but in order to be able to trace the person who purchased the \nmaterial which would enhance our ability to find out who detonated the \nbomb.\n  The provision authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to promulgate \nregulations requiring taggants to be added to explosive materials. Now, \nthe Republican bill, however, omits this key provision. Instead, the \nRepublican bill calls for no action, only more study. I would also note \nthat not only does the Republican bill choose study over action but, \neven worse, their bill calls on the Justice Department to study this \nissue.\n  Now, we all know that jurisdiction over these issues and the real \nexpertise related thereto is in the Treasury Department. Let us not \nduplicate effort. Let us not duplicate bureaucracy. Let us think of the \ntaxpayers, not the pet peeves of some special interest group because \nthey do not like the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department is \nthe outfit that has been dealing with this issue and explosives for \ntime immemorial. The Justice Department is not. It does not have the \nexpertise. So I would suggest that is not the place we should look.\n  Now, taggants are tiny plastic, as they are referred, sandwiches with \ndifferent color stripes that are added to explosives during the \nmanufacturing process. Because these taggants are left after the \nexplosion, they can be used to identify the source of an explosion. And \nthat is the source of the material--where it was purchased. In other \nwords, these identifiers, these little plastic sandwiches, as they are \ncalled, different colored stripes are put into the explosive when it is \nbeing manufactured, legitimately manufactured. We are not talking about \nsome back-room operation. These are legitimate explosives. These are \nlegitimate materials made by legitimate companies for legitimate \npurposes. You add at the time of their manufacture these little colored \nstrips so that when the explosion goes off, you are able to go into the \narea where the explosion took place and by use of detection means find \nthese taggants.\n  These taggants--this is my phrase; I have never heard anyone else use \nthis--are a little bit like that little bar code on the bottom of \neverything you buy in the grocery store. The checker just runs it \nthrough a scanner. They can identify what stock it was, what date it \nwas made, where it came from, what part of the store it was in, how \nmuch it cost.\n  It is the same principle here. We want to be able to essentially run \nthe residue of that explosive material through a scanner, in effect. \nAnd you are able to say OK, the material used in this bomb was \nmanufactured at such and such a time, such and such a batch, et cetera, \nand work your way back with the intention of not going after the \nmanufacturer but going after the person who purchased it.\n  Now, it may be the person legitimately purchased it, and we find out \nit was purchased for a construction operation and it was put in, \nproperly stored in a locked vault and that you find out the vault was \nnot broken into but that on the job it turned out a couple pieces were \nmissing. Well, then you have the investigative tool to narrow it down. \nMaybe then you look at the people who took the explosive out and were \nlegitimately working on the job. Maybe it turns out to be one of them. \nIt was not them. They may say, well, it was only 20 minutes it was not \nhere. And there was a guy wearing a red cap that came by. It is \ninvestigative work. It merely gives, but significantly gives, an \nopportunity to law enforcement agencies to begin to trace, backtrack, \nuntil hopefully you find the person who was the person who purchased \nand used this material.\n  Now, to use a practical example of how even small pieces of evidence \nare vital, consider that the vehicle identification number on the \nexploded remains of a rental truck that was used to blow up the Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City was the critical piece of evidence that gave \nFederal law enforcement a critical lead on the bombing suspects.\n  There was a taggant in effect on that vehicle in an ID number on it. \nWhere would we be if we had not required an ID number on that vehicle? \nWe would be nowhere. You would not have been able to go back to find \nout from where that vehicle was rented, who walked in and rented it, \nwhat they looked like, what their description was and then trace it \nback to the guy who gets arrested almost incidentally on a highway \ngoing out of Oklahoma City the day of the bombing.\n  Very important material, a tiny little thing. You would say, well, \nwait a minute. That truck was blown to smithereens. This just goes to \nshow you the investigative capability of the people there. The axle--I \nbelieve it was an axle--on which this identification number existed was \nfound. They knew to go and look at that ID number.\n  Once they found it, they could begin the tracing process. In fact, it \nwas the employees of the rental agency they traced this back to who \nprovided much of the information necessary to create the composite \nsketch of the suspect initially known as John Doe 1, whom we now know \nas Timothy McVeigh.\n  Now, taggants work much in the same way. The taggants would give an \nindication where the explosives were purchased. Not only does that lead \nlaw enforcement to a sales clerk who might have provided a description \nof the terrorist, but this information may also be key, and perhaps the \nonly physical evidence that a prosecutor can use, to nail the defendant \nto the crime. If there were taggants in the explosives that were used, \nyou would be able to do the same thing--and they were recovered. You \nmight be able to go back and find where the material that blew up the--\nand that was fertilizer added with some chemicals and the like. You may \nbe able to go back and find out where that fertilizer was sold and you \nmay find the very same thing. The clerk says I remember selling that \nfertilizer to the following person, and you do a composite sketch. \nAgain, it is a strong piece of evidence.\n  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue that we \nshould study this issue more closely. But that means only one thing: \nMore needless delay. The potential effect of taggants has been \nhighlighted in a study that was conducted in the late 1970's when the \nATF seeded a very small portion of explosives, 10,000 pounds, with \ntaggants.\n  We had this debate, I might add, when I first came to the Senate in \nthe 1970's, and we were told, no, it may be a destabilizing element in \nthe manufacture of the material; it may be used for purposes on the \npart of law enforcement to do bad things, et cetera. But we agreed that \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and [[Page S7688]] Firearms could do an experiment. \nSo they went to a manufacturing site, and they tagged 10,000 pounds of \nexplosives. They put in one of these little colored strips, these \nsandwiches.\n  Now, despite this relatively small amount--and that probably \nrepresented less than--I will not even guess--one one-hundredth percent \nof all the explosives sold that year. It was infinitesimally small in \nthis little experiment compared to the universe of all explosives sold \nthat year. For example, my staff is telling me 4 billion pounds of \nexplosives are sold per year--4 billion pounds.\n This was 10,000 pounds that was tagged as an experiment. Now, \nnotwithstanding that, that one experiment back in 1978--and the Senator \nfrom California knows this--was very instrumental and effective in \nhelping solve a bombing incident in the State of Maryland. Now, the \nidea that we did this one experiment--and it was just pure luck, I \nsuspect, that that 10,000 pounds was purchased. But what happened was \nthere was a car bombing, and but for the fact that the explosive used \nwas part of that 10,000-pound batch that was the only batch out of four \nbillion pounds sold that year, the perpetrator of the act was unlucky \nenough to purchase something from that batch. And that was the thing \nthat led to the identification and conviction of that individual, with \nlittle or no possibility of their ever having found him but for the \ntaggants.\n\n  I suggest that the study by the Office of Technology Assessment on \ntaggants is also a key source of the safety and efficacy of taggants. \nThere was this experiment and the study by the Office of Technology \nAssessment. The Office of Technology Assessment found that \n``identification taggants would facilitate the investigation of almost \nall significant criminal bombings in which commercial explosives were \nused.''\n  Now, safety tests performed by the Office of Technology Assessment \nfound taggants to be compatible with the explosives covered by this \namendment. By compatible, I mean they did not diminish the efficacy of \nthe explosives, No. 1. So it blew up just as big as it would have blown \nup without the taggant. It did not diminish its capacity.\n  Second, it did nothing to destabilize the explosive. It made it no \nmore or less dangerous to deal with that explosive. One of the \narguments we will hear used is that if you add these taggants, they \nwill have the effect of destabilizing this explosive material, making \nit more dangerous to handle. There is no evidence of that, according to \nthe Office of Technology Assessment.\n  Third, they also found that it did not, in any way, affect the \nmanufacturer of that material. That is, placing the taggants in the \nmaterial as it is manufactured did not diminish safety in the \nproduction of that material.\n  For 15 years, law enforcement in Switzerland have recognized taggants \nas an important piece of the puzzle in solving crimes involving \nillegally used explosives. Under this amendment, the Secretary of the \nTreasury will determine how we can best utilize this technology. Then \nwe will move forward and use the taggants after that assessment has \nbeen made by the Secretary of the Treasury. And that is key. We should \nmove forward in this area now, and we should do so without further \ndelay.\n  Now, a study on common and precursor chemicals, another aspect of the \namendment I want to touch on briefly, is the requirement that the \nSecretary of the Treasury study and make recommendations regarding: \nFirst, the ability and feasibility of rendering inert those common \nchemicals used to manufacture explosive materials and, second, the \nability to impose controls on those precursor chemicals used to \nmanufacture explosive materials.\n  Let me make it clear, this is a separate issue. There are two issues \nhere that the Senator from California has pursued that were in the \nPresident's legislation. One, this notion of, in effect, seeding an \nexplosive with a color-stripped material so that when the explosive \ngoes off, you can find the material and trace back the place where it \nwas manufactured and sold. That is the taggant.\n  Now, there is a second issue, and that is chemicals which are sold--I \nwill use this phrase--over the counter. These are chemicals you can go \nand buy, but they can be used for destructive purposes, although their \nintention is for constructive purposes. Fertilizer is to help things \ngrow, not kill things or kill people.\n  Now, I said this before, and I say it to my friend from California \nhere. I was at a conference with a group of U.S. Senators, \nCongresspersons, and officials from the United Nations the day this \ngod-awful explosion in Oklahoma occurred, and we literally interrupted \nthe conference. One of the conferees was Gen. Michael Rose, a general \nin the British Army, who was the UNPROFOR Commander of Forces in Bosnia \nup until about 3 months ago. General Rose and I were sitting next to \none another discussing the situation in Bosnia. What happened was that \nwe adjourned when we heard this horrible news and went to the nearest \ntelevision. The first scene all of us saw--a dozen of us Congressmen, \nSenators and generals--was a visual image of the Federal building and \nthe confusion surrounding it. You could see how the Federal building \nwas not only blown up, but it looked like it was cut away in the front. \nI was sitting next to General Rose. I could not hear what was on the \ntelevision in this hotel lobby. We just saw the picture. He looked at \nme and he said, ``That bomb is a fertilizer bomb. That is what \ndestroyed that building.'' My staffer reminded me that he looked and he \nsaid, ``That is an ANFO bomb.'' I wondered, what in the devil is he \ntalking about? How does he know this? All we can see is this picture on \ntelevision. He had not heard any more about this than I did. We just \nwalked out of this conference. He went on to explain to me how when \nammonium nitrate is added to fertilizer in a certain formula and way, \nit produces an explosion whose fingerprints or characteristics are like \nthe one we saw. I was amazed. I was complimenting him, because about 3 \nminutes later a reporter comes on and says, ``We have just learned that \nthis was a fertilizer bomb.'' I did not know how he knew this. He went \non to explain to us that it was his experience when he was a commander \nin Northern Ireland with the use of fertilizer bombs by the IRA. He \nwent on to point out that England had changed the law relative to the \nsale of fertilizer to Ireland and the type of fertilizer and the amount \nof nitrate that could be in the fertilizer, and he went on and on about \nit. And he said something fascinating. He said that it has had three \ninteresting effects. First, the environment is cleaner. There is not as \nmuch nitrates left over in the environment when it is applied to the \nsoil. The water is cleaner and the bombs are fewer.\n  So that is when I became interested in how do you take these \nmaterials that seem to me to be totally innocent in terms of the \nability to cause damage and render them inert--inert in the sense that \nthey can only do the thing for which they were manufactured, which is \nto help things grow, as opposed to kill people. One of the ways to do \nthat is to look at it and study it and make recommendations regarding \nthe feasibility of adding materials to the manufacture of these \nchemicals and precursor chemicals that will not diminish the \neffectiveness of the chemical but render them incapable of generating \nthe explosion.\n  The purpose of this provision is very simple, and it should be clear \nto every American in the wake of the Oklahoma City tragedy. What has \nbecome evident in the past weeks is that in America today, nearly \nanyone, as our friend from California has pointed out, can acquire the \ningredients, all of which have other legitimate uses, and build a bomb.\n  The bomb in Oklahoma was a mixture of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and \ndiesel fuel. Ammonium nitrate can be purchased at almost any garden \nsupply or hardware store, and when mixed with a fuel, it can be \nclassified as a high explosive. One way to desensitize ammonium nitrate \nwhile still preserving its effectiveness for its intended use would be \nto mix a nonexplosive chemical such as lime, calcium carbonate, into \nthe product, to render it inefficient for use as an explosive.\n  Now, I think it makes overwhelming sense to suggest that a \nfeasibility study be done and recommendations made as to whether or \nnot, for example, lime can be added to ammonium nitrate, allowing the \nfertilizer to be as potent as it was before for the purposes of \nencouraging growth in the soil, yet rendering it incapable of being \nused as [[Page S7689]] a bomb when mixed with a fuel supply. This type \nof desensitizing is currently employed in England, as I said.\n  Let me be clear, all this amendment does with regard to this point, \nall it does is require the Secretary to study the feasibility of such a \npolicy being implemented in the United States.\n  It is an unfortunate reality that individuals would take seemingly \nharmless--I might add, legal--products and devices and turn them into \nweapons capable of exacting the devastation and loss of life that we \nall saw in Oklahoma City. However unfortunate that may be, it is a \nreality nonetheless. The amendment of my friend from California is an \neffort to curtail the availability of products which can be used in \nthis manner.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make as a concluding point that I \nunderstand negotiations between Senator Feinstein and other interested \nparties on the other side are proceeding. Of course, I hope these \ndiscussions will be successful, but I strongly urge that the Senator \nfrom California not relent on the two essential aspects of her \namendment.\n  One, the taggants be able to be placed, by recommendation from the \nSecretary of Treasury, in explosives; and, two, that the study be \nundertaken that would determine whether there are ways that we can \nfeasibly render inert the destructive capability of otherwise totally \nconstructive precursor chemicals.\n  I see the Senator from California is on the floor and seeking \nrecognition. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nDelaware for that very eloquent exposition on taggants.\n  I must say that it never ceases to amaze me, because outside people \nare saying they are for legislation to begin to tag explosives where \nsafe and not adding to the volatility. Yet once again, I must tell the \nSenator, the lobbying of those special interests is starting up again \nto, one by one, move Senators off of this legislation.\n  This led me to get a little bit of the history of taggants before \nthis body. While the Senator has been here for a long time, I am a \nrelative newcomer, 2\\1/2\\ years, and I did not realize this issue has \nbeen raised now for 22 years before this body. It might be interesting \nto go back into a little bit of the history.\n  It actually began in 1973 when Congress asked ATF to look into \npossible methods of fighting terrorists in criminal bombings. That \nyear, ATF and the FAA established an ad hoc committee on explosives \nseeding. That same year, ATF formed an inner agency advisory committee \non explosives tagging.\n  Also in 1973, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which we \nknew as LEAA, sponsored a study by Lawrence Livermore Lab, managed by \nAerospace Corporation, to study the feasibility of identification \ntagging of explosives.\n  Several companies, including 3M and Westinghouse, began taggant \ndevelopment. By 1976, this was far enough advanced to be the subject of \nthe pilot tagging program developed by aerospace under the contract \nwith the Bureau of Mines. The results seemed positive, in 1977, with \nthe Omnibus Antiterrorism Act.\n  Mr. President, was the Senator here in 1977?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, yes, I was here. I was also here in 1973, \nunfortunately. I have been here, and I have been interested in this \nissue since then. That is why I am so happy the Senator is pushing it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is interesting to see, because in \n1977 Senators Abe Ribicoff and Jake Javits presented language mandating \nthe introduction of explosive tagging over a period of time.\n  During consideration of the bill, the National Rifle Association--who \nsomebody has just said is for taggants--opposed the inclusion in the \nprogram of black and smokeless powders used by some hunters to hand-\nload antique rifles. The National Rifle Association was successful at \nthe committee level at deleting the requirement that these powders be \ntagged.\n  Nonetheless, the requirement that other types of explosives be tagged \nwas left intact. The bill never reached the Senate floor.\n  In the 96th Congress, the antiterrorism legislation was reintroduced \nwith provisions for gradually phasing in identification tagging over a \n2\\1/2\\-year period. The legislation was considered in the House by the \nAviation Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee.\n  It was supported by the Airline Pilots Association and the Airline \nTransport Association. The House Members and Glenn Anderson, the \nsubcommittee chair, wanted to wait for action on the subject in the \nSenate before taking the issue up in the House.\n  The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee marked it up on May 7, \n1979. The only controversial aspect of this Omnibus Antiterrorism Act, \nSenate bill 333, was explosive tagging. Again, the NRA and the \nInstitute of Makers of Explosives lobbied hard to kill the entire \nprogram and made wild accusations about the cost, safety, utility, and \nburdensomeness of taggants.\n  So the principal supporters, Ribicoff and Javits, and the principal \nopponent, who was Senator Stevens at the time, agreed to postpone \ncommittee consideration pending an examination of taggants by the \ncongressional Office of Technology Assessments.\n  That was the report I held up this morning. OTA was not to conduct \noriginal research, but rather was supposed to review existing data and \nreport its findings back to the Governmental Affairs Committee no later \nthan August 6, 1979.\n  OTA went out. They established a staff drawn from science \nfoundations, Lawrence Livermore Lab, to carry out the proposal. They \nalso formed an advisory committee composed of representatives from the \nlaw enforcement community, the explosives industry, and the gun lobby \nto provide input. It is my understanding that one of the explosive \nindustry members was later indicted for selling explosive materials to \nLibyan terrorists.\n  Despite the efforts on the part of OTA to comply with the August 6 \ndeadline, it soon became apparent that the deadline could not be met. \nSo a new deadline was set for Thanksgiving. In the interim, American \nhostages were seized in Iran and the Senate decided to postpone \nconsideration of the underlying bill until the situation was clarified.\n  This gave OTA more time to develop its report, which was finally \nreleased on April 28, 1980. That is the report I mentioned this \nmorning.\n  At this point, the National Rifle Association, I am told, hired \nlobbyists to lobby against the bill. I am told that the people hired \nwere paid more than $250,000 for the effort to defeat this. They were \nsuccessful in getting several trade associations in the construction \nindustry, including the Crushed Stone Association, to launch campaigns \nagainst the bill on the theory that taggants would increase the cost of \nexplosives by more than 100 percent. In fact, the estimate is less than \n10 percent. I read those figures into the Record this morning.\n  By the date of the markup, it became clear that the Javits-Ribicoff \napproach would not win. Senator Glenn offered a compromise. That did \nnot go ahead. The committee vote was 8-7 in favor of an Eagleton \nmotion, who was an opponent of taggants. And on and on and on it goes.\n  Now here we are with a massive incident in the United States--two of \nthem--the World Trade Center and the building in Oklahoma City. And \nnow, today, this afternoon, the phones are heating up. Senators that I \nthought would be for this are calling. They are now getting the \nagriculture communities involved, saying they do not want a study. Just \nthe study on ammonium nitrate, the fertilizer that blew up the building \nand killed 168 people, we were being told we should not study it.\n  I cannot believe it. It is unbelievable to me that anyone could \noppose a study to see if fertilizers can be made inert so they will not \ndetonate it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do not mean yield to the issue, but yield temporarily on \nthe floor.\n  Let me ask the Senator somewhat of a rhetorical question. She points \nout \n[[Page S7690]] accurately, my recollection, because I was here during \nthe entirety of what she spoke of. From my perspective, her historical \nanalysis is accurate. I remember at the time being dumbfounded, quite \nfrankly, that the chemical industry, a large chemical industry in \nDelaware, and others would not push hard for these actions to be taken.\n I mean, I just assumed, naively, that this would be something \neverybody would be for.\n\n  There is one argument that can be made in opposition to what we are \ntrying to do and I think we should state it. That OTA study, Office of \nTechnology Assessment study, said that there was only one possible \nexception to the circumstance under which adding a taggant might \ndiminish the safety, and that was with regard to smokeless powder.\n  The Senator pointed out that back as early as 1973, the NRA pointed \nout that they were concerned about people who were muzzle loading \nantique guns and using smokeless powder to put them in a position to be \nable to use the guns. Probably we could have settled that matter then \nbut it turned out that, whether the NRA was concerned about that or \nnot--and I will not make a judgment about that--it ended up being the \ninitial device used, the wedge used to block anything from happening.\n  It is my understanding from my discussions with the White House, with \nthe Justice Department, my staff and others, that when I introduced the \nPresident's bill, when Senators Kohl and Specter and I introduced the \nPresident's bill containing this provision, that we did not intend--the \nWhite House did not intend, the Justice Department did not intend--to \ninclude within the definition of explosive, smokeless powder. The ATF \nindicates that they do not include that in their definition of \nexplosives. And I would think that--I would like to ask the Senator \nwhether this is not her understanding as well, that we would be willing \nto make it very clear in the record that our definition--your \ndefinition of explosives does not include smokeless powder.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be prepared to do that, Senator. It is my \nunderstanding this affects gels, slurries, dynamite, emulsions and cast \nboosters, and black powder. But it does not include smokeless powder.\n  Mr. BIDEN. As further evidence that we are not just arriving at this \nas a means of a compromise, it was never our intention to include \nsmokeless powder. I would read from, as further evidence of that \nalthough we did not make it absolutely clear, I would read page 2 of \nthe amendment, subsection (e), the bottom, second-to-the-last-line of \nthe page.\n\n       Tracer elements to be added to explosive materials under \n     provisions of this subsection shall be of such character and \n     in such quantity as the Secretary may authorize or require, \n     and such as will not substantially impair the quality of the \n     explosive material for their intended lawful use, adversely \n     affect the safety of the explosives, or have substantially \n     adverse effects on the environment.\n\n  So we thought that we were dealing with this red herring by having \nthe section requiring that the decision would have to be made that the \ntracer elements, the taggants, would not adversely affect the safety of \nthe explosives.\n  Since OTA indicated that there was a possibility of that with regard \nto smokeless powder, we did not intend that to be covered. But I would \nsuggest--I know my friend from California who is leading this effort \nhas probably had some discussions already with the majority staff and \nothers about this. I hope we can reach a resolution on it. And I \nsincerely hope, coming from a State where agriculture is our single \nlargest industry in terms of dollars and effect on the economy, and \nwhere fertilizers are used a good deal--hope no one would be fearful of \nexplaining to the agricultural community that they supported a study to \ndetermine this. I cannot imagine the farmers in my State, very \nconservative, hard-working folks, would be opposed to a study being \nconducted to determine whether or not ammonium nitrate could have an \nelement added to it that would not in any way diminish its efficacy on \nthe land but would diminish its efficacy as an explosive component.\n  I might point out--I might ask it, actually, in terms of a question. \nIs it the sponsor's intention that this merely be a study relative to \nmeans to render inert these components, precursors that can be used as \nbombs? And that if the study concludes that the only way it could be \ndone would be to diminish the capacity of ammonium nitrate to do its \njob on the field, that we would not move forward? This is merely a \nstudy, is it not?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator from Delaware is 100 percent correct.\n  I might say, coming from a State that has a $18 billion agricultural \nindustry, I called up to see if we have had any phone calls at all from \nAgriculture, Farm Bureau, anybody else. The answer is no.\n  I would hazard a guess, knowing the agricultural community of \nCalifornia, that they would not object to a study. So I think this is \nprobably a very targeted lobbying drive at the present time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I hope we follow the advice of the Senator. \nWe know this is the right thing to do. We know this is the right thing \nto do.\n  We know it is, as a minimum, worthy of scientific study to determine \nwhether this can be done with efficacy. And we also know--I do not \nfully understand, frankly--we also know there are certain interests \nthat do not want that to happen. Because they are fearful--the only \nthing I can conclude, Senator, is they are fearful that the study will \ncome forward and say, ``Guess what? You can do this without in any way \ndiminishing the effectiveness of fertilizers used for agriculture.''\n  Because, obviously, if the study is going to come back and say you \ncannot do this without diminishing significantly the capacity of the \nfertilizer to function, that cannot worry them because if that is the \ncase we are not going to do it. There is no way that would get done \nhere.\n  So I always am confused by this response. I was confused in 1973 \nabout why people responded the way they did. I hope we will not let \ninterests that I do not fully understand sidetrack even a study. I \nmight point out, by the way, with regard to taggants, originally the \npeople who are now opposing the Senator's language and the President's \nlanguage were opposed to even a study before. Now they are for a study. \nI hope we can just bypass--not have to go through another 10 years \nbefore we get to the point where they see their way clear, suggesting \nwe can even look at a study.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have here an amended amendment that may solve the \nproblem. There are some technical amendments which I can read. But the \none that deals right now with the situation that my colleague is \nreferring to, smokeless or black powder would be as follows.\n\n       At the end of subsection (c)(1) insert the following:\n       For purposes of this subsection, explosive material does \n     not include smokeless or black powder manufactured for uses \n     set forth in section 845(a)(4)(5) of this chapter.\n\n  Which is ``Small Arms Ammunition and Components Thereof.'' That is \nthe exception, just for small arms ammunition and components thereof.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to the Senator from California that is probably \nbroader than we have to make it, but I would agree with her that that \nis worth doing to allay the concerns and fears of our friends who think \nsomehow there is some nefarious objective here that is not obvious on \nits face.\n  The Senator from----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator will yield? We believe it is already \nexempted. This is a restatement of that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Again, I would have no objection. But I suggest the \nSenator withhold modifying that because the Senator from Utah was \nrequired--he has been on the floor the whole day. He said he had to \nleave for 15 minutes. And would I not take any action in his absence. \nSo I suggest, and maybe the Senator's staff has already done this, make \nthat language available to Senator Hatch's staff. Hopefully he can \nagree to that.\n  But I ask her to withhold modifying her amendment which would require \nunanimous consent until he returns to the floor and has had a chance to \nlook at it. [[Page S7691]] \n  Mr. President, while the Senator from California is doing that, I \nwill repeat that in both instances, in the instance of requiring \ntracers and studying the capability of rendering products which do not \nhave a destructive purpose but are able to be used for destructive \npurposes, to render them inert--that is incapable of being used for \ndestructive purposes--that in both instances we are very concerned \nabout safety. We do not want at any point here, in attempting to \ncreate, eliminate, diminish the possibility of one bad thing happening, \nto raise safety concerns. So for those explosives with potential--and I \nwant to stress potential--safety concerns, the Secretary of Treasury \ncan account for those concerns by establishing regulations. The point \nof this amendment is to improve the safety of Americans. But it will \nnot be done by risking the safety of manufacturers or people who \nlawfully use explosives. This amendment accounts for those concerns and \naddresses the underlying concern with illicit use of explosives.\n  I stress again the action just suggested by the Senator from \nCalifornia is further evidence of the fact that we are in no way \nsuggesting an amendment that would diminish the safety of anyone, the \nmanufacturer or the person who lawfully uses those materials. I further \nnote as it relates to precursor chemicals, we are not in any way \nsuggesting that any change be made prior to a full-blown study. And the \npurpose of that study is to determine whether or not we can be assured \nthat we can render these precursor chemicals inert, without affecting \ntheir ability to be used effectively as designed for the purpose for \nwhich they are manufactured in the first instance.\n  So I hope that when we get to this amendment that no one will be \ndissuaded from voting for it. And I say to representatives of the NRA \nwho are listening that it is not our intention in any way to make \nanything unsafe for hunters, to in any way diminish or limit any right \nof any gun owner in America, to in any way put any gun owner in America \nin any jeopardy whatsoever. This is not a slippery slope. This is not \nthe camel's nose under the tent. This is not all those other things \nthat are always stated when in fact we do anything at all that impacts \nin any way upon firearms, ammunition, or explosive material.\n  There is no subagenda here. It is very simple. We want to track down \nthe bad guys who use explosives the wrong way for criminal purposes, \nand we want to take that material that is sold over the counter for \npurposes totally unrelated to criminal activity or for explosive \ncapability and determine whether or not, after scientists study the \nissue, we can safely render that explosive capability inert, render it \nincapable being used in an explosive compound, and in doing so in no \nway diminish the purpose, the efficacy of the material for which it was \nmanufactured in the first place.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I urge the Senate to support the Feinstein amendment to \nrequire that explosives be manufactured with identifying chemical \nmarkers.\n  These markers, called taggants, are an essential tool for law \nenforcement officials in the difficult effort to apprehend terrorists \nwho use bombs. The President has asked us to include this provision in \nthe pending bill, and we should comply with his request.\n  Explosives are the weapon of choice for any criminal who wishes to \nkill and maim human beings indiscriminately. Nothing demonstrates this \nmore starkly than the tragedy in Oklahoma City, in which 168 people \nwere killed by a bomb in a parked truck outside the building. The \nperpetrators of this atrocious crime caused more death and destruction \nwith an explosive device than they could ever have accomplished with \neven the most lethal firearm.\n  But Oklahoma City is just the tip of the iceberg. Because of their \ndestructive capacity, explosive devices have been used repeatedly to \nperpetrate terrorist acts:\n  On February 26, 1993, Islamic extremists used a 1,200-pound bomb to \ndevastate several levels of one of the World Trade Center Buildings in \nNew York City. Six people were killed, and over a thousand were \ninjured.\n  Explosives caused seven airline crashes between 1982 and 1989, \nincluding Pan Am flight 103, in which 270 people, many of them \nAmericans, were killed over Lockerbie, Scotland. Seven Americans also \ndied in a 1989 plane crash in Africa caused by an explosive device.\n  In 1993, bomb attacks occurred in every one of the 50 States, as well \nas in the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. In \nMassachusetts, there were 16 illegal explosive incidents that year, and \n11 of those bombs detonated before authorities could disable them. In \nthe decade between 1984 and 1993, Massachusetts had a total of 141 \nbombings and 27 attempted bombings. Four people were killed, and 28 \nwere injured during that period.\n  Nationwide, 632 people were killed by bombs between 1989 and 1991.\n  Of course, bombings are not always intended to result in largescale \ndestruction. Explosives are sometimes employed in criminal attacks \nagainst specific individuals, as in the case of the assassination of \nFederal Judge Robert Vance several years ago. And since 1978, the so-\ncalled Unabomber has killed 3 and injured 23 people with deadly letter \nbombs delivered through the mail to his victims' homes and offices. In \n1993 alone, the postal service detected 10 bombs in apparently \nunrelated incidents.\n  The perpetrators of these crimes often evade capture and conviction, \nin part because of the difficulty that law enforcement officials face \nin tracing the origin of explosive devices and components. As the \nOffice of Technology Assessment has noted, ``bombings are particularly \ndifficult crimes for law enforcement agencies to handle as the bomber \nis not usually near the scene of the crime, the physical evidence is \ndestroyed or damaged by the detonation, and the materials necessary to \nfabricate even a quite catastrophic bomb are easily obtainable.''\n  But cutting-edge technology offers two ways to assist law enforcement \nin the difficult task of apprehending terrorists. First, there are \nmeans to detect explosives when they pass through airports and other \nsecure areas. And second, explosives can be manufactured with chemical \ntaggants that help investigators trace the source of the material after \nthe explosion has occurred.\n  The pending bill advances the first of these two technologies by \nrequiring that explosives be manufactured with detection agents that \nwill trigger detection devices at security checkpoints. This \nrequirement implements an international convention, and I commend the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for including this provision in his \nsubstitute.\n  But the pending bill does not include the second of these two \ntechnologies, and the Feinstein amendment would include it. It would \ngive the Secretary of the Treasury needed authority to require \nmanufacturers of explosive materials to include taggants in their \nproducts. Experts within Federal law enforcement say that the \ntechnology is feasible and appropriate, and President Clinton has asked \nCongress to give the Treasury Department this enhanced authority.\n  The use of taggants has proved to be a highly effective law \nenforcement tool in Switzerland, where the government has already \nimplemented the requirement we are now debating. Swiss law enforcement \nagencies credit taggants with helping them to identify the source of \nthe explosive in 566 bombing incidents over a 10-year period. The Swiss \nwere able to apprehend a greater number of bombing suspects over this \nperiod by taking advantage of this new technology.\n  This amendment provides law enforcement with a needed technique to \ntrace the origin of bombs and arrest and convict the criminals who use \nthem.\n  I commend the Senator from California for her amendment and I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Feinstein amendment to \nrequire the tagging of explosive materials to help law enforcement \nofficials investigate and prevent terrorist bombings.\n  The Hatch substitute amendment contains a very narrow provision that \nwould require the use of taggants in only one narrow category of \nexplosive materials--plastic explosives. This is a mistake. I am \nconvinced that we have the technology available today to introduce \ntaggants in a wide range of explosive materials.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service has informed me that \nSwitzerland had required the inclusion of [[Page S7692]] taggants in \nexplosive materials since at least 1980, when that country's regulation \non explosives was enacted. That law provides, in relevant part:\n\n       [Each] explosive must contain a tagging substance that \n     permits the reliable tracing of the origin [of the explosive] \n     even after the explosion. The tagging substance requires the \n     approval of the Central Office [of the Federal Prosecutor] \n     which must consider changing circumstances.\n\n  The New York Times recently reported that a Minneapolis company is \nalready in the business of manufacturing taggants, which it sells \nprimarily to Switzerland. According to the New York Times, the Swiss \npolice have used these taggants to trace explosives in more than 500 \nbombings and explosives seizure cases over the last 12 years.\n  Mr. President, the technology needed to introduce taggants into \nexplosive materials is neither new nor experimental. We have had the \ntechnology available to us for more than 15 years. As long ago as 1980, \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee considered a provision to \nrequire the use of taggants as part of the Omnibus Antiterrorism Act. \nUnfortunately, the provision was dropped in committee, by an 8 to 7 \nvote.\n  At that time, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Richard Davis \ntestified that technology was already available or would soon be \navailable to tag a wide range of explosive materials. Mr. Davis \nprovided the following timetable: Black powder, October 1979; smokeless \npowder, July 1981; dynamites, water gels and slurries, June 1979; fuse \nand detonating cord, November 1979; detonators, June 1981, label \nmethod, October 1981 (double plug method).\n  In fact, the use of taggants during the testing and research period \npreceding action on the bill produced an arrest and conviction in \nMaryland. As Senators Javits and Percy explained in the committee \nreport:\n\n       In a May 1979 bombing in Spring Point, Maryland in which \n     one man was killed and another injured, investigators \n     searched through the debris and found the explosive used \n     contained taggants as part of a pilot program. The taggants \n     led police to a West Virginia explosives retailer, where they \n     developed a list of suspects. One of those suspects knew the \n     victim, providing a direct link in the chain of evidence. In \n     December 1979, a Baltimore jury convicted James McFillin as \n     being guilty of manslaughter. It was the first time a court \n     had admitted the taggants as evidence. So, there should be no \n     question in anyone's mind that taggants work.\n\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this amendment claim that more study \nis needed before taggants can be used. That is a needless delay. \nTaggants have been tested in this country and--even in the limited \ntest--led to an arrest and conviction. They have been required in \nSwitzerland for more than 12 years, and have proved helpful in hundreds \nof bombing and explosives cases over that period.\n  Taggants are a proven technology which can significantly assist law \nenforcement officials in detecting and deterring terrorist acts. We \nshould not repeat the mistake we made when we deferred action on this \nprovision in 1980. We should act now, by adopting the Feinstein \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I note that no one else is seeking recognition. The hour \nof 6 o'clock is approaching.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is there a time set for the first vote at this \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. By unanimous consent, the time has been \nset for 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The first vote will be on what issue, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table the amendment No. 1202.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Amendment 1202 is the taggant amendment of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from California.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Again, I sincerely hope we do not have to wait for another bombing, \nanother horrendous loss of life, even another day before this body will \nact on an issue that we have debated and discussed since 1973, the \nfirst year that I came here. There is no hidden purpose in this \namendment, none whatsoever.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone would be against \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, Mr. President, say to the Senator from \nDelaware, we are prepared to move a modification to the amendment. We \nrequire unanimous consent to be able to do so. I am hopeful that will \nbe forthcoming.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the majority staff tells me that they are \nchecking with Senator Hatch, who is just off the floor, occupied in \nanother matter at the moment. Also, there is a need in order to get \nunanimous consent to amend the Senator's amendment. There are two other \nindividuals I am told on the Republican side who are being asked to \ncheck off. If we are not able to get them prior to 6 o'clock, I will \nask unanimous consent the vote be postponed for 5 minutes. I will not \ndo that now. Hopefully we will find that out--to give us an opportunity \nto determine whether or not there will be agreement. I hope there will \nbe no disagreement on the Senator's amendment because it makes crystal \nclear we are not intending to deal with small arms, we are not \nintending to deal with those folks who are the stated reason for \nconcern on the part of those who are opposing this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might include in the Record at this time \nperhaps, if the Senator will yield, the Federal Register, volume 60, \nNo. 80, Department of the Treasury. This is a listing of those \nexplosive materials that we are dealing with precisely. So that will be \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Commerce in Explosives; List of Explosive Materials\n\n       Pursuant to the provisions of Section 841(d) of Title 18, \n     United States Code, and 27 CFR 55.23, the Director, Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, must publish and revise at \n     least annually in the Federal Register a list of explosives \n     determined to be within the coverage of 18 U.S.C. Chapter 40, \n     Importation, Manufacture, Distribution and Storage of \n     Explosive Materials. This chapter covers not only explosives, \n     but also blasting agents and detonators, all of which are \n     defined as explosive materials in section 841(c) of Title 18, \n     United States Code. Accordingly, the following is the 1995 \n     List of Explosive Materials subject to regulation under 18 \n     U.S.C. Chapter 40, which includes both the list of explosives \n     (including detonators) required to be published in the \n     Federal Register and blasting agents. The list is intended to \n     also include any and all mixtures containing any of the \n     materials in the list. Materials constituting blasting agents \n     are marked by an asterisk. While the list is comprehensive, \n     it is not all inclusive. The fact that an explosive material \n     may not be on the list does not mean that it is not within \n     the coverage of the law if it otherwise meets the statutory \n     definitions in section 841 of Title 18, United States Code. \n     Explosive materials are listed alphabetically by their common \n     names followed by chemical names and synonyms in brackets. \n     This revised list supersedes the List of Explosive Materials \n     dated January 7, 1994, (59 FR 1056) and will be effective as \n     of the date of publication in the Federal Register.\n     Acetylides of heavy metals.\n     Aluminum containing polymeric propellant.\n     Aluminum ophorite explosive.\n     Amatex.\n     Amatol.\n     Ammonal.\n     Ammonium nitrate explosive mixtures (cap sensitive).\n     *Ammonium nitrate explosive mixtures (non cap sensitive)\n     Aromatic nitro-compound explosive mixtures.\n     Ammonium perchlorate explosive mixtures.\n     Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant:\n     Ammonium picrate [picrate of ammonia, Explosive D].\n     Ammonium salt lattice with isomorphously substituted \n         inorganic salts.\n     *ANFO [ammonium nitrate-fuel oil].\n     Baratol.\n     Baronol.\n     BEAF [1,2-bis(2,2-difluoro-2-nitroacetoxy- \n         ethane)].\n     Black powder.\n     Black powder based explosive mixtures.\n     *Blasting agents, nitro-carbo-nitrates, including non cap \n         sensitive slurry and water-gel explosives.\n     Blasting caps.\n     Blasting gelatin.\n     Blasting powder.\n     BTNEC [(bis (trinitroethyl) carbonate].\n     Bulk salutes.\n     BTNEN [(bis (trinitroethyl) nitramine].\n     BTTN (1,2,4 butanetriol trinitrate.\n     Butyl tetryl.\n     Calcium nitrate explosive mixtures.\n     Cellulose hexanitrate explosive mixture.\n     Chlorate explosive mixtures.\n     Composition A and variations.\n     Composition B and variations.\n     Composition C and variations.\n     Copper acetylide.\n     Cyanuric triazide.\n     Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine [RDX].\n     Cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine [HMX].\n     Cyclonite [RDX].\n     Cyclotol.

Such study may \n     include, if appropriate, recommendations for legisation.\n       (b) There are authorized to be appropriated for the study \n     and recommendations contained in paragraph (a) such sums as \n     may be necessary.\n       (c) Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after subsection (k), a new subsection (1) which \n     reads as follows:\n       ``(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, \n     import, ship, transport, receive, possess, transfer, or \n     distribute any explosive material that does not contain a \n     tracer element as prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to \n     regulation, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe \n     that the explosive material does not contain the required \n     tracer element.''.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, explosive material \n     does not include smokeless or black powder manufactured for \n     uses set forth in section 845(a)(4)(5) of this chapter.''\n       (d) Section 844, of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after ``(a) through (i)'' the phrase \n     ``and (1).''.\n       (e) Section 846 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by designating the present section as ``(a),'' and by adding \n     a new subsection (b) reading as follows: ``(b) to facilitate \n     the enforcement of this chapter the Secretary shall, within 6 \n     months after submission of the study required by subsection \n     (a), promulgate regulations for the addition of tracer \n     elements to explosive materials manufactured in or imported \n     into the United States. Tracer elements to be added to \n     explosive materials under provisions of this subsection shall \n     be of such character and in such quantity as the Secretary \n     may authorize or require, and such as will not substantially \n     impair the quality of the explosive materials for their \n     intended lawful use, adversely affect the safety of these \n     explosives, or have a substantially adverse effect on the \n     environment.''.\n       (f) The penalties provided herein shall not take effect \n     until ninety days after the date of promulgation of the \n     regulations provided for herein.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that my motion to table the \nmodified Feinstein amendment be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Vote on Amendment No. 1202, as modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \n1202, as modified, offered by the Senator from California [Mrs. \nFeinstein]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nFaircloth], the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the Senator from \nOregon, [Mr. Hatfield], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], and the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. \nMurkowski] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], \nthe Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. \nLeahy], and the Senator from Washington [Mr. Murray] are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nJersey, [Mr. Bradley] and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] would \neach vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 90, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 234 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--90\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--10\n\n     Bradley\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Hatfield\n     Jeffords\n     Kerrey\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n  So the amendment (No. 1202), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1207 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1207) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand we can accept a few of the \namendments. Senator Dole has informed Members that is the last vote of \nthe day.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are trying to clear additional \namendments.\n  We are prepared to accept the Pressler amendment, renaming a Federal \nbuilding in his State. We are seeing whether we can clear additional \namendments.\n  While I have the floor, let me ask, the Senator from California, \nSenator Boxer, was prepared to go with her amendment tonight, but since \nthat was the last vote, I would like to ask whether or not the chairman \nwould object to her being the first amendment tomorrow?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection to that. Why do we not schedule that \nright before the caucus meetings tomorrow?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, that is perfect.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would be prepared to move Senator \nPressler's amendment regarding renaming the Federal building, if that \nis appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two Pressler amendments.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I was referring to the Pressler amendment \nrenaming a Federal building. It is amendment numbered 1204. However, I \nhave just been informed by the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction that he would like an opportunity to look at that. \nTherefore, I withdraw my request to act on Pressler amendment numbered \n1204.\n  What I am saying is we do not have an amendment to clear at the \nmoment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not have any authority to set a vote \non the [[Page S7695]] Boxer amendment. I think we have to look at the \namendment and go from there. Hopefully, that can be the first vote, if \nwe can work it out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that the pending \namendment is No. 1206, offered by the Senator from Utah on behalf of \nSenator Specter.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, maybe we can accept that amendment if \nit is permissible on the part of the minority.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there are two committee members that have a \nhold on this amendment. I am not sure it will not be able to be \naccepted, but I cannot clear it at this moment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1204\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator who had objected to moving to \nconsider Pressler amendment numbered 1204 has now withdrawn his \nobjection.\n  We, on the Democratic side, are prepared to accept Pressler amendment \nnumbered 1204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1204) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware is prepared to accept the Smith amendment, which appears to be \na technical amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, at this moment, we are trying to clear the \nSmith amendment and several others. I am not in a position to clear any \namendment at this moment. We are running that down right now.\n  If the Senator could withhold for a few minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the managers have been accepting some of \nthese amendments. I would like to get some idea of how many are left.\n  We started off this morning with 99, and I do not know whether we are \ndown to 90, 85, 25, or 10. There will be a cloture vote. If we cannot \nget consent to vote tomorrow, it will be early on Wednesday morning.\n  One way or the other, we are going to dispose of this bill. If people \nare not willing to offer their amendments, we cannot work them out--it \nis only 6:30 and we thought we would be here late tonight. Obviously, \nno one wants to stay.\n  The President says he wants the bill passed. But this is all he says, \n``I want the bill passed.'' We need some action. Tomorrow we will have \na full day. We are not going to dispose of the 99 amendments tomorrow \nor 85 or 75 amendments. We would be prepared to exchange lists. We have \nbeen able to eliminate many of ours. If the Democrats are willing to \ngive what they have, we will know if we have a chance of completing \nthis tomorrow. If not, I would like to move to the telecommunications \nbill.\n  We have accepted four or five minor amendments. That is about all we \nhave gotten today. I am glad we accepted those rather than have 95-0 \nvotes. Some of our colleagues returned today thinking there would be \nmultiple votes. I obviously cannot manufacture votes, unless we just \nhave Sergeant-at-Arms votes. I am not trying to punish anybody. We need \nto finish this bill, the President says so. Everybody says so.\n  How many amendments do we have left: 80? 50? 60? 100?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I think we \nhave about 20 amendments left. I expect that by midday tomorrow we will \nhave fewer than that left.\n  I might point out to the majority leader that two of the four \namendments accepted, when we met last, there was no possibility of them \nbeing accepted. They were two of the six major amendments that the \nDemocratic side felt were essential to be included in the Republican \ncore bill.\n  Although we did accept them and they turned out to be overwhelming \nvotes--taggants--when I spoke this time before we adjourned, I said the \ntaggant amendment and the amendment that the Senator from California \nhad regarding the distribution of material on how to build explosive \ndevices were two of the most contentious amendments,\n and they were so advertised at the time. They had been worked out \nthrough the cooperation of Senator Hatch and the Republican side. So I \ndo not want the Senator, the leader, to think we have only been dealing \nwith those things, with the easiest things on the list. The big items \nleft on the list are some gun-related amendments and the habeas corpus \namendments. We are ready to go at those starting first thing in the \nmorning. I imagine we will be joined, for example, by the Senator from \nNew Jersey, who has an amendment on doing away with the $25 million \nprogram the Defense Department makes available for ammunition for \ntarget practice. He is willing to agree to a half-hour on that \namendment. I do not think we are going to take very much time on the \nremaining very controversial amendments.\n\n  I cannot say to the Senator what one or two people on either side may \ndo based on what the final outcome of the habeas corpus vote is, or a \ngun vote is. I do not know. But I think disposing of the amendments \nwill go relatively quickly and I think we will be able to get time \nagreements on almost all of them.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me just reply. We understand we have \nmaybe five amendments. The Senator is saying he has, still, 20 on that \nside?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask my staff how many amendments we have on the \nDemocratic side left?\n  I am told we have 15 to 20. We can give a closer estimate, but I \nsuspect at least a third of those amendments are place holders that are \nnot likely to be moved at all. But one thing for sure, the list is \ndecreasing, not increasing.\n  I was asked by the Democratic leader if we thought we could finish \nthis bill by tomorrow night. I believe we can finish it by tomorrow \nnight, at least the amendments by tomorrow night. Hopefully we will not \nmove into Wednesday on this legislation. I certainly want to move it. \nThus far I have seen cooperation on both sides to move contentious \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the ranking member and \nchairman on the work they have done on the last couple of legislative \ndays we have been on this bill. This is really just the second day we \nhave been on the bill. As everyone recalls, this is not a piece of \nlegislation that went through committee. We did not have the \nopportunity to review any of it in a committee. So even though the \nissue was subject to hearings, there was no specific hearing on this \nparticular bill. We only had the opportunity to see it about a day \nprior to the time we recessed. Everyone now has, clearly, read the bill \nand had the opportunity to study it. So as a result, I think some of \nthe amendments that were anticipated may no longer be required.\n  But this is not a simple bill. This is not a small matter. This is a \nfar-reaching piece of legislation that deserves our consideration. I \nthink, given that, it is all the more remarkable that perhaps in a \nperiod of the next 48 hours, maybe less than that, substantially less \nthan that, we will be able to complete our work.\n  Senators have legitimate concerns that have to be addressed in the \nform of amendments. They will be addressed. They are cooperating on our \nside. As the ranking member said, I think there is a reasonable \nexpectation we can bring that list down even more. People are \ncooperating, and I think together we can work this thing through and be \nfinished certainly within the next couple of days at the latest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader. I hope that \nis an accurate assessment. We would like to finish the bill tomorrow \nnight and start on telecommunications on [[Page S7696]] Wednesday. I \nmade promises, in effect, to Senators Pressler and Hollings that we \nwould take it up. I am not certain we will even have five amendments \noffered. This is a bill the President wants very much. It would seem to \nme, on the other side, if they have 20 amendments, maybe they would be \nwilling to forgo offering all those on this bill unless they relate to \nthis bill or toughen this bill or somehow strengthen this bill.\n  It is important legislation, there is no question about it. Nobody \nknows how important it is any more than the Presiding Officer, Senator \nInhofe, and Senator Nickles, from Oklahoma. We want to look back on it \na year from now and say we did the right thing, we just did not do \nsomething in the emotion of the moment that might infringe on \nsomebody's constitutional rights a year from now or 10 years from now.\n  But I think there is basic agreement. As I just listen to the two \nmanagers here it seems to me Senator Biden and Senator Hatch have a \npretty good grip on what they would like to accomplish. Hopefully we \nwill work together tomorrow. Maybe we can get it done tomorrow night, \nlate.\n  We did not quite get it done on Memorial Day but at least we made the \neffort. There is no way you can complete it with 97 amendments out \nthere, 67 on that side and 30-some on this side. So we have it down to \na total of 20. Maybe some of those are not--I do not say they are not \nserious amendments--maybe what we call around here, place holders.\n  It seems to me if we start fairly early tomorrow morning we can \ncomplete action on the bill tomorrow night.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I hope so.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is that possible?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think that is true. Again, I do not think \nwe are going to have trouble finishing the amendments. I think the \noutcome of the amendments may affect what one or two people on your \nside or one or two people on my side might end up doing. But my guess \nthere as well is if we finish these amendments we will go to final \npassage and there will not be much in the way of that. But I cannot \nmake a promise to the leader on that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Is there anything else to do this evening? Any other \namendments that can be dealt with?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it is better for us this evening to work on what \nwe are going to do tomorrow, come in early and do our very best to \nfinish this by tomorrow night. I really appreciate the good will on the \npart of the minority here to work with us and get this done. But I \nwould like to finish it by tomorrow night if we can. If it means \ngetting into the habeas amendments pretty early tomorrow, it means \ngetting into the difficult amendments.\n  Hopefully, once we resolve those one way or the other, we can move \nahead to final passage.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question? Shall the Senator \nbe here prepared at 9:45 to offer the amendment? Can we perhaps \nincorporate that into a unanimous consent so we can make sure it is the \nbusiness at hand?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the first amendment \ntomorrow be the amendment of the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest to my distinguished colleague from California, \nif she will work with us on the amendment it might not be as difficult \nas it might be. So I would like to chat with her and see what we can \ndo.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7658-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXTENDED USE OF MEDICARE SELECTED POLICIES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to enhance fairness in compensating owners of patents \nused by the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION ENHANCING FAIRNESS IN THE COMPENSATION OF PATENT OWNERS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \nprovide fairness to our Nation's inventors. As the law is now written, \ninventors whose patents are taken for use by the Federal Government \nhave only one recourse to obtain compensation--they are compelled by \nstatute to bring a lawsuit against the Government. Under court \ninterpretations, they are forced to bear all costs of the lawsuit, even \nwhen they win their case. This bill would permit patent holders whose \nclaims are upheld to be reimbursed, as well, for their reasonable \ncosts.\n  In 1982, when the U.S. Claims Court was created, the Congress made \nsignificant improvements in the existing law concerning claims against \nthe Government. It did not, however, give consideration to the fairness \nof the existing statutes that require payment of compensation to \npersons whose patent rights are taken for national defense or other \npurposes. The Congress simply carried over the existing provisions of \nsection 1498(a) of title 28, requiring ``reasonable and entire \ncompensation'' for the taking of patent rights. Those provisions--fair \non the surface--dated from the time of World War I. In the years since \nWorld War I, however, the statutory language has been applied by the \ncourts in a manner that produces a serious inequity.\n  The problem arises most frequently in cases involving an inventor \nwhose rights have been infringed by a defense contractor. In such a \ncase, the statute provides that the inventor's only remedy is an action \nin the U.S. Claims Court against the Government--the beneficiary of the \ndefense contractor's infringement--on the theory that, indirectly, the \nGovernment has taken the patent rights for public use.\n  The Government is authorized to take private property, for the \nbenefit of the public, under the power of ``eminent domain.'' It may do \nso, however, only upon paying the ``just compensation'' required by the \nfifth amendment to the Constitution. The principle applies to the \ntaking of intellectual property--like patents--as well as tangible \nproperty. Statutory application of this principle to the taking of \npatent rights is found in the part of section 1498(a) of Title 28 that \nprovides:\n\n       Whenever an invention . . . covered by a patent . . . is \n     used . . . by . . . the United States without a license of \n     the owner . . ., the owner's remedy shall be by action \n     against the United States in the United States Claims Court \n     for the recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation \n     for such use. . . .\n\n  It might logically be supposed that the constitutional requirements \nof ``just compensation'' and the statutory requirements of ``reasonable \nand entire compensation'' would assure that an inventor will not suffer \na loss when the Government takes his invention for public use. \nUnfortunately, logic and practice do not always keep pace with one \nanother. The inventor does suffer loss--the costs of his lawsuit--and \nthat loss can be significant.\n  The current situation may be summarized as follows: In order to \nobtain any compensation at all under section 1498, an inventor must \ninitiate a lawsuit against the Government. After succeeding in such a \nsuit, he becomes entitled to receive ``reasonable and entire \ncompensation.'' But the inventor then finds that, under current court \ninterpretations, he cannot recover any of the expenses, including the \nwitnesses' travel costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, that he \nincurred as a result of having to pursue the civil action. The expenses \nare, in effect, deducted from that sum established to be fair \ncompensation. In short, Government requires the victim of its taking to \nsue to recover his losses, forces him personally to bear all his costs \nin undertaking the suit, and leaves him with compensation that \nrepresents less than the true value of the property taken. This result \nis less than ``just'' and certainly is less than ``reasonable and \nentire.''\n  The courts have generally taken the position that if Congress had \nintended to include reimbursement of reasonable costs and attorneys' \nfees within the term ``reasonable and entire compensation'' it should \nhave said so specifically.\n  That is what this bill does--it says so specifically. It would \nauthorize expressly the recovery of reasonable costs by an inventor who \nis forced by statute to litigate against the Government in order to \nobtain compensation. It would permit the inventor to recover all his \nreasonable costs--including witnesses' fees and travel costs, \nattorneys' fees, charges by accountants and other experts, costs of \nemployee time in reviewing records and otherwise preparing for the \nsuit, court costs, and all related expenditures incurred as a result of \nbringing the lawsuit. The costs in each case would be scrutinized by \nthe Claims Courts to assure that they were reasonable, of course, but \nto the extent they were reasonable they could be recovered.\n  This problem should have been corrected long ago--when it first \nbecame apparent that court interpretations would not permit inventors \nto obtain a complete recovery. To continue this inequity would be a \nserious disservice to some of our most productive inventors, and to \nsome of our best companies in important industries. We need to be fair \nwith those inventors and companies in order to encourage innovation and \nmake our country more competitive. This bill would help assure the \nnecessary fairness.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRYOR (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 881. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nprovisions relating to church pension benefit plans, to modify certain \nprovisions relating to participants in such plans, to reduce the \ncomplexity of and to bring workable consistency to the applicable \nrules, to promote retirement savings and benefits, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             church retirement benefits simplification act\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Church \nRetirement Benefits Simplification Act of 1995, legislation which I \nalso introduced and held hearings on in the 101st, 102d, and 103d \nCongresses. This act provides much needed clarification of the rules \nthat apply to church retirement and welfare benefit plans and brings \nconsistency to those rules. In addition, the act resolves significant \nproblems churches face in administering their retirement and welfare \nbenefit programs under current law.\n  In developing this important legislation, we have worked closely with \nleaders of the pension boards of 30 mainline Protestant and Jewish \ndenominations and a Catholic religious order. The employee benefit \nprograms of these mainline denominations and order are among the oldest \nprograms in our country. Several date from the 1700's, and their median \nage is in excess of 50 years. These programs provide retirement and \nwelfare benefits for several hundred thousand clergy and lay workers \nemployed by thousands of churches and church ministry organizations \nserving the spiritual needs of literally millions of members.\n  Church retirement benefits programs began in recognition of a \ndenomination's mission to care for its church workers in their advanced \nyears. Several church retirement and welfare benefit programs were \ninitially formed to provide relief and benefits for retired, disabled, \nor impoverished ministers and families as particular cases of need were \nidentified. As time passed, church denomination began to provide for \nthe retirement needs of their ministers and lay workers on a current \nand [[Page S7698]] systematic basis. Today, church retirement and \nwelfare benefit programs provide benefits for ministers and lay workers \nemployed in all forms of pastoral, healing, teaching, and preaching \nministries and missions, including, among others, local churches, \nseminaries, old-age homes, orphanages, mission societies, hospitals, \nuniversities, church camps and day care centers.\n  Mr. President, the goal of the act is to clarify the rules that apply \nto church employee benefit plans. Under current law, these rules are \ngenerally lengthy and complex and are, for the most part, designed for \nfor-profit, commercial employers. Most denominations are composed of \nthousands of work units, each having only a few employees, and the \nbudgets of these work units are marginal at best. These organizations \nrely almost completely on contributions from the offering plate to \nsupport their missions, including the salaries and retirement and \nwelfare benefits of their ministers and lay workers. Unlike for-profit \nbusiness entities, churches cannot pass operating costs on to customers \nby raising prices.\n  Churches are also much more loosely structured than most for-profit \nbusiness organizations, and many denominations cannot impose \nrequirements on their constituent parts. For example, hierarchically \norganized denominations may be able to control the provision of \nemployee benefits to ministers and lay workers, while in congregational \ndenominations, such control is typically more difficult.\n  In addition, churches are tax-exempt and, unlike for-profit business \norganizations, have no need for tax deductions. Churches and church \nministry organizations therefore lack the incentive of for-profit \nemployers to maximize either the amount of the employer's\n tax deduction or the amount of income which the highly compensated \nemployees who control a for-profit business can shelter from current \ntaxation through plan contributions and tax-free fringe or welfare \nbenefits.\n\n  Mr. President, retirement and employee benefit tax laws do not always \ntake the difference between churches and for-profit employers into \naccount, with the result that churches have had to divert a significant \namount of time and resources from their religious mission and \nministries in attempting to identify and comply with rules that in many \ninstances are unworkable or simply not needed for church employee \nbenefit plans.\n  If the act becomes law, the reduction in administrative burdens and \nconsequent savings in related costs now imposed on churches and church \nministry organizations will outweigh any possible gain from an employee \nbenefits policy perspective. Unlike the for-profit sector where cost \nsavings result in a better bottom line for shareholders, savings in the \nchurch sector will find their way into missions and ministries that \nhelp people who need help.\n  A 1993 study by Independent Sector, a national membership \norganization composed of over 600 tax-exempt organizations and \ncorporate philanthropy departments, indicated that approximately half \nthe funds contributed to churches is used in service to others. \nReligious congregations are the primary voluntary service providers for \nneighborhoods. Ninety-two percent of religious congregations have one \nor more programs in human services. Three-fifths of religious \ncongregations offer family counseling, and more than one-third--almost \n40 percent--give means or shelter to the poor. Some 74 percent donate \nfor international relief or missionary activity, and almost 90 percent \nsponsor hospices, health programs, hospitals, or provide for the \ndisabled, retarded, or people in crises. The Independent Sector study \nindicated that in 1991 religious congregations made $6.6 billion in \ndirect grants to other groups and gave $15.9 billion for education, \nhuman services and health programs. These figures are well beyond the \ngiving of all U.S. foundations and corporations combined.\n  It is my view that the Congress should do everything possible to \nensure that churches can continue to maximize their contributions \ntoward these important missions and ministries, rather than paying for \ncosts of complying with rules that are unworkable or not needed for \nchurch employee benefit plans.\n  The cornerstone of the act is a recodification of the rules \napplicable to church retirement plans so that all of such rules in the \nInternal Revenue Code are identified, simplified, and separated from \nthe rules that apply to for-profit employers. Retirement plan issues \nunique to churches will thus not be inadvertently affected when \nCongress is considering future Code changes which are applicable to \nfor-profit employers but not appropriate for churches.\n  The act would also ensure that church retirement plans, whether \ndescribed in the new proposed section 401A--applicable only to those \nchurch section 401(a) plans that affirmatively decide to be subject to \nit--or section 403(b), are subject to the same coverage and related \nrules. In 1986, Congress determined that the section 403(b) plans of \nchurches and so-called qualified church controlled organizations should \nnot be subjected to coverage and related rules. The act would extend \nthis same relief to church section 401(a) plans and would also \neliminate the troublesome qualified church controlled organization\n approach in favor of a provision that only subjects church-related \nhospitals and universities to applicable coverage and related rules. \nThe act, consistent with the law that now applies to church section \n401(a) plans, would also clarify that the coverage rules that will \napply to the section 403(b) programs of church-related hospitals and \nuniversities are those that were applicable prior to the enactment of \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n\n  The act also would resolve a number of other problems many church \npension boards face under current law. For example, under present law \nthere is a question as to whether self-employed ministers and chaplains \nwho work for nonchurch employers are able to participate in their \ndenomination's retirement and welfare benefit programs. The act would \nmake it clear that such ministers may participate in such programs.\n  The act would also:\n  Make it clear that the portion of a retired minister's pension which \nis treated as parsonage allowance is not subject to Self Employment \nContribution Act, or SECA, taxes;\n  For the first time, subject church plans to definite, objective \nvesting schedules;\n  Solve several church employer aggregation problems;\n  Provide relief that will result in better retirement income for \nforeign missionaries;\n  Simplify the required distribution rules that apply to church \nretirement plans;\n  Eliminate an unworkable requirement under the so-called section \n403(b) catch-up contribution rules; and\n  Make relief granted under section 457 consistent with coverage relief \nproposed for church retirement and welfare benefit plans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 881\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building at 1314 LeMay \nBoulevard, Ellsworth Air Force Base, SD, as the ``Cartney Koch McRaven \nChild Development Center'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n             cartney koch mcraven child development center\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation \ntoday along with my South Dakota colleague, Senator Daschle to \ndesignate the child development center at Ellsworth Air Force Base in \nSouth Dakota as the Cartney Koch McRaven Child Development Center.\n  It was just slightly more than a month ago that terrorist thugs \nbombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. Among \nthe victims inside was Cartney Koch McRaven. Stationed at Tinker Air \nForce Base and having just been married the previous weekend, Cartney \nwas in the Murrah Federal Building to register her new married name on \nFederal documents. Tragically, her life was cut short by the savagery \nof domestic terrorism.\n  It is only fitting that we honor Cartney at Ellsworth Air Force Base. \nSpearfish was her home. And she chose to begin her adult life by \njoining the Air Force and serving her country. And serve she did, with \nhonor, with devotion, with dignity.\n  It is even more fitting that her name appear on the child development \ncenter at Ellsworth. Airman First Class Cartney Koch McRaven served in \nHaiti, where the stark poverty had an enormous impact on her. Cartney's \nheart went out to the children of Haiti. She devoted her time in Haiti \nto an orphanage, offering a warm smile and a kind, loving word to young \nfaces. The mission of our Armed Forces in Haiti was to ensure peace and \noffer hope to the people of Haiti--young and old. Cartney took her \nmission to heart.\n  Even her family honored Cartney's commitment to young people by \nurging that donations be made in Cartney's memory to the orphanage in \nHaiti.\n  But we do more than honor a person. We honor the values she \npersonified and practiced in her daily life. The values of service, of \nduty, of compassion and caring for the underprivileged young--values \nthat are at the core of South Dakota and of America.\n  It is my hope that by passing this legislation, Cartney Koch McRaven \nforever will be remembered as a symbol of these core values and an \ninspiration to the young people in South Dakota and America to honor \nand serve their family, community, and country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation introduced today by myself and Senator Daschle appear in \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF CARTNEY KOCH MCRAVEN CHILD \n                   DEVELOPMENT CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal building at 1314 LeMay \n     Boulevard, Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, shall be \n     known and designated as the ``Cartney Koch McRaven Child \n     Development Center''.\n       (b) Replacement Building.--If, after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, a new Federal building is built at the location \n     described in subsection (a) to replace the building described \n     in the subsection, the new Federal building shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Cartney Koch McRaven Child \n     Development Center''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to a Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         SENATE RESOLUTION 128--RELATIVE TO BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 128\n\n       Whereas Article I, Section 8 of the United States \n     Constitution provides that Congress shall have the sole power \n     to declare war;\n       Whereas the Senate adopted S. Res. 330 on August 11, 1992, \n     which stated that it was the sense of the Senate that no \n     United States military personnel shall be introduced into \n     combat or potential combat situations without clearly defined \n     objectives and sufficient resources to achieve those \n     objectives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the President is not authorized to use the \n     United States Ground Forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina unless--\n       (1) the use of United States ground forces in Bosnia-\n     Hercegovina is authorized in advance by Congress; or\n       (2) the deployment of forces of the United States ground \n     forces into Bosnia-Hercegovina is vital to the national \n     security interests of the United States (including the \n     protection of American citizens in Bosnia-Hercegovina), there \n     is not sufficient time to seek and receive Congressional \n     authorization, and the President reports as soon as \n     practicable to Congress after the initiation of the \n     deployment, but in no case later than 48 hours after the \n     initiation of the deployment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a \nresolution which would prohibit the President from using ground forces \nin Bosnia without prior consent of the Congress because, in my view, \nthere is ample time for the Congress of the United States to deliberate \non this matter and to make a decision. And such a resolution, I submit, \nis necessary as a constitutional matter to preserve the constitutional \nprerogatives of the Congress and really to stop further erosion by the \nexecutive branch.\n  The events of the past week in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been very, \nvery disturbing, as they have been for the better part of 2 to 3 years \nnow. As I have said on the floor of the U.S. Senate in the past, it is \nmy view that the mission of the U.N. peacekeepers was realistically \nMission Impossible because there was no peace to keep. In the past I \nhave supported the resolutions and the amendments on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Moslems could \ndefend themselves in accordance with article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\n  We have had the position taken by the President in a speech last week \nat the Air Force Academy where he has said that U.S. forces would be \nused to relocate U.N. peacekeepers, sent on a temporary basis. But we \nknow, as a practical matter, what happens when there is temporary \naction taken.\n  There has been consistent analysis of the terrain in Bosnia, and \nfighting of a ground war there is on absolute marsh and swamp, and we \nare realistically unable to undertake that without assurances that it \nis to be done on a limited basis.\n  It is my view that, before there ought to be an entry by the United \nStates of our own ground forces, we ought to have an exit plan as well; \nthat, realistically viewed, the United States does not have vital \nnational interests at stake there on this state of the record; that \nbefore even consideration ought to be given there ought to be a \ncomprehensive plan; and that there ought to be a detailed statement as \nto what the European participation would be because it is much more in \ntheir interest than ours. These matters ought to be submitted--Mr. \nPresident, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There ought to be a comprehensive plan, we ought to know \nexactly what has happened, and the matter ought to be deliberated upon \nand voted upon by the Congress of the United States.\n  We have seen an erosion of constitutional authority of the U.S. \nCongress as the sole agent which is authorized to involve the United \nStates in war. We fought a war in Korea without constitutional \nauthorization. We fought a war in Vietnam without constitutional \nauthorization. And these matters ought to come to the Congress unless \nthere is an emergency, and on the face of the resolution which I have \nproposed the President could use the deployment of forces if there is a \nsituation ``vital to the national security interests of the United \nStates, including the protection of American citizens in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina where there is not sufficient time to seek and receive \ncongressional authorization,'' and then the President report as soon as \npractical to the Congress of the United States.\n  When the use of force was authorized in the Gulf, that was done only \nafter the matter was brought to the floor of the U.S. Congress, the \nU.S. Senate. We had extensive debate going on on this floor on January \n10, 11, and 12, 1991 when there was a resolution passed by the Senate \nauthorizing the use of force by a 52-to-47 vote, and a similar \nresolution of authorization was passed by the House of Representatives.\n  But until and unless the Congress makes that decision reflecting the \nwill of the American people, it is my view that there ought not to be \nthe use of ground forces in Bosnia.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7703-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7703-S7705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 COMPREHENSIVE TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT NO. 1202\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1199, proposed \nby Mr. Hatch, to the bill (S. 735) to prevent and punish acts of \nterrorism, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 152, strike line 6 through line 17 on page 153, and \n     insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

RAYMOND W. O'KEEFE, U.S. ARMY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate \nCol. Raymond W. O'Keefe, a native son of Maine, who retired from the \nU.S. Army on June 1, 1995, after a distinguished career of faithful \nservice to our Nation spanning 26 years. Throughout those 26 years of \nservice, Ray O'Keefe exemplified the true spirit of the United States \ncavalryman: ``honor was his guide, resourcefulness his strength, and a \npassion for duty was his chief characteristic.''\n  Colonel O'Keefe was commissioned through the Reserve Officers' \nTraining Corps as a second lieutenant in the Regular Army following his \ngraduation from the University of Maine at Orono in June 1969. Over the \ncourse of his career, Colonel O'Keefe served in a variety of \nchallenging troop and staff assignments in the United States, Germany, \nKorea, and Vietnam. Following completion of the Armor Officer's Basic \nCourse at Fort Knox, then-Lieutenant O'Keefe reported for duty with the \n1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry, assigned to the elite 82nd Airborne \nDivision, at Fort Bragg, NC. Lieutenant O'Keefe practiced his craft and \nhoned his skills while serving in a variety of positions at the troop \nlevel.\n  He arrived in Pleiku, in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, in \nDecember of 1971, and assumed command of D Troop, 17th Cavalry. the Ia \nDrang Valley, sight of one of the first large battles of the war, was \nonly thirty miles distant. One of the last major fights of the war, the \nEaster Offensive in March, \n[[Page S7706]] 1972, involved this same area, and Ray O'Keefe was \nthere.\n  His next assignment brought him to a post well-known in the annals of \ncavalry lore--Fort Riley, KS--the birthplace of the famous 7th Cavalry \nRegiment. Already an experienced combat veteran, Ray served with \ndistinction as a troop commander and operations officer with the 1st \nSquadron, 4th Cavalry, refining his skills, coaching, and teaching the \ncavalrymen and officers entrusted to his care.\n  Obviously, Ray O'Keefe stood out from his peers, for as an armor \nofficer he was selected to attend Infantry Officers Advanced Course at \nthe U.S. Army Infantry School. Selection to an advanced course of \nanother branch is an indication that an officer has mastered his basic \nbranch skills and is being groomed for positions of much greater \nresponsibility. His follow-on assignment as a staff plans officer with \nthe Joint Personnel Staff at Headquarters, 8th U.S. Army, in Yong San, \nKorea, underscored the high regard in which he was held by his \nsuperiors. The assignment provided Ray valuable experience working with \nsenior officers and those of the other Services and would serve him \nwell in future assignments.\n  Following promotion to major ahead of his peers, and with a Master of \nScience degree in Educational Administration in hand, Ray O'Keefe \nreturned to New England. Assigned as the Assistant Professor of \nMilitary Science at the University of New Hampshire, he excelled as an \ninstructor of young men and women. Those entrusted with attracting and \ndeveloping our Army's future leaders have a particularly important \nresponsibility. Ray O'Keefe truly understood this responsibility and \nmore than met the challenge.\n  As a field grade officer, Ray continued with his service in a series \nof increasingly challenging assignments, this time in Germany. The cold \nwar was at its height, and deterrence was the keystone of our defense \npolicy. Trained and ready, Army forces provided NATO's first line of \ndefense in Europe against the Warsaw Pact. Serving 1 year as executive \nofficer of the 4th Battalion, 64th Armor, in Aschaffenburg, followed by \nalmost 3 years on the Operations and Plans staff of the 3rd Infantry \nDivision in Wurzburg, then-Major O'Keefe was instrumental in \nsuccessfully bringing the M1 Abrams main battle tank to the division. \nPersonally selected by the commanding general as chief of training for \nthe division, Ray soon became the recognized expert in Europe on \nfielding and training for the M1 tank.\n  Battalion command is a challenge reserved for only the Army's most \ncapable and most promising officers. In June of 1984, then-Lieutenant \nColonel O'Keefe's demonstrated performance and potential resulted in \nhis selection to command the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, a unit rich \ntradition. From its battalion colors fly streamers emblazoned with \nnames we associate with gallantry, courage, sacrifice: Little Big Horn, \nLeyte, Korea. Equipped with tanks, helicopters, armored personnel \ncarriers, and artillery, the division cavalry squadron is perhaps one \nof the most lethal fighting organizations within the Army and one of \nthe most challenging to effectively command. Its mission was one of the \ncold war's most difficult and sensitive--patrolling the border between \nfreedom and tyranny in Europe. Under Ray O'Keefe's expert hand, the \ntroopers of the 3rd Squadron patrolled the intra-German border 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week. Tough, realistic training and competent, \nconfident leadership were rewarded in 1985 when the 3rd Squadron \ncaptured the prestigious Flynn Cup, awarded to the best border squadron \nin the VII Corps. Through sustained superior performance, Ray O'Keefe \nproved he had what it took to command and care for 1,200 soldiers and \ntheir families.\n  The Joint Staff provided Ray O'Keefe another opportunity to excel. \nAssigned as Chief of the Operations, Training, and Exercise Branch in \nthe National Military Command Center, he played a key role in every \nworld crisis for almost 2 years. Colonel O'Keefe developed and wrote \nthe required operational concept for what was to become the automated \nCrisis Management System, now the heart of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \ncrisis management response. The impact of this contribution to our \nNation cannot be overstated.\n  Colonel O'Keefe culminated his service as Chief, Congressional \nActivities Division, Office of the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army. In this \ncapacity, Ray once again set the standard preparing senior Army \nleadership for their personal interactions with Congress, including \nconfirmations, congressional testimony, and meetings with Members of \nCongress. Ray also supervised preparation and publication of the Army's \nannual Posture Statement and Focus periodical. Both General Sullivan \nand Secretary West have come to rely on Ray O'Keefe's sound judgment, \nkeen insight, and sage advice. In this assignment, as in all the others \nthroughout his career, Ray has been in the vanguard working to ensure \nthat America's Army maintains, the warrior's edge.\n  Col. Raymond W. O'Keefe is indeed the quintessential leader. His \nselfless service, commitment to excellence, and caring professionalism \nhave continually provided inspiration to those with whom he has served. \nThis exceptional officer truly personifies those traits of courage, \ncompetency, and integrity that our Nation has come to expect from our \nArmy officers. When he was needed, he was there. He has served our \nNation well, and our heartfelt appreciation and best wishes for \ncontinued success go with him.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7705-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7706-S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE BUDGET RESOLUTION FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I was forced to cast my vote \nagainst the budget resolution for the upcoming fiscal year.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I take seriously my \nresponsibilities to form and oversee our Nation's budget. Accordingly, \nI believe the budget resolution is one of the most important documents \nproduced by the Congress each year.\n  This resolution is critical legislation because it sets our Nation's \npriorities. It steers our economic policies. And, it carries weight \nwith the American people.\n  I believe this process should be used to give the American people \nhope. The American people deserve a sound budget, which reflects their \nspending priorities. And, they deserve economic security in youth as \nwell as in older years.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this budget fulfills none of these \nrequirements. It is truly the worst of slash and burn politics. It is \nmisguided economic policy. It robs our constituents of hope and our \nchildren of their future.\n  Mr. President, our colleagues offered a number of amendments which \nwould have gone a long way to improve this bill.\n  I must say, Mr. President, I was pleased that a strong bipartisan \ncoalition of Senators supported a sense of the Senate measure I offered \non impact aid. Impact aid is critical educational assistance for our \nfederally impacted school districts. I hope my amendment will ensure \nthat the Federal Government lives up to its responsibilities to our \nNation's schoolchildren who live on Federal property. That is the \nminimum we owe the children of our women and men in uniform, and I am \npleased the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. \nDomenici, accepted my amendment as part of his resolution.\n  Unfortunately, many other amendments which would have improved this \nbill failed to pass on largely party-line votes.\n  I was pleased to support a substitute budget proposed by my friend, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad. His proposal--the fair share \nplan--reached balance, closed loopholes, excluded Social Security, but \nsmoothed the glidepath of reduced spending. It is my sincere belief \nthat the budget proposed by Senator Conrad would have been a better \nstarting point than the one put forth by my Republican colleagues. The \nConrad plan was not perfect, but it would have been better for our \nchildren, our elderly, the environment, and the most vulnerable members \nof our society.\n  My friends, the distinguished junior Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, offered a wise \namendment which aimed at restoring the draconian cuts to education. I \nwas pleased to speak in favor of this amendment, and [[Page S7707]] an \ntruly sorry that our Republican friends were unable to join colleagues \non this side of the aisle in restoring some hope for our children's \nfuture.\n  Similarly, my Budget Committee colleague, the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg, and my friend from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller, offered an important amendment to restore some of the \nnasty cuts to the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. This amendment would \nhave given some much-needed security to our elderly. It would have also \nloosened the squeeze on the middle class--average Americans like me, \nwho are caught between elderly, frail parents, and kids at home.\n  I was honored to join two of my distinguished colleagues from the \nFinance Committee, Senator Bradley and Senator Breaux to roll back the \ntax increase on our country's working families. This budget plan raises \nthe taxes on families earning less than $28,000 per year. I think \nnearly everyone in this country would agree it is inherently unfair to \nraise taxes on the lower middle class and give a break to the \nwealthiest among us. Unfortunately, this amendment was rejected on \nparty lines. That is a tragic and sad mistake.\n  Time and again, some of our colleagues attempted to restore common \nsense to this budget, but we were caught up in the partisanship of this \nbody. One of the worst examples of this came with the defeat of the \nMurray amendment. My amendment simply would have protected kids from \nMedicaid cuts. Despite the defeat of my amendment which would have put \nthe Senate on record that children should not be left without \ninsurance, I will continue to fight for the interests of children in \nthis Nation as the Medicaid system is reformed by this Congress.\n  Lastly, I was very disappointed that an amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, was defeated. The Senator from \nDelaware correctly called attention to the risks to our environment if \noil exploration were to be extended in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. This amendment was important for the future of our Nation's \nenvironment, and its defeat is shortsighted and ill-advised.\n  Mr. President, without these amendments, without this safety net for \nour children, without protections of our environment, and without other \nsafeguards for our most vulnerable citizens, this resolution is fatally \nflawed. And, I cannot support this draconian and risky budget \nplan.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7706-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Hiram is also one of only 13 \npeople to ever deliver the lecture. He joins an impressive list of past \nlecturers which include two Nobel Prize winners. His speech will focus \non his work to understand and control infection after trauma, research \nhe has worked extensively on at the University of Louisville for more \nthan a decade.\n  Hiram received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1960, \nand 11 years later he accepted a position at the University of \nLouisville. At the age of 35, Hiram was named chairman of surgery at \nthe university, making him one of the youngest surgery department \nchairmen in the Nation.\n  His research on surgery infection began in 1969, and he says it still \nhas a long way to go. He best describes his work in a recent article \nfrom the Courier Journal, ``you keep hoping for a breakthrough. But in \nfact * * * you're crawling your way up the Washington Monument one step \nat a time.'' And you can bet, Hiram will continue his research on \nsurgical infections for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I commend Dr. Hiram C. Polk, Jr., for his outstanding \nservice to the University of Louisville and to the entire medical \ncommunity. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work \nof this outstanding Kentuckian and to congratulate him on his induction \nas an honorary fellow into the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7707-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Hiram is also one of only 13 \npeople to ever deliver the lecture. He joins an impressive list of past \nlecturers which include two Nobel Prize winners. His speech will focus \non his work to understand and control infection after trauma, research \nhe has worked extensively on at the University of Louisville for more \nthan a decade.\n  Hiram received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1960, \nand 11 years later he accepted a position at the University of \nLouisville. At the age of 35, Hiram was named chairman of surgery at \nthe university, making him one of the youngest surgery department \nchairmen in the Nation.\n  His research on surgery infection began in 1969, and he says it still \nhas a long way to go. He best describes his work in a recent article \nfrom the Courier Journal, ``you keep hoping for a breakthrough. But in \nfact * * * you're crawling your way up the Washington Monument one step \nat a time.'' And you can bet, Hiram will continue his research on \nsurgical infections for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I commend Dr. Hiram C. Polk, Jr., for his outstanding \nservice to the University of Louisville and to the entire medical \ncommunity. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work \nof this outstanding Kentuckian and to congratulate him on his induction \nas an honorary fellow into the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7707-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7707-S7708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, unfortunately I was unable to \nvote on the balanced budget resolution and several pending amendments. \nI was the commencement speaker for the 1995 graduating class of Johns \nHopkins University in Baltimore from which my niece and nephew were \nalso graduating.\n  However, had I been here to vote I would have voted against the \nresolution because I believe it hurts too many Americans. It hurts our \nseniors and it hurts our students.\n  Everything this country has fought for is being attacked in this \nbudget, Medicare, Medicaid, long-term care, veterans health care, and \neducation.\n  We must have a call to arms to save lives and save people.\n  Mr. President, during consideration of the budget resolution, Senator \nConrad offered an amendment which would have achieved a balanced budget \nby 2004.\n  I support Senator Conrad's approach to balancing the budget because I \nbelieve that it represents a far more equitable approach to balancing \nthe budget than the budget resolution which passed the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I support the Conrad amendment because it balances the \nbudget without counting the Social Security trust fund surplus. I have \nstated in the past that I cannot support a balanced budget that does \nnot protect Social Security. A promise made must be a promise kept.\n  We cannot jeopardize the retirement benefits of the G.I. Joe \ngeneration--the generation that fought and saved civilization. We owe \nit to our veterans and their families to ensure a safe and secure \nfuture.\n  In addition, I support the Conrad amendment because it fully funds \neducation and restores some of the cuts to veterans programs, \ninfrastructure investments, and technology programs, while still \nachieving a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I also want to express my strong support for an \namendment offered by my colleague, Senator Kennedy, to restore funding \nfor college aid.\n  The Republican budget resolution would cut $30 million in Federal aid \nto college students over the next 7 years. This is the largest \neducation cut in U.S. history.\n  This is unacceptable. Education must be a No. 1 priority. It is with \nme and it should also be a priority in this budget.\n  Senator Kennedy's amendment would have helped to restore college \nstudent aid funds. This amendment did not pass, but yet it is extremely \nimportant when half of all college students receive Federal financial \naid.\n  However, I am pleased that the Snowe amendment which was adopted will \nrestore $9.4 billion over 7 years to student loans. I support this \namendment because I know what it will mean to Maryland's students.\n  Our undergraduate students borrow the maximum of $17,125 just to be \nable to afford a college education, access to increased opportunities \nand to achieve the American dream.\n  The cost of college has skyrocketed and our students need our support \nthrough Federal financial aid programs or through innovative \ninitiatives like National Service. We cannot turn our back on them now.\n  Mr. President, in this budget, we are given cuts, not compassion. As \nan appropriator, I know firsthand what these cuts mean. These are not \nnumbers. These are not statistics. These are not line items. They are \nissues people care about.\n  Balancing the budget should not be about rhetoric or about scoring \npolitical points. Balancing the budget should be about honoring the \ncontributions of the G.I. Joe generation, the generation who worked \nhard, played by the rules, and served our country well. It is for those \nwho are fighting for the future generations of Americans. \n[[Page S7708]] \n  Mr. President, the Senate still has a long way to go this year and a \nlot of work to do on this Nation's budget. This resolution is not the \nfinal word and I look forward to setting this Nation's priorities \nstraight and fighting for the generations to come.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7707-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE TERCENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP, NJ\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \n300th anniversary of the founding of Gloucester Township. Three hundred \nyears after its incorporation, Gloucester Township has grown from a \nsmall farming community along the banks of what is now Timber Creek \ninto one of New Jersey's premier residential communities.\n  On June 1, 1995, residents of Gloucester Township celebrated their \n300th year with a ceremony consisting of a reenactment of the 1695 \nProclamation of Incorporation. After the ceremony, the tercentenary \ncommittee presented a hand-sewn quilt consisting of 33 panels which \ntraces the township's unique history and highlights the area's historic \nsites. The quilt, lovingly crafted by over 20 volunteers, took hundreds \nof hours to complete and is a fitting tribute to a special community. \nLike the memorial quilt, Gloucester Township is a creation of the sum \nof its parts, incorporating many small, distinct communities--each with \ntheir own histories and special characteristics--to add color and form \nto the township.\n  When the mayor and town council of Gloucester donned their colonial-\nera garb to reenact the Incorporation Proclamation, they payed tribute \nto an area of New Jersey that is rich in history. The community of \nChews Landing, which predates New Jersey's statehood by years, is still \nsprinkled with old, historic homes many built during the days when \nGeorge Washington and James Madison were subscribers to the St. John's \nEpiscopal Church in Chews Landing. Other colorful figures in American \nhistory who have roots in Gloucester Township include: Lt. Aaron Chew, \na local war hero; Abraham Clark, George Reed, and Charles Campbell, \nsigners of the Declaration of Independence; F. Muhlenberg, a member of \nthe Continental Congress and first Speaker of the House; William \nPatterson, former Governor of New Jersey; and Elias Boudinot, a member \nof the New Jersey Continental Congress and Director of the first U.S. \nMint. Blenheim, home to the cemetery that is still known today as \nWallin's Graveyard, was home to Charity Chew Powell and her husband \nRichard who lost 17 of their 20 sons in the American Revolution and \nother of our country's early wars.\n  Gloucester Township is not only rich in history, it is also blessed \nwith attributes that make the area such a wonderful place to live and \nraise a family. An outstanding school system, beautiful parks, an \nactive little league, and a diverse population create an environment \nwhere the bonds of community can thrive. Approximately 56,000 \ninhabitants strong, Gloucester Township is no longer a small town on \nthe banks of a creek. Still, the small-town belief that fellow \nresidents are actually friends and family, still flourishes and has \nallowed Gloucester's different communities to live harmoniously as \ntheir community has grown. Today, when the fragile ecology of our \nsocial environment is as threatened as that of our natural environment, \nI am delighted to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the \ninhabitants of Gloucester Township and the lessons they offer in \ncommunity and modern living.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Gloucester Township once again, on \ntheir tercentennial anniversary.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7708-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      SOCIAL COMPACT'S 1995 OUTSTANDING COMMUNITY INVESTMENT AWARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nSturgis Neighborhood Program [SNP] and the Sturgis Federal Savings Bank \nas recipients of the Social Compact's 1995 Outstanding Community \nInvestment Award. The Social Compact is an ecumenical coalition of \nhundreds of CEOs from all types of financial services institutions and \nneighborhood self-help organizations who have joined forces to promote \nproven, effective strategies for strengthening America's vulnerable \nneighborhoods.\n  The partnership achievement of the Sturgis Neighborhood Program and \nthe Sturgis Federal Savings Bank is rebuilding community hope and pride \nby stabilizing lower income neighborhoods and families through the \nrehabilitation of affordable rental housing. Since its inception, the \nSNP has rehabilitated five single family homes and more are on the way. \nTenant families are employed, receive family development guidance, and \nparticipate in maintenance education programs. Families also \nparticipate in a Goal Setting Plan which guides them toward being self-\nsufficient, productive members of the community.\n  The Sturgis Federal Savings Bank was the first institution to support \nSNP's mission and played a vital role in its initial success. With the \nassistance of Sturgis Federal, SNP received grants and subsidies which \nallowed the organization to successfully renovate the completed five \nunits of affordable rental housing. It is my honor to congratulate the \nSturgis Neighborhood Program and the Sturgis Federal Savings Bank. I \njoin the Social Compact in thanking them for their contributions to the \nSturgis community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7708-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7708-S7709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RAYMOND KELLY'S COMMENCEMENT SPEECH TO MARIST COLLEGE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on May 20, 1995, Raymond W. \nKelly, the esteemed former police commissioner of New York City, gave a \nmoving commencement speech at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, NY. \nSenators will recall that, in addition to his service as the head of \nthe Nation's largest police force, Commissioner Kelly recently returned \nfrom a very demanding assignment as director of the International \nPolice Monitors in Haiti.\n  In his speech, Commissioner Kelly urged the Class of 1995 to be, and \nI quote, ``America's new idealists. * * * America needs new, energetic \nvoices to counter the current wisdom that says all government is \nsuspect. The class of '95 should be that voice.''\n  In recognition of Commissioner Kelly's public service, Marist College \nawarded him an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. His fine \ncommencement address truly deserves the attention of the Senate, and I \nask that the text of the speech be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n                      Remarks by Raymond W. Kelly\n\n       President Murray, Brother Paul, Chairman Dyson, friends, \n     family, and members of the class of 1995. I want to express \n     my appreciation to Marist College and its board of trustees \n     for conferring this honorary degree on me. And I want to \n     express my congratulations to the class of '95 who earned \n     your degrees the hard way. This honor permits me to share \n     with the class of '95 the soaring reputation of this great \n     institution; a reputation which has spread far beyond the \n     confines of the Hudson Valley, across America and beyond, to \n     some unexpected corners of the world.\n       What Brother Paul Ambrose and the original Marist \n     fraternity planted with their sweat and broad shoulders has \n     blossomed beyond even their inspired dreams. It has blossomed \n     because the secular community who followed in their footsteps \n     kept the faith and worked hard. The result is this beautiful \n     campus, a crown jewel on the Hudson River.\n       But Marist College is far more than that. It has preserved \n     what other institutions have lost, or are still trying to \n     achieve: namely, a faculty that teaches, an administration \n     that leads, and a board of trustees that governs. The \n     result--and I know this first hand--are graduates who leave \n     Marist College ready to take on the world, in all of its \n     complexity, and even its dangers.\n       Last fall, when President Clinton asked me to go to Haiti \n     to direct the international police monitors, he put at my \n     disposal over twelve hundred police professionals from around \n     the world. In addition, I had United States Army and Marine \n     Corps personnel reporting to me. Our job was to stop human \n     rights abuses by a notorious Haitian police and military, and \n     to establish an interim public security force. We did all \n     that, and more.\n       I was honored to lead the effort, but I certainly could not \n     do it alone. With a large and highly skilled group from which \n     to choose, I needed three individuals for key positions. I \n     had neither the time nor the inclination to check their \n     college credentials. I just went on my instincts that came \n     with 30 years of judging leadership in the New York City \n     Police Department and the United States Marine Corps.\n       And today, I want the Marist College class of 1995 to meet \n     the three individuals who I asked to go in harms way to lead \n     Haiti out of the hell created by a brutal dictatorship. They \n     are (and I'd like them to stand): [[Page S7709]] \n       United States Marine Corps Major Samuel Delgado, military \n     liaison for Haiti's second largest city, and Marist College \n     graduate, class of 1977.\n       United States Marine Corps Major Mario Labpaix, interpreter \n     and military liaison for Haiti's largest city, and Marist \n     College graduate, class of 1978.\n       And former assistant commissioner of the New York City \n     Police Department, Paul J. Browne, the deputy director of the \n     international police monitors in Haiti, and Marist College \n     graduate, class of 1971.\n       They are three reasons who our mission in Haiti was a \n     success. And if the President of the United States called \n     again tomorrow and asked me for three good men, I'd call \n     Delgado, Lapaix and Browne. And if the President of the \n     United States called tomorrow and asked me for three hundred \n     good men and women, I'd call the Marist College placement \n     office.\n       Professor Lavin described it as an ``uncanny coincidence.'' \n     But I'm not so sure. It should be no surprise that the tenets \n     of ethics and of public service rooted in the Marist \n     tradition and carried forward in its classrooms emerge in its \n     graduates, just when the world needs them most.\n       I urge the class of 95 to hold fast to those tenets, and to \n     make ethical conduct and service to your fellow human beings \n     the hallmarks of whatever careers await you. America, and the \n     world, sorely need both. America and the world also need \n     people who will stand on principle. And, uphold in their \n     daily lives the values that this institution believes in.\n       My advice to the class of 95 is: Tell the truth, be loyal \n     to your friends, but not blind to their failings, and set a \n     standard of ethical conduct for yourselves and to be true to \n     it no matter what.\n       Whatever perceived advantage in your personal or public \n     life is sacrificed by doing the right thing is not worth \n     attaining if it means compromising what you believe in.\n       One other thing: I have never made a career decision based \n     on money, and I have never regretted it. I can see all of you \n     with loan payments cringing. But I mean it. Simply put, money \n     is overrated. America has plenty of money and plenty of money \n     makers, what it needs is idealists.\n       I urge class of 95 to be Ameria's new idealists.\n       Somewhere between Dallas, Vietnam and Watergate, our \n     idealism was shattered. Idealism was the great casuality of \n     my generation. It need not be yours.\n       America needs new, energetic voices to counter the current \n     wisdom that says all government is suspect. The class of 95 \n     should be that voice.\n       America needs a conscience that counters the lie that the \n     poor are responsible for their own plight. The class of 95 \n     should be that conscience.\n       America needs the confidence to refute the proposition that \n     self interest should come before all other interests. The \n     class of 95 should have that confidence.\n       There is also a disturbing manifesto of government mistrust \n     abroad in the land. It is embraced by a radical fringe that \n     is not prepared to die for its cause but ready to kill for \n     it. But it is not embraced by the radicals alone. It is \n     espoused by newcomers to leadership who say they are drawn to \n     government for the principal purpose of dismantling it. It \n     has also given rise to a new mean-spiritedness and a new \n     cynicism; one that casts a cold eye on the plight of the poor \n     and the aspirations of minorities and immigrants. And it has \n     given rise to a new isolationism which would confine American \n     foreign policy to the dark parameters of narrow self \n     interest.\n       All of this suspicious introspection is unbecoming of the \n     American character.\n       Americans are, by nature, generous and optimistic and we \n     need to reclaim our heritage.\n       You need to reclaim it.\n       I was recently told about a retired General Electric \n     employee who had immigrated to the United States from the \n     Ukraine during World War Two. He came, by way of Russia, by \n     way of Germany, by way of France. He was a refugee. Along the \n     way he met American soldiers, the first Americans he had ever \n     seen. He said the Americans were fundamentally different from \n     him and from everyone he had ever known.\n       The Americans were full of hope. They were full of optimism \n     and idealism. They laughed easily and looked to the future. \n     He knew no one like them. They were unencumbered by the old \n     European notions of family position, of wealth, of status. \n     They were free of the elitism that held so many people back. \n     He said he saw the Americans as ``a new tribe,'' completely \n     and irresistibly different from his experience, and he \n     desperately wanted to be a member of the tribe.\n       That was 50 years ago. But the world still sees Americans \n     in much the same way. In Haiti, we were welcomed as \n     liberators by the poorest people in the Western Hemisphere. \n     The graffiti on the walls in Port-Au-Prince said: \n     ``Americans, please stay in Haiti for 50 years.''\n       American self-interest was served in Haiti, certainly as it \n     applied to curtaining the flow of illegal immigration into \n     the United States. But we also went to Haiti because it was \n     the right thing to do. We put our might were our mouth was. \n     We fed the hungry. We saved lives. We routed the bullies, and \n     rescued fellow human beings from despots. We restored \n     democracy. We treated some of the poorest people in the world \n     with great dignity, which was a completely new experience for \n     them.\n       We need to practice that charity at home, and not be afraid \n     to remain engaged abroad. America needs you to do that. \n     America needs optimists. It needs idealists. America needs \n     the class of 95 to be engaged in the world.\n       If your country asks you to serve, say yes. If it doesn't \n     ask, volunteer.\n       We need to have the kind of faith in ourselves that the \n     world has in America.\n       We need Americans who believe, as President Kennedy did, \n     that ``Here on Earth, God's work must truly be our \n     own.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7708-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY 1995 NCAA LACROSSE CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise toady to pay tribute to our \nNation's 1995 NCAA Men's Lacrosse Champions, the Orangemen of Syracuse \nUniversity. I am particularly proud both as a New Yorker and as an \nalumnus of both the university and its law school.\n  Last Monday, before a crowd of over 26,000, the Orange bested the \nMaryland Terrapins--who enjoyed a home field advantage--by a score of \n13-9 to win the collegiate title. This victory was a fitting tribute to \nthe memory of the late Roy Simmons, Sr.--the father of SU Coach Roy \nSimmons, Jr., and the legend of Syracuse lacrosse--to whom the \nOrangemen had dedicated their season. The victory for Syracuse marks \nthe sixth time that the Orange have won the national championship and a \nrecord 13th straight trip to the final four.\n  The young men of the Syracuse University lacrosse team have a lot to \nbe proud of in this victory. It is the crowning achievement in this \narduous sport demonstrating that a commitment to teamwork and \nexcellence do pay off. This is especially true among the upperclassmen \nwho could have rested on their 1993 championship laurels. By example, \ntheir hard work to get back on top will be carried on by SU teams for \nyears to come. A tradition of winning has been maintained, and it is a \ntradition that I believe future Syracuse teams will sustain.\n  We can all be proud of the accomplishment of these young men. They \nhave risen to claim top honors in this demanding sport without \nsacrificing their academic standards. Mr. President, once again, I \nsalute our Nation's NCAA Lacrosse Champions, the Syracuse University \nOrangemen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7709-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE EVERYBODY WINS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this spring on Capitol Hill an \nexiting literacy program began with the help of Senators and Senate \nstaff. The children at Brent Elementary School are now being read to \nonce a week during their lunch hours by volunteers in the Everybody \nWins Program. Everybody Wins is a successful literacy program which \nmatches up professionals with at-risk, inner-city school children as \nreading partners.\n  During each power lunch session, the reading partners select a book \nand read aloud together--an activity that the Commission on Reading \ncalls the single most important activity for building a child's \neventual success in reading.\n  Dr. Frances Plummer, the principal of Brent Elementary School, has \nbeen instrumental in making this program a success. Dr. Plummer, a \nnative Washingtonian, attended the D.C. schools, from kindergarten \nthrough receiving her B.S. degree from D.C. Teachers College. She then \nwent on to earn a masters degree and doctorate of education from George \nWashington University. Her career has included being a teacher and \nassistant principal in the Washington D.C. public schools before going \non to become the principal of the Brent Elementary School.\n  Dr. Plummer's philosophy is ``Teach each child at your school as you \nwould want your own child taught.'' I, along with my colleagues who are \nparticipating in the program would like to commend Dr. Plummer's \npatience, hard work, and a lifetime of dedication to the children that \nshe serves.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/05/senate-section/article/S7709-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7709-S7710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
