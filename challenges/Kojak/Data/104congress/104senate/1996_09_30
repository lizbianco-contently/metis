This is a different parks \nbill from the one that has been pending in the Senate now for several \ndays, but it did pass the House by an overwhelming margin, I think with \nonly seven votes against it.\n  A late-night session is possible in order to complete action on the \nomnibus appropriations bill, which must be signed by the President by \nmidnight tonight in order to fund various parts of the Government for \nthe new fiscal year, which begins tomorrow.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, again, that I am very pleased we were able \nto \n_______________________________________________________________________\n                              N O T I C E\n\n   A final issue of the Congressional Record for the 104th Congress \n will be published on October 21, 1996, in order to permit Members to \n revise and extend their remarks.\n   All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \n delivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \n Debates (Room HT-60 or S-220 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, \n between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., through October 21. \n The final issue will be dated October 21, 1996 and will be delivered \n on October 23.\n   None of the material printed in the final issue of the \n Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \n event, that occurred after the sine die date.\n   Senators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \n either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \n the Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record at Reporters.''\n   Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \n submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \n contacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the \n Government Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \n a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\n   By order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                     \n WILLIAM M. THOMAS, Chairman.\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n[[Page S11816]]\n\n\nreach agreement on this omnibus appropriations bill. It is before us. \nIt is large. But it has been reviewed by the House. In fact, the House \nvoted to pass the omnibus appropriations bill by a vote of 370 to 37, \nan overwhelming vote of approval. I listened to the debate well into \nthe night on Saturday night. In fact, I stayed up until I saw the final \nvote, at about 10:30. They went into a lot of detail on what is in the \nbill. I was somewhat surprised and impressed by the way that it was \npresented, the information that was given to the House Members, and by \nthe extremely bipartisan and very gentle debate that occurred.\n  Congressmen who had been fighting each other vigorously for the last \n2 years were praising each other and saying what a good job had been \ndone. Any time you have a bill this large, I am sure there are some \nmistakes included. I am sure that any one of us can find a lot of \nthings that we do not like about it. But it has been passed, now, by \nthe House. The President has endorsed it in writing. His letter of \nendorsement is in the Record. I placed it there last Saturday.\n  Now it is incumbent upon the Senate to do our job. It is all in our \nhands. We must act on this before late tonight so it will have time to \nbe put together and delivered to the President. We have a number of \nSenators who have questions they want to raise about it, perhaps. The \nconference--the Democrats will meet at 12, the Republicans will be \nmeeting at 2. We will talk it through. It is going to take a lot of \ncooperation--and sacrifice, as a matter of fact, in some cases, to get \nwork completed.\n  There are other issues pending. Obviously, we need to get the FAA \nreauthorization done. I am committed to doing that. There appear to be \nsome Senators who are willing to have a scorched earth policy, which \nwould work against the Federal Aviation Administration, airport safety \nin America, against their individual States, and over a very small \nprovision which is actually a fix in the law that was inadvertently \ncaused.\n  We need to find way to work this out. We are trying to do it, again \nin a bipartisan way. I know Senator Daschle would like to do that. I \nknow there are Senators like Senator Pryor and Fritz Hollings on that \nside, Senator McCain, and, obviously, Senator Stevens, and so where \nthere is a will there will surely be a way. We will try to work that \nout.\n\n  The parks bill is a major preservation piece of legislation. Some of \nthe parks that were controversial or were strongly opposed by the \nadministration were taken out. But the chairman of the committee in the \nHouse, Congressman Young of Alaska, spoke very strongly for it. Some of \nthe provisions that are desperately desired are in here, such as the \nPresidio, Tallgrass project--a whole number of others are included in \nthis bill. So I hope we will find a way to get through it and get \npassage of this parks legislation.\n  If we can leave tonight having passed the omnibus appropriations \nbill, the Defense appropriations bill, a parks bill, and the FAA \nreauthorization, we could go out truly on a very high note.\n  I know our colleagues who are leaving, like the Senator from Alabama, \nwho I am pleased to see back with us here this morning, are prepared to \nspeak, as well as other Senators who are retiring after many, many \nyears of great service--they would feel very good. It would give us a \nlittle time to thank them one last time before they leave this Chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11815-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   WAIVING CERTAIN ENROLLING REQUIREMENTS IN H.R. 4278--HOUSE JOINT \n                             RESOLUTION 197\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Tomorrow, Mr. President, on October 1 of this year, the \nPost Office will celebrate the 100th anniversary of Rural Free Delivery \n[RFD]. RFD now serves the whole country, some 25.5 million households \nand businesses in all, and it is a necessity in States like Alabama. In \nfact, I am proud to say that Congressman Richard Clarke of Alabama was \nan early leader in the effort to initiate this service. As this \nimportant anniversary approaches, I would like to recount Congressman \nClarke's leadership efforts in its successful implementation.\n  On January 5, 1892, Representative Richard Clarke became the first \nMember of Congress to introduce a bill to make RFD a permanent service. \nHe introduced bills in two succeeding Congresses, H.R. 13 in the 52d \nand H.R. 402 in the 53d ``To provide for the free collection and \ndelivery of mails in rural districts.'' He contacted many Members on \nthe need for such legislation and made the first speech advocating the \nestablishment of the program. When the bill was finally adopted by \nCongress, Mr. Clarke was engaged in a campaign for Governor of Alabama. \nTherefore, Congressman Tom Watson of Georgia took the lead in obtaining \nits passage. Although his name does not appear as the official sponsor \nof the legislation which ultimately created RFD, the people of his \ndistrict and the State of Alabama have every right to claim that this \nMember of Congress was a leader in establishing RFD.\n  Richard H. Clarke was born in Dayton, Marengo County, AL on February \n9, 1843. He attended Green Springs Academy and was graduated first in \nhis class from the University of Alabama in July 1861. During the Civil \nWar, he served in the Confederate Army as a lieutenant in the First \nBattalion of the Alabama Artillery. He later studied law, was admitted \nto the bar in 1867, and began practicing in his hometown. He later \nmoved to Demopolis, also in Marengo County, where he continued to \npractice law. From 1872 until 1876, he served as the State solicitor \nfor Marengo County. He was the prosecuting attorney of the seventh \njudicial circuit in 1876 and 1877 and later resumed his private law \npractice in Mobile, AL. He served as president of the Alabama State Bar \nAssociation in 1897.\n  He was elected as a Democrat to the 51st Congress and to the three \nsucceeding Congresses. He served from March 4, 1889 through March 3, \n1897. He served on the Rivers and Harbors Committee. Among his many \nlegislative accomplishments was the deepening of the channel of Mobile \nHarbor and the establishment of Mount Vernon Hospital for the mentally \nill. He ran for Governor of Alabama as a ``sound money''--gold \nstandard--Democrat in 1896, but was defeated by the silver standard \ncandidate, Joseph Johnston. He resumed his law practice and served\n\n[[Page S11817]]\n\nin the State house of representatives in 1900 and 1901. He passed away \nin St. Louis, MO on September 26, 1906 and was buried in the Magnolia \nCemetery in Mobile. His grandson, Dr. Richard Clarke Foster, served as \npresident of the University of Alabama in the late 1930's and early \n1940's.\n  Of course, Congressman Clarke was by no means alone in his efforts on \nbehalf of RFD. The Post Office says that the first rural delivery route \nbegan just after the Civil War, in a very unofficial way. In 1868, a \ngroup of families in Norwood, GA, hired a freed slave named Jerry \nElliot to deliver their mail. Mr. Elliot collected his employers' \nsorted mail at the local post office, where future Congressman Tom \nWatson worked as a clerk. Apparently, Watson was highly impressed with \nthe idea, and years later he joined as a crucial sponsor of legislation \nto fund the service.\n\n  The official battle over RFD began more than 20 years later and \nspanned four Postmaster Generals. John Wanamaker, appointed in 1889, \nwas the first Postmaster General to urge adoption of Rural Free \nDelivery. Wanamaker had received a number of letters complaining that \nthe cities received free delivery, but rural America did not. Free \ndelivery for urban areas had begun in 1863.\n  At Postmaster General Wanamaker's request, the Congress passed a \njoint resolution on October 1, 1890, to authorize a test of the free \ndelivery system in small towns and villages. It also appropriated \n$10,000 for this pilot program. The towns Wanamaker selected for the \nexperiment ranged in size from 400 to 8,000 residents. Farmers became \nstrong advocates of the service, realizing that they would receive \ndaily market quotations and information about where they could sell \ntheir crops.\n  With the success of his experiment and the strong support of the \nfarmers, Wanamaker continued to push for Rural Free Delivery.\n  The same year that Congressman Clarke introduced his second RFD bill, \nCongressman Tom Watson's legislation to extend RFD to farmers, rather \nthan just villages and towns, was passed. But this measure, too, only \nprovided for an experimental expansion. Postmaster General Wanamaker's \nsuccessor, William Bissell, argued correctly that this amount was \nvastly insufficient to facilitate permanent RFD. In fact, Bissell \nrefused even to continue experimentation, and a stand-off between him \nand Congress ultimately forced his resignation.\n  Bissell's successor, Postmaster General William Wilson, complained \nthat the Post Office's funding was so small that he might only improve \nexisting services. So, a Senator named Marion Butler from North \nCarolina urged passage of a further appropriation, and the Post Office \nbegan an experimental system in West Virginia. This experiment proved \nsuccessful, and it led to the establishment of the current system with \nthe help of further Congressional appropriations. By that time, \nPostmaster General Wilson had been succeeded by James A. Gary.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that a Member of Congress from Alabama--\nRichard Henry Clarke--was so influential in the establishment of Rural \nFree Delivery, a service most Americans in rural areas take for granted \ntoday. Although there are several individuals who might arguably be \nconsidered the father of RFD, I wanted to make sure Congressman \nClarke's efforts did not go unrecognized. The creation of this service \nis very much a part of his legacy.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is here. If he wishes to make an opening \nstatement on this bill, I will be pleased to yield to him. I have a \nlengthy statement to make about the subject I believe should precede \nthis omnibus appropriations bill, the FAA conference report. If the \nSenator from Oregon wishes to make a statement, I will be happy to \nyield to him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nOregon with the understanding that I will resume the floor when he has \ncompleted his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11816-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11817-S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I believe that the pending business is \nthe omnibus appropriations bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senate now has, as the Chair has indicated, under \nconsideration the fiscal year omnibus appropriations bill which will \nconclude our action on the six fiscal year 1997 appropriations bills \nthat have not been enacted into law, and they are: No. 1, Commerce, \nJustice, State, and related agencies; No. 2, the Defense appropriations \nbill; No. 3, the foreign operations appropriations bill; No. 4, the \nInterior and related agencies appropriations bill; No. 5, the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill; and No. 6, the Treasury-Postal Service \nappropriations bill.\n  As Senators are aware, members of the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittee and their staffs worked around the clock at the end of last \nweek to reach a bipartisan agreement with the administration on all the \noutstanding issues included in these bills. Our colleagues in the House \nadopted this bill Saturday by an overwhelming rollcall vote of 370 to \n37, and the President has indicated he will sign the bill as soon as it \nreaches his desk.\n  I know that many Senators have questions and concerns about this \nlegislation. Senator Byrd and I will be here throughout the day to \naddress those matters as best we can. I hope and expect that when we \nreach a vote on final passage later today, a large majority of the \nSenate will vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this will be the last appropriations measure that I \nwill manage here on the Senate floor. For the past 16 years as chairman \nor ranking minority member of the full committee, I have stood here \nwith Senator Byrd, Senator Stennis, and Senator Proxmire as we have \nbrought to the Senate the 13 annual appropriations acts, supplementals, \nrescissions bills and continuing resolutions. It has been an \nextraordinary experience. The appropriations process has been the \ncrucible of debate on enormous range of issues, great and small. We \nhave carried on through the revolutionary 1981 reconciliation process, \nthe Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, budget summits, and Government \nshutdowns. Despite it all, year in and year out, this Congress has \nacted on appropriations bills and sent them to the President. It is our \nprincipal constitutional duty to do so.\n  Mr. President, I cannot adequately express how honored I am to have \nbeen a part of this process. I owe an enormous debt to all of my \ncolleagues with whom I have served, both here in the Senate and in the \nHouse. I am privileged to have enjoyed relationships across the aisle \nin both bodies that have immeasurably enriched my life, and I can only \nhope that I have managed to return those gifts in some way.\n\n  All of us on the Committee on Appropriations, both here and in the \nHouse, are served by an extraordinary staff. These highly capable men \nand women are the best there are. Before I leave Washington for Oregon \nlater this month--I started to say later today; that perhaps is only \nwishful thinking at this moment--I hope to be able to thank each one \npersonally for their contributions.\n  It would be impossible, Mr. President, to make a comprehensive \nrecitation of the provisions of this legislation, and I will not try. I \nbelieve that this bill, which I hold in my hand, represents our \ncompleted product which is, obviously, a rather enormous package. I \nbelieve that various summary descriptions have been distributed. The \ntext of the legislation is printed in the Record and copies are \navailable here on the floor and in cloakrooms and in Senators' offices.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Alaska will respond to a \nrequest that he amend his unanimous-consent agreement to be recognized \nfollowing my brief presentation in order to permit the ranking member, \nSenator Byrd, to make his opening statement as well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have just conferred with Senator Byrd, and I agree. I \ndo amend my request that I be recognized\n\n[[Page S11818]]\n\nafter the Senator from West Virginia completes his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amended request? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I will yield the floor, but before I do \nso, I, again, want to personalize my remarks, Senator Byrd being on the \nfloor, to say that this was a joint effort. And with Senator Byrd's \nvast background and expertise in the procedures of the Senate, the \nhistory of the Senate, the legislative role of the Senate, I, again, \nexpress my deep appreciation for his collaboration, his cooperation, \nhis spirit of friendship, and the demonstration of that friendship day \nin and day out in achieving our mutual responsibilities to bring this \nbill to the floor, like all previous bills.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, [Mr. Hatfield], who is here today managing his last \nappropriations bill. I will have more to say during the day, I am sure, \non that line.\n  The bill now before the Senate contains the results of very intense \nand difficult negotiations over the past week, and particularly over \nthe past weekend, between the two Houses, with the administration \nparticipating with advice and suggestions. These negotiations included \nnot only the chairman and ranking members of each of the affected \nAppropriations Subcommittees, but also the representatives of the House \nand Senate Republican and Democratic leadership, as well as the \nPresident's very able Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, and the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, Frank Raines, and their staffs.\n\n  As Senators are aware, these negotiations were necessary because of \nthe inability of Congress and the administration to reach agreement on \nsix of the thirteen fiscal year 1997 appropriations bills. Over the \npast months, the President indicated that he would not agree to sign \nthese appropriations bills unless funding for a number of priorities \nwas increased by some $6.5 billion and unless certain controversial \nlegislative riders were dropped.\n  And so, we found ourselves in Congress faced with having to deal with \nthe President s requests in a very short period of time if we were to \nreach agreement on the six remaining appropriations bills by the \nbeginning of fiscal year 1997, which starts at the hour of midnight.\n  In addition, the administration proposed a number of urgent \nappropriations, including some $1.1 billion to fight terrorism and \nimprove aviation security and safety, as well as over $500 million in \nfirefighting assistance for Western States and $400 million to assist \nthe victims of Hurricanes Fran and Hortense.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate all of those Members and staffs who \nhave worked literally around the clock over the past week, and \ncertainly over the past weekend, in order to reach this agreement and \nhave it prepared for consideration in the House on Saturday evening \nwhen it was agreed to, and by the opening hours of this day here in the \nSenate. I particularly wish to recognize the efforts of the chairman \nand ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee. Mr. \nLivingston has proved himself to be a very able and articulate \nchairman--and I have enjoyed immensely the opportunity to work with Mr. \nLivingston--he along with his equally able ranking member, Mr. Obey.\n  If there were not a David Obey in the Congress, Congress would have \nto create one. He reminds me, in a way, of that irascible Senator \nMcClay who was a Member of the first Senate when it met in 1789. Mr. \nObey is very knowledgeable and extremely able. And so both of these \nmen, Mr. Livingston and Mr. Obey deserve great credit for their work on \nthis resolution.\n  They, together with my dear friend and colleague, the Senator from \nOregon, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. \nHatfield, deserve the lion's share of the credit for this agreement.\n  I know that Senator Hatfield, as would I, would have preferred to \nhave had each of the fiscal year 1997 appropriation bills enacted \nseparately rather than having them conglomerated into this massive \nomnibus bill. Senators should not be placed in the position that we \nfind ourselves in at this moment. We should not be backed up against \nthe wall here on the last day of the fiscal year, facing a Government \nshutdown unless we adopt this massive resolution. No Senator, and I \ndare say no staff person, has had the time to carefully review the \nthousands of programs funded in this resolution, or to read and \ncomprehend the many nonappropriations, legislative matters contained in \nthis resolution. What we are faced with is having to rely on those \nmembers and staffs in the House and Senate with jurisdiction over each \nof the provisions in this resolution. To my knowledge they, along with \nthe Office of Management and Budget and other executive branch \npersonnel, have approved each item and provision in their respective \nareas.\n  While I applaud the efforts of all those who have worked so hard on \nthis measure, I nevertheless abhor the fact that it, once again, has \ncome to this. We must redouble our efforts in future Congresses to get \nour work done, despite the very real differences among ourselves and \nwith the administration. The leaders of the Senate have almost \nimpossible burdens in meeting the requests of Senators throughout every \nsession. I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to commit \nthemselves to working with both leaders in ways that will enable the \nnext Congress not to have to consider such massive, omnibus legislation \nas the one now before the Senate.\n  Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Hatfield, has stated, this resolution contains the necessary \nappropriations for fiscal year 1997 for each of the six remaining \nappropriation bills which have not yet been enacted into law. Namely, \nTitle I of the resolution provides the fiscal year 1997 appropriations \nfor the following appropriation bills: Commerce/Justice/State/ and the \nJudiciary; Department of Defense; Foreign Operations; Interior; Labor-\nHHS; and Treasury Postal.\n  Titles II, III, and IV of H.R. 4278 contain legislation that results \nin offsets totaling some $3.3 billion. Those provisions include so-\ncalled BIF-SAIF; SPECTRUM sales; and certain PAYGO savings.\n  Title V contains other appropriations for various departments and \nagencies totaling some $850 million, as well as a number of general \nprovisions.\n  Finally, I should note that division C of the resolution contains the \nagreement on immigration reform.\n  Chairman Hatfield has highlighted the important priorities contained \nin this resolution and, therefore, I will not repeat them.\n  I hope that the Senate will proceed expeditiously and that we may be \nable to complete action on this measure in time to send it to the \nPresident for him to sign before the hour of midnight. I shall have \nmore to say, of course, during the day.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] for his \ncharacteristic courtesy in yielding to me, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \nchairman and ranking member of our full committee, the Appropriations \nCommittee. I certainly do apologize to them for seeking the floor ahead \nof them, because I knew they were coming. But I wanted to make certain \nthat I did retain the right to alert the Senate to a very difficult \nproblem as we proceed to consider this bill.\n  First, let me say I know that this is the last bill to be handled by \nthe Senator from Oregon. He and I went on the Appropriations Committee \non the same day. I have sat beside him for so many years now working on \nmatters affecting appropriations, and we have both served with the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia in a way that most people \nwould never understand.\n  There is a deep friendship among those of us who worked through long \nnights trying to figure out how to solve the problems of keeping this \nGovernment going and at the same time pursue the objectives of policy \nenunciated by our leaders. It is not an easy thing.\n  Both the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from West Virginia have \nspent many more hours in conference on this bill than any other member \nof the Appropriations Committee, and\n\n[[Page S11819]]\n\nthey certainly deserve our great respect and thanks for all the work \nthey have done to get us to this point.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia just said, this bill absolutely \nmust be signed tonight. It is our intention to see to it that that \ntakes place. I do give both the Senator from Oregon and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia great credit for what they have done and the manner \nin which they have handled this bill.\n  As a postscript, I also say I certainly do agree with the Senator \nfrom West Virginia--and I think the Senator from Oregon does too; I \nknow he does--this is not the way to handle appropriations bills, and \nwe must find a way to deal with our procedure to assure that bills from \nappropriations committees, that each bill is considered on its own \nmerits and it goes to the President in a way that expresses the will of \nthe Congress, and the President can express the will of the executive \nbranch. Under our traditional system of checks and balances, that must \nbe preserved in order to assure the freedom of this country. So I \nintend to work with the Senators to achieve that goal. I do, again, \napologize to them for seeking the floor ahead of them because I know \nthey are entitled to present their positions in the very beginning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11817-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11819-S11824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY THE FEDERAL AVIATION AUTHORIZATION ACT \n                                OF 1996\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to again \naddress the question of the failure to approve the conference report on \nthe aviation trust fund. This is the Federal Aviation Authorization Act \nof 1996.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us contains the funding for the \nGovernment. We have already dealt with the appropriations for \ntransportation. But the conference report on the Aviation Authorization \nAct for 1996 contains the authority to spend the money. There currently \nis just $50 million, out of a $1.46 billion program, left after today \nto continue the work of the modernization of our airports and airways. \nWe have worked now 2 years--a bipartisan group--to try and improve the \nsafety and security of the Federal aviation system.\n  I give great credit to the chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator Pressler, the ranking member, Senator Hollings, and to the \nchairman of the aviation subcommittee, Mr. McCain, and the ranking \nmember of that committee, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nFord. We have, many of us, had differences of opinion on the bill. But \nwe found a way to work it out. This bill is absolutely necessary now to \nproceed to strengthen the safety and security of the aviation \ntransportation system. I am here this morning to again serve notice to \nthe Senate that this bill must be passed before we adjourn sine die. \nAgain, let me say, there is only $50 million left in this fund that can \nbe expended after today.\n  What we are looking at, Mr. President, is a bill that has been \ncrafted in order to meet some very important objectives of people who \nare very much involved with the issues of aviation safety. Let me point \nout, for instance, that just this past week we, once again, had a \nhearing with regard to the rights of those people who are survivors of \nvictims of air disasters.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not prepared to yield during this statement, Mr. \nPresident. I don't intend to take much time. I want to alert the \nSenate--and I know the Senator from Illinois has a matter he wishes to \nbring up that is quite similar to what I am talking about. But I would \nlike to finish my statement.\n  We had Victoria Cummock, a survivor of a victim of the Pan Am crash. \nShe has done a great deal to alert families who have been similarly \naffected of the need for Federal legislation to deal with family \nassistance to those that are affected by these crashes, the survivors \nof the victims of the crashes.\n  One of the things they asked us to do was to pass House bill 3923. \nAnd as I said at the hearing, I don't intend to get too personal about \nthis, but I personally know something about victims of air crashes. I \nknow that it is necessary for us to wake up and make sure that the \nFederal law does assure assistance to families of passengers involved \nin aircraft accidents. This bill does that. The aviation bill does \nthat.\n  The bill that is in the conference report that is being held up now \nover one provision in the bill. It requires the Chairman of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board to designate and publicize the \nname and phone number of a director of family support services to \ndesignate an independent nonprofit organization, such as the Red Cross, \nto assist in the taking of responsibility for coordinating the \nemotional care and support for those families. It has a substantial \ndesignation of assistance, such as providing mental health and \ncounseling services, to provide it in the environment in which families \nmay grieve in private, meet with families, communicate with families as \nto the role of Government agency, and arrange for a suitable memorial \nservice after consultation with the families.\n\n  It is a bill that is absolutely necessary, as we think of the number \nof families that have been affected by these air carrier crashes. It \nwill provide that unsolicited communication concerning a potential \naction for personal injury can't be made before 30 days after the \naccident. It does have a requirement that the air carrier submit plans \nto address the needs of families if their aircraft is involved in an \naccident. There is absolute necessity for this bill to pass. It \nestablishes a task force within the Department of Transportation to \nassure that this will be done.\n  Mr. President, my main reason for addressing the issue, though, is \nthe problem of safety at our airports. The Aberdeen, SD, runway has \nalmost closed for safety reasons. It has no carryover money. It has to \nhave this bill passed today so that money will be available tomorrow. \nIn my capital city of Juneau, we have a wind shear problem. It has \nrecently developed that the FAA wishes to change the takeoff \nrequirements and will not allow a plane to take off until they can \nprove there are no wind shears in the community.\n  We have in this bill the authorization for the money to take wind \nshear equipment to Juneau. This is just one of the items. In \nMassachusetts, for instance, as a result of formula changes in this \nbill, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will receive $3.5 million more \nunder its entitlement, which is nearly $1.4 million greater than what \nit gets now. But its Boston airport entitlement and Nantucket \nentitlement both increase. In the State of Wisconsin, they would have \nan apportionment of $1.9 million more in entitlement for the airports. \nIn Wisconsin, for instance, Madison's airport--a very interesting \narea--needs the money to proceed with the improvements to their \nairports. This bill is not only airports, but we are talking about \nsecurity provisions.\n  We have changed, as a result of the bill that I wish to have brought \nup and passed today, the provisions for the authority to check criminal \nrecords for security screeners at airports; given new authority for the \nFAA to facilitate interim deployment of advanced aviation security \ntechnology, including the explosive detection equipment that we must \nhave. They can make and will make vulnerability assessments of every \nairport in the country, and they are going to deal with new ways to \ndevelop passenger profiling. But above all, they are going to have the \nnational academy of science work on the explosive detecting and \naircraft hardening technology.\n  This bill cannot wait until we get back next year and organize and \nget around to passing bills. It would be, roughly, February 15, at the \nearliest, before that could be done. Under the essential air service, \nwhich is absolutely essential to maintain transportation in my State \nand many of the Northern States, funds could not be taken from the \ntrust fund if this bill does not pass. There is only a 1-month \ncarryover, which means that all of our planes that are involved in \nessential air service will be grounded before December if this bill \ndoes not pass.\n  This is the most critical bill that I can think of in terms of \naviation safety. I have a whole list of items here that deal with the \nsecurity requirements that are funded by this bill. Huntsville, AL; \nFort Lauderdale; Fort Myers; Orlando; St. Petersburg; in Atlanta, \nSavannah; Valdosta, GA; Lexington, KY; Greensboro, NC; Wilmington, NC; \nChattanooga, TN; Nashville,\n\n[[Page S11820]]\n\nTN; in Illinois, the Springfield capital security fencing is absolutely \nrequired that it be fixed. That money is not there unless this bill \npasses today. It will not be there until the second quarter of the \nfiscal year, at the earliest.\n  In Minnesota, there is a firefighting building provided for. I \nbelieve that is very much associated with security.\n  When we go through all of these, Ohio has the largest number of \nsecurity requirements in the country that are funded by this bill. In \nRacine, WI, there are obstructions on the field that must be removed. \nIt has one of the highest priorities in the country to deal with this.\n  I made a mistake; I said Ohio had the highest number. California has \nthe highest number of security requirements and facilities that are \nfunded by this bill.\n  Mr. President, the question comes down to, ``How can we get this bill \nup?'' There are ways, Mr. President, that we can delay the present bill \nuntil the FAA bill is brought up. I do not want to do that. I \nappreciate, as I have already said, the work done by the leaders of our \nAppropriations Committee, and the joint leadership of the Congress, to \nsee to it that there is no hiatus in funding in terms of our National \nGovernment at this time.\n  But the FAA bill comes before us when the country has been rocked \nwith aviation tragedies. ValuJet is just starting to fly today. That \nreminds all of us of the tragedy in Florida. We still have the \nunexplained TWA Flight 800. We have all kinds of speculation concerning \nthat. In the wake of the tragedy, the White House had a commission \nchaired by the Vice President. Many of those recommendations are in our \nbill. We have added to them considerably.\n  But, clearly, the explosive detection devices are No. 1 in regard to \nour joint effort to find a way to upgrade our security at our Nation's \nairports.\n  Mr. President, there is a small group of Senators that are delaying \nthis bill because of one provision. It is just as easy for them to come \nin here next year and repeal that. That will not be difficult. If they \nhave the votes to repeal it, they can repeal it next year.\n  The idea of delaying the safety of the Nation over one amendment--I \nmust say, it was an amendment offered on the other side of the aisle, \nwhich most of us on this side of the aisle supported, but it is a \nprovision that corrects a technicality in the law. And the law that was \npassed by Congress, as I understand it, was a mistake in the law.\n  But, in any event, why this bill? Why can't these Senators find a way \nto meet their objectives without putting the Nation's safety at risk?\n  I want the Senate to know that if this bill does not pass, I am going \nto see to it that the survivor of every victim gets the personal \ntelephone number of the people that oppose this bill. I urge people \ninvolved in this victims' rights committee to get on the phone and call \nthese people right now.\n  There is no reason for this delay. We have tried our best to work out \na problem here with regard to aviation safety, and it is the basic \nproblem which brought us to the point that we are here today; that is, \nthat we were in disagreement as to how to finance future additions to \nthe trust fund. There was no dispute among Members of the Senate over \nwhat we had to do to meet the security requirements, or what we had to \ndo to find a way to increase funding. It was as to how we were to do \nit.\n  We have had disagreements whether we should have taxes, or whether we \nshould have a new entity that replaces the aviation trust fund, or \nwhether we should have new fees and find new funding mechanisms. The \nquestion was not whether we needed more money to modernize our system \nand improve safety, and particularly deal with the increased terrorist \nthreat. The question was how to get that money. That is a separate \nissue, but it is not the issue that is delaying this bill.\n\n  What is delaying this bill is about three sentences in the bill that \ndeal with an error which was made in the ICC bill passed through the \nCongress. I understand that some people are very disturbed about that. \nI have heard from some people in my State who are very disturbed about \nthat. But my answer to them has been, look, this bill means Juneau will \nreopen. This means that the people who are in these areas where the \nmoney will run out will not face a closure of their airports as Juneau \nhas been placed--it means that the essential air services will \ncontinue. And we will not have to notify the people in 170 villages in \nmy State that, ``I am sorry, you can't have Christmas transportation \nbecause the money has run out. Two or three Senators objected to a \nbill.''\n  There is a procedure here, Mr. President, so that we can continue. I \nask the leadership to join together and notify us. We will stay in \nsession until we pass the FAA bill. A procedure has to be followed. It \nis a cloture procedure. It can take a series of days, and it will be a \nsevere inconvenience to many Senators. But what is inconvenience to the \nSenators as compared to having additional crashes in this country?\n  I usually don't speak--I do speak loudly and angrily, but I do not \nspeak with such personal involvement, Mr. President. I cannot conceive \nthat anyone would stand in the way of passing legislation that might--I \ncan't say it will, but it might--lead to the installation of safety \nequipment which would prevent an aircraft crash in this country.\n  I intend to be back and back. I seek the assurance of the leadership \nthat we will stay in session to pass this bill. It means tomorrow, \nWednesday, and probably Thursday before we can get it done. But this \nSenator is prepared. And I am a candidate. I would like to go home. I \nam prepared to stay here as long as it takes to convince these Senators \nthat we have the authority in our rules to go around two or three \nSenators to get a bill passed. It may well be that.\n  I also urge leadership not to accept the objection of any absent \nSenator. Two of these Senators are not here, and they are sending in \nobjections. I am going to start reading off their names the next time. \nIf I have to come to the floor, starting tomorrow I am going to talk \nabout the Senators personally who are obstructing the passage of a bill \nthat is absolutely necessary in the interest of the safety of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my colleague \nfrom Alaska, I agree with 99 percent of what he had to say. What \nhappened, Mr. President, is that in conference on this very vital \nbill--and the Senator from Alaska is correct when he says this is a \nvital bill--in conference, a matter where the Congress injects itself \ninto a labor-management issue of one corporation, an amendment that was \ndefeated 10 to 10 in Appropriations Committee when it came up.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What was that?\n  Mr. SIMON. This is the labor-management issue that was added on. And \njust so there is no misunderstanding, Mr. President, I will introduce \nfor myself and Senator Kennedy the FAA bill with this provision \nstripped. I am just going to leave it at the desk. I am not asking \nunanimous consent to move it ahead.\n  Clearly, this ought to pass, but we should not at the last minute \nwith using the cover of FAA inject ourselves into a labor-management \nissue that has been rejected by Congress before, and all of a sudden in \nthe last minute we are trying to get it passed. That is not the way to \ndo things. We ought to have hearings. If Congress wants to get in the \nmiddle of this labor-management fight, let us do it after hearings; let \nus do it very, very carefully.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a couple of ways for the Senate \nto resolve this issue. One is a cloture vote that prevails, and the \nother is for the provision that is currently in the legislation to be \nwithdrawn.\n  I want to point out that the Congress, in my judgment, does not have \nthe luxury of adjourning and leaving\n\n[[Page S11821]]\n\nthis session of Congress not having resolved this issue.\n  Mr. SIMON. I agree with my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with the Senators from Alaska and Illinois, and \nothers who are dealing with the question of aviation safety and \naviation security. We have worked on this bill for a long, long while.\n  This bill is critically important. Whatever needs to be done must be \ndone, because I am joining the Senator from Alaska and others to \nprevent the Congress from finishing its work if they believe that they \ncan allow this Congress to end its session without advancing this bill. \nThis bill needed to be done this year. It must be done now. Whatever \ncan be done to resolve this issue has to be done soon.\n  I heard the Senator from Alaska on Saturday come to the floor. I also \nspoke a bit on this. I talked to Senator Lott, the majority leader. I \nhave talked to the minority leader. I visited with Senator McCain this \nmorning, who has a role in this. I visited half a dozen times with \nSenator Wendell Ford of Kentucky.\n  We must solve this problem. The failure to do so will mean that this \nwill not be a very orderly ending to this session because this involves \nthe safety and security of the people who fly in this country. This \nCongress cannot end its work without solving this issue.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I could not agree more with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota. The question is, Are we going to take some amendment \nthat was not either in the House bill or the Senate bill where we move \nin and say we are going to take sides in a labor/management dispute? I \nfrankly do not know whether the corporation or the labor union is \nright. But I do not think we ought to be moving ourselves into the \nmiddle of this thing. So, Mr. President, I offer this bill on behalf of \nSenator Kennedy and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I certainly will yield to the Senator from Arizona, but \nI just want to say passage of that bill will kill the bill. The House \nis not in session.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me express my deep disappointment that \nthe Senator from Illinois would do this at this time. I am a great \nadmirer and friend of the Senator from Illinois, but I am telling you, \nI say this in all candor to the Senator from Illinois, you are putting \nin jeopardy the very lives of American citizens who fly on airlines \ntoday. You know that this was a simple mistake, a drafting error, in \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 that is \nbeing corrected here. That is why the Senator from Kentucky, the \nSenator from North Dakota, the Senator from South Carolina, and all of \nus on the committee literally unanimously supported this amendment.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, you are going to cause grave \ndanger not only to American citizens, the men and women and families \nwho will be making use of the airlines as passengers both domestically \nand internationally, but you will also prevent the much-needed funding \nfor airport improvements and security all over America including the \nState of Illinois. I'm talking about over $9 billion annually for \nnational needs such as air traffic control; repair, maintenance, and \nmodernization of our air traffic control equipment; repair and \nconstruction of runways, taxiways, and other vital aviation \ninfrastructure; the purchase of critical firefighting equipment at our \nNation's airports and the list goes on and on.\n  In fact, I will show the Senator from Illinois--and I will be glad to \nyield to him for a response. The Senator from Illinois should \nunderstand that in his State there is over $25 million in funding for \nimprovements in the aviation system in his State which is badly needed. \nI do not believe there would be that $25 million, over $25 million, in \nimprovements which are badly needed in his State, which he is now \nplacing in jeopardy by not allowing this aviation funding bill to go \nforward.\n  I understand the clout that labor has on that side of the aisle. I \nunderstand that. I have seen it. I understand it. I know it. I am \nseeing it today in the form of a lot of television commercials that are \nbeing run all over the country in opposition to some of my friends on \nthis side of the aisle. But I say to the Senator from Illinois that he \nis making a very serious mistake here. The Senator from Illinois has \nhad a very distinguished career in the Senate. As I said, he has my \ntrue respect and friendship, and it is clear he has the respect of all \nour colleagues. The little thing we did with the bow ties the other day \nhere in the Senate Chamber was a graphic demonstration of the enormous \naffection in which we hold the Senator from Illinois.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois--and I will be glad to yield to him \nwithout losing my right to the floor in just a minute. I urge the \nSenator from Illinois not to get out in front on this. This is the \nSenator from Massachusetts doing; we all know it. We know it is the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who is leading the \nopposition to this. If the Senator from Massachusetts wants to come to \nthe floor and deny that, I will be more than happy to yield to him for \nthose purposes. But I urge the Senator from Illinois to understand that \nwhat we are talking about here is airline safety, airport security, \nensuring that our Nation's airports will be adequately funded, and most \nimportant providing for thorough reform, including long-term funding \nreform, of the FAA to secure the resources to ensure we continue to \nhave the safest, most efficient air transportation system in the world. \nI say to my friend from Illinois, that is what is so important in the \nFAA reauthorization bill--that is what is in this bill. We are talking \nabout the aviation safety and the lives of American citizens, millions \nand millions of whom are using our airlines each and every day. In fact \nby the year 2002, more than 800 million passengers per year will be \nflying the Nation's skies--a 35-percent increase over today's levels. \nWe are also talking about much-needed funding for the State of \nIllinois, the State of Arizona, the State of Kentucky, the State of \nAlaska, the State of South Carolina, the State of Massachusetts, and \nothers.\n\n  I also wish to remind the Senator from Illinois that in the FAA \nreauthorization conference, the amendment was proposed by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Hollings, not by myself or the Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Stevens, but it was Senator Hollings, strongly \nsupported by Senator Ford, who I think is unequaled in his advocacy for \nthe people he represents. I think it would be a serious mistake for you \nto continue in your opposition to this critical aviation safety \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield the floor to the \nSenator from Illinois without sacrificing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, as my colleague from Arizona knows, I have \ngreat respect for him and the significant contribution he has made in \nso many areas. Everything he says about the necessity for passing this \nbill is correct. But what we are doing in this labor-management \nprovision is bypassing the committee of jurisdiction.\n  I remind the Senator from Arizona--I do not think he was here when I \nmentioned it--this particular amendment was tried on the Appropriations \nCommittee, was defeated in a 10 to 10 vote in the Appropriations \nCommittee. It is a matter of real controversy. It injects the U.S. \nCongress into a labor-management dispute. I do not know which side is \nright, but I know that the committee of jurisdiction has not had a \nhearing on this; that the committee of jurisdiction has not acted, and \nall of a sudden we are adding this amendment.\n  I do not think that is the way we ought to legislate. As far as my \nfriend from Alaska saying the House is not in session, the House \ncontinues to be in session. They are not going to have any more votes. \nIf we pass this without this amendment, it will clear in the House \nwithout any objection whatsoever. The Senator from Arizona knows that. \nThe question is not whether the FAA bill should pass. The question is \nwhether it should pass while we insert ourselves into a labor-\nmanagement dispute that maybe someone in the Chamber knows more about \nthan I do. I do not know\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\nthat much about it. But I do not think we have any business getting \nourselves in the midst of that thing.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona allow me to \nask the Senator from Illinois a question without his losing his right \nto the floor?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend from Illinois, is he aware that this \npiece of legislation, on this amendment he is referring to, was in the \nICC statutory provisions prior to the reorganization and putting ICC in \nthe Department of Transportation?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have to tell you I do not know much about \nthe history of this at all other than I know we are injecting ourselves \ninto this labor-management dispute, which we should not be doing.\n\n  Mr. FORD. In the legislation also, I say to my friend from Illinois, \nthere is a statement which says that it shall not be narrowed or \nbroadened; it should remain the same. With that language as it relates \nto the transfer of ICC, that means everything will stay the same. The \nbill would not have gotten out of conference, in my judgment, if this \namendment had not been on it. Now we find, with an amendment on it, it \nmay not get through Congress. So all of us were in a catch-22 position. \nBut it is very obvious from the legal aspects--I am not a lawyer, but I \nam on the jury--all of the legal experts say that the express part of \nthe ICC has been used, has been used several times, has been tested.\n  So leaving this out of the legislation is what persuaded some of us \nto try to be helpful. I want to get the bill passed. I understand that. \nBut I think you will find that the scorched Earth policy is one that \nwill just keep us here for a while. The Senator from Alaska, even \nthough he is a candidate--he is up for reelection--is willing under the \ncircumstances to encourage his leadership for us to stay here.\n  The point is, does the fight get completed in a reasonable time or do \nwe have the fight prolonged? I hope, if we are going to have the fight, \nthat the Senator and his colleagues, the two or three others, whatever \nnumber it might be, give us an opportunity to have a cloture vote \ntomorrow and proceed with the passage of this legislation or the defeat \nof it. I hope he will get in that posture so we can do these things the \nbill purports to do and we can go on home.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague will yield for 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from \nIllinois without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am not trying to obstruct this thing. I hope we can work \nout a reasonable answer. I think the reasonable answer is that this \npiece of labor-management legislation ought to be considered by the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee when the Senate comes back into \nsession, not stuck on a bill that was neither in the House nor the \nSenate. All of a sudden we are injecting ourselves. I do not think that \nis the way to legislate.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I finally ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator \nfrom South Dakota for 1 minute without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senators from \nKentucky and Arizona for their great efforts and to say I will \ncertainly stay here as long as it takes to pass this bill.\n  This bill is critical to pass. In my little State of South Dakota, \nfor example, we have all the essential airport funding, we have the \nFederal Aviation flight service, and small States that have small \nairports depend on the airport trust fund. This will be a disaster to \nair safety across the United States. It will be a disaster to \neverything we have been talking about since the major air crashes that \nhave occurred, if we cannot pass this bill.\n  I am privileged to chair the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee. Our committee, on a bipartisan basis, on a motion from our \nranking member, agreed to this amendment. It was a bipartisan effort. \nWe must pass this bill. We have worked it out in our committee. It was \na long-fought, hard-fought bill, and we must pass it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, without whose leadership and \nwithout whose enormous efforts we would not be where we are. Have no \ndoubt, Mr. President, about the magnitude of this bill. In less than 14 \nhours the Federal Government's authority to provide critical funding to \nairports across the country and our national air transportation system, \nincluding safety and security, will expire, unless we pass the FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  Before the Senator from Kentucky leaves, I wish to thank him for \neverything he has done. His efforts are inspiring to us all.\n  You know, Mr. President, the lesson in this legislation is that \nwithout bipartisan effort, including working with the Administration, \nespecially Ms. Linda Daschle, the Deputy Administrator of the FAA, we \nwould not have this legislation before us. It was truly a pure, \nbipartisan effort, a product of 2 years of hard work, compromise, and \nliterally hundreds and hundreds of hours of meetings. I believe that we \ncannot--we cannot allow it to be derailed at this time. This would be \nunconscionable.\n  To start with, I want to correct my previous statement to the Senator \nfrom Illinois. I am sorry he has had to leave the floor. I was wrong in \n$25 million. The real number is, for the State of Illinois is more than \n$30 million which will be authorized for the State of Illinois. \nSpecifically: $9 million is for Chicago O'Hare Airport, $1.8 million is \nfor Chicago Midway Airport, $1.1 million is for Quad-City Airport in \nMoline, $860,000 is for greater Peoria Airport, $690,000 is for the \nUniversity of Illinois in Champagne/Urbana, $670,000 is for the Capital \nAirport in Springfield, $525,000 is for Bloomington Airport, $500,000 \nis for Greater Rockford Airport, $500,000 is for Decatur Airport, \n$500,000 is for Merrill C. Meigs Airport in Chicago, $500,000 is for \nQuincy Municipal Airport, $500,000 is for Williamson County Airport in \nMarion--the list goes on and on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the primary airport projects for fiscal \nyear 1997 that will require entitlement funding for the State of \nIllinois, which is now being placed in jeopardy, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                1997 final entitlements                         \n Rank and LOCID       Airport        City and State      PFC       after adjustments            Conference      \n                                                                         (Est.)                                 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 ORD..........

Let us also be very clear. According to the Senate \nFinance Committee, absolutely no money can be spent out of the aviation \ntrust fund without passage of this bill. Title X of the bill provides \nauthority for money to be spent out of the aviation trust fund. That \nmeans--I want to repeat for the benefit of my colleagues--no money for \naviation safety; airport security; air traffic control repair, \nmaintenance, and modernization; repair and construction of runways, \ntaxiways, and other vital aviation infrastructure, the purchase of \nfirefighting equipment at our airports, Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, \nAirborne Collision Avoidance Systems, and research and development of \nnew explosive detection equipment, can not be spent without this bill \nbeing passed. There is a great deal at stake here.\n  I emphasize, again, this is not a partisan bill. This is a bill that \nwas worked out with the full cooperation of the administration, \nincluding the White House, the Department of Transportation, the \nFederal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Defense, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and others--a partnership with \nSenator Ford, Senator Hollings, and the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Pressler. But I say to my colleagues that we will not make very \ncritical and vital changes to aviation safety and security and thorough \nreform of the FAA unless we pass this bill.\n  Again, I point out that the technical correction amendment, which was \nput on the bill by the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, \nin conference, was to correct a drafting error in the Interstate \nCommerce Commission Termination Act of 1995, that is acknowledged to \nhave been a mistake and nothing else. It should have been included in \nthe original ICC bill.\n  Let us have no illusion about what is going on here. What is going on \nhere is that organized labor is flexing their muscles so they can \nprevent a technical correction which is being made to correct a \ndrafting error that was made in previous legislation. Let us have no \ndoubt--no doubt at all what we are talking about here.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that we talk about what is \nbeing included in this bill as far as aviation safety and security is \nconcerned. It ensures that the FAA and our Nation's airports, as I \nmentioned, will be adequately funded. I'm talking about over $9 million \nannually for national aviation related needs such as air traffic \ncontrol. But some of the other critical aspects of this legislation are \nthat it directs the National Transportation Safety Board to establish a \nprogram to provide for adequate notification of and advocacy services \nfor the families of victims of aircraft accidents.\n  I think we know the problems associated with the recent TWA 800 \nexplosion in New York and the ValuJet crash in Miami and how mishandled \nthe notification was to the families in these tragedies. We need to \ncorrect that now. We do not need to wait until next year or the year \nafter. We need to correct the problem, and we do it in this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation will enhance airline and air travelers' safety by \nrequiring airlines to share employment and performance records before \nhiring new pilots.\n  We do this in this bill. We found out, in a previous accident of an \nAmerican Airlines commuter aircraft, that a pilot did not have adequate \ntraining of the kind that was necessary to make sure that the lives of \nthe passengers were not endangered. Indeed, they were all killed. One \nof the reasons, in the conclusions of the National Transportation \nSafety Board, was that American Airlines did not have sufficient access \nto their employment and performance records from a previous employment \nwith another airline.\n  Additionally, this legislation will make sure that the FAA gives high \npriority to implement a fully enhanced safety analysis system, \nincluding automated surveillance. It bolsters weapons and explosive \ndetection technology through research and development. It improves \nstandards for airport security, passenger baggage and property \nscreeners, including requiring criminal history records checks. It \nrequires the FAA to facilitate quick deployment of commercially \navailable explosive detection equipment. It contains a sense of the \nSenate on the development of effective passenger profiling programs. It \nrequires the NTSB and the FAA to work together to develop a system to \nclassify aircraft accident and safety data maintained by the National \nTransportation Safety Board and publish such data. The American public \ndeserves to know what the safety record is of the airline that they fly \non. That is part of this bill.\n\n  It requires all air carriers and airports to conduct periodic \nvulnerability assessments of security systems. It requires the FAA and \nthe FBI to carry out a joint threat and vulnerability assessments every \n3 years. It authorizes airports to use project grant money and \npassenger facility charges for airport security programs. It requires \nthe FAA to study and report to Congress on whether certain air carrier \nsecurity responsibilities should be transferred to or shared with \nairports or the Federal Government. This is just a few of the many \nsafety and security related items that this legislation does.\n  I do not think there is anybody who believes that the present airport \nsecurity procedures are adequate. That is not a conclusion that I \nreach; it is the conclusion that every outside aviation expert makes. \nThere have been many hearings in the House and the Senate regarding \nthis. Mr. President, we have to move forward with these critical safety \nand security provisions now.\n  Who should be responsible for airport security? I think it is very \nclear that it should not be the airlines. The bill requires the \nNational Transportation Safety Board to take action to help families of \nvictims following commercial aircraft accidents, as I pointed out \nearlier. How can anyone in this body wish to stop this legislation from \ngoing forward.\n  Let me just read, since we are talking about labor unions, since that \nis what is holding up this bill. I have a letter which was addressed to \nme from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which is a \nmember of the AFL-CIO.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Air Traffic Controllers \n     Association (NATCA) supports the personnel reform language \n     contained within. * * * The Air Traffic Control system \n     continues to crumble and the safety of the system is in the \n     balance. Your bill provides the funding stream necessary to \n     modernize the system that is need of repair.\n       [This bill] provides for continuation of collective \n     bargaining agreements, representational status for NATCA and \n     other unions and provides for the duty to bargain in good \n     faith. Your bill allows the employees who will have to live \n     and work under the new system the ability to develop the \n     system. Thank you for drafting a bill which will provide the \n     necessary reform to modernize the FAA and make it more \n     responsive to the users.\n\n  Signed by Mike McNally, the executive vice president of the National \nAir Traffic Controllers Association.\n  This flies in the face of what some segments of organized labor are \ntrying to do today in derailing this critical aviation legislation. I \nwas pleased to have the opportunity of working with the National Air \nTraffic Controllers Association and those dedicated and outstanding men \nand women who sometimes operate under conditions of the most severe \nstress imaginable.\n  Here is a letter from the National Transportation Safety Board to \nChairman Pressler. I will not read the whole letter. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter, and the previous letter from the National Air \nTraffic Controllers Association, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Air Traffic Controllers\n\n\n                                     Association MEBA/AFL-CIO,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 9, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Air Traffic Controllers \n     Association (NATCA) supports the personnel reform language \n     contained within S. 1239. The association believes that \n     providing the exclusive bargaining representatives with full \n     bargaining rights over the development of a new personnel \n     system provides a fair platform that will benefit the agency, \n     the employees and ultimately the users of the air traffic \n     control system.\n       We are aware of other efforts in substitution of S. 1239 \n     and fear that these attempts, with all good intentions, may \n     further delay FAA Reform that is desperately\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\n     needed at this time. The Air Traffic Control system continues \n     to crumble and the safety of the system is in the balance. \n     Your bill provides the funding stream necessary to modernize \n     the system that is in need of repair. We will be working with \n     hope that S. 1239 succeeds the mark up and are encouraging \n     the committee members to assist in this endeavor.\n       NATCA applauds your efforts to reform the air traffic \n     control system. It has been a long in coming and it took your \n     leadership to finally make it a reality.\n       Your bill provides the flexibility the FAA needs to meet \n     the demands of the 21st century while protecting the \n     interests of the men and women who operate the air traffic \n     control system. Union support provides for continuation of \n     collective bargaining agreements, representational status for \n     NATCA and other unions and provides for the duty to bargain \n     in good faith. Your bill allows the employees who will have \n     to live and work under the new system the ability to develop \n     the system.\n       Thank you for drafting a bill which will provide the \n     necessary reform to modernize the FAA and make it more \n     responsive to the users.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Mike McNally,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                         National Transportation Safety Board,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: It is my understanding that \n     tomorrow the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation will mark up S. 1239, the Air Traffic \n     Management System Performance Improvement Act of 1995. \n     Although the full Board has not taken a position on this \n     legislation, I did want to share my personal views with you.\n       As Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, I \n     see on a daily basis the immense job the Federal Aviation \n     Administration has to accomplish. The competition for funds \n     during a period of tighter federal budgets, the need to \n     anticipate and justify future staffing requirements annually, \n     and the protracted process for procurement of new equipment, \n     are all factors that can degrade efficiency and affect the \n     ability of the system to respond to new demands and new \n     technology. I believe the reforms in S. 1239 remedy this \n     deficiency, without taking the aviation trust fund off \n     budget, and I hope the Commerce Committee will fully support \n     this bill.\n       Many of the safety enhancing actions identified by the \n     Board in the past have required research, development, \n     procurement and installation programs that span several \n     years. Examples are Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, Airborne \n     Collision Avoidance Systems, airport surface surveillance and \n     conflict detection equipment. Many of these programs have \n     experienced development and installation schedule slippages. \n     So, too, has the FAA's air traffic control system \n     modernization programs. It is difficult for the Board to \n     determine the role of budget planning in these slippages; \n     however, it is obvious that the need to justify budgets and \n     establish priorities during this period when the Federal \n     government must tighten budgets could have an impact on \n     significant safety programs. This bill would ensure the \n     continuation of that funding in a fiscally responsible \n     manner.\n       Mr. Chairman, we take great pride that America's aviation \n     industry is the safest in the World. Without a predictable \n     source of funds, there is the potential that new safety-\n     related technical systems may be delayed, degrading that \n     safety. The FAA, the agency responsible for the \n     implementation and administration of these systems, believes \n     that this bill will greatly improve the prospects for the \n     acquisition of these critically important safety systems. I \n     concur in their judgement on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jim Hall,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to repeat what the National Transportation Safety \nBoard is saying about this legislation, so the opponents, the ones who \nare trying to hold up this bill and perhaps derail it, understand what \nis at stake here. I want to repeat it so it is perfectly clear to my \ncolleagues and to the American public who want this legislation to move \nforward.\n  I quote from the letter to chairman Pressler from the National \nTransportation Safety Board:\n\n       Without a predictable source of funds, there is the \n     potential that new safety-related technical systems may be \n     delayed, degrading that safety. The FAA, the agency \n     responsible for the implementation and administration of \n     these systems, believes that this bill will greatly improve \n     the prospects for the acquisition of these critically \n     important safety systems. I concur in their judgement on this \n     matter.\n\n  Signed by J. Hall, the Chairman of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard.\n  I am not supporting this bill because I put in 2 years of hard work \nwith Senator Ford, Senator Hollings, Senator Pressler, Senator Stevens, \nLinda Daschle, David Hinson, Secretary Pena, Jim Hall, the National Air \nTraffic Controllers Association, the Air Transport Association, the Air \nFreight Association, and people like my friend from North Dakota, \nSenator Dorgan, who has played such a key and important role in \nensuring not only airline safety but also the access to airline service \nin smaller States. Few have been a stronger supporter of the Essential \nAir Service Program which remains a lifeline for many small \ncommunities. This bill has the funding tools in place that will be \nvital for financing this program in the future.\n  I am not talking about all that. I have worked on other issues that \ntook a long period of time and have failed. That has been sort of one \nof the difficulties I have had around here from time to time.\n  What I am talking about is the safety and security of all Americans. \nIf the Senator from Massachusetts, who I am sorry is not here on the \nfloor, wants to lead the opposition, then the American people should \nknow whose responsibility it is that we do not pass this legislation. \nWhat a small minority finds objectionable is a correction, a technical \ncorrection, to a drafting error which was contained in the Interstate \nCommerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 that was passed, that \neverybody recognized was written incorrectly. That is what we are \ntalking about here. If we do not pass this legislation and get it done \nsoon--in fact, by midnight tonight, in less than 14 hours--then \ncritical funding will be cut off to airports across the country and our \nnational air transportation system will expire. And I fear, frankly, \nfor what can happen in the future and, frankly, I do not want to have \nthat responsibility.\n  Finally, I will probably be back on the floor on this issue. I \nstrongly urge my colleague from Illinois, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect and affection, I strongly urge my other colleagues to \nunderstand what is at stake here and for us to get this legislation \ndone as quickly as possible and not worry about a small technical \ncorrection to a drafting error that is all that is involved here.\n  So, I will be back--I hope not to be back on this issue. But I, like \nmy colleague from Alaska, do not intend to allow the Senate to go out \nof session until we have this issue resolved, and will use every \nparliamentary method available to me to make sure that we address this \nbill and pass it.\n  I have had a conversation with the distinguished majority leader on \nthis issue. I know he shares my view of the importance and criticality \nof this legislation. I hold every hope and aspiration that we will have \nthis issue resolved as quickly as possible.\n  Again, expressing my deep appreciation to all of the individuals, all \nof the different entities that have been involved in shaping this \nlegislation that took us over two years, I am not about to see it \nderailed at this point because of a minor objection that really has \nvery little, if any, relevance to the importance of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 3 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from North Dakota \nfor 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11819-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11824-S11825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STILL TIME TO PASS BILLS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

We certainly must pass the FAA \nbill, and I am hopeful we can do so, while resolving the one \ncontroversial area that remains. We heard the Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, say the House is out of session, implying that they \ncouldn't act if the legislation was stripped of the controversial \npiece. We heard the Senator from Illinois say, ``Untrue, the House is \nstill there, they\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\ncould take action.'' We need to find out the truth, we need to find out \nthe answer, and we need to move forward.\n  Madam President, we have a wonderful opportunity yet remaining in the \nwaning hours to pass the Presidio parks bill. After much dedicated work \non both sides of the aisle over in the House and with the \nadministration on Friday and Saturday, the House passed a Presidio \nparks bill with many important parts for this country in it. There is \nonly one body that has to act on this bill, and that is the U.S. \nSenate. If we can all agree, we can pass, by unanimous consent, this \nPresidio parks bill.\n  As I understand it, it includes many wonderful projects all over this \ncountry. It would be an environmental gift for the people of this \ncountry, and I can tell you that my leader, Senator Daschle, expressed \nto me his great interest in seeing us do it, and from the remarks of \nthe majority leader, Senator Lott, I feel very optimistic that we can.\n  From the East to the West, the North and the South, there are parts \nin this bill that I think we all want. Does everybody get everything he \nor she might want? Of course not. It is never possible. The Presidio \nparks bill is one of great compromise, even on the issue that I care so \nmuch about.\n  On the Presidio itself, we had to compromise. So I don't think any \nMember can say it is a perfect bill. There may be something in there \nyou don't love, and there may be something not included in there you \nwant included, but I think we do have an opportunity to do something \nfor the American people and go home and be extremely proud. The \nPresidio Park will become a jewel of the National Park System, and the \nlegislation encompasses a wonderful idea that really was brought to the \ntable from the Pennsylvania Avenue Corporation when we remodeled and \nrejuvenated Pennsylvania Avenue, and it is a board of trustees totally \nnonprofit with experts in real estate and experts in historic \npreservation sitting on it and overseeing it.\n  Congresswoman Pelosi has worked so hard on this--I used to represent \nthe Presidio when I was in the House--as well as Congressman George \nMiller, Senator Feinstein, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Chafee and \nmany others. I do hope that we can pass the parks bill by unanimous \nconsent, but I have asked my leader to keep us here, because I do \nbelieve if we had to vote on a cloture motion, we could carry that \ncloture vote, and we would overwhelmingly pass this parks bill.\n\n  Madam President, I hope we can do it quickly, but, if not, I hope we \nwill stay here and work for the American people, resolve the FAA \nproblem, resolve this parks bill, pass this continuing resolution and \ngo home feeling proud that we have a safer Nation, we have a stronger \nNation, and we have a more beautiful Nation.\n  Thank you very much. I now yield to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11824-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11825-S11828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE CLINTON RECORD AND SENATOR DOLE'S ECONOMIC AGENDA\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have now come to what may be the last \nday of the congressional session. Perhaps it will take another day or \ntwo for Congress to adjourn.\n  I would just like to observe that this is what we have been handed on \nthe final day. I do not know how many pages are here. I assume it is at \nleast a thousand pages. We are handed this massive bill--that few of us \nhave seen--because once again Congress has failed to do its job on \ntime.\n  Here we are on the eve of the next fiscal year, and six \nappropriations bills have to be rolled into one in order to prevent a \nshutdown of Government. Madam President, this is not the way to do \nbusiness. I doubt there are very many Members who have any idea what is \nin this omnibus consolidated appropriations bill. I certainly do not.\n  We got this stack this morning. We are going to vote, they tell us, \nsometime this evening. You know, I am a pretty fast reader, but I do \nnot think I can get this job done in time to make any kind of reasoned \njudgment on what is included. This is not the way we ought to do our \nbusiness.\n  Madam President, it does seem to me to be an appropriate time to \nreview the record of what has happened over the last several years. I \nwould just like to start with the question of deficit reduction, \nbecause we hear a lot of talk about who is conservative and who is not \nconservative. Frankly, I do not think it matters so much who is \nliberal, who is conservative; I think what the American people are \ninterested in is who gets results, because that is at the end of the \nday what really matters.\n  If we look at our last three Presidents on the question of the \ndeficits, the results are now very clear. We look back to 1981, \nPresident Reagan inherited a deficit of about $79 billion. Very quickly \nthe deficit skyrocketed to over $200 billion, and it was stuck at that \nfigure for most of his term. At the end of President Reagan's term we \nsaw some slight improvement, but still the deficit was about twice as \nhigh as the deficit he had inherited. So it is not surprising that the \nAmerican debt grew dramatically during those years.\n  Then, of course, came the Bush administration. President Bush \ninherited a deficit of $153 billion, and it promptly went out of \ncontrol. In the last year of the Bush Presidency, the deficit was up to \n$290 billion.\n  Then President Clinton came in, and in each and every year of the \nClinton administration, the deficit has gone down; $255 billion the \nfirst year, down to $116 billion this year. So the President has done \nan outstanding job of deficit reduction.\n  Some have said, ``Well, he doesn't really deserve any credit.'' It is \ninteresting to look at what an impartial observer says. The head of the \nFederal Reserve, Chairman Greenspan, says the deficit reduction in \nPresident Clinton's 1993 economic plan was ``an unquestioned factor in \ncontributing to the improvement in economic activity that occurred \nthereafter.'' Certainly Mr. Greenspan is correct.\n  We passed in 1993 an economic plan that cut spending and that raised \nrevenue, and that in combination reduced the budget deficit. Because \nthe deficit was coming down, interest rates came down, and economic \nactivity increased. Mr. Greenspan says that plan was ``an unquestioned \nfactor in contributing to the improvement in economic activity that \noccurred thereafter.''\n  Perhaps this is an appropriate time to start looking at the record. \nWhat did happen? Well, one of the things we often talk about is the \nmisery index. The misery index is a measure of unemployment and \ninflation.\n  Look what has happened to the misery index over the last 28 years. We \nhave the lowest misery index now, after 4 years of the Clinton \nadministration, the lowest misery index in 28 years.\n  The good news does not stop there. We have also seen strong economic \ngrowth under the Clinton administration. Real private-sector economic \ngrowth, under the Bush administration, averaged 1.3 percent. Under the \nClinton administration, real private-sector GDP growth has averaged 3.2 \npercent; a very good record and a dramatic improvement over what we \nhave seen previously.\n  Real business fixed investment. I think one of the best measures of \nwhether an economic plan is successful is what happens to real business \nfixed investment. We can see that under President Clinton, we have the \nbest rate of increase in real business fixed investment of any \nPresident since World War II. If we look at the last 4 years--since the \nClinton administration took control, since we passed the 1993 economic \nplan--we see a dramatic increase in business fixed investment, in fact, \nthe best record that we have seen in decades.\n  President Clinton delivered on his promise to reduce the deficit--we \ncan all recall he said he would cut it in half. It was $290 billion in \nthe year before he took office. He has more than met that promise. He \nhas reduced the deficit to $116 billion, a 60-percent reduction.\n  That is not the only promise he has delivered on with his economic \nplan. He said his plan would deliver 8 million new jobs. But instead, \nwe now have over 10 million new jobs created during the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Let me just turn to one other matter because unemployment is also a \nvery significant measuring point as to how well an economic plan is \ndoing.\n  Back in December 1992, before Bill Clinton came into office, the \nunemployment rate in this country was 7.3\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\npercent--7.3 percent. In June of this year it was down to 5.3 percent, \na dramatic reduction in unemployment. In fact, we now know the \nunemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent in August 1996. That is the \nlowest level of unemployment that we have had in 7 years.\n  Last week we got more good news with respect to what was happening in \nthe economy. The Census Bureau issued its analysis of what has been \noccurring. What we found is that incomes have been going up and poverty \nhas been coming down, another good measure of whether or not an \neconomic plan is working. In fact, what we saw was that median \nhousehold income is up the largest increase in a decade.\n  We saw the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years.\n  We saw 1.6 million fewer people in poverty, the largest drop in 27 \nyears.\n  We saw the poverty rate for elderly Americans at 10.5 percent, its \nlowest level ever, lowest level ever in terms of the number of elderly \nliving in poverty; again, I think a good measure of how well this \nClinton economic plan has worked.\n  I might say, I was proud to have voted for that plan. We had a tie \nvote here in the U.S. Senate, broken by a vote of the Vice President of \nthe United States. Our friends on the other side of the aisle said this \neconomic plan, the results of which I have just reported on, would \ncrater the economy. That was their commentary at the time. They said it \nwould increase the deficit. They said it would increase interest rates. \nThey said it would increase unemployment. They were wrong on every \ncount. They were wrong on every single count.\n  Madam President, we have seen the results of the Clinton economic \nplan. I think that raises the question of what would the Dole economic \nplan do?\n  Senator Dole, running for President, has said that he has a plan, and \nthe cornerstone of that plan is a $550 billion tax cut. I thought, in \norder to put in perspective what the Dole plan is likely to do, that we \nought to look ahead to the next 6 years, because his plan covers the \nnext 6 years.\n  It is very interesting. If one looks at what we are facing in the \nnext 6 years, from 1997 to 2002, this is the projected spending of the \nUnited States under current law. We would spend $11.3 trillion. But \nthis is our income. Our income is only $9.9 trillion. So we are going \nto be adding $1.4 trillion to the national debt--debt held by the \npublic.\n  The first thing Senator Dole says we ought to do is cut the revenue \nanother $550 billion, reducing it to $9.4 trillion. So, now the gap \nbetween income and outgo is bigger. He is digging the hole deeper \nbefore he starts filling it in. He is adding to the debt. That is going \nin precisely the wrong direction.\n  If one looks at what is necessary for an economic plan to add up, one \nfinds the following: We would need $584 billion of spending cuts \nnecessary to balance the unified budget. That includes all spending and \nall revenues--that is the unified budget. That includes the Social \nSecurity surpluses that we are scheduled to run over the next 6 years. \nSo we would need $584 billion of spending cuts in order to balance the \nunified budget. But Senator Dole says he wants a $551 billion tax cut. \nSo now we would need $1.1 trillion of cuts in order to balance the \nunified budget and prevent adding to the debt held by the public over \nthis next 6-year period.\n  It does not stop there. Senator Dole's plan assumes that he is going \nto count all of the Social Security surpluses over the next 6 years to \nhelp balance the budget. That is $525 billion of Social Security \nsurpluses. Now, if we were really going to honestly balance this \nbudget, we would need the $584 billion of spending cuts just to balance \nthe unified budget, then we need the $551 billion to cover his tax cut \nso we do not add to the debt, then we need another $525 billion so that \nwe are not raiding the Social Security trust funds. So now we need $1.6 \ntrillion in spending cuts.\n  Madam President, we will look at what Senator Dole is proposing and \nsee if he meets those tests. Does he come up with $1.1 trillion of cuts \nto prevent adding to the debt with his tax cut? Or does he honestly \nbalance with $1.6 trillion of cuts necessary to prevent raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund? What are the cuts he has come up with? Has \nhe come up with anything close to $1.1 trillion to prevent adding to \nthe debt to cover his tax cut, or to really do the job and have $1.6 \ntrillion of cuts to prevent raiding the Social Security trust fund?\n  Here is the spending that is outlined over the next 6 years under \ncurrent law. Social Security, $2.1 trillion, about 20 percent of \nprojected spending over the next 6 years. Interest on the debt, nearly \nas much, $2 trillion. Defense, $1.7 trillion. Of course, Senator Dole \nsays defense is off the table. He will not cut defense, he will not cut \nSocial Security. Medicare is $1.6 trillion projected over the next 6 \nyears. Medicaid, almost $1 trillion over the next 6 years. Other \nentitlements--student loans, food stamps, child nutrition--those are \nother entitlements. Then we have nondefense discretionary, which is \n$1.7 trillion over the next 6 years. Nondefense discretionary is roads, \nbridges, law enforcement, jails, parks--all of that is in nondefense \ndiscretionary.\n  Now, we will look for a moment at whether or not Senator Dole's plan \nadds up. Taking the savings he has talked about, he said he will take a \nsliver out of the $1.6 trillion of Medicare, and he has that savings of \n$158 billion. So that is in the cookie jar. We will see when we are \ndone if he has $1.1 trillion of cuts or the $1.6 trillion necessary to \nprevent raiding the Social Security trust fund. We have so far in the \ncookie jar $158 billion of Medicare cuts. He says on Medicaid, he will \ntake a sliver out of that, which is the equivalent to $72 billion, and \nwe will put that down and it is in the cookie jar. That is $72 billion \nof Medicaid cuts. He also says he will take a chunk out of other \nentitlements, which is right here. He will take a chunk out of this \nspending category. And, again, he is talking about $124 billion of \nother entitlements--again, that is child nutrition and a number of \nother areas we have talked about, including food stamps, Federal \nretirement, student loans. He has $124 billion there. We will put that \nin the cookie jar. Then he says he will cut nondefense discretionary. \nThat is one of his biggest cuts, nondefense discretionary. He has $300 \nbillion that we can put in the cookie jar out of nondefense \ndiscretionary spending.\n\n  What is nondefense discretionary spending? That is an area in which \nwe are projected to spend $1.7 trillion over the next 6 years. He has \n$300 billion in cuts out of that category. That is roads, bridges, \nairports, education, law enforcement. That is the biggest place he is \ncutting.\n  Does that make sense? Is that where we want to cut in this country--\neducation, roads, bridges, airports, law enforcement? Well, Senator \nDole says cut that $300 billion. He is not done yet because he also has \nsome interest savings, a little sliver of interest savings. That is $50 \nbillion of interest savings.\n  Then Senator Dole sees he is nowhere close to adding up so he goes \nback to the spending pie and he says, ``I have to take some more out of \n`other entitlements.' I have to take some more out of child nutrition, \nstudent loans. I have to take some more out of Federal retirement.'' So \nhe comes up with another $66 billion of other entitlements. But still \nhe is nowhere close to adding up. He is at about $750 billion so far, \nso he is way short of adding up to the $1.1 trillion necessary to keep \nfrom adding to the debt to finance his tax cuts. So he is way short.\n  What he does is go back to nondefense discretionary spending again, \nhits that again. Education, roads, bridges, airports, law enforcement, \nenvironmental protection. He says take another $150 billion out of that \ncategory and put it in the cookie jar.\n  Now, one can see he is drastically cutting this category of spending. \nSenator Dole started with $302 billion in nondefense discretionary \ncuts, and then he took another $150 billion out of this category. So he \nis up to $450 billion out of nondefense discretionary spending, which \nis $1.7 trillion to begin with. We are talking about cutting education, \nroads, bridges, airports, law enforcement, and jails by 30 percent in \nthe Dole economic plan. But still it does not add up. Still it does not \nadd up. If you add up all of what he has talked about cutting, he is \njust over $900 billion. And we showed on the previous chart that you \nneed $1.1 trillion in cuts in order to prevent adding to the debt \nbecause of his tax cut. And you need $1.6 trillion of cuts if you are \ngoing to avoid raiding the Social Security trust fund.\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\n  So if $1.1 trillion is the test, Senator Dole has a $200 billion gap \nhere in terms of spending cuts. Even with that, he has taken huge \nchunks out of education, roads, bridges, airports, law enforcement. He \nsays he is going to be tough on law enforcement, but he takes 30 \npercent of the money that we are projected to spend over the next 6 \nyears out of the category that law enforcement spending comes from. If \nhe is not going to cut law enforcement as much, he is going to have to \ncut education more. He is going to have to cut roads more or airports \nor bridges more. Still he is nowhere close to adding up.\n  Madam President, it just seems to me that the Dole plan is at least \n$200 billion short of adding up, and that even assumes that Senator \nDole is going to use all $525 billion of Social Security surpluses.\n  Well, it doesn't take an awful lot of mathematical calculation to \nfigure out the problem. We remember the last budget that was offered by \nhis party had $245 billion of tax cuts, and in order to help finance \nthat, they had $163 billion in reductions to Medicaid. All you have to \ndo to reality test here is ask what would be the Medicaid cuts \nnecessary to finance the bigger Dole tax cut? Because instead of a $245 \nbillion tax cut, he is now talking about a $550 billion tax cut. How \nbig would the Medicaid cuts have to be? They were $163 billion to \naccommodate a $245 billion tax cut. How big would they have to be to \naccommodate a $550 billion tax cut?\n  Domestic discretionary spending. The same way. Under the previous \nRepublican budget, they had $245 billion of tax cuts. They had domestic \ndiscretionary cuts of $440 billion. In order to accommodate the tax cut \nand move toward a balanced budget, how big would those domestic \ndiscretionary cuts have to be to accommodate a $550 billion tax cut?\n  The same question can be raised about Medicare. Medicare, they \nproposed reducing $270 billion. I know some say, well, it is not a cut. \nWell, how did they save $270 billion if it is not a cut? How did they \nsave $270 billion if they didn't cut anything? Of course, they cut \nsomething. They cut from what current law provides. Why? Because they \nneeded to accommodate their $245 billion tax cut and move toward a \nbalanced budget. How big would the Medicare cuts have to be if you are \ngoing to have a $550 billion tax cut instead of a $245 billion tax cut? \nObviously, something has to give here. Either the cuts have to be much \ndeeper, or the Dole plan is actually going to add to the deficit, add \nto the debt. That would be a profound mistake, in my judgment.\n  Senator Dole has said Social Security is off the table. Is it really? \nIs it really off the table? I showed the chart that indicated in his \nplan he is counting on using $525 billion of Social Security surpluses \nin the next 6 years in order to help move toward balance. Very \ninteresting. Madam President, $525 billion out of Social Security \nsurpluses and a $550 billion tax cut. Does that make any sense? Does it \nmake sense to take every penny of Social Security surplus and turn \nright around and give it out in terms of a tax cut--a tax cut that \ndisproportionately goes to the wealthiest among us?\n  You know, we hear that claim made. What is the evidence? So I had \nthis chart prepared. The Dole tax cuts--who benefits? Who are the big \nwinners? This looks at all of his tax cut plans put together. If you \nare in the under $10,000 a year category of income, and 19 percent of \nAmerican families are in that category, you get $5 on average. If you \nare in the $10,000 to $20,000 a year category, that is 21 percent of \nthe American people, you get $120 a year, $10 a month, on average. If \nyou are in the $20,000 to $30,000 category, about 16 percent of the \nAmerican people, you get $400 a year, about $30 a month, on average. \nLook at the top end here. The top 1 percent of the American people. \nThose earning over $200,000 a year. What do they get? Well, they get \nthe cake. They get, on average, $25,000 a year of tax reduction. Madam \nPresident, $25,000 a year of tax reduction.\n\n  So if you are in the 50 percent of the American people that have less \nthan $30,000 a year of income, you are going to get anywhere from $5 a \nyear to $30 a month, on average, at the top end of that scale. But if \nyou are up here and you earn over $200,000 a year, you are going to get \na $25,000 reduction, on average. Is that fair? Does that make any \nsense? Does it make any sense to add to the debt, add to the deficits, \nso we can give a $25,000 a year tax break to the top 1 percent, who \nearn over $200,000 a year? Is that what we ought to do in this country? \nDoes that make sense?\n  Does it make sense to take $525 billion of Social Security \nsurpluses--money we are going to need to get ready for when the baby \nboom generation retires, and give it all out in a tax cut, the vast \nmajority of which goes to people earning over $200,000 a year? Does \nthat make any sense? Does it make any sense to propose a plan that has \n$900 billion in spending cuts, when you need at least $1.1 trillion of \nspending cuts to accommodate Senator Dole's tax cut and not add to the \ndebt? And you would need $1.6 trillion of spending cuts not to raid the \nSocial Security trust fund. And he only comes up with $900 billion of \ncuts. The cuts he has come up with come out of nondefense discretionary \nspending. He is cutting that category 30 percent, even though his plan \ndoesn't add up. The part that he is really hammering is education, \nroads, bridges, airports, law enforcement, jail construction. Does that \nmake any sense for America's future?\n  Madam President, when one looks at where the money is going over the \nnext 6 years, it is very interesting. Defense spending $1.7 trillion. \nSocial Security $2.1 trillion. Interest on the debt $2 trillion. \nMedicare $1.6 trillion. Medicaid just under $1 trillion. This is where \nthe money is going. Other entitlements--that is child nutrition, \nstudent loans, that is food stamps, and nondefense discretionary, $1.7 \ntrillion, as I have said. That is education, roads, bridges, airports, \nlaw enforcement.\n  I just think we have to ask ourselves: What works? What do we know \nworks? We know, based on the evidence I provided earlier, that the \nClinton economic plan that we passed in 1993 has worked. It is \nundeniable. Four years in a row of deficit reduction. Let us go back to \nthe chart that we began with. I think it is a good place to end. We \nknow what works. The plan that we passed in 1993 reduced the deficit \nevery year for 4 years in a row. More than a 60 percent reduction. We \nneed to stay on that course, because we face the demographic time bomb \nof the baby boom generation. When they retire, the demands on Federal \nprograms are going to explode. That is why we need to stay on this \ncourse of deficit reduction. It is one reason that this course of \ndeficit reduction that is paid off so handsomely. Not only have we \nreduced the deficit but unemployment got reduced.\n  All of the things that you would like to see going up are going up. \nJobs are going up. Income is going up. Business investment is going up. \nThe things you would like to see going down are going down. Poverty is \ngoing down. Unemployment is going down. The deficit is going down.\n  This is a plan that has worked. And I believe it would be a profound \nmistake to go in this direction--this radical direction--that Senator \nDole has prescribed that clearly doesn't add up. Either he is going to \nhave much bigger cuts in things like education, Medicare, Medicaid, \nroads, or bridges that he has already outlined--and he has already \noutlined massive cuts in those areas--or he is going to absolutely \nexplode this deficit. And that would be a profound mistake for this \ncountry's future.\n  I hope over the coming weeks that we in this country will have a \nserious national debate about these issues because this is critical to \nAmerica's future. We have a chance to stay on course. We have an \nopportunity to keep moving this country in the right direction. I very \nmuch hope that, as we go through these last 5 weeks of the political \ncampaign, that the American people will keep in mind the progress that \nhas been made. We have made important progress--strengthening our \nnational economy. We cannot go back to a failed policy that put this \ncountry in the ditch once before, that exploded the deficits, that \nexploded the debt, and that weakened America; that put us in a \ncondition of economic decline against our competitors. That would be a \ntragedy.\n  Hopefully, we have learned from our failures of the past and the more \nrecent\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\nsuccesses that we have enjoyed since the Clinton economic plan was \npassed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the pending business before the Senate \nis the continuing resolution, the large appropriations bill. But there \nare a couple of other items--one of which we discussed earlier this \nmorning--that must be resolved by this Congress.\n  I wanted to just mention again why the FAA reauthorization bill is \ncritical. We have talked about the issue of aviation safety and \nsecurity this morning. But I want to mention to my colleagues one other \nitem that is in this bill that I think is critically important. It \ndeals with the issue of the essential air service program, and the \nability to provide airline service to even rural areas of our country.\n  I have said before--and I know it is repetitious but I want to say \nagain--that, in my judgment, the issue of airline deregulation has been \nterribly hurtful to many rural States in our country.\n  Prior to airline deregulation, the State which I represent here in \nthe Congress had numerous jet carriers serving the airline service \nneeds of North Dakota. We had the old Western Airlines, we had Republic \nAirlines, the old North Central which later became Republic, Northwest \nAirlines, Frontier Airlines, and Continental Airlines. At various times \nwe have had a wide range of jet carrier service in North Dakota.\n  But since airline deregulation we now have one carrier serving our \nState with jet service--Northwest Airlines. Northwest is a fine \ncarrier. I think they provide good service. But, as all of us know, the \nmarket system works best only when you have competition. Competition \nmeans that people vie for the customers' business by better service \nand/or lower prices. And when you have one carrier you do not have \nprice competition.\n\n  We put in place an essential air service program when airlines were \nderegulated in this country some 15 or so years ago, and the essential \nair service program was designed to try to provide some basic \nprotection for rural areas recognizing that the deregulation may mean \nthat the major airlines will go compete between Chicago and Los \nAngeles, Los Angeles and New York, and New York and Miami. They are not \ngoing to rush to go compete between smaller cities and smaller markets.\n  So the essential airline service program was developed. It was \noriginally developed and authorized, and expended about $80 million a \nyear; then down to $70 million; then $50 million; and, then $30 \nmillion. Now it is down to about $25 million a year just providing a \nskeleton of support for airline service in small communities in our \ncountry.\n  This piece of legislation creates a new and unique way to permanently \nresolve the essential airline service program at a healthy rate of \nfunding--fully financed--that will be helpful to rural areas all across \nthis country.\n  Madam President, if I were to leave Washington, DC, today to fly to \nLos Angeles, CA, and I purchased a ticket with a 2-week advance, with a \nSaturday night stay and with all of the requirements that the airlines \nhave on those who purchase these tickets, it would cost probably in the \nneighborhood of $250 to fly from here all the way across the country to \nCalifornia. The Commerce Committee framed it in terms of going to see \nMickey Mouse at Disneyland in Anaheim, CA--about $250. Then I showed \nthe members of the Commerce Committee a picture of the world's largest \ncow that sits on top of a hill outside of New Salem, ND. It is called \nSalem Sue. A giant cow sits on a hill out there not so far from \nBismarck. If I wanted to see not Mickey Mouse but Salem Sue instead, \nand wanted to fly from here to North Dakota half as far as flying from \nhere to Los Angeles, and I made reservations to do that, I would pay \ntwice as much.\n  In other words, we are left in a circumstance in this country with \nairline deregulation where--at least with respect to rural areas--if \nyou want to fly twice as far you can pay half as much going to an urban \narea, but fly to a rural area and fly half as far you will double your \nticket price.\n  Does anyone think there is any rational basis for that? I do not. If \nyou believe that transportation is sometimes repetitious of universal \nneed, and you believe the need for transportation service is relatively \nuniversal, it does not make sense to say, ``Well, if you live in a very \nlarge area of the country you get dirt cheap prices but if you live in \na small area of the country, what happens is you just pay through the \nnose.''\n  What I proposed in the FAA reauthorization bill was an essential air \nservice program that is funded by a fee that is assessed on overflights \nin this country by foreign carriers. Virtually every country in the \nworld assesses a fee on airlines overflying their space by foreign \ncarriers--virtually every country except the United States. We do not \nhave such a fee. We were intending to promote such a fee, and I propose \nthat when a fee is proposed we attach it, at least part of it, to the \nessential air service program so that it generates a sufficient amount \nof money each year; rather than have to go to the Appropriations \nCommittee and seek diminished funding every year for that program, \nwhich is essential in providing airline service to rural areas, we \nwould have a permanent source of funding to fill in where airline \nderegulation is injuring rural States and smaller communities.\n  That is what we put in the FAA authorization bill. I authored the \npiece of legislation. It was supported on a bipartisan basis by \nRepublicans and Democrats. It will permanently solve this problem in a \nsignificant way and provide opportunity through better air service in \nrural parts of our country that have been injured by deregulation. It \nis simple but effective in solving a real problem.\n  That is part of this bill. And if this bill dies, that goes. A lot of \nwork over a long period of time to solve a very real problem is going \nto be gone.\n  We mentioned earlier this morning that the major issue here, however, \nis aviation safety and security. The responsibility to pass an FAA \nauthorization bill is one that cannot be abrogated. We cannot end this \nsession of Congress without passing this legislation. I know there is a \ncontroversial piece that was attached in conference. Whatever excuse \none might want to find for one reason or another to say this is going \nto have to be delayed, it cannot be voted on now or then, the fact is \nthis Congress cannot adjourn and cannot leave town without addressing \nthis issue. Reauthorizing the functions of the FAA are critical in \naddressing the aviation safety and security issues that this Congress \nis obligated to address.\n  The Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Arizona, and others have \nspoken this morning, and I would add my voice to theirs, although I \nmight make some different characterizations than I heard in a couple of \ninstances today about what is at stake in this fight, but I would say \nthis. There is no disagreement about the fact that this Congress cannot \nadjourn unless it resolves this issue. And there will be some of us \nstanding here at the end of this week preventing this Congress from \nending its session if it has not enacted an FAA authorization bill that \ndeals with the issue of safety and security in air travel in this \ncountry.\n  I began simply mentioning that there are many other things in this \nbill which escape a lot of notice, one of which is a critically \nimportant piece dealing with improving airline service in rural States \nand smaller communities across this country which I think is critically \nneeded.\n  Madam President, I know there are others who want to speak. I did \nwant to add my voice to those who spoke earlier this morning on this \nFAA reauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KYL). The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11828-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11828-S11834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n[[Page S11829]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the continuing \nresolution and, specifically, the immigration bill, which deals with \nillegal immigration and which has been added as a portion of that bill.\n  Few issues are more clearly and unequivocally the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government than the issue of immigration, whether it be \nlawful or unlawful. Legal immigration, the threads from which our \nNation's rich tapestry is woven, is a matter of national policy, and, \nin fact, no nation on Earth has as a liberal policy and takes in more \npeople from other countries each year than does the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  The ability to absorb newcomers becomes a question of resources, a \nreflection of our values, values of self-sufficiency, responsibility, \nrespect for our laws, family unity, and the legacy of this country as a \nNation of immigrants.\n  Illegal immigration, however, is a matter of law enforcement --\nwhether it is enforcing our borders, enforcing our laws against working \nillegally or hiring someone to work illegally. It is the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility to enforce these laws.\n  Unfortunately, this job has not been done well over the years, and \nthe prohibitions against illegal immigration, while on the books, have \nmeant very little in reality. The cost of the failure to act on this \nresponsibility has been very high.\n  Warning signals have been coming for years:\n  Communities are demanding action against: the growing crowds of \nillegal workers looking for day labor on street corners; lawsuits \ndemanding Federal reimbursement for the cost of incarcerating, \neducating or providing health care for illegal aliens. ``English only'' \nlaws are being discussed, expressing concerns about the inability of \nteachers to teach in schools. Many in California have dozens of \ndifferent languages. As a matter of fact, there has been a report that \n67 different languages are spoken in a single elementary school. It is \nvery difficult for teachers to teach under these circumstances. There \nis also a rise in discrimination, and even vigilantes at airports \nlooking for illegal immigrants.\n  A study just released by the Public Policy Institute of California \nsheds some light on the rise in animosity toward illegal immigrants. \nThe study shows that the level of illegal immigration into California \nduring the 1980's was substantially higher than previously thought.\n  Researchers estimate that as many as 2.2 million illegal immigrants \nsettled in California during the 1980's, their migration soaring along \nwith the California economy, comprising as much as 22 to 31 percent of \nall newcomers to the State during that period.\n  This is the point. As the State's economy stalled in the 1990's, the \nresearch indicates, interestingly enough, that illegal immigration \ndropped to about 100,000 a year. So as the economy of a given area gets \nstronger, the job magnet attraction for illegal immigration increases. \nWhen an economy worsens, that job magnet attraction clearly decreases.\n  I came to this body in 1993 after having run for Governor of my State \n3 years before. I knew then as I traveled through my State--and I \nlearned it very clearly--in 1989 and in 1990 that this was going to be \na growing issue, and that the need for change was becoming more urgent.\n  As a newcomer to this body, I stood in the Chamber on June 30, 1993, \nand told my colleagues that I believed we needed to take action to stem \nillegal immigration, that the impact on my State had become enormous, \nand that failure to do so would only bring about a backlash.\n  At that time, I introduced a bill to beef up our borders and stiffen \npenalties for document fraud and for employing illegal workers. I tried \nto get myself on the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee, where I have served with the distinguished Presiding Officer \nthese past 2 years. But this body did not act. The House did not act.\n  Within a year, in California, organizers were circulating petitions \nto put proposition 187 on the ballot--by far, the most draconian and \npunitive anti-immigration measure seen in this country for many \ndecades, and for the first time it targeted children. It took the \napproach of requiring that teachers and doctors report anyone suspected \nof being here illegally.\n  Essentially, if a youngster were in school and looked different or \ntalked different and the teacher suspected they might be illegal, it \nwas that teacher's law-given obligation to report that youngster to the \nINS. If that youngster was born in this country and therefore a citizen \nbut the parents might have been born in another country and came here \nillegally, it was that teacher's obligation to report that youngster.\n  Most amazingly so, the same prerequisites and obligations were \nimposed on doctors and health care workers. Therefore making it a real \nrisk, if a child had measles or chicken pox, to even take that child to \na doctor. Believe it or not, that proposition passed with a substantial \nmajority in the State, and it won in most minority communities. As a \nmatter of fact, even in those communities where it did not win, it \nreceived a substantial plurality.\n  A poll taken by the Los Angeles Times, right after the election, \nasked voters why they supported proposition 187. Nearly 80 percent of \nthe initiative's supporters said it was to send a message to \nWashington. More than half said they hoped this would force Washington \nto do something about illegal immigration. Less than 2 percent--believe \nit or not--cared for the specific measure that denied education to \nillegal children in that now infamous initiative.\n  I did not support that measure, but the message was unmistakably \nclear. People should not have to force the Federal Government to live \nup to its responsibilities to enforce our borders and our laws. Period. \nWe do not have the luxury of debating this issue for another 2 years or \n4 years. Rather, we have the responsibility to take action now. And the \nbill in this continuing resolution does offer strong reform. This is \nnot a perfect bill, but its major thrust is to stop illegal \nimmigration. And carried out and enforced, I believe it can make a \nmajor step forward in that direction.\n  Let me just quickly talk for a few moments about some of the key \nprovisions. Mr. President, both you and I strongly supported the \nprovision to add 1,000 new border patrol agents each year for the next \n5 years and allow the Attorney General to increase support personnel at \nthe border by 300 per year, over the same period. This effectively \ndoubles the strength of the Border Patrol.\n  I think this works. Since 1993, Border Patrol, along our southwest \nborder, has increased by 50 percent in personnel. And, as a result, \napprehensions of illegal immigrants rose more than 60 percent in 1 \nmonth at the beginning of this year. Clearly, the presence of added \nBorder Patrol makes a difference in controlling illegal immigration.\n  This bill improves border infrastructure, authorizing $12 million for \nnew equipment and technologies for border control, including building a \ntriple fence in appropriate areas, and new roads. This would be in one \nof the most highly traveled and difficult to patrol areas along the \nsouthwest border.\n  The bill adds 600 new INS investigators in 1997 alone to enforce our \nlaws. I have heard critics criticize this bill, saying it does not do \nenough in that direction. However, there will be 150 more investigators \nto investigate employer violations, 150 to investigate criminal aliens, \nand 300 designated to investigate visa overstays in 1997.\n  You and I know that one-half of the people who come into our country \nillegally have visas and they just simply overstay that visa. And the \nvisa, up to this point, has had no teeth. If they disappear into the \nfabric of the society, it is very difficult to find them to enforce \nthat visa. This bill dedicates 300 new INS investigators to visa \noverstays. It is the first real effort this Congress has made to \ncontrol one of the biggest problem areas in illegal immigration.\n  And the bill allows the Attorney General to establish an automated \nentry and exit control system, to match arriving and departing aliens \nand identify those who overstay their visas.\n  It precludes a person who overstays his or her visa from returning to \nthis country for up to 10 years. This gives meaning to a visa. In a \nsense, in a\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\ngreat sense, I am sorry we have reached this day and age in our very \nfree society. But, you know, there is one thing I deeply believe and \nthat is, we are a country of laws. We do not have the liberty to pick \nand choose which laws we enforce or do not enforce. But the departments \nof our Government should be bound to enforce the laws that are on the \nbooks.\n  We, if we do not like those laws, have the ability and the \nopportunity to change those laws. I am very disappointed this bill does \nnot increase penalties for employers who violate the law as the Senate \nbill did, but penalties do exist. I have just taken a look at those \npenalties. As I mentioned earlier, there are also 150 INS agents, \ninvestigators specifically designated to investigate employers. The \npenalties essentially go from $250 to $10,000 in civil penalties for \neach alien, increasing with the number of offenses. And, on top of \nthese fines, if the employer has a pattern of violations, he or she can \nalso be subject to a maximum of $3,000 per alien and 6 months in prison \nfor each transaction. And the Attorney General may also issue an \ninjunction against the employer for repeated offenses.\n  If you think about it, these are strong penalties. But what is the \nproblem? The problem is they have not been enforced. So this bill, once \nagain, must be enforced if it is to have teeth.\n  Let me speak of worker verification. This is another disappointment \nbecause the heart of any effective system to prevent the job magnet \nfrom working is verification of documents that show legal authority to \nwork. Any employer who can have their prospective employee, while being \ninterviewed, present up to 29 documents, really cannot tell which is \nreal and which is false. I know that. I have been in that position. I \nknow how difficult it is to tell. This bill establishes three pilot \nprograms for employment verification in five of the highest-impact \nStates. So this is a step forward.\n  I want to speak for just a moment about document fraud, because \nprobably there is no more greater problem in the United States in this \narea than document fraud. It is wholesale. It is rife.\n  It is just all over the place. Just recently, INS shut down a major \ndocument fraud ring in Santa Ana, CA. They confiscated 22,000 fake \ngreen cards, Social Security cards and driver's licenses. These were \nall first-rate forgeries, and they were meant to be sold in California \nand throughout three other States. It is a major underground industry \nin my State, and this bill does begin to deal with this problem.\n  It reduces the number of documents that can be used to establish an \nindividual's employment eligibility, and it increases the maximum \npenalties for document fraud from 5 to 15 years in prison. That is the \nmaximum, and it sets security standards for key identification \ndocuments, such as birth certificates and driver's licenses, to prevent \nfraud and counterfeiting.\n  If I had my way, we would cut the number of documents down to a basic \nnumber and make every green card, every Social Security card and every \nbirth certificate counterfeit-resistant.\n  So the compromise in this bill is not all I wanted or think we need, \nbut, again, it will be light years better than the situation we now \nhave with employers having to struggle to recognize up to 29 different \ndocuments.\n  The bill also stiffens penalties for aliens illegally entering or \nattempting to enter the United States, and makes high-speed flight from \nan INS checkpoint a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison. I \nthink most Members of this Senate have seen the results of high-speed \nchases, certainly in my State, where people can die by the dozens in \ncar crashes, in overcrowded vans, as innocent victims of high-speed-\npursuit chases by law enforcement. And, of course, one very notorious \nincident resulted in law enforcement officers in a county taking out \ntheir frustrations physically upon some of the people who were being \ncarried in the van.\n  Let me just for a moment speak about title V. This was a \ncontroversial title. It included some provisions for illegal immigrants \nand several provisions for legal immigrants. It was meant to tighten up \nincome requirements and do some other things. Basically, I very much \nagree with the changes made to title V--with some exceptions, and I am \nprepared to support it. There is one area which was not changed and \nwith which I have a major problem, and that is the section that deals \nwith refugee assistance. A provision was deleted from the conference \nreport that would have corrected a glaring inequity in the allocation \nof refugee assistance funds.\n  Under the funding formulas in the current law, funds for refugee \nassistance are not allocated on the basis of need or numbers or where \nthe refugees are. My State, California, has 60 percent of all of the \nrefugees in the United States of America. We receive $31 per refugee \nunder this bill, while other States receive as much as $497 per \nrefugee. That is just plain wrong. It is not the way this Government \nshould exist, with cushy deals for some States and other States really \nending up down and out.\n  This provision costs California $7 million in Federal funds. The \nwithdrawal of the language that I submitted, to see to it that refugee \ndollars went based on where the refugees are, is not included in the \nimmigration bill. It went with some kind of a political plum. I \ncertainly intend to readdress this issue at the first available \nopportunity in the next Congress.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I must say, I am very pleased that the \nGallegly amendment is out of this bill. I also think that fair changes \nhave been made to the immigration bill, and I particularly thank the \nmembers of the Immigration Subcommittee. I think both you and I would \nagree that the markup of this bill on the Senate side was something \nvery unusual. Members listened to each other, and it went on hour after \nhour, day after day. I think we produced a very good bill on the Senate \nside.\n  This bill has been changed somewhat. I think it still remains a very \nstrong Federal tool giving the Departments of the Federal Government \nboth the license they need, as well as the tools they need, to see that \nwe do what we should do: guarantee that the borders of our country are \nenforced against illegal immigration.\n\n  I, for one, being the product of legal immigrants, really believe \nthat it is important that the richness of our tapestry continue to be \nwoven through people who come to this country from many other places. \nThe fact that the legal immigration quotas remain as they are, \nextraordinarily broad, and I think liberal, is important, and that we \nsay to the people of this Nation, ``We are a nation of laws, and we \nwill abide by them.''\n  I thank the committee. I particularly thank the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, Senator Simpson, who worked very hard and \nvery diligently, who has studied this issue and which legislation bears \nhis name. I think he has been a person of great integrity and \ncredibility on the issue for a long, long time. When he retires from \nthis body, I guess at the end of this year, he will leave a legacy of \nfairness and a striving for laws in this area which are sustained by \nthat credibility and integrity.\n  Finally, I want to address sponsor income requirements. In addition \nto being enforceable, sponsor contracts must also be realistic. I \nsupport raising the income requirement for sponsors of immigrants.\n  The purpose of the sponsor income requirement is to ensure that \npeople who sponsor immigrants into this country have the ability to \nprovide for them. Tell me how someone supports a family of two on \n$10,360 per year--which is the current poverty-level requirement.\n  A person can barely support himself or herself on $10,360 per year--\nthat's why it's called the poverty level.\n  This bill makes what I think is a modest change in the income \nrequirement: If you have an income of $12,950 per year for a family of \ntwo, you can bring your spouse and minor children into this country.\n  California--and all States who bear the burden of illegal \nimmigration--need this bill. I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation by voting yes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the omnibus appropriations bill that is \nnow\n\n[[Page S11831]]\n\nbefore the U.S. Senate includes 6 of the regular appropriations bills \nout of 13, but includes, by far, the largest amount of money directly \nappropriated by the Congress for discretionary purposes during the \ncourse of the year, as 2 of those 6 bills are the appropriations bills \nfor our national defense and for all myriad activities coming under the \nrubric of labor, health, and human services.\n  These appropriations, nevertheless, represent only a modest \nproportion of the money the people of the United States spend through \ntheir taxes and through their borrowing because, of course, it does not \ninvolve major changes in any of the entitlement programs which continue \nto grow almost without any significant control.\n  Nevertheless, this is a responsible appropriations bill. It is the \nwork of a bipartisan compromise, actually a tripartite compromise, \ninvolving the Republican leadership in both Houses of Congress, with \ninput from the Democratic minority, all subject to the will of the \nPresident of the United States who has said he will sign the bill.\n  By and large, it is a commonsense solution, it is a reasonable \nappropriations bill, and it is one that I will certainly vote to pass.\n  This set of appropriations does dramatically reduce the spending for \ndiscretionary purposes by the Government of the United States. It does \nat least begin to move in the direction of reducing the burdens that we \nimpose on the people of the United States and reducing at least the \ngrowth in the debt that we load on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren. It changes the direction that 40 years of a Congress \ndominated by the Democratic Party led this country in. To that extent, \nit represents a very important change.\n  Even so, Mr. President, last-minute negotiations have included in \nthis proposal, in my opinion, $3 billion or $4 billion of the $6.5 \nbillion demanded by the President over and above the earlier plans of \nthe budget that is unnecessary spending. It is, in essence, the price \nthat we pay for ending this debate on the last day of the fiscal year \nand not threatening a closedown of the Government. That is a relatively \nhigh price, $3 billion or $4 billion, but it pales to relative \ninsignificance when compared with the more than $50 billion that we \nhave saved from the normal growth of previous programs over the course \nof the last several decades.\n  We are heading in the right direction, in other words, but we have \nnot achieved our ultimate goals.\n  We on this side of the aisle have as a priority to make the Federal \nGovernment live within its own means, to cut wasteful Government \nspending, to end, to terminate the time at which we continually add to \nthe burdens of those who will come after us. We have made it a priority \nto return power to the people and to their local and State governments.\n  But in spite of these gains, Mr. President, do most people really \nthink that we have clipped the wings of the bureaucrats here in \nWashington, DC, and returned power to them? I think not, Mr. President. \nAnd I believe that that perception, that reality, shows not only what \nwe have gained in the last 2 years, but how far we still have to go.\n  It is time and it is our purpose to return common sense to \nGovernment, to give individuals a greater degree of influence over \ntheir own daily lives, to change the direction of the last decades, to \nexamine programs which have gone unexamined for a decade, two decades, \nthree decades, four. When programs are not working, Mr. President, they \nshould be changed or terminated.\n  But overall, as I said, as I began these remarks, this is a good \nappropriations bill. It does move us in the right direction. It is one \nthat it is appropriate for us to pass. And I am convinced that before \nthe evening is out, we will have passed it.\n  At this point in my remarks, Mr. President, I have the details of \nthat portion of this bill that comes under the influence of the \nSubcommittee on Appropriations for the Department of the Interior and \nrelated agencies. In that connection, Mr. President, the bill is almost \nidentical to the bill that we were considering here on the floor of the \nSenate at the time at which nongermane amendments, by the legion, were \noffered, and the bill was taken down.\n  That proposal was worked out in a totally bipartisan fashion, with \nthe help and the assistance and the approval of my most distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd. It is a \nvery responsible answer to questions in connection to our national \nparks, our national forests, our energy resources, our cultural \ninstitutions and the like.\n  As you will recall, the Interior bill was brought up and debated \nbriefly on September 6, 9, and 10, before being put aside. With little \npossibility of passing a separate bill in time for the start of the \nfiscal year, the Interior bill has been combined into the omnibus \nappropriations bill. Following the Senate floor action, Senator Byrd \nand his staff and my staff and I worked with our House counterparts to \niron out the differences between the House-passed and Senate-reported \nbills. The bill before you reflects the product of those discussions as \nwell as negotiations with the White House to ensure that a final \nproduct would be signed by the President.\n  This bill represents compromises. No one received everything he or \nshe wanted. However, I believe it is in the interest of the Nation to \nmove forward so vital operations of the Government can continue \nuninterrupted as the new fiscal year begins. It includes \n$12,504,798,000 in discretionary budget authority and approximately \n$13,176,000,000 in outlays. The President's budget request is $377 \nmillion above the level included in the omnibus bill in budget \nauthority and $494 million above it in outlays. As a starting point, \nthe discrepancy in House and Senate 602(b) allocations was resolved by \nsplitting the difference between the two allocations.\n  The Interior bill includes an additional $150 million for programs \nthat the Congress and the administration agree are priorities, and for \nwhich additional funding should be provided. These programs include \nareas such as Indian education, energy conservation, Indian health \nservices and facilities, the National Endowment for the Humanities. \nAmendments were expected to be considered on the Senate floor that \nwould have added funding to these same programs. The administration has \nexpressed concern regarding specific legislative provisions within the \nbill and many of these provisions have been dropped or modified.\n  Emergency funding is included to address the devastating wildfires in \nthe West and hurricane, flood-related and other disaster damages in the \nEast and West. Only $88.2 million for Forest Service fire suppression \nis proposed in the President's fiscal year 1997 request. The agency's \n10-year annual average expenditure for fire suppression is $296.4 \nmillion, leaving a $208.2 million shortfall if fiscal year 1997 proves \nto have an average fire season. In addition, the Forest Service \ncurrently owes the Knutson-Vandenberg Trust Fund (K-V) $571 million for \ncurrent-year and past-year fire suppression activities. The agency \ncannot borrow additional funds from the KV fund without deferring \nstatutorily required reforestation activities. Recognizing the severity \nof this fire season, the unrealistic budget request, and the critical \njuncture of the fire and KV programs, an additional $120.5 million \nabove the budget request is added for fire suppression activities, \nbringing the total to $210.5 million. Also, included in the Interior \nportion of the omnibus bill is $550 million to repay the borrowed KV \nfunds. Another $100 million is included for the Department of the \nInterior's fire suppression activities. Funding of $48 million for \ndamage caused by floods, hurricanes, and other natural acts is \nincluded. Within the Interior section, $17 million is provided for \ncounterterrorism.\n  The Interior bill presents difficult choices. The needs of the \nvarious agencies funded through the Interior bill are great, from the \noperations and facilities requirements of the national parks, forests, \nrefuges, public lands, and museums to the basic health care, tribal \ngovernment, and education services provided to native Americans. In \nassembling this bill, we have attempted to strike a balance between \nthese competing interests and between the various interests of the \nCongress and the administration.\n  Now, let us turn to the recommendations before you today. Among the \nitems of interest are:\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\n                            Land Management\n\n  The omnibus bill provides additional funds above the fiscal year 1996 \namounts for the operational accounts of the land management agencies.\nBureau of Land Management: plus 1 percent.\nFish and Wildlife Service: plus 5 percent.\nNational Park Service: plus 6 percent.\nForest Service: plus 1 percent.\n\n  The construction accounts for the land management agencies have \nincreased $38.5 million, or about 11 percent, above the fiscal year \n1996 level. The majority of the construction projects involve the \ncompletion of ongoing projects and the restoration or rehabilitation of \nexisting facilities. While it may seem that this is a large increase \nfor construction, I would remind my colleagues that the facility \nbacklogs for these land management agencies are approximately $9 \nbillion.\n  Overall funding for land acquisition for the land management agencies \ntotals $149.4 million, which is about $11.2 million, or 8 percent, over \nthe current level; $49.4 million above the House level; and $3.6 \nmillion below the Senate committee recommendation. The omnibus bill has \nidentified specific projects, even though the House bill did not.\n\n\n                            Science Agencies\n\n  Funding for the Office of Surface Mining is increased slightly, while \nthe Minerals Management Service is maintained at the fiscal year 1996 \nlevel through the increased use of user fees.\n\n\n                          Cultural Activities\n\n  Within this category, the first priority was to provide adequate \nresources to those cultural institutions, such as our Nation's museums, \nfor which the Federal Government has primary funding responsibility.\n  Among the many competing needs of our cultural agencies, the \nsubcommittee continues to place particular emphasis on repair and \nrenovation work that is required to keep these institutions open to the \npublic and collections preserved safely. Budget estimates from the \nKennedy Center, the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian \nInstitution have been met in full to facilitate this work.\n\n\n                          Department of Energy\n\n  Energy conservation programs are funded at $570 million. This number \nis an increase from the initial House-Senate conference agreement, \nreflecting the committees' response to the funding priorities \nidentified by the administration late last week.\n  Within the amount provided for energy conservation, the \nweatherization program is increased by $9 million over the fiscal year \n1996 level and the State energy conservation program is increased by $3 \nmillion.\n  Fossil research and development is down 4.5 percent from the \ncomparable fiscal year 1996 level.\n  The sum of $123 million is rescinded from the Clean Coal Technology \nProgram, substantially less than the $325 million rescission proposed \nin the budget. The rescission included in the conference agreement \nreflects a careful consideration of the needs of projects remaining in \nthe program, funds made available by the recent termination of some \nprojects, and the $200 million rescission that was enacted last year.\n  Funding for the naval petroleum and oil shale reserves is set at \n$143.8 million. While this amount is above both the House and Senate \npassed levels, it is still $5 million below the prior year level and \ndoes little to address the increased demands placed on the program by \nthe potential sale of the Elk Hills field. I also note that the \nadministration estimated that the original House and Senate funding \nlevels would have resulted in a revenue loss of $45 million over the \nnext 2 years.\n\n  Operations of the strategic petroleum reserve are funded by oil sales \nfrom the reserves, $220 million.\n\n\n                            Indian Programs\n\n  In aggregate, Indian programs total $3,765,645,000 in the Interior \nportion of the bill, which is an increase of about $112 million above \nthe fiscal year 1996 funding level and about $16.5 million above the \nSenate committee recommendation.\n  BIA.--Funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs increases by about $34 \nmillion above the fiscal year 1996 funding level, and $68 million above \nthe House amount.\n  Tribal priority allocations.--Emphasis has been placed on providing \nadditional funding to tribal priority allocations, which is $26.7 \nmillion--plus 4 percent--above fiscal year 1996 and $4.2 million above \nthe Senate committee recommended level. Within the tribal priority \nallocations, the committee has included an increase of $4 million for \nsmall and needy tribes and a general increase of $19.5 million.\n  School Operations.--The omnibus bill also places emphasis on \nelementary and secondary school operations and funding has been \nincreased by $41.3 million--plus 10 percent--above the fiscal year 1996 \nlevel and almost $23 million above the Senate Committee recommended \nlevel. The omnibus bill funds all BIA-funded elementary and secondary \nschool operations at the budget request, with the exception of a small \nreduction--$2 million--below the President's request for the Indian \nSchool Equalization Program [ISEP] formula.\n  Indian Health Service.--Total funding for the IHS is increased by $67 \nmillion--3.4 percent. The increase is for staffing of recently \ncompleted facilities, a portion of pay costs to maintain service \nlevels, and funding for replacement of a health care facility in \nMontana that recently burned to the ground.\n\n\n                         Legislative Provisions\n\n  Several provisions have been removed that were included in either the \nHouse or Senate versions of the Interior bill, but which were opposed \nby the administration. The following provisions have been removed: \nGeneral Accounting Office review of the Tongass land management plan; \nPennsylvania Avenue (section 115); funding distribution formula for the \nBureau of Indian Affairs (section 118); Cook Inlet Region, Inc. \n(section 121); Mount Graham Red Squirrel (section 317); Istook \namendment--tax collections (section 322).\n  Another provision (section 329) dealing with sovereign immunity had \nbeen removed previously during Senate committee consideration of the \nInterior bill. During negotiations last week on the omnibus bill, a \nproposed provision was dropped that would have imposed a moratorium on \nany rulemaking by the Secretary of the Interior for class III tribal-\nState Indian gaming compacts.\n  As I mentioned, one of the provisions removed from the Interior bill \nwas the Mount Graham provision concerning the construction of a large \nbinocular telescope on Mount Graham, AZ. The provision amended Public \nLaw 100-696, the Arizona-Idaho Conservation Act of 1988 [AICA] to \npermit the use of the alternative site 2 on Emerald Peak of Mount \nGraham. This provision was contained in the fiscal year 1996 omnibus \nappropriations bill (Public Law 104-134) as well and brought the site \nfully within AICA's exemptions from otherwise applicable laws.\n  On June 17, 1996, the U.S. Court Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in \nMount Graham Coalition v. Thomas, 89 F. 3d 554 (9th Cir. 1996) \nvalidated the congressional action in the fiscal year 1996 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill. The provision effected a permanent change in AICA \nto ensure the prompt construction and operation of the telescope. Since \nAICA has been amended and has been validated by the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, it is no longer necessary to include the provision in the \nfiscal year 1997 appropriations act.\n  A gaming amendment is included that would amend the Rhode Island \nsettlement law to clarify that for the purposes of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act (IGRA), Rhode Island settlement lands should not be \ntreated as Indian lands. At the time that IGRA was passed, a colloquy \nwas entered into that clearly stated the intent for the protections of \nthe Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act should remain in effect \nand that the Narragansett Indian Tribe should remain subject to the \ncivil, criminal, and regulatory laws of the State of Rhode Island. \nThese laws include the State prohibition against casino gambling. Other \nsettlement laws exempt specific tribes or settlement lands from IGRA.\n\n\n       Grand Staircase-Canyons of the Escalante National Monument\n\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that the administration recently \ncreated the Grand Staircase-Canyons of the Escalante as one of the \nlargest national monuments in the continental United States without the \nconsultation of Congress and without public comment. I expect the \nSecretary to fully\n\n[[Page S11833]]\n\ncomply with the provisions outlined in the proclamation dated September \n18, 1996. Pursuant to the proclamation, it is my understanding that the \nSecretary will manage through the Bureau of Land Management.\n  As chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I would \nremind the administration that the designation of a national monument \nimplicitly implies significant future funding obligations. In a period \nwhen funding requirements and maintenance backlogs are at an all-time \nhigh at the Department of the Interior, the need for a public policy \ndebate over creating new national monuments, particularly as large as \nthe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, is extremely \nimportant. Ultimately, public input into the process serves the public \ngood and assists the committee in its challenging funding priorities. I \nurge the administration to use the public process outlined in numerous \nenvironmental statutes dating back to the 1970's in order to designate \nsuch a large tract of land as this.\n  Due to the serious impacts of the national monument designation to \nthe people of Utah and on budget allocations, it is my view that no \nother national monument should be designated in Utah until the \nmanagement plan and final issues regarding the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument are resolved.\n  I am concerned about the lack of details on the monument beyond the \ninformation contained in the proclamation, including estimated costs to \nmanage the monument and provide for a potential increase in visitors to \nthe area. As a result, I am requesting the Secretary of the Interior to \nsubmit a report by February 1, 1997 that details the costs associated \nwith the monument, the process for developing a management plan, and a \ndetailed description of how affected parties will be involved in the \nprocess of developing the management plan. Also, I am requesting that \nthe Secretary submit by April 1, 1997, a plan for implementing an \nexchange of the school trust lands located within the monument.\n  Mr. President, I said in these earlier remarks that as important and \nas widespread as this appropriations bill is, it neither represents all \nof the triumphs and change of direction in this Congress or all of the \nareas that remain undone.\n  We have accomplished a great deal in this Congress. We have saved \nsome 50-plus billions of dollars in appropriated accounts, money that \nwill not go on the credit card to be charged to later generations.\n  For our citizens, for our constituents, who were angry and upset with \nthe current welfare system because it discouraged work and encouraged \ndependency, we have acted, if you are able-bodied, you will not be able \nto receive endless Government checks in the future.\n  Under the plan passed by Republican Members, with Democratic \nassistance in both bodies and signed by the President, if you can work, \nyou will work or at least you will be off of the public welfare rolls. \nThe gravy train is over. Reform that was only discussed in the abstract \nin past Congresses is a part of the law now.\n  For those of our citizens who wanted health care reform, without the \nmassive bureaucracy that was proposed here just over 2 years ago, we \nhave also acted. You will be able to change your jobs and take your \nhealth care with you. You will not be prohibited from getting health \ncare insurance by reason of preexisting conditions. The changes that \nthe people of this country actually wanted 2 years ago, but were \noverwhelmed by the complexity of the President's proposed system, the \nchanges that they actually wanted are there. The overwhelming Federal \ncontrol is not.\n  A line-item veto, talked about for years, but a reality in this \nRepublican Congress.\n  A constitutional amendment to mandate a balanced budget, passed by \nthe House of Representatives, and failed by only a single vote here in \nthe U.S. Senate, and I think extremely likely to pass in the course of \nthe next Congress.\n  Imposing on Congress the rules we have imposed on others, talked \nabout in the past and become an accomplishment of this Congress.\n  A real crime bill, not the phony promise of 100,000 new police \nofficers, a promise that was never kept, not midnight basketball, but \nan actual law, Megan's law, to protect children from sexual predators \nhas passed and has become law.\n  Victims rights legislation, new antiterrorism bills, and most \nimportantly, laws that will terminate or at least shorten the endless \nappeals in capital punishment cases, all passed.\n  Opening up our telecommunications system to new competition, talked \nabout for a decade, passed under this Congress.\n  New safe drinking water laws for the people of the United States, \nimportant food safety measures, and the like, all accomplishments of \nthis Congress that were only thought of or discussed in theory in \nCongresses in the past.\n  Mr. President, matched against these accomplishments, however, are \nthose areas in which the job has not yet been completed. Some of these \nare the most important: A desperate attempt last year not just to \nreform our Medicare system, but to preserve and protect it for future \ngenerations of citizens, to postpone or to cancel the impending \nbankruptcy of the hospital insurance trust fund, the desire to see to \nit that Medicaid becomes more rational and less burdensome on our \ntaxpayers and on our States.\n\n  All of these failed, Mr. President, in spite of being a part of the \nmassive bill that would have balanced the Federal budget with these \nreforms and with tax relief, all failed because of the veto of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  We can look forward, Mr. President, if we have a Congress like this \none, to another serious attempt to meet these most vital challenges to \nour future during the course of the next Congress.\n  Unfortunately, we have been faced by an administration, at least, and \nmany Members of the Democratic Party who prefer the status quo. In \nfact, the great struggle during this Congress was between those who \nwere in the majority for so many years who created these problems and \nwho liked the status quo and those of us who felt that a major change \nin direction was important for us to reflect the views of the American \npeople and regain their trust.\n  We must change these entitlement programs. We must see to it that \nthey are available to the future without overwhelming the present and \nwithout overwhelming the generations who in fact through their work \nmust pay for them.\n  But most of all, Mr. President, we need to provide tax relief for the \nAmerican people. And no difference between the two parties can be \ngreater than those who are perfectly content with the present system, \nwith the present burdens, and those who feel that tax relief is \nnecessary for working American families, and for those of us who beyond \nthat feel that even significant amendments to the present Tax Code are \nvery similar to putting Band-Aids on a corpse, and that what we really \nneed to do, Mr. President, is to junk the present system, to repeal the \npresent system, and to begin over again, and to create a system which \nis fair and which is productive, which is simple and understandable, so \nthat literally tens of thousands of employees of the Internal Revenue \nService, and of all the organizations and professions throughout the \nUnited States who make their livings by finding loopholes in the Tax \nCode, can become accustomed to more productive and more constructive \nwork in a growing society.\n  Mr. President, we must abolish the IRS as we have known it, but this \nis not so much a criticism of the IRS and the hard-working people who \nare employed by it, as it is of us, those of us who have created a \nsystem that is so susceptible to misuse, to unfairness, and to \ncomplexity, and to create a discontent in and among the American \npeople.\n  So, Mr. President, as we finish this Congress, we have this vitally \nimportant and positive appropriations bill before the Senate. I believe \nwe must also pass a bill relating to our parks and recreation areas \nthat is now before the Senate in two different forms from the House of \nRepresentatives and, of course, the Federal Aviation Administration \nauthorization bill so necessary to combat terrorism, to make our \nairways more secure, to provide for the construction of new airport \nfacilities and new navigation facilities.\n  I hope we can accomplish all of that during the remainder of this \nday, but if\n\n[[Page S11834]]\n\nwe cannot, I hope our leadership will keep us throughout the week until \neach of these vitally important initiatives has become the law of the \nland so we can go home and tell the American people we have started to \nchange the course in which this country is going. We are shifting it to \na better and more responsible and more responsive direction, but we \nneed more than 2 years to make up for all of the follies of the last \ntwo to four decades. With that, I recommend the passage of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe pending legislation as we approach in the course of some 11 hours \nthe end of the fiscal year at 12 o'clock midnight. We are faced with an \nappropriations process which I believe has severely undermined what we \nare supposed to be doing as legislators.\n  I just heard my distinguished colleague, Senator Gorton, make a \ncomment about the price we are paying for what he considers to be extra \nappropriations on certain lines because we have not had an opportunity \nto consider the items in detail. I agree with him about that. My \nsuggestion is we are paying even a higher price because we have not \npermitted the appropriations process to run its course because of the \npolitical differences and the very deterioration of our Senate process.\n  It was illustrated on the Interior appropriations bill where the \nmajority leader had to take down the bill because of maneuvering--one \nside trying to gain an advantage on some politically popular items like \neducation, something I have long supported in my capacity as chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee which deals with appropriations. \nThen the bill which I have the chairmanship of, Labor, Health, Human \nServices, and Education, was never brought to the floor because of \ninsufficient time and because of the determination that the bill could \nnot be enacted in due course.\n  Instead, we have come to a situation where everything is rolled into \none omnibus appropriations bill, which is a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition, with the alternative being to close down the Government. \nThe procedural posture today is that there is a second measure which \ncan come before the Senate which is the Department of Defense \nconference report where the omnibus appropriations bill has been rolled \nin, as well as the immigration bill, which would not even allow an \nopportunity for amendment during consideration of any of the individual \nitems if that is to be called up as the order of the day.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, when we reconvene for the 105th \nCongress, we will take a look and change the rules of the Senate to \nprohibit bringing up extraneous, nongermane matters on appropriations \nbills. If that were to be the case, when we consider Interior, it is an \nInterior bill alone. When we consider Labor, Health, Human Services, \nand Education, we then direct our attention to that so we do not get \ninto a situation where at the last minute we have no alternative but to \nsay yes or no to such a massive bill. Or, when the extraordinary \nprocedure is used of having a conference report, either to say yes or \nno without any amendment there.\n  I have spoken on this at some great length on Saturday, the day \nbefore yesterday, Mr. President, and at that time expressed my concern \nabout a procedure which blurred the lines of separation of powers \nbetween the Congress, which is supposed to do the appropriations, then \nsending a bill to the President for his consideration, and a procedure \nin which the Chief of Staff, representing the executive branch, was \nparty to negotiations with Congress before the bill was passed. This \nwas an aberration, really a corruption, of the constitutional process \nof separation of powers, where each House acts, there is a conference, \nwe send a bill to the President, and he makes the decision, signing or \nnot, and then the Congress has the power to override.\n\n  What we have really seen, as I said at great length on Saturday, is a \nprocedure where we have had the delegation of the President's authority \nto the Chief of Staff, with it being impossible for the President to \nknow what was being agreed to on his behalf, again, I think, raising \nserious constitutional questions as to whether the President may \ndelegate the authority in that way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11828-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11834-S11835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FOREIGN AID\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now want to comment for a moment or two \nabout one aspect of the appropriations process. That is the issue of \nforeign aid, which is tied into U.S. policy in the Mideast, and what is \nhappening today in Israel and the conflict between Israel and the \nPalestinians, the PLO and the forthcoming summit with leaders from the \nMideast, which is to be held in Washington tomorrow and the day after.\n  I commented on this issue on Saturday as well, Mr. President. It is \nmy hope that the parties, Israel and the Palestinian Authority, will be \nable to work out their problems. They are now coming to Washington with \nadditional leaders from the Mideast in an overtone which may suggest \npressure on the parties, pressure specifically on Prime Minister \nBinyamin Netanyahu.\n  It is my view, Mr. President, that it is intolerable to have a \nsituation where the Palestinians are firing on Israeli soldiers. The \nPalestinians are firing on Israeli soldiers with rifles and ammunition \nprovided by the Israelis, pursuant to the Oslo Accords, so that the \nPalestinian police can contain the areas in Gaza and the other areas in \nwhich they have been given a limited amount of local authority. There \nwas never any intention that those Palestinian police were to be an \narmy to engage in what is, in effect, virtual warfare against the State \nof Israel.\n  This makes us pause as we see a demonstration of what might occur if \nthe peace process goes forward and if there is great authority for the \nPLO, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, now known as the \nPalestinian Authority, as to what they may hope or seek to accomplish \nwith a separate Palestinian state. That certainly is not part of the \nagreement on the Oslo Accords.\n  A few months after the signing on the White House lawn of September \n13, 1993, I and others from this body went to take a look at what was \nhappening, and we had a chance to meet with Chairman Arafat, had a \nchance to visit Jericho and Gaza, and we saw the flags of a Palestinian \nstate which was already being assumed when the ink was barely dry on \nthe Oslo Accords signed a few months earlier. That was not what was \nintended.\n  Now we have a de facto Palestinian state with a police force \nestimated between 30,000 and 40,000, which is a veritable army. That \ncontext, I submit, Mr. President, is simply an intolerable situation.\n  Going back to September 13, 1993, when I saw Arafat honored on the \nWhite House Lawn, it was a very, very difficult day considering that \nthis was the man who was implicated in the murder of the United States \ncharge in the Sudan in 1974. This is the man who was implicated in \nmassive killings and terrorism against Israel. This is the man who led \nthe hijacking of the Achille Lauro leading to the murder of Mr. \nKlinghoffer, who was pushed off the deck of the Achille Lauro in his \nwheelchair. It was pretty hard to sit on the White House Lawn and watch \nthat man honored.\n  It seemed to me that if Prime Minister Rabin and then Foreign \nMinister Peres were willing to shake Arafat's hand, considering that \nIsrael had suffered the most at the hands of PLO atrocities, then the \nUnited States ought to try to be helpful.\n  But now we see that a summit is planned. And, as this morning's press \nquotes, Arafat is betting that Prime Minister Netanyahu will come under \npressure from President Clinton. If this is the case, I think it is \ntime to rethink precisely what we are doing.\n  Israel voted for the Likud-Netanyahu government this past election \nexpressing their concerns for security. It is very easy for people \nthousands of miles away from the locale to say, ``Well, there ought to \nbe pressure, and there ought to be in effect a determination, if not a \ndictation, as to what the Israeli elected officials ought to do.''\n  It is my sense that Prime Minister Netanyahu can hold his own and \nmake decisions for himself. But it is also my sense that there ought to \nbe a statement made that the situation is intolerable with the \nPalestinians firing on Israeli soldiers, and that the United States \nought not to exert pressure as to what the Israelis are to do in terms \nof their own security.\n  I had a chance to meet with Chairman Arafat last month in Gaza. And\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\nwhen he asked about aid from the United States, I reminded him about \nthe provisions of our law which require the Palestinian authorities to \nchange the PLO charter before such aid will be granted. He brought me a \ndocument which simply said that all provisions of the charter \ninconsistent with the September 13, 1993, agreement were invalid, which \nhardly reaches the issue about the provisions of the PLO charter \ncalling for the destruction of Israel. It was obviously insufficient.\n  Then there are the provisions of American law which call upon the \nPalestinian authorities to take strong steps against terrorism. I think \nthey have not done that. The closing of the border is difficult with \nRomanians and others coming in to handle jobs in Israel. But when the \nopen borders mean terrorism, and destruction of Israeli buses, it is \nnot hard to understand why as a matter of security those borders are \nclosed.\n  When I discussed with Chairman Arafat the issue of terrorism, he \ndiscussed Abu Nidal, somebody that he knows well--had known well--and \nAbu Abbas who was implicated in the Achille Lauro hijacking and is \nunder a 30-year sentence in absentia from the Italian court. Chairman \nArafat said that Abu Abbas raised his hand to change the PLO charter. \nThose are matters which require a lot of consideration as to just what \nmay be expected of the Israeli Government in terms of trusting the PLO \nand trusting the Palestinian authorities.\n  Do the leopards change their spots? Here we have the Palestinian \npolice firing on Israeli soldiers with guns and bullets provided by the \nIsraelis.\n  So let us take a look at what we expect to be done. Certainly the \nmatters ought to be subject to negotiation. But we really ought not to \nallow the Palestinian authority and Arafat to get what they want at the \nbargaining table by rioting and warfare.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, it appears that this afternoon we are \ngoing to be asked to vote on something in the form of an omnibus \nconsolided appropriations bill which may be attached to the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  This is it, Mr. President. This is the 2,000-plus pages that have \nbeen put together and assembled since last Friday. I would suggest \nthere is not one Member of this body who has read this. But we go \nthrough that quite often and quite often we vote on things that we have \nnot read in their entirety. But the reason that we are going to do this \nis because we on the majority side are somewhat held hostage. At least \nin the minds of many Members we are. We are talking about $6.5 billion \nmore that we are going to agree to spend to respond to the President's \nrequest for programs that he was not able to get funded during the \nnormal process--$6.5 billion with a ``b'', Mr. President. So we are \ntalking about a major, major amount of expenditures.\n  All of this goes back to this horrible fear that we seem to be \nlaboring under that--if we do not do this and we pass our \nappropriations bills, as we would normally do through the deliberative \nprocess, and the President vetoes these and we come to an impasse--the \nGovernment will stop at the end of the fiscal year which is taking \nplace at this historic time right now, and that the Republicans would \nbe responsible for it.\n  Last night I was watching a debate that took place wherein the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, was talking about what \nhappened when the Republicans shut down the Government. And I was \nwaiting for a response because the Republicans did not shut down the \nGovernment. The Republicans only did those things that were responsible \nin the normal process that we live under here.\n\n  I remember so well in the other Chamber when the President of the \nUnited States, Bill Clinton, gave his State of the Union Message. And \nin that he had a very dramatic time during that 1 hour and 6 minutes--\nwhatever it was--when he said, ``And don't you ever shut down \nGovernment again,'' looking at us as if we were the ones who shut it \ndown.\n  Well, anyway, apparently the vast majority of the American people \nbelieved that.\n  So, in fear for that and in responding to that, we are agreeing to \nfund a lot of his programs to the extent of $6.5 billion, programs such \nas the Goals 2000 Program.\n  You know, a few years ago I came home. And at that time my son was in \nthe fourth or the fifth grade. I can't remember. And he was just \nbeaming. I said, ``Jimmy, something good must have happened today.'' He \nsaid, ``Well, you know, dad. I am in the fourth grade.'' I said, ``Yes. \nI know that.'' He said, ``Dad, you know that in reading I am in the \nfifth grade.'' I said, ``How does that work?'' He said it was a brand \nnew Federal program. ``It is a pilot program we are trying. It is a \nsystem that is set up where if you accelerate in a certain area that \nyou can then compete with those who are in perhaps a grade or two above \nyou.''\n  I remember it so well back many years ago. I was in grade school. I \nwas in the first grade. It was a little country school named Hazel \nDell. And there were eight grades in one room. There were eight \nrows. Back in those days, every time you missed a spelling word, you \nwould walk up to the front of the class and they would swat you with a \npaddle. So I was a good speller, and I was in the first row because I \nwas in the first grade. My brother was in the second row because he was \nin the second grade. My sister was in the eighth row because she was in \nthe eighth grade. But every time they got around to me they had me sit \nover in the third row because I was a good speller.\n\n  Here is a brand new, innovative program that Government came up with \nhere centralized in Washington. I would suggest to you that the Goals \n2000 Program is one that has as its goalposts to bring the curriculum \nas close to Washington because our wisdom is so much greater here than \nit is out in the local areas. I do not agree with that. And yet what we \nare doing today, if we do--and I think it is going to happen--is we \nwill extend the funding of that by $255 million.\n  I see here that another $87 million is going to go to EPA. Now, I am \non the Environment and Public Works Committee. I can tell you that our \neffort with the Republican majority has been to stop some of this \nfoolishness that comes out of Washington and have, for instance, real \nSuperfund reform, Superfund reform where we would repeal retroactive \nliability, repeal joint and several liability, bring the remedies from \nthe Federal Government back to the State. The average Superfund cleanup \nthat is supervised by the Federal Government is something like 8\\1/2\\ \nyears, and yet we have some that are being done, or proposals being \nmade that if we can do it under local jurisdiction with everyone \ninvolved such as in Bossier City, LA, where one of the oil companies \nhad actually had a cleanup--they admitted they were the responsible \nparty, so they made a proposal to the State of Louisiana, and it was \nagreed to by the State of Louisiana, by the city of Bossier City, by \nall of the local officials, by all the consumer groups, by everyone \nthey could get together to clean it up in a year and a half, and yet \nthe EPA in Washington said no. Now we have got it reversed. But at \nfirst they said no, and so it would take another 8 to 9 years to do.\n  And so with this thrust that we are trying to get to bring the \nremedies and bring as much back to the local area, we find we are \nincreasing EPA by $87 million, and that is in addition to the $170 \nmillion that the Agency received above the fiscal year 1996 levels.\n  So, first of all, we have increased them by $170 million. Now we are \nincreasing that by $87 million. So all these programs where the people \nare upset Government is coming, the EPA, and saying you are guilty of \nmessing up the Superfund site when you sold used crankcase oil 10 years \nago to a licensed contractor; therefore, we are going to fine you, this \nkind of abuse of the responsible and law-abiding taxpayers is going to \ncontinue.\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\n  The same is true with endangered species, wetlands. And I notice on \nthis, if this is correct, that of the $6.5 billion, about half of that \nis coming from the BIF-SAIF fund. And if you recall, Mr. President, \nthis was an amount of money that was set up to take care of future \nneeds, a reserve, if you will, so that we do not have to go back \nthrough the same thing we went through a couple of years ago when this \nso-called bailout came about. So that the S's will be required to put \nin approximately a one-time expenditure of $3.1 billion. This will go \ninto a fund so that in the event it is called upon the money will be \nthere, and yet in fact through accounting they are going to be using \nthis money for some other purposes, to fund these programs, the \ndomestic programs the administration wants.\n\n  Now, if called upon, that money would still have to come from \nsomeplace, so what we are doing through accounting, smoke and mirrors, \nis just delaying this payment to buy something today.\n  And then I think the Chair would agree with me, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, who is occupying the chair at this time; he and I \nhave stood on this floor and expressed our concern over what is \nhappening to our defense budget many, many times in the last couple of \nyears. We are in fact operating with a defense budget that is far below \nthe minimum expectations of the American people. The vast majority of \nthe American people when asked, should we be capable of defending the \nUnited States of America on two regional fronts, say yes.\n  And so we had the Bottom-Up Review under this administration. We came \nup with some figures as to what it would cost so we would be able to \nmeet the minimum expectation of the people of America. And yet we are \ncutting more and more and more. In fact, it was not too long ago before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee that the Chiefs of the four \nservices testified to this committee that we are $20 billion short-- \nthat is B, billion dollars short--of meeting those minimum expectations \nin our procurement account.\n  So, in fact, Mr. President, we are not meeting those expectations. \nAnd yet we find out something between $350 million and $1 billion is \ngoing to come out of defense--more money coming out.\n  Right now we have been trying to revive or keep alive a National \nMissile Defense System. We know for a fact there are some 25 to 30 \nnations that are either working on a weapon of mass destruction or \nalready have it. We know there are two missiles owned by two countries \nright now in existence that can reach the United States. We know there \nare mad people out there like Saddam Hussein who murders his own \ngrandchildren who are working on technology, and perhaps, if they are \nable, buy the missile technology to deliver a weapon of mass \ndestruction. I understand that they have, at least we suspect they do \nhave in their possession a biological weapon of mass destruction.\n  When we have a National Missile Defense System that is 90 percent \npaid for, all we have to do is kind of reach up into that high tier \nwith maybe some of the 22 Aegis ships that we have and be able to knock \ndown a missile coming at the United States while we have time to do it, \ninstead of that they have cut funding for the National Missile Defense \nSystem to the point where it is now delayed. And each year that it is \ndelayed is a year that a threat exists to the American people. And so \nit is a very serious thing, and we do not know for sure how much more \nmoney is coming out of defense. We do not know where it will come from. \nIs it going to come out of the National Missile Defense System? I hope \nnot.\n  Is it coming out of the personnel account? Two-thirds of our defense \nbudget is spent on people, and it would stand to reason some of it \nwould have to come out of that. And yet we have soldiers serving right \nnow who are actually on food stamps. So we cannot knock any more out of \nthis account. In conventional warfare, we are now No. 8 or 9, depending \non how you measure it, in ground forces. I think Pakistan has passed us \nup. In my opinion, that makes us No. 9. So we have a very serious \nproblem in conventional forces and force strength, and we cannot afford \nany more cuts.\n\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I am going to listen attentively to \nthe debate today to see if I missed something, but I am anticipating \nopposing it. I think I can justify it for no other reason than to say \nlook at that, Mr. President. This is something that did not exist 5 \ndays ago. There it is. That is what we will be voting on in order to \nkeep Government from shutting down if the President should elect to \nshut down Government in the event that he were to veto our \nappropriation bill.\n  So I do not like what we are doing. I think we are caving into $6.5 \nbillion of the President's domestic programs that he has been promoting \nthat this Congress, both Houses agree is money should not have to be \nspent. Sooner or later we are going to have to do something about all \nthe funding we do around here, the smoke and mirrors. We have troops \nright now in Bosnia. We were promised by this administration that in \nDecember of this year those troops would be back, and if we did not \nbelieve it--I did not believe it, and yet when we had a motion, or a \nresolution of disapproval so that we could keep from sending our troops \nover to do humanitarian work in the country where we do not have any \nstrategic interests facing our Nation's security and we send them on \nover anyway, we missed that by four votes. And I suggest, Mr. \nPresident, if we had been honest with the American people, if the \nPresident had been honest with the American people and admitted that we \nwere not going to have the troops back in 12 months, then there would \nbe enough pressure on the people of this body, at least four of them to \nvote the other way and we would not have had to send troops over there. \nNow they said it is going to cost $2 billion. Just last week Under \nSecretary of Defense John White admitted it will be closer to $3.5 and \nprobably be double that figure. So there is another few billion dollars \nthat are not there, not accounted for.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not think that I could consciously, unless \nsomething happens today, unless I learn something that my studies have \nnot found so far, vote to spend an additional $6.5 billion on \nadditional programs for the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have a message from the leader if it is all right. \nOn behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate remain \nin status quo with respect to debate only on H.R. 4278 until 2:30 \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I ask that we modify that to give me, if nobody else is \nseeking recognition, 7 or 8 minutes to speak as though in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. Let me modify that to say not to start until 10 \nminutes from now, and the Senate remain in status quo with respect to \ndebate on H.R. 4278 until 2:30 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11835-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11836-S11837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIRING SENATE COLLEAGUES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and colleague from \nOklahoma for his usual courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I had spoken before about various Members of this body \nwho are retiring. But last week, as I was sitting at my home in \nVermont, looking back down through the list of those retiring Senators \nof both parties--many of whom, incidentally, visited Vermont at one \ntime or another--I was struck by a common thread. Let me tell you, \nfirst, of the Senators who are retiring, and then I will speak of that \nthread.\n  Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee; Senator Pell of Rhode Island, the \nformer chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of the most \nsenior Members of this body--in fact, I believe the most senior one \nretiring this year; Senator Sam Nunn, former chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and Senator Bennett Johnston, former chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, both of whom came here a couple of years ahead of me; \nSenators David Pryor of Arkansas and Paul Simon of Illinois, and Alan \nSimpson of Wyoming; William Cohen of Maine. Senators Nancy Kassebaum of \nKansas,\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\nHowell Heflin of Alabama, Jim Exon of Nebraska, Bill Bradley of New \nJersey, and Hank Brown of Colorado.\n  All of these people served with distinction, each for different \nreasons, each for their own area of expertise. But when you look down \nthrough this list, if you are one of the people who handicaps political \nraces, you would have to say, whether you were Republican or Democrat, \nthe thing they each have in common is that each one of these Senators \nwould have been reelected. The Democrats in this list would have easily \nbeen reelected. The Republicans in this list would have been easily \nreelected. A couple have literally run without opposition in the past.\n  Maybe it says something about this body. To me, it says two things. \nOne is that we have fallen, both here and in the other body, fallen \ninto the habit of allowing things to become too partisan, too personal, \nand, in many instances, mean. There is too much aiming for the special \ninterest groups of the ultraright or the ultraleft, too often looking \nfor legislation that is designed to be a slogan, rather than to be of \nsubstance for this country.\n  But the people I have mentioned here are the ones who have tried to \nstay away from that, who have tried to bring us back to the middle, \nback to the center, realizing at some point Republicans and Democrats \nhave to come together.\n  I think of Mark Hatfield and what he has done, both as chairman and \nas ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where if \nthere is ever a committee where individual interests sometimes go way \nover any question of ideology, it is in that committee. How many times \nhe has brought us all together so we could come out for the good of the \ncountry.\n  Senator Kassebaum, who in her work, her quiet work but her steady and \nhonest and complete work for this country and for this body, both as \nchair of her committee and as representative of her State, earned the \ncomplete applause of every Member of this body. There is not a Member \nhere who is happy to see her retire. We all wish she would stay. That \nis obviously the way the people of Kansas feel.\n  Senator Sam Nunn, who is recognized by Republicans and Democrats \nalike as one of the foremost voices in this body on defense matters, \nsomeone to whom both Republican and Democratic Presidents have gone, as \nhave the leaders of both parties in here, time and time again, for \nadvice and help and support--again, one who brought Republicans and \nDemocrats together.\n  Bennett Johnston, who is probably as able a legislator as I have ever \nserved with, again, as both chairman and ranking member, taking \nlegislation through this body that would have stymied anybody else.\n  Alan Simpson, a person with whom I share a great friendship, as well \nas, I might say, the same barber. He has an ability and a very candid, \nsome would say earthy style of bringing us together. He is also a \nperson who has always kept his word to both sides of the aisle.\n\n  Bill Cohen is a man who brings a legislator's expertise but a poet's \nsoul to this body. He has worked so often with me and with others on \nthis side of the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions to some of the \nmost difficult issues in this body, ranging from the use of our \nintelligence agencies to our worldwide power.\n  Howell Heflin, with whom I sat in both the Agriculture and Judiciary \nCommittees, the wise judge who, when we are unable to reach a solution, \nsomehow seems to come up with one--again, that brings us together.\n  Claiborne Pell, one of the most distinguished Members of this body, \nand most loved Members, a quiet man who, again, always seems to do what \nis right.\n  Paul Simon, historian, at the time when this body is losing so much \nof its sense of history, again, he will bring us back, over and over \nagain, not only to what is right but also what is historically right.\n  You see Hank Brown, Bill Bradley, Jim Exon, people with whom I have \neither served on committees or committees of conference with them or as \ncosponsors of their legislation, again, understanding that at some \npoint we have to come together.\n  I believe I mentioned all in this list, except for Senator David \nPryor. It is no overstatement to say David Pryor is the friend of all \nof us. We all understand David's motivation in leaving, both for his \nhealth, and for his family--primarily for family. David Pryor would not \nhave been contested this year. He would have won virtually by \nacclamation in Arkansas.\n  There is hardly a Member in this body who has not gone to David at \nsome point and said, ``How do we get out of this impasse? How do we \nwork it through?'' I must say, President Clinton, in good days and in \nbad days, has been fortunate to have David Pryor here, as one he could \nspeak to and from whom he could get an honest assessment, and also one \nwe could speak to, whether we had good news or bad news for the \nPresident.\n  All of these people will be missed, but I don't think we can \noverstate that what we have lost by these Senators leaving. They leave \nbehind a body that grows increasingly polarized, and the country \nsuffers, the Senate suffers. I have said so many times--it is a mantra \nalmost to me--this body should be the conscience of the Nation. The \nconscience is one where we come together collectively and speak to the \nbest instincts in the greatest democracy history has ever known. This \nrequires men and women of good will in both parties to recognize the \ndifferences in each other's region of the country, in each other's \nphilosophy, sometimes in each other's goals * * * but, through all \nthat, to understand ultimately it is the United States' goals that must \nbe met. It is this country's goals that must be met, but it is also the \nhistory and the integrity of this body that must be preserved.\n  We are making decisions for our children and for our grandchildren. \nThey are going to live most of their lives in the next century. Our \ndecisions should be for that next century, not just for this week's \npartisan gain or this election's partisan gain or this evening's news.\n  So I hope when we come back into session in January--and I will be \none who will be here--that all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nwill pledge to follow the examples of so many of these Senators I have \ntalked about, and work to come together, not to further polarize, both \nthis body and the other body. In the end, neither party gains or loses \nan advantage by that polarization, but the country does lose--it loses \nbadly.\n  Every one of us will say goodbye with fondness and affection to these \nMembers of the Senate. Each one of us will miss these Members of the \nSenate, no matter which party we belong to. But I might add, if we want \nto honor their distinguished service in this body, let's do it by \npledging, as we come into the 105th Congress, that we do it with more a \nsense of comity, of accommodation, of bipartisanship and upholding the \nNation's interests and the responsibilities and respect and proud \nhistory of the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11836-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11837-S11838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN A. DURICKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an Associated \nPress article about John Duricka, written by my friend, Jim Abrams, be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, John Duricka was not only one of the finest \nphotographers I ever knew, but also one of the best reporters of the \nCapitol. His photos will illustrate our history books for decades and \ngenerations to come. He was a man who suffered greatly in the last few \nmonths of his life with cancer, but few of us knew how badly it was.\n  I had a conversation with him at the beginning of the summer in which \nhe talked of going to the Republican and Democratic Conventions. I told \nhim I was looking forward to seeing him at ours and would probably be \nasking him for tips on exposures and angles for my own photography at \nthat convention. It became too much, and he did not make it there, and \nmore is the pity.\n  Last week, there was a memorial service for him there. Many spoke in \neulogies of him. They spoke of a man who always had to get the photo \nbut never forgot there were other photographers he worked with. Over \nand over,\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\nI saw him in a committee room where he would come in--you always get a \nnice smile from him--and I would see him go over, find a great angle, \ntake a couple shots, and often, if there was a new photographer there, \nhe would point that angle out to him.\n  The article that is printed at the end of this from the Associated \nPress speaks far better about him, as I think Mr. Abrams is far more \neloquent than I, and that is why I want it included.\n  I was pleased to see the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, \nalso spoke about him last week. He well deserves that.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Associated Press, Sept. 24, 1996]\n\n                        AP Photographer Praised\n\n                            (By Jim Abrams)\n\n       The Senate and House opened their sessions Tuesday with \n     tributes to AP photographer John A. Duricka, a veteran of \n     Capitol Hill photo coverage who died Monday.\n       ``The Senate and all Americans lost a true professional \n     yesterday,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``The \n     measure of John's professionalism and dedication is he was on \n     the job almost up to the time of his death doing what he \n     loved and doing it wonderfully well.''\n       Lott spoke of Duricka's ``combination of mature demeanor \n     and tough determination'' and added: ``All who treasure our \n     freedoms of the press and free expression will miss his \n     outstanding contributions to that end.''\n       In the House, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said Duricka was \n     ``a great friend to me.'' Dreier recalled that he delivered \n     the eulogy at the funeral of Duricka's brother, a \n     photographer at the San Gabriel Valley Tribune who was killed \n     in a plane crash several years ago.\n       ``John Duricka was a great man and he took wonderful, \n     photographs and he's one of those institutions in this \n     Capitol who will be sorely missed,'' Dreier said.\n       Jonathan Wolman, AP's Washington bureau chief, said: ``From \n     Bobby Byrd to Newt Gingrich, John captured all the great \n     figures of Congress. He illustrated the legislative process \n     with pictures of leaders, lobbyists and hundreds of ordinary \n     citizens who appeared in committee hearings.''\n       Duricka was ``a professional's professional,'' Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy, D-Vt., recalled Monday. ``His work was seen by \n     millions who never knew his name. He was a familiar presence \n     on Capitol Hill and I always looked for him among the \n     photographers. He was a friend to many, and he will be \n     missed.''\n       Duricka, 58, had a 30-year career as an AP photographer. He \n     was chairman of the congressional Standing Committee of Press \n     Photographers, which represents the interests of still \n     photographers.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, we are coming on to the end of this \nsession. It is a very, very important session. I think we have \naccomplished a lot in this Congress. We have made changes, seen major \nchanges in how the budget is going to be handled. We now have the \nPresident of the United States talking, for the first time--a \nDemocratic President talking for the first time--in 60 years about \nbalancing the budget. I do not think we have any choice in the matter. \nWe have to move toward a balanced budget.\n  But we have to see change in welfare reform. For the first time we \nhave actually done something to entitlement programs. We have certainly \npassed a whole raft of other bills that are outlined in the newspapers \nalmost on a daily basis. I think people are amazed what a terrific and \nimportant Congress this has been.\n  I would like to just take a few minutes this morning to address some \nof the measures in the omnibus bill before the Senate. One such measure \nis the vast bulk of the immigration conference report. The American \npeople expect the Federal Government to control our country's borders. \nWe have not yet done so. The American people expect Congress and the \nPresident to strengthen the national effort against illegal \nimmigration.\n  Despite the last-minute political gamesmanship of the President, we \nhave included in the omnibus measure provisions dealing with the \nproblem of illegal immigration. This omnibus measure includes the \nconference report on H.R. 2202, the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, with certain modifications to \ntitle V of the conference report. The legislative history of the \nimmigration portion of this measure includes the legislative history of \nH.R. 2202 and S. 1664, with their accompanying committee reports and \nfloor debates and, in addition, a joint explanatory statement of the \ncommittee of conference in Report 104-828.\n  The American people should make no mistake about it. There is no \nthanks owed to President Clinton for this achievement.\n  On August 2, 1996, President Clinton wrote to Speaker Gingrich. \nRemarkably, he said unequivocally he would veto this bill even with the \nsignificantly modified Gallegly provision on public education for \nillegal aliens, a compromise which was not even yet at that point in \nfinal form. Republican conferees removed that provision from the \nproposed conference report, a draft of which was initially circulated \non September 10, 1996. It was the only issue upon which the President \nsaid he would veto this bill.\n  The President had 2 weeks before the actual conference to register \nother objections to the draft conference report. Yet, only after the \nconference committee met and filed its report did the President \ninterpose final objections related to title V of the conference report, \nwhich addresses immigrants' financial responsibilities. The President \nwas apparently willing to shut down the Government or kill the \nimmigration bill on his last-minute demands. The immigration measure in \nthis appropriations bill now contains further concessions to the \nPresident. We have finally cleared away the obstructions, and it is my \nunderstanding that he no longer has any major objections.\n\n  This bill is an important bill. It cracks down on illegal \nimmigration. Among other things, it builds up and strengthens the \nBorder Patrol. It authorizes 5,000 new agents and 1,500 new support \npersonnel for the Border Patrol over the next 5 years. This increase \nbasically doubles the size of the Border Patrol. The proposal adds as \nmany as 450 investigators and related personnel to combat illegal alien \nsmuggling into our country over 3 years. The bill provides 300 \npersonnel to investigate those who overstay their visas and thus remain \nillegally in our country.\n  The conference report requires the Attorney General to establish an \nautomated entry and exit control system to match arriving and departing \naliens and to identify visa overstayers. It authorizes acquisition of \nimproved equipment and technology for border control, including \nhelicopters, four-wheel drive vehicles, night vision scopes and sensor \nunits, just to name a few things.\n  The bill adds civil penalties to existing criminal penalties against \naliens illegally entering our country. Criminal and civil penalties for \ndocument fraud are increased. Criminal penalties against those who \nsmuggle aliens into our country are also increased. High speed flight \nfrom an INS checkpoint is a felony punishable by up to 5 years \nimprisonment under this bill.\n  The bill makes it illegal to falsely claim American citizenship with \nthe purpose of obtaining any Federal or State benefit or service or for \nthe purpose of voting or registering to vote in any Federal, State or \nlocal election.\n  This bill gives the INS, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nwiretap authority in alien smuggling and document fraud cases.\n  The bill broadens the definition of ``aggravated felony'' for \npurposes of our immigration laws, even beyond the new Terrorism Act, to \ninclude crimes of rape and sexual abuse of a minor. It lowers the fine \nthreshold for money laundering from $100,000 to $10,000. It decreases \nthe imprisonment threshold for theft, violence, racketeering, and \ndocument fraud from 5 years to 1 year. That is the threshold. The \nbroadened definition of aggravated felony adds new offenses related to \ngambling, bribery, perjury, revealing the identity of undercover \nagents, and transporting prostitutes. What does this mean? More \ncriminal aliens will be deportable and fewer will be eligible for \nwaivers of deportation.\n  To assist in the identification and removal of deportable criminal \naliens, the bill authorizes the registration of\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\naliens on probation or parole; requires that the criminal alien \nidentification system be used to assist Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies in identifying and locating removable criminal \naliens; and authorizes $5 million per year from 1997 to 2001 for the \ncriminal alien tracking center. The bill also provides that funds under \nthe State Criminal Alien Assistance Program may be used for costs of \nimprisoning criminal aliens in State or local facilities.\n  This bill also provides that the fee for adjustment of status be \nincreased to $1,000 and that at least 80 percent of those fees be spent \non enhancing the Immigration and Naturalization Service's capacity to \ndetain criminal aliens and others subject to detention. The bill also \nauthorizes $150 million for detaining and removing deportable and \ninadmissible aliens.\n\n  To facilitate legal entry, this measure provides for increased full-\ntime land border inspectors to ensure full staffing of border crossing \nlanes during peak crossing hours. The bill will result in the \nestablishment of preinspection stations at a limited number of foreign \nairports.\n  These provisions are desperately needed to stem the tide of illegal \nimmigration.\n  I note that I am not happy with all of the immigration bill's \nprovisions, but I have to say, I do not think anybody is. The vast \nmajority of them, however, are good provisions. But let me give you a \ncouple of illustrations that I am not very happy about. It adds, for \nexample, personnel for the enforcement of employer sanctions. I believe \nwe ought to repeal employer sanctions outright as a costly, \ncounterproductive failure. I cannot help but note that President \nClinton has gone much further than even this bill proposes by signing \nan Executive order penalizing Federal contractors who violate the \nemployer sanctions law. In doing so, he not only throws more good money \nafter bad, he is inadvertently fostering more discrimination against \nthose ethnic minorities in our society who look and sound different \nfrom the majority.\n  I am no fan of verification schemes, and I am skeptical that the \npilot programs provided for in this bill will be worthwhile. Here \nagain, the President is already using existing authority to implement \nverification projects, which I do not believe can work on a national \nscale.\n\n  Despite my great reluctance, I have agreed to allow the Attorney \nGeneral to certify to Congress that she cannot comply with the \nmandatory criminal alien detention provisions of the recently enacted \nterrorism law, antiterrorism law, thereby obtaining a 1-year grace \nperiod which could be extended or can be extended under this bill for 1 \nadditional year on top of that 1-year grace period. The Clinton \nadministration has been tenacious in pleading with Congress to ease \nthis criminal alien detention requirement. I would have preferred that \nthe administration find facilities necessary to implement these \nprovisions.\n  On balance, though, the immigration bill is a very worthy measure, \nand I am pleased that it has been included in the omnibus spending \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent a statement of legislative history be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee a few questions to clarify the changes made in the \nasylum provisions of the Senate immigration bill when the House and \nSenate conferees adopted the conference report on H.R. 2202, the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. \nThese provisions are included in this omnibus appropriations measure. \nSenator Hatch was a conferee on this legislation and was deeply \ninvolved in the development of this provision.\n  Section 604 of the conference report would add to the Immigration and \nNationality Act a new section providing that an alien may not apply for \nasylum unless he or she demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence \nthat the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the \nalien's arrival in the United States. That section also includes two \nimportant exceptions--one for changed circumstances that materially \naffect the applicant's eligibility for asylum, and the other relating \nto the delay in filing an application. Would the Chairman explain the \nmeaning of these exceptions?\n  Mr. HATCH. The conference report does include a 1-year time limit, \nfrom the time of entering the United States, on filing applications for \nasylum. Conferees also adopted important exceptions, both for changed \ncircumstances that materially affect an applicant's eligibility for \nasylum and for extraordinary circumstances that relate to the delay in \nfiling the application.\n  Like my distinguished colleague from Michigan, I too supported the \nSenate provision, which received overwhelming, bipartisan support in \nthe Senate. In fact, that provision was\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\nadopted by an amendment in the Judiciary Committee that passed by \nunanimous consent. The Senate provisions had established a 1-year time \nlimit only on defensive claims of asylum, that is, those raised for the \nfirst time in deportation proceedings, and provided for a good cause \nexception.\n  Let me say that I share the Senator's concern that we continue to \nensure that asylum is available for those with legitimate claims of \nasylum. The way in which the time limit was rewritten in the conference \nreport--with the two exceptions specified--was intended to provide \nadequate protections to those with legitimate claims of asylum. I \nexpect that circumstances covered by the Senate's good cause exception \nwill likely be covered by either the changed circumstances exception or \nthe extraordinary circumstances exception contained in the conference \nreport language. The conference report provision represents a \ncompromise in that, unlike the Senate provision, it applies to all \nclaims of asylum, whether raised affirmatively or defensively.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Would you say that the intent in the changed \ncircumstances exception is to cover a broad range of circumstances that \nmay have changed and that affect the applicant's ability to obtain \nasylum?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. That exception is intended to deal with circumstances \nthat changed after the applicant entered the United States and that are \nrelevant to the applicant's eligibility for asylum. The changed \ncircumstances provision will deal with situations like those in which \nthe situation in the alien's home country may have changed, the \napplicant obtains more information about likely retribution he or she \nmight face if the applicant returned home, and other situations that we \nin Congress may not be able to anticipate at this time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. It is my understanding that the second exception, for \nextraordinary circumstances, relates to legitimate reasons excusing the \nalien's failure to meet the 1-year deadline. Is that the case?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, the extraordinary circumstances exception applies to \nreasons that are, quite literally, out of the ordinary and that explain \nthe alien's inability to meet the 1-year deadline. Extraordinary \ncircumstances excusing the delay could include, for instance, physical \nor mental disability, unsuccessful efforts to seek asylum that failed \ndue to technical defects or errors for which the alien was not \nresponsible, and other extenuating circumstances.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the time limit and the exceptions you have discussed \ndo not provide sufficient protection to aliens with bona fide claims of \nasylum, I will be prepared to work with my colleagues to address that \nproblem. Is my understanding correct that you too will pay close \nattention to how this provision is interpreted?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. Like you, I am committed to ensuring that those with \nlegitimate claims of asylum are not returned to persecution, \nparticularly for technical deficiencies. If the time limit is not \nimplemented fairly, or cannot be implemented fairly, I will be prepared \nto revisit this issue in a later Congress. I would also like to let the \nSenator from Michigan know how much I appreciate his commitment and \ndedication on this issue.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you. I would likewise thank the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for his diligent efforts on this issue in \nconference and his explanation of the conference report's provisions.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will note, briefly, that the bill modifies the \nantiterrorism law's provisions on summary exclusion, in order to better \nassure that those who are bona fide asylees are not erroneously \ncompelled to leave this country.\n  On a related point, the Clinton administration has recently announced \nits plans to cut refugee admissions next year to 78,000. I oppose this \ncut. In fiscal year 1995, the level was 110,000. Last year, the level \nof refugee admissions was set at 90,000. I believe we should set the \nsame level of 90,000 refugee admissions for next year. A further cut is \nunwarranted, especially with the renewed steps against alien \nimmigration embodied in the bill. Moreover, I think it sends the wrong \nsignal to the world.\n  A Hatch-Biden substitute for my Child Pornography Protection Act, S. \n1237, has been included in the omnibus measure. I thank the \nappropriators on both sides of the aisle for their cooperation in \nincluding this important measure in this omnibus bill. The legislative \nhistory of the child pornography provisions of this bill includes the \nlegislative history of S. 1237, including the report of the Committee \nof the Judiciary, Report 104-358.\n  Senators Feinstein and Grassley have important provisions in the \nchild pornography provisions of this measure and I want to thank them, \nas well as Senator Biden, for their important work on these matters. \nThey have done a very good job, and I have a lot of respect for my \ncolleagues.\n\n\n                    Child Pornography Prevention Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, modern computer imaging and morphing \ntechnology has made possible the production of pornographic depictions \nof minors which are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting \nviewer from unretouched photographs of actual children engaging in \nsexually explicit conduct.\n  Such computer generated child pornography has many of the same \nharmful effects, and thus poses the same threat to the physical and \nmental health, safety and well-being of our children and of our society \nas pornographic material produced using actual children. However, \nbecause current Federal law pertaining to the sexual exploitation of \nchildren and the production, distribution, possession, sale, or \ntransportation of child pornography is limited to material produced \nusing actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct, computer \ngenerated child pornography is presently outside the scope of Federal \nlaw.\n  The omnibus bill includes the Child Pornography Prevention Act of \n1996. This act will close this computer generated loophole and give our \nlaw enforcement authorities the tools they need to protect our children \nby stemming the increasing flow of high-technology child pornography.\n  The Child Pornography Prevention Act, as introduced, as S. 1237, \naddresses the problem of ``high-tech kiddie porn'' by creating a \ncomprehensive statutory definition of the term ``child pornography'' to \ninclude visual depictions of sexually explicit conduct: First, produced \nusing children engaging in sexually explicit conduct; Second, computer \ngenerated depictions which are, or appear to be, of minors engaging in \nsexually explicit conduct; or Third, materials advertised, described, \nor otherwise presented as a visual depiction of a minor engaging in \nsexually explicit conduct.\n  The act establishes a new section in U.S. Code Title 18, Sec. 2252A, \nprohibiting the distribution, possession, receipt, reproduction, sale, \nor transportation of child pornography. The act contains congressional \nfindings as to the harmful effects of child pornography and the threat \nto the physical and mental health, safety, and well-being of children \nand society posed by child pornography, both computer generated \ndepictions and depictions produced using actual children. The act also \nincreases the penalties for child sexual exploitation and child \npornography offenses.\n  At the Judiciary Committee markup of S. 1237, Senator Biden expressed \nconcern that the bill, as introduced, may not be upheld by the courts. \nSpecifically, Senator Biden was concerned as to the constitutionality \nof the provision in the bill's definition section that classifies as \nchild pornography a visual depiction which appears to be of a minor \nengaging in sexually explicit conduct, even if no actual child was \ninvolved in its production.\n\n  In New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), the Supreme Court, while \nupholding prohibitions on child pornography, not otherwise obscene, \nwhere the pornography included actual minors, noted that ``distribution \nof descriptions or other depictions of sexual conduct, not otherwise \nobscene, which do not involve live performance or photographic or other \nvisual reproduction of live performances, retains First Amendment \nprotection.''\n  Senator Biden, and some others, worried that, to the extent the bill \nreached both child pornography that is within Ferber's four corners, \ni.e., material produced utilizing actual minors, and visual depictions \nof those who merely appear to be minors--through the use of computer \n``morphing,'' for example--it could be struck down. In light of this\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\nconcern, Senator Biden wanted to include in the bill a separate section \nexpressly covering pornography involving identifiable minors, so that \nif the broader appears to be provision is struck down, coverage of \nidentifiable minor child pornography will survive.\n  I am confident that the Child Pornography Prevention Act's \nprohibition on computer-generated visual depictions which appear to be \nof a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct would be found \nconstitutional, a view shared by the Department of Justice and other \nlegal experts in this field, and the definition of child pornography \ncontained in this legislation would be upheld by the courts in its \nentirety.\n  I believe the Supreme Court, in light of technological advances since \nthe Ferber decision and the record Congress has established with \nrespect to the harmful effects of computer-generated material which \nappears to be of a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct, \nincluding the use of such material to seduce children for sexual abuse \nand exploitation, will find it constitutional.\n  At the same time, I agree that it would be reasonable to include in \nthe act a fall-back provision specifically covering only identifiable \nminor material. Since this type of material involves a depiction of, \nand is therefore likely to result in harm to, a real child, i.e., the \nchild being depicted, such a provision is indisputably constitutional \nunder Ferber and would provide an enforceable weapon against at least \nsome computer-generated child pornography in the event that the act's \nbroader prohibition on computer-generated material which appears to be \nof a child engaging in sexually explicit conduct is overturned by the \ncourts.\n  Despite concerns about the method proposed by Senator Biden to \naddress the problem of identifiable minor pornographic material, I \nagreed at the markup to accept his amendment, with the understanding \nthat we would work together to improve the way we are achieving his \nobjective.\n\n  Senator Biden's amendment added to S. 1237 another new statutory \nsection, as 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252B, which is directed at one particular \ntype of computer-created or generated images--visual depictions which \nhave been created, adapted or modified to make it appear that an \nidentifiable minor was engaged in sexually explicit conduct. The term \nidentifiable minor was defined to mean a minor who is capable of being \nrecognized as an actual person by, for example, his face or other \ndistinguishing feature or physical characteristic, although a \nprosecutor would not be required to prove the minor's actual identity.\n  Section 2252B duplicated, with respect to identifiable minor \nmaterial, the prohibitions and penalties established under Sec. 2252A \nfor the distribution, possession, receipt, sale or transportation of \nmaterial which would be classified as child pornography under this \nbill. The bill, as modified in the Judiciary Committee, however, did \nnot expressly include identifiable minor material in the statutory \ndefinition of ``child pornography,'' although such material could be \nclassified as child pornography under the definition's ``appears to \nbe'' language.\n  I agreed with the goal of Senator Biden's amendment. Visual \ndepictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct can haunt \nthat person for his or her entire life. In addition, there is the \nthreat that a child molester or pedophile could take pictures of a \nchild he finds sexually desirable and then produce pornographic \ndepictions featuring that child engaging in sexual conduct--depictions \nwhich he can use to stimulate his own sexual appetites, sell or \ndistribute to others, or use in an effort to seduce that child or \nothers into submitting to sexual exploitation.\n  The threat posed by, and the harm resulting from, visual depictions \nof identifiable minors which have been created or altered so as to make \nit appear that the minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct is \nsufficiently distinct and serious to warrant inclusion in the act of \nlanguage specifically addressing this type of material.\n  My concern regarding the Biden amendment was directed solely at the \nmethod used to achieve the goal of prohibiting pornographic material \nwhich uses the image or depiction of an identifiable minor as a clearly \nseparate offense. It was, in my view, unnecessarily duplicative to \nenact two virtually identical statutory sections, 2252A and 2252B, to \ndeal with computer created or generated child pornography, as the \ncommittee-passed bill with Senator Biden's amendment did.\n  Further, it was inconsistent and potentially very confusing \nspecifically to address identifiable minor pornographic material in the \ncontext of this bill, to treat such material in the identical manner as \nmaterial formally classified as child pornography under this bill, but \nnot to include identifiable minor material in the bill's statutory \ndefinition of child pornography. It seemed to me that there is a far \nstronger case for the creation of one new section to deal with the new \ntechnology of child pornography, rather than two.\n\n  In addition, if we included in this legislation a provision dealing \nspecifically with identifiable minor material, but failed to include \nsuch material in the bill's definition of child pornography, this fact \ncould be seized upon by child pornographers and pedophiles to make the \nlegal argument that identifiable minor material cannot be considered \nchild pornography within the meaning of federal law. This could have an \nadverse impact on law enforcement efforts where, for example, an \nindividual's involvement with or prior conviction for child pornography \nwas relevant to an investigation or prosecution, or a factor in \nsentencing.\n  Following continued discussions, Senator Biden and I concluded that \nthe most appropriate and effective method of dealing with identifiable \nminor material, and that most compatible with the framework for dealing \nwith all forms of child pornography set out by the act, is to include \nin the proposed statutory definition of the term child pornography a \nsubsection specifically covering such material. The Child Pornography \nPrevention Act contained in the omnibus bill is the Hatch/Biden \nsubstitute.\n  Under this bill, a visual depiction would be classified as child \npornography if such visual depiction has been created, adapted or \nmodified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually \nexplicit conduct. The term identifiable minor would be defined as a \nperson who was a minor at the time the visual depiction was created, \nadapted, or modified, or whose image as a minor was used in creating, \nadapting, or modifying the visual depiction, and who is recognizable as \nan actual person by the person's face, likeness, or other \ndistinguishing characteristic, such as a unique birthmark or other \nrecognizable feature, but such term does not require proof of the \nminor's actual identity.\n  Modifying the definition of child pornography to include identifiable \nminor child pornographic material, eliminates any need to establish an \nadditional section in title 18 pertaining specifically and exclusively \nto that particular type of material. Since identifiable minor material \nwould be classified as child pornography, its distribution, possession, \nreceipt, reproduction, sale or transportation would, like all other \nmaterial so classified pursuant to the Act, be prohibited under the \nsection 2252A created under this bill.\n  The act also resolves any concern as to the severability of the \ndefinition's identifiable minor provision in the event the definition's \nappears to be language were to be struck down.\n  S. 1237, as introduced, resolved the question of severability by the \nbill's severability clause, which explicitly states that if any \nprovision of this act, which would include the legislation's definition \nof child pornography, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of \nthe act shall not be affected. In order to set to rest any lingering \nconcern, however, the Hatch/Biden substitute amended the act's \nseverability clause to specifically state that if any provision of \nsection of the definition of the term child pornography is held to be \nunconstitutional, any remaining provision or section of the definition \nshall not be affected.\n  We know that child pornography aggravates child sexual molestation. \nWe must take steps to deal with this latest technological challenge to \nour laws protecting children. I believe that the Child Pornography \nPrevention Act shows that the intent of Congress is not to stand idle \nand thereby abet this pernicious activity. I urge all senators to \nsupport this act.\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a section-by-section analysis of the child \npornography provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996\n\n\n                               section 1\n\n       This section sets forth the short title for the \n     legislation, the ``Child Pornography Prevention Act of \n     1996.''\n\n\n                               section 2\n\n       This section sets forth a statement of Congressional \n     findings with respect to child pornography and computer-\n     generated depictions of, or which appear to be of, minors \n     engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Child pornography is a \n     form of sexual abuse and exploitation which can result in \n     physical or psychological harm, or both, to children. Child \n     pornography permanently records the victim's abuse, can cause \n     continuing harm to the depicted individual for years to come, \n     can be used to seduce minors into sexual activity, and is \n     used by pedophiles and child sex abusers to stimulate and \n     whet their own sexual appetites.\n       New photographic and computer imaging technologies are \n     capable of producing computer-generated visual depictions of \n     children engaging in sexually explicit conduct which are \n     virtually indistinguishable to an unsuspecting viewer from \n     unretouched photographs of actual minors engaging in such \n     conduct. The effect of such child pornography on a child \n     molester or pedophile using the material to whet his sexual \n     appetites, or on a child shown such material as a means of \n     seducing the child into sexual activity, is the same whether \n     the material is photographic or computer-generated depictions \n     of child sexual activity. Computer-generated child \n     pornography results in many of the same types of harm, and \n     poses the same danger to the well-being of children, as \n     photographic child pornography, and provide a compelling \n     governmental interest for prohibiting the production, \n     distribution, possessing, sale or viewing of all forms of \n     child pornography, including computer-generated depictions \n     which are, or appear to be, of children engaging in sexually \n     explicit conduct.\n\n\n                               section 3\n\n       This section amends the definition of the term ``visual \n     depiction'' at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(5) to include stored \n     computer data.\n       This section further amends Title 18 of the United States \n     Code by adding a new subsection, as 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(8), \n     establishing a definition of the term ``child pornography,'' \n     which is defined as ``any visual depiction, including any \n     photograph, film, video, picture, drawing or computer or \n     computer-generated image or picture, which is produced by \n     electronic, mechanical or other means, of sexually explicit \n     conduct, where: (1) its production involved the use of a \n     minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, or; (2) such \n     visual depiction is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in \n     sexually explicit conduct; (3) such visual depiction has been \n     created, adapted or modified to appear that an ``identifiable \n     minor'' is engaging in sexually explicit conduct; or (4) it \n     is advertised, distributed, promoted or presented in such a \n     manner as to convey the impression that it is a visual \n     depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.''\n       The term ``identifiable minor'' would be identified in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2256(9) to mean a minor who is capable of being \n     recognized as an actual person by, for example, his face or \n     other distinguishing feature or physical characteristic, \n     although a prosecutor would not be required to prove the \n     minor's actual identity.\n\n\n                               Section 4\n\n       This section adds a new and distinct section to title 18 of \n     the United States Code, as 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252A. This section \n     makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly mail, or ship, \n     or transport child pornography in interstate or foreign \n     commerce; to receive or distribute in interstate or foreign \n     commerce child pornography, or material containing child \n     pornography that has been mailed, or shipped, or transported \n     in interstate or foreign commerce; or to reproduce child \n     pornography for distribution through the mail. This section \n     further makes it unlawful in the special maritime and \n     territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or on any land \n     or building owned or controlled by the United States, or in \n     the Indian territory, to knowingly sell, or possess with \n     intent to sell, any child pornography; or to possess any \n     book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, \n     or any other material that contains 3 or more images of child \n     pornography.\n       Section 2252A mirrors with respect to ``child pornography'' \n     (as that term is defined under Section 3 of this bill) the \n     prohibitions on the distribution, possession, receipt, \n     reproduction, sale or transportation of material produced \n     using an actual minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct \n     contained in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252. The penalties in \n     Sec. Sec. 2252 and 2252A would be identical. Violation of \n     paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of Sec. 2252A(a) pertaining to \n     the distribution, reproduction, receipt, sale or \n     transportation of child pornography would be fined or \n     imprisoned for not less than 15 years, or both; a repeat \n     offender with a prior conviction under Chapter 109A or 110 of \n     Title 18, or under any state child abuse law or law relating \n     to the production, receipt or distribution of child \n     pornography would be fined and imprisoned for not less than 5 \n     years nor more than 30 years. Any person who violates \n     paragraph (4) of Sec. 2252A(a) pertaining to the possession \n     of child pornography would be fined or imprisoned for not \n     more than 5 years, or both; a repeat offender with a prior \n     conviction under Chapter 109A or 110 of Title 18, or under \n     any state law relating to the possession of child pornography \n     would be fined and imprisoned for not less than 2 years nor \n     more than 10 years.\n       This section also establishes an affirmative defense for \n     material depicting sexually explicit conduct where the \n     material was produced using actual persons engaging in \n     sexually explicit conduct and each such person was an adult \n     at the time the material was produced, provided the material \n     has not been pandered as child pornography.\n\n\n                               Section 5\n\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2251(d) to increase the \n     penalties for sexual exploitation of children. An individual \n     who violates Sec. 2251 would be fined or imprisoned for not \n     less than 10 years nor more than 20 years, or both. A \n     repeat offender with one prior conviction under Chapter \n     109A or 110 of Title 18, or under any state law relating \n     to the sexual exploitation of children would be fined and \n     imprisoned for not less than 15 years nor more than 30 \n     years; an individual with two or more prior such \n     convictions would be fined and imprisoned for not less \n     than 30 years nor more than life. If an offense under \n     Sec. 2251 resulted in the death of a person, the offender \n     would be punished by death or imprisonment for any term of \n     years or for life.\n\n\n                               Section 6\n\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(d) to increase the \n     penalties for offenses involving material produced using a \n     minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. As amended, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2252 will provide the identical penalties as 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2252A for offenses relating to the distribution, \n     possession, receipt, reproduction, sale or transportation of \n     prohibited child pornographic material.\n\n\n                               Section 7\n\n       This section amends the Privacy Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2000aa, to extend the existing exemption for searches \n     and seizures where the offense consists of the receipt, \n     possession or communication of information pertaining to the \n     national defense, classified information or restricted data, \n     to include an exemption for searches and seizures where the \n     offense involves the sexual exploitation of children, the \n     sale or buying of children, or the production, possession, \n     sale or distribution of child pornography under Title 18 of \n     the United States Code, 2251, 2251A, 2252, or 2252A.\n\n\n                               Section 8\n\n       This section, the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of \n     1996, amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2241(c) and 2243(a) to \n     provide for a mandatory sentence of life in prison for repeat \n     offenders convicted of sexual abuse of a minor or aggravated \n     sexual abuse of a minor.\n\n\n                               Section 9\n\n       This section includes in the bill a severability clause \n     providing that in the event any provision of the bill, \n     specifically including any provision or section of the \n     definition of the term child pornography, amendment made by \n     the bill, or application of the bill to any person or \n     circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of \n     the bill shall not be affected.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in addition, we were able to include a \nmeasure I sponsored which reimburses Billy Dale and the other members \nof the White House Travel Office for the legal expenses they incurred \nin defending themselves against the Clinton administration's \npolitically generated investigation into the office. I am pleased that \nthe Congress will soon pass this measure.\n  I want to commend Senator Gregg of New Hampshire for his efforts in \nsecuring $1.4 billion in funding for our Federal antiterrorism effort. \nAs well, this bill enhances the Federal commitment to combat illegal \ndrugs by providing a significant increase in our drug control budget. I \nhave to say that Senator Gregg has played a significant and pivotal war \nin the antiterrorism fights of this past Congress. He has done a \nterrific job and he deserves a lot of credit for the strides we have \nbeen able to make. I want to pay public acknowledgment to him for the \ngood work he has done.\n  With regard to the significant increase in our drug control budget, \nfor example, the bill provides $140 million in funding for five new \nhigh intensity trafficking area task forces, one of which the Judiciary \nCommittee expects will serve several Rocky Mountain States.\n  An additional $197 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n$46 million more than the President's request, has been provided as \nwell as a significant increase in funding for the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, the drug czar's office.\n  Further, the omnibus bill also contains legislation which I \nintroduced to allow the Office of Independent Counsel to obtain an \nadditional 6-month extension for travel expenses. Ken Starr needs this \ntime extension, and I am\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\npleased the leadership saw fit to include this measure.\n  As well, the bill contains $11.4 million in funding for the first \nphase of construction of a long-needed annex for the Federal courthouse \nin Salt Lake City. This has been a priority of the judicial branch for \nsome time and it is a highly warranted expenditure.\n  Moreover, I urged the negotiators to include a provision which \nclarifies the effective date of an important change to the rules of \nevidence which allows evidence of prior conduct to be admitted into \nevidence in Federal sex offense cases. This was a much needed \nclarification which Senator Kyl and Congresswoman Molinari urged be \nadopted. I am very pleased it was included.\n  Finally, I express my opposition to the medical patents provision \nwhich was included in this bill. This measure was added notwithstanding \nthe fact that there were no Senate hearings, and over the objections of \nmyself, the chairman of the Finance Committee and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. It is an unprecedented change to our patent code and it \nis my intention to closely scrutinize the implementation of this new \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, before I close, I wanted also to make a few comments \nabout a provision tucked inside this omnibus legislation which is of \ngreat concern to me. The provision would functionally eliminate the \npatenting of medical procedures.\n  I know that the authors of this provision are doing what they think \nis in the best interest of our citizens.\n  Nevertheless, I take exception to their amendment on medical process \npatents. I think this amendment is bad patent policy and questionable \ntrade law.\n  A patent that is not enforceable is like no patent at all. That is \nsimply what this issue boils down to.\n  And further, to exempt large multi-million-dollar organizations such \nas HMOs from the reach of patent code enforcement, flies in the face of \nthe American tradition of encouraging individual initiative.\n  My final concern, a very serious concern, is about the Uruguay Round \nAgreements Act [URAA], the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n[GATT] implementing legislation. Substantial questions have been raised \nabout whether this provision is consistent with the Agreement on Trade-\nRelated Intellectual Property [TRIPs]. In fact, it now appears that the \namendment may not be consistent with TRIPs, a grave matter of \ninternational import.\n  I also have concerns about the process implications of inserting this \nlanguage in the appropriations bill. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I try to take special care of all of the statutes under the \nCommittee's primary jurisdiction such as the patent code.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am also charged with the \nresponsibility of upholding the laws that affect our Nation's \ninternational trade.\n  In this regard, after serious study of this issue, on September 27, \nChairman Roth and I wrote to our colleagues, Senators Lott, Daschle, \nHatfield and Byrd, and indicated our concern about inserting this \nprovision in the final legislation due to its unstudied impact.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As Chairmen of the Senate Finance and \n     Judiciary Committees, we strongly oppose inclusion of \n     proposed section 616 in the omnibus appropriations bill. \n     Inclusion of the provision, which concerns medical procedure \n     patents, is inappropriate for several reasons.\n       Section 616 implicates U.S. obligations under an \n     international trade agreement, specifically the Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) \n     administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). As a \n     result, this aspect of section 616 falls under the Senate \n     Committee on Finance's jurisdiction on international trade \n     agreements.\n       Moreover, the provision raises serious questions regarding \n     U.S. compliance with its obligations under TRIPs. It could \n     also establish a precedent which other countries might invoke \n     to deny or weaken patent protection afforded to U.S. industry \n     under the TRIPs. The Committee on Finance has not had an \n     opportunity to hold a hearing on this matter to consider \n     these broader ramifications for U.S. trade policy.\n       Section 616 is very controversial and constitutes a \n     significant departure from principles of American patent law \n     that have been on the books for over two hundred years. The \n     amendment would preclude a certain class of patent-holders \n     from enforcing their patent rights against infringement, a \n     change that renders these patents virtually meaningless. That \n     there is no consensus on this significant change in U.S. \n     patent law is underscored by the fact that the Clinton \n     Administration, the American Intellectual Property Law \n     Association, the Intellectual Property Owners, and the \n     Intellectual Property Law Section of the American Bar \n     Association are on record as opposing the provisions \n     contained in section 616.\n       As noted, section 616 has not been properly vetted through \n     the Committees of jurisdiction. This is exactly the type of \n     complex, technical provision that should not be hastily \n     included in end-of-the-session omnibus legislation. As two \n     Committee Chairmen with jurisdiction over this provision, we \n     urge that you not include this provision in the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Orrin G. Hatch,\n       Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary.\n     William V. Roth, Jr.,\n       Chairman, Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. In short, this letter said, that as chairmen of the \ncommittees with jurisdiction over key substantive issues raised by the \nmedical process patent amendment, we did not think that this complex, \ntechnical legislation with such a substantive impact should be included \nat this time and in this vehicle given there has been no study by the \nrelevant authorizing committees. I feel it would have been preferable \nto look carefully before we leap into this legislative abyss which has \nsuch far reaching precedential significance.\n  Subsequent to that letter, I received a letter from the General \nCounsel of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] stating, \nin sum, that the proposed policy may run afoul of the TRIP's agreement \nand also encourage our trading partners to follow this example to \ndiscriminate against other types of technologies.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record at this point a copy \nof this September 27, 1996 letter from the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative with respect to the application of articles 27, 28 and \n30 of TRIP's and how our trading partners may use this unfortunate \nprecedent. I wish to commend the staff at USTR for their work on this \nvexatious issue.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Executive Office \n           of the President,\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: You have requested the Office of the \n     U.S. Trade Representative's views on whether the proposed \n     limitation on patient infringements relating to a medical \n     practitioners performance of a medical activity are \n     consistent with U.S. obligations under the Agreement on \n     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs \n     Agreement). As I understand the proposal, it would generally \n     deny the remedies available under title 35 for infringement \n     of patents on diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical \n     techniques.\n       USTR has serious concerns about the consistency of this \n     provision with the TRIPs Agreement. Moreover, we believe that \n     the proposal sets a damaging precedent that other TRIPs \n     Members might apply to other technologies.\n       Although TRIPs Article 27:3 permits Members to exclude \n     diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical techniques from \n     patentability, we believe that if a member makes patents \n     available for this field of technology, a Member must accord \n     the full rights required under the TRIPs Agreement. Article \n     27:1 requires that patent rights be enjoyable without \n     discrimination as to the field of technology. Those rights \n     are specified in Article 28 and include the right to prevent \n     third parties from the act of using a patented process. \n     Moreover, TRIPs Articles 44 and 45 specify remedies, \n     including injunctions and damages; that must be made \n     available to address patent infringement.\n       While TRIPs Article 30 permits Members to provide limited \n     exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, \n     such exceptions must not unreasonably conflict with the \n     normal exploitation of the patent and must not unreasonably \n     prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent holder. \n     Precluding the grant of damages and injunctive relief for \n     patent infringement under the circumstances set forth in the \n     proposed legislation, goes far beyond other exceptions \n     provided in title 35 and raises questions about\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\n     whether the exception is covered by Article 30.\n       We are particularly concerned because other TRIPs Members \n     might follow this example and apply this type of exception to \n     other technologies. We could be seen as endorsing this type \n     of action.\n       Please contact me or my staff if we can provide further \n     information or assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jennifer Hillman,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Now that this amendment will become law, I hope that those \nwho interpret the bill as being consistent with TRIP's are correct. For \nif they are not, we will have unwittingly shown the way for our trading \npartners to absolve themselves of their responsibilities under TRIP's.\n  The stakes are high. Virtually every trade expert believes that \nworldwide adherence to TRIP means jobs for American workers, and \nlowered costs for American consumers as piracy of products is reduced \nand others pay their fair share of research and development costs.\n  Let me take a few moments to explain my concern about the impact that \nthis provision will have on the patent code.\n  Section 101 of the patent code has been essentially unchanged since \n1793. Section 101 broadly states: ``Whoever invents or discovers any \nnew and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, \nor any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent * * *''\n  One leading Supreme Court case, Diamond versus Diehr, decided in \n1981, quoted approvingly from the Judiciary Committee bill report on \nthe 1952 recodification of the patent code, and emphasized that \npatentable subject matter under section 101 ``includes everything under \nthe sun invented by man'' and noted that process patents have been \navailable since 1793.\n  Judge Giles Rich of the Federal Circuit is one of America's greatest \nall-time experts in patent law. Circuit Judge Rich drafted the 1952 \nrecodification in which the word ``process'' was substituted for \n``art''--the first and only change in section 101 since 1793.\n  Incidentally, I am told that Thomas Jefferson apparently helped draft \nthis statute and in his capacity of Secretary of State had a \nministerial role in actually issuing some of our Nation's first letters \npatent.\n  In a leading decision in the area of biotechnology, In \nRe Chackrabarty, written in 1979 by Judge Rich--then of the predecessor \nCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals --and affirmed by the Supreme Court \nin 1981, Judge Rich noted that a broad interpretation of what is \npatentable under section 101 has served our Nation well through out \nhistory:\n\n       The present recital of categories in section 101. . . has \n     been the same ever since the Patent Act of 1793, except for \n     substituting ``process'' for ``art'' and defining it . . . to \n     include art. For nearly 200 years since, those words have \n     been liberally construed to include the most diverse range \n     imaginable of unforseen developments in technology. The list \n     is endless and beyond recitation. We merely suggest that the \n     Founding Fathers and the Congresses of the past century could \n     not have foreseen the technologies that have allowed man to \n     walk on the moon, switch travel from railroads to heavier- \n     than-air craft, fill the houses with color TV, cure normally \n     fatal diseases with antibiotics produced by cultures of molds \n     . . . and give to schoolchildren at small cost pocket \n     calculators with which they can produce square roots on an . \n     . . integrated circuit so small the circuits are not visible \n     to the naked eye . . . We believe section 101 and its \n     predecessor statutes were broadly drawn in general terms to \n     broadly encompass unforeseeable future developments.\n\n  In contrast to this soaring rendition of why a policy of broad \npatentability is beneficial to society, comes now this cleverly drafted \nand hastily adopted medical procedure patent amendment.\n  Although the amendment goes through the back door of the enforcement \nprovisions of section 287, when all is said and done the practical \neffect is to preclude an important class of endeavor--medical \nprocedures--from protection under section 101.\n  Somehow I cannot help but think that Thomas Jefferson and Judge Rich \nand many others will be disappointed in this shrinking of the patent \ncode.\n  Putting aside my major concerns about the trade ramifications, in \nterms of pure patent law, I think there should be a very heavy burden \non those advocating change of a law that appears to be working well and \nhas worked well for a long time.\n  In my view, this burden has not been met.\n  What is broken? Can anyone show me an actual example of health care \nnegatively affected due to the existence of a procedure patent?\n  How can we be sure that research on tomorrow's medical procedures \nwill continue apace absent patent protection?\n  Frankly, I find it odd that in the case that precipitated this \nalleged ``crisis'' that compels adoption of this particular amendment \nbefore there has been even one hearing--the Pallin ``stitch-less'' \ncataract surgery process, the patent was not upheld by the courts.\n  Some argue that such process patents will drive up health care costs. \nBut in the Pallin case the requested $4 per operation fee was much less \nthan the $17 per stitch charge, so money was saved.\n  Where is the crisis that justifies inviting considerable mischief by \nour trading partners in dragging their feet in implementing TRIP's?\n  If we have unwittingly misinterpreted TRIP's, we will all be asking \ndown the road, where was the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means \nCommittee when this happened?\n  Before we set this precedent by adopting the curious rule that you-\ncan-have-a-patent-but-you-just-cannot-en- \nforce-it, would it not have been better for the Judiciary Committee and \nfull Senate to study and carefully debate the merits of this proposal?\n  While this rule may be good in the short run for physician \norganizations, the health care products industry and large \norganizations like HMO's and hospitals, can we say for certain that \ncategorically taking away the incentives to patent medical procedures \nis in the interests of the American public?\n  One allegation that has been stressed repeatedly by the authors of \nthis amendment is that ``pure'' process patents cost very little to \ndevelop, and thus, patent protections for such processes should not \nlead to substantial royalties. What this somewhat simplistic argument \nfails to consider are cases in which there has been substantial R for \na process, at a cost to the inventor. For now, under the language we \nwill approve today, any incentive for inventors to patent those \ndiscoveries will be removed, and very possibly, the incentive for \nresearch and development as well. Medical research, and medical \nprogress, can only suffer.\n  Over the course of the last few days, when it became clear that the \nnegotiators for the omnibus bill might include this medical process \npatent provision in the final compromise, I sent three dear colleague \nletters in opposition to the provision. I regret that my colleagues \nwere either unaware, or unpersuaded by, my arguments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record; as follows:\n                                               September 26, 1996.\n       Dear Colleague: H.L. Mencken once said, ``There is always \n     an easy solution to every human problem--neat, plausible, and \n     wrong.'' I am afraid that this is the case with the Ganske/\n     Frist amendment on medical procedure patents.\n       As Chairman of the Committee with substantive jurisdiction \n     over the patent code, I urge your opposition to inclusion in \n     the omnibus appropriations bill of the Ganske/Frist \n     amendment, a provision that would effectively preclude the \n     enforcement of medical process patents. With all due respect \n     to my colleagues Congressman Ganske and Senator Frist, this \n     language, either as passed by the House or in a more recent \n     form, raises significant procedural and substantive \n     questions, and should not be adopted without a full review by \n     this body.\n\n\n                          PROCEDURAL CONCERNS\n\n       Authorizing Language on Appropriations Bill: The Ganske/\n     Frist amendment circumvents the normal Committee process by \n     misusing the appropriations mechanism to amend a highly \n     technical and very complex area of substantive patent law. \n     This is precisely the type of non-germane amendment that \n     Senators Hatfield and Byrd and others have admonished the \n     Senate not to incorporate within this type of omnibus \n     appropriations vehicle.\n       Not Reviewed by Judiciary Committee: The language of the \n     latest Ganske/Frist compromise has never been the subject of \n     a hearing or mark-up by any Committee of Congress. The Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and the full Senate should have the \n     opportunity to carefully consider and meaningfully debate \n     this issue before final action is taken on this provision.\n       The original Ganske proposal, which would have excluded \n     surgical and medical procedures from patentability, was the \n     subject of\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\n     a 1995 hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee \n     on Courts and Intellectual Property. The bill, H.R. 1127, was \n     opposed by the Biotechnology industry Organization, the \n     Section of Intellectual Property Law of the American Bar \n     Association, and the American Intellectual Property Law \n     Association.\n       An amendment to bar the Patent and Trademark Office from \n     spending its funds to issue such patents was adopted on the \n     Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill in the House on \n     July 24, 1996. Joining those opposed to this amendment were \n     the Intellectual Property Owners, the Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of America, and Chairman Moorhead and \n     Ranking Member Schroeder of the Subcommittee that conducted \n     the earlier hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11838-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11845-S11848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUBSTANTIVE CONCERNS\n\n       Administration Opposition: The Commissioner of Patents and \n     Trademarks, Bruce Lehman, testified before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on September 18, 1996, and stated that \n     the Administration opposes both the Ganske Amendment and the \n     latest Ganske/Frist compromise. Commissioner Lehman noted \n     that the area of medical technology is particularly patent-\n     dependent and expressed his concern that we not overreact in \n     a fashion that jeopardizes ``the goose that lays the golden \n     egg''.\n       Impact on Medical Research: The supporters of the Ganske/\n     Frist compromise can provide no assurance that enactment of \n     this legislation would not impede timely future development \n     of critical ``pure'' medical procedures. As Commissioner \n     Lehman has testified, patents are often useful in attracting \n     investment capital. It is impossible to state categorically \n     today, as the Ganske/Frist legislation seems to presume, that \n     tomorrow's advances in ``pure'' medical procedures will take \n     place as expeditiously as possible absent patent protection. \n     As Commissioner Lehman told the Judiciary Committee: ``It \n     would be really quite tragic if we were to find that a very \n     large loophole were to be opened in the patent system that \n     would cause investment in some of the most important \n     technology--not just from an economic point of view but from \n     a life-saving point of view, to cause that investment to dry \n     up.''\n       Biomedical researchers, physicians, and other health care \n     professionals are to be saluted for their rich tradition of \n     public disclosure and free exchange of ideas. That this long-\n     standing iterative educational process often acts to preclude \n     compliance with the strict legal requirements of the patent \n     system does necessarily lead to the conclusion that all \n     medical processes should not be patentable. In no other field \n     would one suggest that the incentives of the patent system be \n     eliminated in the hope that technical progress would proceed \n     unabated.\n       Patent Protection Available to All: For these reasons, the \n     Administration is joined in opposing this legislation by the \n     Section of Intellectual Property Law of the American Bar \n     Association which believes the proposals:\n       `` . . . violate a fundamental principle of our law under \n     which patent protection is available without discrimination \n     as to field of invention or technology. The Frist/Coalition \n     approach is doubly discriminatory in that it would achieve \n     this result by discriminatory treatment based on the identity \n     or profession of the infringer. . . The Section of \n     Intellectual Property Law believes that it would be both \n     unfair and counterproductive to single out one area of \n     creativity--the creation of new and improved medical \n     procedures--and deny rewards to those creators while \n     providing them to all others.''\n       The Case for Changing the Law Has Not Been Made: Section \n     101 of the patent code--which broadly defines the subject \n     matter eligible for patenting--has been essentially unchanged \n     for over 200 years. The Ganske/Frist initiative reverses this \n     long history of statutory and case law and, without adequate \n     justification, precludes the patenting of an extremely \n     important field of endeavor--medical processes. The patent \n     code should not be changed on the basis of anecdotal \n     evidence.\n       It is particularly perplexing that in the case that \n     precipitated the current controversy, the Pallin suture-less \n     cataract operation, the system worked, and the patent has not \n     been enforced by the courts.\n       Moreover, to the extent that the Ganske/Frist compromise is \n     designed to reduce litigation costs, it is difficult to see \n     how it accomplishes this goal. Where a medical process \n     involves any type of instrument, a motion for summary \n     judgment could likely involve contested issues of fact that \n     would subject physicians to the expenses of litigation, even \n     where they would ultimately not be subject to remedies.\n       A Right Without a Remedy: The latest Ganske/Frist \n     compromise provides the right to patent medical procedure \n     without a remedy against the most likely class of infringers \n     (medical practitioners). This violates one of the most \n     fundamental benefits of the United States patent system--the \n     right to exclusive use. Severely limiting the remedies \n     available under section 287 of the patent code is tantamount \n     to amending what is patentable under the 200 year old \n     language of section 101. A patent without a meaningful remedy \n     against infringement is like no patent at all.\n       Individual Inventors vs. Multi-Million Dollar Corporations: \n     By extending protection to organizations that employ \n     physicians such as health maintenance organizations, the \n     Ganske/Frist legislation raises equity questions concerning \n     the proper balancing of rights of individual inventors versus \n     large corporations. We must think carefully before we take \n     away the rights of individual inventors by not allowing \n     enforcement against patent infringement by multi-million \n     dollar corporations.\n       Trade Implications: The House-passed Ganske amendment to \n     limit the authority to expend funds to issue medical \n     procedure patents undercuts the hard fought gains of the GATT \n     Treaty TRIPS provisions (Trade-Related Intellectual Property \n     Rights). The House language invites, however unintentionally, \n     our trading partners to adopt intellectual property \n     protections that comply with TRIPS but, at the same time, \n     functionally nullifies these apparent gains by simply not \n     appropriating administrative funds. If this technique were \n     used by our foreign trading partners not to enforce American-\n     owned patents on, for example, pharmaceuticals or automobile \n     parts, Congress and the public would demand action.\n       Not Reviewed by Finance Committee: This latest Ganske/Frist \n     compromise raises novel, complicated, and sensitive issues of \n     far-ranging precedential significance relating to Articles \n     27, 28, and 30 of TRIPS. These issues need to be thoroughly \n     examined and merit careful consideration and debate by the \n     Judiciary Committee, the Finance Committee, and the full \n     Senate. There is no consensus on these issues. We have not \n     had an opportunity to hear from the United States Trade \n     Representative or the Secretary of Commerce on these matters. \n     For example, the American Intellectual Property Law \n     Association has noted that this amendment:\n       ``. . . would be very deleterious to the patent law and \n     raises serious questions regarding the compliance by the \n     United States with its obligations under TRIPS. This \n     amendment . . . should be rejected. The proponents have \n     failed to demonstrate a need for this amendment. The \n     amendment would proclaim an open season for exceptions to \n     patent protection to address other alleged problems. \n     Moreover, it would clearly be inimical to the interests of \n     American industry for the United States to take the lead in \n     weakening the patent protection required under Articles 28 \n     and 30 of the TRIPS.''\n\n\n                   OPPOSE THE GANSKE/FRIST AMENDMENT\n\n       Oppose the Ganske/Frist Amendment: In sum, the laws that \n     allow the patenting of the broadest possible range of subject \n     matter coupled with the three basic legal requirements of \n     novelty, utility, and nonobviousness have proven effective \n     over the long run. Our current statutory framework has met \n     the Constitutional charge ``to promote science and useful \n     arts'' and has helped make the United States the world's \n     leader in medical technology. We should not change these \n     laws absent a demonstration of a compelling need, and we \n     should not use the omnibus appropriations vehicle for such \n     a controversial change in substantive patent law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 27, 1996.\n\n        Substantial Opposition Voiced to Ganske/Frist Amendment\n\n       Dear Colleague: In view of the upcoming debate on the \n     omnibus appropriations bill, I thought you would want to be \n     aware of several compelling arguments raised in opposition to \n     proposed language barring medical procedure patents or their \n     enforcement. I continue to oppose this proposal on both \n     procedural and substantive grounds. Here's what some top \n     intellectual property authorities are saying:\n       The Clinton Administration: The Clinton Administration \n     opposes the Ganske/Frist amendment both as it passed the \n     House and in its more recent version. In a July 17, 1996 \n     letter to the House Appropriations Subcommittee, the Commerce \n     Department stated,\n       ``We continue to oppose enactment of H.R. 1127 (the Ganske \n     bill) and any amendment that contains the substance of it. We \n     still believe that it is premature to adopt such drastic \n     steps when we have the opportunity to adopt administrative \n     measures to mitigate the problem.''\n       Moreover, in September 18, 1996 testimony before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, PTO Commissioner Bruce Lehman expressed \n     opposition to the latest compromise and the unprecedented \n     loophole it would establish. PTO Commissioner Lehman said,\n       ``I, personally, the Office, and the Administration are \n     against the Ganske amendment, and we would be against a \n     variation of that, too, and let me tell you why.''\n       Commissioner Lehman's major points in opposition were:\n       This could be a case of overreaction to a specific \n     circumstance. Even though that situation may be \n     controversial, it is important not to kill the ``goose that \n     lays the golden egg,'' that is, the incentive for medical \n     research;\n       There is no requirement that patent applications be filed. \n     Historically, surgical procedures are not patented. When they \n     are, it is usually because it is required as part of a \n     business plan to attract the necessary capital for research \n     and development;\n       We would not have the wonderful therapies we have right now \n     in this country--we wouldn't have the medical and \n     pharmaceutical industry that leads the world, that provides a \n     level of health care second to none, if it weren't for the \n     patent system. It\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\n     is one of the most patent-dependent industries that there is, \n     and so we have to be extremely careful in tampering with that \n     system.\n       PTO Commissioner Lehman concluded, ``It would be really \n     quite tragic if we were to find that a very large loophole \n     were to be opened in the patent system that would cause \n     investment in some of the most important technology--not from \n     an economic point of view, but from a life-saving point of \n     view--to cause that investment to dry up.''\n       ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law: In the attached \n     letter, the ABA's Intellectual Property Section strongly \n     opposes the original Ganske and Frist bills (H.R. 1127/S. \n     1134), as well as the Ganske amendment adopted in the House \n     as part of the Commerce Department appropriations bill and a \n     more recent variation advanced by the Medical Procedures \n     Patents Coalition. The ABA Intellectual Property Law Section \n     says:\n       ``All the proposals violate a fundamental principle of our \n     law under which patent protection is available without \n     discrimination as to field of invention of technology. The \n     Frist/Coalition approach is doubly discriminatory in that it \n     would achieve this result by discriminatory treatment based \n     on the identity or profession of the infringer.''\n       The Intellectual Property Law Section raises several \n     concerns about the latest proposal, concerns which have not \n     been examined by any committee of Congress. These concerns \n     include: the negative impact on the America's world \n     leadership in scientific and technological development by \n     singling out one area of creativity and denying rewards to \n     those creators while providing them to all others; the \n     international impact of making this change to accommodate \n     narrow domestic interests; and the unworkability and \n     ineffectiveness of the proposals.\n       The American Intellectual Property Law Association: In a \n     September 16, 1996, letter, the American Intellectual \n     Property Law Association said,\n       ``This amendment, which would limit the remedies available \n     against physicians and health care organizations for \n     infringing medical procedure patents, should be rejected. The \n     proponents have failed to demonstrate a need for this \n     amendment. The amendment would proclaim an open season for \n     exceptions to patent protection to address other alleged \n     problems.\n       ``Moreover, it would clearly be inimical to the interests \n     of American industry for the United States to take the lead \n     in weakening the patent protection required under Articles 28 \n     and 30 of TRIPs.''\n       The Intellectual Property Owners: The Intellectual Property \n     Owners' Association represents companies and inventors who \n     own patents, copyrights and trademarks in all fields of \n     endeavor. In a letter expressing strong opposition to the \n     Ganske amendment, the IPO has said,\n       ``The amendment will harm members of our association who \n     are investing in medical research. Moreover, the amendment \n     amounts to a full employment law for attorneys. Attorneys and \n     the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will spend huge amounts \n     of money litigating the scope of the amendment, adding to the \n     already too high cost of obtaining and enforcing patents.''\n       Further, in a separate letter commenting on a more recent \n     version of the amendment, the IPO says,\n       `` The proposal made by the American Medical Association \n     and pharmaceutical and biotechnology trade associations to \n     limit remedies for patent infringement by physicians and \n     medical organizations is a dangerous precedent. It could \n     undercut the efforts of the United States to strengthen \n     patent rights in countries throughout the world in all fields \n     of technology. We hope Congress will not rush to judgement \n     with legislation that will cause expensive litigation or \n     diminish the strong incentives that the United States has \n     traditionally provided for medical research.''\n       Accordingly, I urge you to join these leaders in the field \n     of intellectual property in opposing inclusion of this \n     unstudied proposal in the end-of-the-year appropriations \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the opposition \n     of the Section of Intellectual Property Law of the American \n     Bar Association to S. 1134, the ``Medical Procedures \n     Innovation and Affordability Act'', and to a similar proposal \n     recently advanced by the Medical Procedures Coalition \n     (hereafter referred to as ``the Coalition proposal''). These \n     views have not been considered or approved by the House of \n     Delegates or Board of Governors of the American Bar \n     Association.\n       S. 1134 and the Coalition proposal are two of four \n     proposals currently pending in Congress, or which Congress \n     has been asked to consider, to curtail patent rights for \n     medical and surgical procedures. H.R. 1127, the ``Medical \n     Procedures Innovation and Affordability Act,'' introduced in \n     the House on March 3, 1995 by Mr. Ganske, would prohibit \n     patenting of inventions relating to certain medical and \n     surgical procedures. On July 24 of this year, an amendment by \n     Mr. Ganske relating to these issues was adopted in the House \n     during consideration of H.R. 3814, the FY97 Commerce, \n     Justice, State Appropriations Act. The Ganske amendment would \n     achieve a ban on patenting of medical procedures similar to \n     that called for in H.R. 1127 by a restriction on use of \n     appropriated funds. H.R. 3814, including the Ganske \n     amendment, is pending in the Senate.\n       The Ganske bill and the Ganske amendment attempt to \n     insulate medical practitioners from liability for \n     infringement of patents on medical procedures by denying \n     patent protection to such procedures. Senator Frist's bill, \n     S. 1134, and the Coalition proposal attempt to achieve the \n     same result by denying legal remedies to owners of patents on \n     these procedures when their patents are infringed by medical \n     practitioners. We oppose both approaches and we oppose all \n     four proposals. All the proposals violate a fundamental \n     principle of our law under which patent protection is \n     available without discrimination as to field of invention or \n     technology. The Frist/Coalition approach is doubly \n     discriminatory in that it would achieve this result by \n     discriminatory treatment based on the identity or profession \n     of the infringer.\n       The Section of Intellectual Property Law believes that it \n     would be both unfair and counterproductive to single out one \n     area of creativity--the creation of new and improved medical \n     proceures--and deny rewards to those creators while providing \n     them to all others. Our world leadership in scientific and \n     technological development, a leadership which most \n     particularly includes leadership in development of improved \n     medical technology and procedures, has been achieved in large \n     part because of, not in spite of, the controls and rewards \n     which our system gives to our innovators.\n       For decades the United States has urged all nations to \n     adopt laws protecting intellectual property fully and without \n     discrimination. These efforts have been largely successful, \n     but are by no means over. In the ongoing talks regarding a \n     Diplomatic Conference on Certain Copyright and Neighboring \n     Rights Questions, critical issues regarding legal protection \n     for emerging new areas of innovations are being addressed. \n     The United States would be sending a dangerous message to \n     these efforts by carving out a glaring exception to our \n     system of uniform protection in order to accommodate narrow \n     domestic interests which can be addressed, and are already \n     being addressed, with far less radical measures.\n       S. 1134 and the Coalition proposal are apparently designed \n     to address earlier criticism of H.R. 1127. However, they \n     attempt to fix a fundamentally unsound and conceptually \n     flawed proposal by narrowing its exclusionary provisions so \n     that patent protection is not denied in areas where that \n     denial presents policy or political impediments to enactment \n     of the legislation. We believe that our legal framework for \n     the promotion and protection of intellectual creativity, the \n     finest and most successful that the world has known, would \n     not be strengthened by such short-sighted statutory \n     gerrymandering.\n       We also believe that the proposals based on restrictions on \n     remedies are unworkable and would not achieve the intended \n     results. As we understand it, the objective of these \n     proposals is to provide a legal framework in which to prevent \n     successful lawsuits against medical practitioners for the \n     practice of certain medical procedures. Ideally this would be \n     achieved by such suits never being filed. However, since \n     plaintiffs control the filing of lawsuits, a more realistic \n     objective seems to be to provide for early identification and \n     expedited procedures for the dismissal or other disposition \n     of such cases. If such a ``gatekeeper'' system is not \n     functioning, the legislation would be of little utility. For \n     example, if lengthy and costly discovery proceedings are \n     required or permitted before a case can be weeded out, the \n     legislation will provide little if any relief of the nature \n     sought by medical practitioners and their supporters. In \n     fact, such legislation might very well increase litigation \n     and litigation costs, through a combination of failure to \n     reduce existing litigation and additional litigation over the \n     meaning and effort of the legislation itself.\n       We believe these are precisely the results which would flow \n     from the enactment of these proposals. In this regard, we \n     note that the Coalition proposal provides a number of \n     exceptions to the general rule that legal remedies are not \n     available for infringement arising out of the performance of \n     medical or surgical procedures by medical practitioners, as \n     well as an even broader, over-arching exclusion of coverage \n     of certain activities relating to commercial development and \n     distribution and the provision of pharmacy or clinical \n     laboratory services.\n       One key exception in the proposal, relating to patented use \n     of a composition of matter, provides that the exception does \n     not apply to such use unless the use ``directly contribute(s) \n     to achievement of the objective of the claimed method.'' This \n     is clearly an issue which is fact bound to a high degree, and \n     not one that is likely to be resolved at the pleadings or \n     motion stages of litigation. Proponents of the Coalition \n     proposal suggest that legislative history can be treated to \n     establish legislative intent that these fact intensive \n     questions can be decided by motion to dismiss or summary \n     judgment. However, legislative history accompanying \n     amendments to title 35 are unlikely to be found to be \n     controlling legislative intent regarding application of Rules \n     of Civil Procedure which are unchanged by the legislation, \n     particularly when the intent expressed is in conflict\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n     with the express language of the Rules themselves. (The \n     Coalition suggests that a movant for summary judgment under \n     Rule 56 may prevail by showing by a ``preponderance of \n     evidence'' that certain essential facts exist. However, Rule \n     56 states that such a motion may be rendered only if ``there \n     is no genuine issue as to any material fact'').\n       We strongly urge you to oppose all four versions of this \n     legislative proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John R. Kirk, Jr.\n     Chair.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 28, 1996.\n       Dear Colleague: I am writing to urge you to reject the \n     Frist/Ganske proposal that would effectively prohibit medical \n     procedure patents.\n       If you were in a car crash and ended up in the emergency \n     room would you care whether your life was saved with a drug, \n     or with a medical device, or with a surgical procedure? No, \n     all you would care about is that the your life was saved \n     through the most appropriate, up-to-date medical technology.\n       Why, then, should we adopt the untested Frist/Ganske \n     amendment and suddenly reverse 200 years of patent law by \n     rendering patents on life-saving medical procedures \n     meaningless? Do you really want to take the chance that your \n     doctor or the emergency room will be stuck with yesterday's \n     technology because we hastily amended the patent law today?\n       My good friend, Senator Frist, recently posed the question: \n     ``Should the Heimlich maneuver be patentable? Imagine someone \n     collecting a dollar every time someone used this or any other \n     `pure' medical procedure!'' The fact is that many people \n     would pay a dollar rather than take the risk of choking to \n     death before they could get to the hospital. If you had a \n     choice between the Heimlich Maneuver and an emergency \n     tracheotomy, which would you choose? And, given the costs of \n     emergency room visits, I am sure that the insurance company \n     would opt for the simple, cost-effective procedure.\n       But, of course, the Heimlich maneuver, like most medical \n     procedures, is not patented. We owe a debt of gratitude to \n     Dr. Heimlich and all the other pioneers in medicine and \n     health care practitioners, including Senator Frist and \n     Representative Ganske, who are primarily motivated not to \n     make money, but to save lives. We should also salute the \n     tradition in the medical sciences of sharing information and \n     freely exchanging ideas concerning the latest advances in \n     medicine.\n       There is often an iterative educational dialogue that takes \n     place during the medical research process. These interactions \n     can act to defeat patentability because the strict legal \n     requirements of demonstrating novelty and nonobviousness can \n     not be satisfied by incremental or publicly discussed \n     scientific achievements.\n       For example, in his recent Roll Call article, \n     Representative Ganske criticized a patent issued in the area \n     of breast reconstructive surgery. If, as Dr. Ganske states, \n     ``[this particular type of] breast reconstructive surgery had \n     been in widespread use for at least 15 years. . .'', then \n     this patent should not have been issued in the first place \n     and will not withstand court challenge.\n       The case that has fueled the current debate involved a \n     patent issued to Dr. Samuel Pallin for a ``no-stitch'' \n     cataract procedure. In a suit to enforce this patent against \n     another surgeon, Dr. Jack Singer, a consent decree \n     invalidating the patent was sanctioned by a court on grounds \n     that the technique was already in use. In other words, the \n     result feared by Senator Frist and Representative Ganske did \n     not occur; the procedure failed the test for patent \n     protection.\n       Senator Frist contends that ``health care costs would \n     explode if doctors charged licensing fees for every new \n     surgical or medical technique. . .'' And, on the issue of \n     finding ways to reduce health care costs, I appreciate and \n     generally agree with my colleague's suggestions. But the \n     facts of the Pallin case reveal that--even with the requested \n     $4 per operation fee--appreciable cost savings are achieved \n     when it is taken into account that each stitch not needed \n     saves an estimated $17.\n       Senator Frist takes the position that the basic rationale \n     behind the American patent system--the encouragement of \n     innovation--``does not apply to innovations in pure medical \n     and surgical procedures because such innovations will occur \n     without the benefit of patent law.''\n       Many leading experts in intellectual property law take \n     exception with this viewpoint. For example, the Commissioner \n     of Patents and Trademarks, Bruce Lehman, expressed the \n     Clinton Administration's opposition to the Frist/Ganske \n     amendment by cautioning Congress not to overreact to the \n     controversial Pallin case. As Commissioner Lehman recently \n     explained his reasoning to the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n       ``Historically, in the area of surgical procedures, people \n     oftentimes don't file patent applications. When people file \n     for patents, it is usually because they have to file a patent \n     in order to get the financing to make that technology a \n     reality * * *\n       ``It would be really quite tragic if we were to find that a \n     very large loophole were to be opened in the patent system \n     that would cause investment in some of the most important \n     technology--not from an economic point of view but from a \n     life-saving point of view, to cause that investment to dry \n     up.''\n       In contrast to the view that ``these innovations would \n     occur anyway,'' consider the assessment made by William D. \n     Noonan, M.D., J.D., concerning the importance of patent \n     protection for attracting private investment into the \n     research that resulted in the surrogate embyro transfer (SET) \n     procedure:\n       ``The research that developed the SET procedure was \n     financed with $500,000 of venture capital because the \n     National Institutes of Health (NIH) would not fund the \n     research. It seems unlikely that the inventor of the SET \n     process would have gotten this private funding if the process \n     was not patentable subject matter.''\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ William D. Noonan, M.D., J.D., ``Patenting of Medical and \n     Surgical Procedures,'' Journal of the Patent and Trademark \n     Office Society, August, 1995, at 656-57.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Moreover, Dr. Noonan points out that, ``it is a \n     questionable generalization to condemn all the therapeutic \n     procedure patents merely because * * * [of the Pallin `no \n     stitch' suture patent]'' and that ``there are instances in \n     which medical advances may not be made if patent protection \n     for a therapeutic method is not available.''\n       At this point in time, there are simply too many unanswered \n     questions about the Frist/Ganske amendment to justify \n     sweeping this provision into the ``end-of-the-session'' \n     omnibus appropriations legislation. Among these questions \n     are:\n       Since there is no purported ``emergency'' need for the \n     legislation (e.g., the Pallin cataract patent has not been \n     enforced), and there has never been a hearing or mark-up in \n     either the House or Senate on the language of the Frist/\n     Ganske amendment, would it not be prudent for the respective \n     Judiciary Committees' of each chamber to consider this \n     legislation?\n       Given the precedent setting nature of this legislation for \n     U.S. trade policy, particularly with respect to the proper \n     interpretation and application of Articles 27, 28, and 30 of \n     the GATT Treaty TRIPs provisions, would it not be preferable \n     for the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means \n     Committee to examine this issue in close consultation with \n     the United States Trade Representative?\n       In a September 27, 1996 letter, the Office of the United \n     States Trade Representative stated, ``USTR has serious \n     concerns about the consistency of the provision with the \n     TRIPs Agreement. Moreover, we believe that the proposal sets \n     a damaging precedent that other TRIPs Members might apply to \n     other technologies.'' Why should we act in such haste in a \n     way that may run afoul of the TRIPs agreement, and provide a \n     roadmap for our trading partners who may use this example to \n     justify the creation of broad exceptions for other \n     technologies?\n       How can we be certain that costly and risky research will \n     continue on tomorrow's seminal ``pure'' medical procedures in \n     the absence of patent protection?\n       Why should the incentives associated with the patent system \n     for research into medical procedures be any less or different \n     than the incentives for research into drugs and medical \n     devices?\n       As overall federal budgetary pressures constrain the growth \n     of NIH funding, is this the time to decrease private sector \n     incentives to invest in certain types of biomedical research?\n       What policy objectives are advanced by the Frist/Ganske \n     amendment that prefers the rights of large corporate \n     entities, such as HMOs, over the interests of individual \n     inventors?\n       What are the implications of the provisions of the Frist/\n     Ganske amendment that nominally allow medical procedure \n     patents but then do not permit these patents to be enforced \n     against the most likely infringers?\n       Until we know more about the answers to these and other \n     questions, and we are able to get the answers on the record \n     for all senators to consider, I urge my colleagues to oppose \n     inclusion of the Frist/Ganske amendment on medical procedure \n     patents in the omnibus appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and \n         Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judd: I have significant concern about an amendment \n     which was adopted during House consideration of H.R. 3418, \n     the House Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. That \n     amendment, authored by Rep. Greg Ganske, would limit the use \n     of funds to approve patents for surgical or medical \n     procedures or diagnoses. I want to express my appreciation to \n     you and your staff for your efforts to defer consideration of \n     this contentious issue pending review by the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       I understand the concerns which motivate the amendment and \n     I am sympathetic to the issues which have been raised. \n     However, I believe myriad questions can be raised about this \n     proposal and its impact. The effect of this amendment would \n     be to bar process patents for a certain industry, an \n     exception never before made to our 200-year old patent law. A \n     more recent version of the bill would allow the patents, but \n     bar enforcement rendering the patent but an empty shell. Both \n     of these would create tremendous precedents in patent law, \n     precedents which are not supported by the intellectual \n     property community. At a Judiciary Committee hearing today, \n     Patent Commissioner Bruce Lehman\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n\n     also indicated that the Administration could not support \n     either the Ganske provision or the recent variation.\n       In sum, I think that this issue needs to be more fully \n     considered by the Congress, and in particular, by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee. I believe that passage of the Ganske \n     provision, or the recent Frist modification, without adequate \n     consideration of its long-term implications for intellectual \n     property rights would be extremely unwise.\n       Let me hasten to add that I understand your special \n     interest in this issue, and I am sympathetic to the need to \n     examine further the impact of medical process patents. My \n     study of the Singer case, in which the patent was overturned, \n     leads me to believe that the Patent and Trademark Office's \n     procedures could be improved in the area of medical patents. \n     This is something that I will be pursuing, and I welcome your \n     input into this process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in closing, I must reiterate my profound \ndisappointment and my objections to including this medical process \npatents provision in the omnibus appropriations bill. This is a serious \nmatter and a serious precedent. We will have to look very carefully at \nits implications in the months to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11845-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11848-S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering this morning to \nH.R. 4194, a bill to reauthorize alternative means of dispute \nresolution in the Federal administrative process, is the result of a \ncompromise reached last night with the other house.\n  The amendment deals with the issue of bid protest jurisdiction in the \nFederal district courts and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The \namendment will expand the bid protest jurisdiction of the Court of \nFederal Claims. It should be noted, however, that this amendment in no \nway expands the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims beyond bid \nprotests or changes the standard of review in any other area of \njurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.\n  Currently, the Court of Federal Claims only has jurisdiction over bid \nprotests which are filed before a contract award is made. My amendment \nprovides for both pre- and post-award jurisdiction. The Federal \ndistrict courts also have jurisdiction over bid protests. Prior to a \n1969 Federal court decision, however, the Federal district courts had \nno jurisdiction over Federal contract awards. A Federal district court, \nin Scanwell Lab., Inc. versus Shaffer, held that a contractor can \nchallenge a Federal contract award in Federal district court under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  It is my belief that having multiple judicial bodies review bid \nprotests of Federal contracts has resulted in forum shopping as \nlitigants search for the most favorable forum. Additionally, the \nresulting disparate bodies of law between the circuits has created a \nsituation where there is no national uniformity in resolving these \ndisputes. That is why I have included provisions in this amendment for \nstudying the issue of concurrent jurisdiction and have provided for the \nrepeal of the Federal district courts' Scanwell jurisdiction after the \nstudy is complete in 2001.\n  The chamber of commerce fully supports this language as do our \ncolleagues in the other chamber.\n  I would like to express my deep gratitude for the willingness of my \ncolleagues and their staffs in both houses to work with me and my staff \nto develop this compromise.\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we all want a government that works better \nand costs less. In the rush of closing business in this Congress, I am \npleased that the Senate has made time for legislation authored by \nmyself and Senator Chuck Grassley to encourage faster, less costly ways \nto resolve disputes with the Federal Government. This bill, which has \ngone through several versions, is now before us as H.R. 4194, and has \nbeen approved by both sides of the aisle in the Senate and the House. I \nam hopeful that, by the end of the day, this legislation will be on its \nway to the President.\n  It's a fact of life that many people have disputes with the Federal \nGovernment. In the late 1980's, of the 220,000 civil cases filed in \nFederal court, more than 55,000 involved the Federal Government in one \nway or another. Resolving these disputes costs taxpayers billions of \ndollars.\n  Resolving them before they become courtroom dramas is one way to make \na dent in this billion-dollar drain on taxpayer funds. Mediation, \narbitration, mini trials and other methods offer cheaper, faster \nalternatives to courtroom battles.\n  That's why, 6 years ago, Senator Grassley and I cosponsored the \nAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990. It is why we have teamed \nup again this year to reauthorize and fine-tune that Act and make it a \npermanent part of U.S. law. Perhaps the most important improvement we \nwould make is to expand the alternative dispute resolution or ADR tools \navailable to Federal agencies by making binding arbitration a more \nattractive option. The bill takes two steps to do so. First, it would \neliminate a one-way escape clause that allowed Federal agencies, but \nnot private parties, unilaterally to vacate a binding arbitration award \nthat disadvantaged the government. In the 5 years this escape clause \nhas been on the books, no one has ever agreed to an arbitration \nproceeding with the Government on this basis. Eliminating this \nunilateral escape clause is expected to encourage more private parties \nto agree to use binding arbitration as a cost-saving alternative to \ncivil litigation. Second, the bill would put into place several \nsafeguards to protect the United States from improper or unwise use of \nthis ADR technique, including requiring agencies to think through, \nahead of time and in writing, when binding arbitration should be used; \nrequiring every agreement to use binding arbitration to be in writing \nand to specify the maximum dollar award that an arbitrator may award \nagainst the United States; and ensuring that agency officials cannot \neven offer to use binding arbitration unless the official already has \nauthority to settle the matter.\n  Also, to ensure that binding arbitration remains a voluntary \nprocedure, the bill maintains the provision in the ADR law, 5 U.S.C. \n575(a)(3), which prohibits Federal agencies from requiring individuals \nto agree to use binding arbitration to settle disputes as a condition \nof entering into a contract or obtaining a benefit. Both the bill \nsponsors and the authorizing committees intend this provision to \ninclude prohibiting an agency from requiring a party to submit to \nbinding arbitration as a condition of Federal employment or to \nrelinquish rights under other laws such as the Civil Rights Act. It is \nnot the intent of the bill to coerce anyone into using binding \narbitration.\n  The bill makes a number of other refinements in the ADR law as well, \nincluding clarifying the confidentiality of ADR proceedings; clarifying \nagency authority to hire mediators and other ADR neutrals on an \nexpedited basis; allowing agencies to accept donated services from \nState, local and tribal governments to support an ADR proceeding; \nadding an explicit authorization for appropriations; removing a ban on \nFederal employees' electing to use ADR methods to resolve certain \npersonnel disputes; and eliminating special paperwork burdens on \ncontractors willing to use ADR to resolve small claims against the \nGovernment under the Contract Disputes Act. The bill would also \nreassign the task of encouraging and facilitating agency use of ADR \nmethods from the Administrative Conference of the United States, which \nhas been terminated due to a lack of appropriations, to an agency or \ninteragency committee to be designated by the President.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the ADR law, the bill also includes the \nLevin-Grassley amendment to reauthorize the Negotiated Rulemaking Act \nof 1990. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act is another reform effort that \nseeks to interject common sense and cost savings into the way the \nFederal Government does business. In essence, it allows a Federal \nagency to form an advisory committee with its regulated community, \npublic interest groups and other interested parties to draft \nregulations that everyone can support and live by.\n  As its name implies, the point of the law is to get parties to \nnegotiate with each other and the Federal Government to devise \nsensible, cost effective rules. No one is required to participate in a \nnegotiation, and no one gives up their rights by agreeing to negotiate. \nIt is a voluntary, rather than a mandatory, process.\n  Agencies and others have discovered that, in many rulemaking \nsituations, negotiation beats confrontation in terms of cost, time, \naggravation, and the ability to develop regulations that parties with \nvery different perspectives can accept. One industry participant in a \nnegotiated rulemaking involving the Clean Air Act put it this way: \n``It's a better situation when people who are adversaries can sit down \nat the table and talk about it rather than throwing bricks at each \nother in courtrooms and the press.'' An environmental journal reached \nthe same conclusion, summing up a negotiated rulemaking involving the \nGrand Canyon with the headline, ``See You Later, Litigator.'' The \nWashington Post has called negotiated rulemaking ``plainly a good \nidea,'' while the New York Times has called it ``an immensely valuable \nprocedure that ought to be used far more often.''\n  Like ADR, the bill would make the Negotiated Rulemaking Act a \npermanent fixture in Federal law, while fine-tuning some provisions. \nThe improvements include facilitating agency hiring of neutrals, called \nconvenors and facilitators, on an expedited basis; providing an \nexplicit authorization for appropriations; clarifying the authority of \nagencies to accept gifts to support negotiated rulemaking proceedings; \nand reassigning the responsibility for facilitating and encouraging \nagency use of negotiated rulemaking from the Administrative Conference \nof the United States, which has been terminated, to an agency or \ninteragency committee to be designated by the President.\n  If enacted during this Congress, the bill would avoid a lapse in the \nnegotiated rulemaking law which is otherwise scheduled to expire in \nNovember. That is why it is so important to pass this legislation \nbefore Congress closes its doors for the year.\n  Finally, the bill would address the unrelated issue of judicial \njurisdiction over procurement protests. At present, the Court of \nFederal Claims reviews some procurement protests, while the Federal \ndistrict courts have responsibility for others. This overlapping \nauthority has led to forum shopping and has resulted in unnecessary and \nwasteful litigation over jurisdictional issues. For this reason, the \nJanuary 1993 report of the Acquisition Law Advisory Panel (the so-\ncalled section 800 Panel) recommended that:\n\n       There should be only one judicial system for consideration \n     of bid protests and that forum should have jurisdiction to \n     consider all protests which can now be considered by the \n     district courts and by the Court of Federal Claims. * * * The \n     Court of Federal Claims should be the single judicial forum \n     with jurisdiction to consider all protests that can presently \n     be considered by any district court or by the Court of \n     Federal Claims.\n\n  The original Senate bill contained a provision that would have \nimplemented this recommendation and consolidated Federal court \njurisdiction for procurement protests in the Court of Federal Claims.\n  The revised bill we are taking up today contains a compromise \nprovision that would consolidate the jurisdiction of the Court of \nFederal Claims and the district courts. For 4 years, the consolidated \njurisdiction would be shared by the Court of Federal Claims and the \ndistrict courts. Each court system would exercise jurisdiction over the \nfull range of bid protest cases previously subject to review in either \nsystem. After 4 years, the jurisdiction of the district courts would \nterminate, and the Court of Federal Claims would exercise exclusive \njudicial jurisdiction\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\nover procurement protests. These provisions addressing Federal court \njurisdiction over procurement protests would not affect in any way the \nauthority of the Comptroller General to review procurement protests \npursuant to chapter 35 of title 31, U.S. Code, and they would not \naffect the jurisdiction or standards applied by either the district \ncourts or the Court of Federal Claims in any area of the law other than \nthe procurement protests to which they are addressed.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Grassley, and in \nparticular his staffer, Kolan Davis, for the hard work and leadership \nhe has shown to renew and strengthen the ADR and negotiated rulemaking \nlaws. I would also like to thank Senator Glenn, Senator Cohen, and \nSenator Stevens, from the Governmental Affairs Committee for their \ncontinuing support. And this bill would not have had a chance without \nthe hard work, persistence, and creative effort of three House Members \nand their outstanding staffs, and I would like to thank Congressmen \nJack Reed, George Gekas, and Henry Hyde for getting this legislation to \nthe floor despite a crowded calendar. This bill shows that \nbipartisanship is alive and functioning in this Congress.\n  Alternative dispute resolution methods and negotiated rulemaking \nprovide new and better ways to conduct government business. They cost \nless, they're quicker, they're less adversarial, they develop sensible \nsolutions to problems, and they free up courts for other business.

Mr. President, I want to speak on the bill that is \nbefore us and just on a very small portion of it, the immigration bill. \nObviously, the immigration bill is not just a small portion of the bill \nthat is before us. It is perhaps one of the most important aspects of \nthe bill before us. But what I meant was, I do not want to speak to the \nappropriations part of the bill.\n  I want to voice my strong support for the illegal immigration bill. \nThis has been included, as everyone knows, as part of the continuing \nresolution. Senator Simpson, chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, \nhas worked diligently to bring this bill forward.\n  I am very pleased to have worked with him in creating solutions to \nthe immigration problems that our country is facing today and, also, to \ntake time to compliment Senator Simpson for the hard work that he has \ngiven for the people of his State of Wyoming to the United States as a \nMember of the U.S. Senate. He is now retiring. Those of us who have \nserved with him on the Judiciary Committee, and a considerable amount \nof time together with him on the Immigration Subcommittee, are surely \ngoing to miss his leadership in this area.\n  This bill that is before us even under these extraordinary \ncircumstances of its being part of the omnibus bill, even under those \ncircumstances, should not detract from the hard work that has gone on \nin this Congress on this legislation that Senator Simpson has put \ntogether. He has produced a very strong bipartisan bill that will help \nus make a huge impact on the problems of illegal immigration.\n  In the last 2 years, Senator Simpson has made a great effort to deal \nwith illegal immigration. We have done it by providing over $1 billion \nin new funding. But we all know that comprehensive legislation, like \nthe bill before us, is necessary before we are ever going to be \nsuccessful, or whether or not even that additional billion dollars in \nthe war on illegal immigrants is going to be successfully spent.\n  Provisions of the bill provide for more effective deportation \nmeasures, increased border and investigative staffing, and stricter \nemployment and welfare standards. It is exactly measures such as these \nthat are necessary to combat the growing problem of illegal \nimmigration.\n  Illegal immigration is an issue that has been in the forefront of \npublic debate for some time right now. It is a growing problem that \naffects even the smallest towns in the Midwest.\n  The problem became graphic to me in January 1995 when an Iowa college \nstudent named Justin Younie was murdered by an illegal alien who had \nbeen removed from the State of Iowa once before because of his illegal \nstatus. Unfortunately, this particular illegal alien came back to the \nUnited States and to my State of Iowa without any problems. That is the \ncase with so many illegal aliens returning, only this time, this \nperson, this illegal alien, ended up committing murder. This person has \nsince been convicted of this horrible crime. That does not bring back \nthe life of Mr. Younie. But it does set the stage for a very important \nprovision that I have in this bill allowing local law enforcement \npeople to be involved in the arrest of an illegal alien if the only \nthing they have done wrong is being in this country illegally. I know \nit is not understandable to people who for the last 20 years, there has \nbeen a regulation saying that local law enforcement people cannot \narrest an illegal alien just because they are here illegally. But that \nis the situation.\n\n  We have another example beyond this murder of the reach of illegal \nimmigration, and it was featured in the U.S. News & World Report of \nSeptember 13, 1996, and on the cover story. It addressed illegal \nimmigration and its effects on the small town of Storm Lake, IA. \nSpecifically, the article focused on the meatpacking industry, which, \nsince its opening in 1982, has experienced a large influx of illegal \nimmigrants. The effects on the town of Storm Lake have been very \nsignificant. Along with a population increase has come increased crime \nrates, increased education expenditures, racial problems, and economic \nconcerns causing great resentment within the community.\n  According to the article, the increase in illegal immigrants to the \ntown can\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\nbe attributed to the job opportunities offered by this meatpacking \nindustry. Apparently, workers are recruited by immigrants already \nworking at the plant. Once these workers are recruited, they illegally \ncross the border, obtain a false identity, and begin work. As workers \nare injured, or the plant is raided by the INS, new workers are hired \nto fill the empty positions. This process ensures a continuous demand \nfor workers which has been so steady that it has reportedly spawned a \nsort of underground railroad from Mexico to the town of Storm Lake, IA.\n  It is because of situations like these--the meatpacking story in \nStorm Lake and the murder of Justin Younie in Iowa--that the illegal \nimmigration conference report is being discussed here today. Provisions \nin this act address illegal immigration problems at every level, from \nBorder Patrol to deportation. The act takes direct steps to reduce \ncrime associated with illegal immigration and provides States with \nincentives to do the same.\n  Among the hundreds of provisions in this bill are a number of \ninitiatives that I fought for as a member of the Judiciary Committee \nand, as well, as a conferee. For instance, this bill allows the \nAttorney General to enter into agreements with local law enforcement, \npermitting, as I said, for the first time since 1977 local authorities \nto apprehend, detain, and transport illegal aliens. This is an \nespecially important step for the interior States, such as my State of \nIowa, that are distant from the borders.\n  Just a few weeks ago local police had to release a truckload of \nillegal aliens because the INS wouldn't--or, as they might say, \n``couldn't''--respond just then. But they used the argument that there \nwere less than 20 illegals in the group. So it was too small of a group \nfor them to mess around with. Obviously, it is better from that \njudgment to wait until they find their way into a job and into the \nunderground economy, get lost, and then spend thousands of dollars more \nto apprehend the very same people. But they were in the custody for a \nshort period of time of these local law enforcement people.\n  So it is obvious that local law enforcement needs more tools like we \nare now providing to fight illegal immigrants.\n  In addition, because of my insistence, the conference included a \nguarantee that each State will have at least 10 agents. This will help \nStates like Iowa that do not have any agents right now when illegal \nimmigration is growing at a rapid pace.\n  The conference committee also included a provision of mine to exempt \nnonprofits and churches from the time-consuming and costly paperwork of \nverification and deeming. Unfortunately, the administration made the \nmistake of demanding the provision be changed in the last-minute \nnegotiations last week on title V.\n  I might say at this point that my staff got a call about 1:30 \nSaturday morning to discuss some changes in this language. That is not \na very good way to write a piece of legislation. And we are going to \npay the consequences for it on this because this resulting language is \ninferior to what I had agreed to in conference, and that was a \nbipartisan agreement.\n  At least on the face of it, nonprofits will be exempt from the new \nprovision. But the question of when and how people can be served by \nnonprofits and any resulting paperwork requirement will unfortunately \nbe left to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General. The former \nconference language that we had worked out provided protections from \nregulations. But the administration language does not. I think this \nwill have to be remedied in legislation next year because we are going \nto have potential problems on this.\n  Nevertheless, I am satisfied with another provision concerning \ncongressional participation.\n  This provision requires that when we proceed with the verification \npilot projects for employers, Congress and the Federal Government will \nbe a part of those projects. The only way that we are going to know if \nthese really work or not is if we, in the Congress, are a part of them. \nThat is a followup of my legislation, the first bill passed by a \nRepublican Congress in 40 years, the first bill signed by President \nClinton going way back to January of 1995, a bill where after 6 years \nwe finally ended the exemption that Members of Congress as employers \nhad from Federal law--civil rights, labor and safety legislation, among \nothers, which we had exempted ourselves from that apply to the rest of \nthe country.\n  That legislation has passed, so we are no longer exempt from those \nlaws. There is no longer two sets of laws, one for Capitol Hill and one \nfor the rest of the United States. There is one set of laws that \napplies equally.\n  When it comes to this verification pilot project for employers, it \nseems to me that we in the Federal Government ought to be participating \nin these projects and then we are going to know firsthand the redtape \nthat small business or large business even has to go through to meet \nthe requirements of our immigration law. Then in a few years when we go \ndown the road to making a final decision whether or not this new \nverification procedure goes into place, we are going to do it not from \nthe standpoint of just what our constituents are telling us, as so very \nimportant as that is, we are also going to know firsthand what is \ninvolved with this project and the impact it is going to have upon \nemployers of America because we are employers in the sense that we, as \nMembers of Congress, hire staff. And if the small business people ought \nto go through a certain process under this project, we ought to as well \nso we know firsthand what the situation is.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, anyone who does not support this bill \nis just not serious about dealing with illegal immigration. Although \nmany of the provisions of this bill could have been tougher, there has \nbeen a strong effort to achieve bipartisan support. I look forward to \nthis bill becoming law, and I commend Senator Simpson for the \nincredible job he has done with this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, as we have launched into the high-pitched \nrhetoric and the harsh charges and countercharges of the fall political \ncampaign season, I found it very interesting when I heard a sermon \npreached by Dr. Craig Barnes, the pastor of the National Presbyterian \nChurch, on Sunday. It so happens that his sermon topic was ``Choosing \nGood Government.'' I asked Dr. Barnes if he would mind if I shared this \nwith my colleagues and with those who are interested, because I \nthink Dr. Barnes laid down some very good principles for people of \nfaith, people who contend they are religious believers, regardless of \ntheir particular sect or denomination or even their religion, to \nconsider in choosing those who seek to represent us in November.\n\n  Dr. Barnes is not one to recommend one party or another or one \ncandidate or another, nor have I heard him in his sermons attempting to \ninfluence the choices that those of us in the legislative bodies make \nwhen we deal with controversial issues, but I think he had a couple of \nvery good points to consider and to apply based on our tenets, our \nbeliefs and judgment as to how these standards should be applied. He \ngives us a framework for making the choices that are very important to \nall of us in this election year because, as he points out, we are \nsubject to the rule of man by reason of the authorization from God for \nman to establish laws and rules over one another.\n  Dr. Barnes points out that we have to choose a system which is in \nconformity with God's will if we are to choose a government that is \nconsistent with the principles that have been laid down by our God and \nby our faith.\n  The two main points that Dr. Barnes makes are, first, to choose God's \nleader is always to choose godly character. And he points out that we \nlive in an\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\nera when character and integrity have sometimes gotten off the table \nfor consideration. You try bringing up an issue like personal morality \nand they say that is nobody's business.\n  Dr. Barnes points out that as King David discovered,\n       People who do not make good personal choices are \n     compromised in their ability to make good public choices. \n     Biblical leadership is never seen as a job. It is a calling. \n     It is a way of life for which the leader is a symbol. People \n     who choose to live by the Bible,'' or by the other directives \n     that they have receive from that higher being in whom they \n     have belief, ``are given rather clear standards of ethical \n     behavior. Some things are right. Some things are wrong. [It \n     is] not wrong because it is ineffective or unpopular. But [it \n     is wrong] because it isn't the right thing to do. To choose \n     God as your authority is to resist the current privatization \n     of morality and to choose a leader who is clearly trying to \n     be led by God in his or her own life.\n  The second point that Dr. Barnes makes is that choosing a leader is \nalways a choice about a particular vision for our life together. And we \nhave heard lots of talk about vision: Do we have vision in the \ncampaign? What is the vision?\n  We all know the maxim that, ``Without a vision, the people perish.'' \nBut, according to some polls, almost 90 percent of us claim to believe \nin a God, and to pray. But we seem to be spiritually empty. And the \nreason we may be that is because we are no longer able to call for the \nsacrifice or discipline necessary to live by the teachings.\n  We, as Americans, cherish not only our freedom but our vision of life \nunder God. That is what brought the pilgrims and the Puritans here. \nThat was what native Americans and Hispanics had before we came, life \nunder God. Slaves that were dragged here found a vision, that they \ncould build a new life in the Biblical stories of God's deliverance.\n  So those who will now lead us have to offer some vision of our life \ntogether. This has to be more than just helping each person to get a \npiece of the pie. It has to be something that will, again, inspire \nsacrifice and commitment to the common good, something that will make \nus refuse to accept ``the way it is said'' and commit ourselves to \n``the way it can be.''\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who may be interested, and anyone \nelse who is concerned about choices we make this fall, to read and \nponder this sermon.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the sermon is ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        Choosing Good Government\n\n                        (By Dr. M. Craig Barnes)\n\n       Americans have always been ambivalent about authority. We \n     know we need it. We honor and respect it. But we are still \n     suspicious of it.\n       This is not surprising for a nation whose founding \n     documents include a Declaration of Independence, which we \n     cherish. But that independence has also been written on our \n     hearts. It was what propelled us to explore the frontier and \n     tame it with our hands. It was what almost split the nation \n     in two over a Civil War. Our spirit of independence has led \n     us to honor innovation and creativity, and a competitive \n     economy where we are free to improve ourselves. It has even \n     sent us overseas to fight tyranny and aggression, because we \n     cannot stand the thought of people not being free. Every \n     healthy American teenager knows about the longing to be free, \n     and that longing never goes away.\n       So we are very careful about giving even some of this \n     freedom away. But we know we have to. We give it to parents \n     and teachers, to employers and to the elders of the church, \n     and we give it to the government who can tell us what to do. \n     They can restrict our activities with laws and regulations \n     and they can direct us toward a particular future. We give \n     these leaders power over our lives because we know we cannot \n     live together without some authority. But we don't really \n     like it.\n       One of our favorite American beliefs is that the real \n     authority still lies with the individual who at least chooses \n     the people to lead us. Very conscious of this, leadership \n     today has tried to move beyond the hierarchial models of the \n     past where the person at the top ran the show. Now, the last \n     thing anyone wants to be accused of is being authoritarian. \n     So we have developed a new emphases on ``participative \n     management'' and ``building consensus.'' But we are \n     discovering this can digress into little more than servicing \n     complaints. In essence, many leaders today are saying, ``I'm \n     must here to give you what you want.'' (``So I can stay \n     here.'') This has led many social and political commentators \n     to ask who really has authority in a free society? The leader \n     or those who are led?\n       According to Romans chapter 13, the answer is neither one. \n     ``Let every person be subject to the governing authorities; \n     for there is no authority except from God.'' Now that is a \n     rather strong statement. And just in case we want to gloss \n     over it, Paul says the same thing three times in this \n     passage. ``There is no authority except from God . . . Those \n     authorities that exist have been instituted by God . . . \n     Whoever resists authority resists what God has appointed.''\n       At first we want to object by asking what about tyrants \n     like Hitler or Stalin? What about the boss or teacher who \n     abuses their power. Is there authority from God? But then we \n     remember that the Apostle Paul, who was inspired to write \n     these words, lived under incredible tyrants like Claudius and \n     Nero. Paul knew about leaders who abused authority, but he \n     also knew about the sovereign power of God.\n       As a Jew, Paul was steeped in the Old Testament \n     understanding of God's Kingdom--God's reign on earth which is \n     greater than the kingdoms of earth and uses the kingdoms of \n     earth for his own purposes. Which means all governments are \n     under God. To the degree that human leaders obey God they are \n     being faithful to their calling. To the degree that human \n     leaders break God's commandments they are stepping outside of \n     their authority, which can only come from God.\n       Actually the Bible is filled with illustrations of people \n     who because they obeyed God could not obey their leaders. \n     When Pharaoh ordered the midwives to kill all the Hebrew \n     babies, they began to hide them and Moses' life was \n     preserved. When Nebuchadnezzar ordered everyone to bow before \n     his image. Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego refused to obey. \n     When Darius outlawed praying, Daniel continued to pray. When \n     Herod ordered the death of the children in Bethlehem, Jesus' \n     parents fled to Egypt with their son. When Peter was told by \n     the Sanhedrin to stop preaching, he told his religious \n     leaders, ``We have to obey God rather than man.'' In everyone \n     of those cases, people of faith were making heroic choices \n     about who would govern them. And in every case, the choices \n     were guided by a prior commitment to serve God the only real \n     authority we have.\n       The Bible says nothing about either covenants or contracts \n     between people and their leaders. That makes for good social \n     and political theory, but it is not how the Bible orders our \n     life together. The Bible claims both the people and the \n     leader are under a common obligation to live under God, and \n     the leader is but an instrument of divine purposes. Thus, we \n     must help our government succeed in its calling to serve God. \n     We cannot disregard the laws and direction of our leaders \n     just because we had other preferences. We must still honor \n     good leaders even when they make bad mistakes. In the words \n     of B.B. King, ``Only a mediocre man is always at his best.'' \n     The only time we can refuse to obey our government is when in \n     a great crisis in conscience we become convinced it has \n     determined to lead us away from life under God's authority.\n       Rev. Michael Cassidy, a leader of the South African \n     church's resistance to apartheid tells about the time he was \n     summoned to appear before President P.W. Botha in Pretoria. \n     When he entered his office, the president stood and began \n     reading Romans 13. Botha claimed the passage called for \n     unequivocal support of the Nationalist Government apartheid \n     policy. Rev. Cassidy responded by reminding the president he \n     too had read the Bible and began quoting from Revelation 13, \n     which describes governments that become dragons when they \n     devour God's people. The authority doesn't lie in the leader. \n     The authority lies in God, whom the leader also serves.\n       Here in the land of the Free, we are given a wonderful \n     opportunity to make choices about who will lead us. We can \n     elect leaders. We can choose an employer, or a church, or a \n     politician. Behind each of those choices. for people who \n     believe in God, is a decision about which leader will bring \n     us closer to the reign of God. Let me offer two guidelines to \n     help us in our choices about who will lead us closer to God's \n     kingdom.\n       1. To choose God's leader is always to choose Godly \n     character. We live in an era when the issues of character and \n     integrity have somehow been taken off the table for \n     consideration. Try bringing up the issues of personal \n     morality of a leader at work and you are likely to be told, \n     that is a private issue. The question is can he or she do the \n     job.'' But as King David discovered people who do not make \n     good personal choices are compromised in their ability to \n     make good public choices. Biblical leadership is never seen \n     as a job. It is a calling. It is a way of life for which the \n     leader is a symbol.\n       People who choose to live by the Bible are given rather \n     clear standards of ethical behavior. Some things are right. \n     Some things are wrong. Not wrong because it is ineffective or \n     unpopular. But wrong because it isn't the right thing to do. \n     To choose God as your authority is to resist the current \n     privatization of morality and to choose a leader who is \n     clearly trying to be led by God in his or her own life. The \n     evidence of that is not only in things like sex and money, \n     but also in the morals we don't talk about as much in \n     Washington--like humility, and graciousness, and the refusal \n     to become mean just because it helps you survive.\n       2. Choosing a leader is always a choice about a particular \n     vision of our life together. In a recent article in the \n     journal First Things, Thomas Reeves asks why does our country \n     seem to be so spiritually empty when according to the Gallup \n     poll 90% of us\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\n     claim to believe in God and to pray? One of his suggestions \n     is that our religious leaders no longer have a vision of \n     another way of life. Thus, we are no longer able to call for \n     the sacrifice or discipline necessary to live by the Spirit. \n     So the prayers of the people have become self-indulgent \n     expressions of consumerism, where we keep asking God to \n     give us something we can't get for ourselves.\n       John Updike's novel, In the Beauty of the Lilies, begins \n     with a Presbyterian preacher named Clarence Wilmot who loses \n     his faith at the turn of the century. For Rev. Wilmot it \n     seems Christ is still hiding in the beauty of the lilies \n     across the sea from us. He cannot find the Savior. He's \n     overwhelmed by urban poverty and the injustice of his own \n     parishioners. He finds no answers in the new liberal theology \n     that adores scientific and cultural potential, but has little \n     to say about God. Eventually he drops out of the ministry and \n     becomes an unsuccessful encyclopedia salesman. No longer able \n     to proclaim truth, he now peddles information.\n       The novel then traces how this loss of faith and vision is \n     visited upon his children and grandchildren. Clarence's son \n     becomes frightened of life. The author writes, ``Nothing made \n     Teddy indignant. He was curious about the world but never \n     with any hope of changing it. He had no faith to offer. Only \n     the facts of daily existence.'' Clarence's granddaughter \n     became what the author calls a ego-theist who is preoccupied \n     with herself. She doesn't seem to be troubled by morals, but \n     finds it useful to pray to God for success. His great \n     grandson became so lost and disillusioned that he fell easy \n     prey to a cult leader who destroyed his followers in a fire.\n       Throughout the novel, the reader watches these characters \n     make one bad choice after another. The book ends without any \n     redemption or hope, but simply with two words, ``The \n     children.'' I was so upset, I slammed the book shut and threw \n     it across the room. It was an awful book. But it's true. \n     Without a vision of life, without something more than our \n     current preoccupation with information and success, we are \n     destroying not only ourselves, but our children.\n       To be American means to cherish not only our freedom, but \n     also our vision of life under God. That was what brought \n     Pilgrims and Puritans here. That was what Native Americans \n     and Hispanics had before we came--Life under God. Slaves that \n     were dragged here, found the vision to build a new life in \n     the Biblical stories of God's deliverance. Immigrants that \n     piled into the land came with the vision that there was a \n     life here for them too--as Americans under God.\n       So those who will now lead us have to offer some vision of \n     our life together. This has to be something more than just \n     helping you get your piece of the pie. It has to be something \n     that will again inspire sacrifice and commitment to the \n     common good, something that will make us refuse to accept the \n     way it is and commit ourselves to the way it can be.\n       Where will our leaders find a vision with that kind of \n     authority? From their own faith in God. The only authority we \n     have.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, in recent years, there has been been one \nissue that, perhaps more than any other, has sent waves of fear through \nour communities--the scourge of illegal drugs and the threat they pose \nto our children and families. As the 104th Congress comes to a close, I \nwant to reflect on one aspect of this growing threat: the increasing \nuse and manufacture of methamphetamines.\n  The use of this drug is increasing among youth and young adults. \nAccording to the most recent Drug Abuse Warning Network, \nmethamphetamine-related deaths increased nationally by 145 percent \nbetween 1992 and 1994 and methamphetamine-related emergency room cases \nare up 256 percent since 1991. In addition, methamphetamine-related \nhospital visits more than tripled between 1991 and 1994, with the \nlargest increases occurring in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and \nDenver.\n  In case my colleagues are not familiar with this drug, it is commonly \ncalled, in its various forms, speed, crank, ice, and meth. It's cheap, \neasy to get, highly addictive, and very, very dangerous.\n  This drug can be inhaled, injected, ingested, or smoked. Its effects \ninclude feelings of alertness, euphoria, self-confidence, and \nimpulsiveness. It can lead to rage, depression, paranoia, \ndelusions,weight loss, abnormal heartbeat, insomnia, confusion, and \nauditory hallucinations. It has increased its purity in recent years \nand its effects can be sustained for up to 8 hours. Abusers may remain \nawake for days or weeks after a binge, then enter the most dangerous \nphase, know as tweaking, where they as most likely to suffer \nhallucinations, dramatic mood swings, and extreme violence.\n  While all drugs are cause for concern, the increase of \nmethamphetamines pose unique problems for law enforcement and \ncommunities, namely clandestine labs.\n  In recent months, I have met with groups of law enforcement officials \nincluding Washington State Patrol Chief Annette Sandberg, U.S. Attorney \nKate Pflaumer, and representatives of many local law enforcement \nagencies, including Shoreline Polices Department, Snohomish County \nSheriffs Department, Lynnwood Police Department, Everett Police \nDepartment, Marysvill Police Department, and Mukilteo Police \nDepartment. Without exception, all mentioned the increasing numbers of \nclandestine laboratories used to manufacture methamphetamines.\n  These labs are easily assembled in hotel rooms, trailer homes, or \nother small structures in both rural and urban settings. Using a quick, \neasy and cheap method, dubbed the Nazi method because of its invention \nby the Germans to keep soldiers alert in World War II, legal \ningredients are harnessed to create a potent form of methamphetamines.\n  Once these labs are located, local law enforcement officers must \ndisassemble them, often at great risk to themselves. The chemicals used \nto make this synthetic drug include red phosphorous, iodine, \nhydrochloric acid, and, most importantly, ephedrine. These chemicals or \ntheir combination create hazardous waste and can be deadly if officers \nare overexposed to them.\n  According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, the clandestine nature of \nthe manufacturing process and the presence of ignitable, corrosive, \nreactive, and toxic chemicals have led to explosions, fires, toxic \nfumes, and irreparable damage to human health and the environment. The \nso-called cooks or chemists in these clandestine labs simply dump \nhazardous chemical wastes on the ground, into streams or lakes, into \nsewage systems or septic tanks, or underground.\n\n  Law enforcement officials or firefighters require special training in \nhealth, safety, and disposal methods to deal with these labs. The \ncleanup of these dangerous sites is complex, expensive and time \nconsuming. The contaminated materials and evidence can weigh up to \nseveral tons. The substances to which these law enforcement officers \nare exposed present very real health risks.\n  In addition to the danger posed to officers and the environment, \nunwitting future tenants of the motels, homes, or trailers may be \nexposed to toxic vapors that have permeated plaster and wood of \nbuildings. Children may play in the soil or water onto which these \nchemicals have been carelessly or intentionally dumped. Passersby also \nmay inhale these vapors as they pass a clandestine lab. Finally, \nchemicals may be stored in rental lockers or other semi-public places \nthat lack proper ventilation or temperature controls. These improperly \nstored chemicals increase the likelihood of fire, explosion, and human \nexposure.\n  So, Mr. President, what should we do? I am in strong support of S. \n1965, the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act passed by the \nSenate 2 weeks ago and the House this weekend. That bill takes a \nmultifaceted approach to the problem by addressing, among other things, \nimportation of chemicals used to make the drug; increased penalties for \nmanufacturing, possession of manufacturing equipment, and trafficking; \nhigher civil penalties for firms that knowingly supply precursor \nchemicals; restitution for cleanup of clandestine lab sites; \ndevelopment of an interagency task force; public health monitoring; and \npublic-private education programs.\n  I congratulate Senators Hatch, Biden, and Feinstein on their efforts \nto help this Congress address the problem. I ask unanimous consent that \nmy letter to Senators Hatch and Biden be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1996.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee.\n\n     Senator Joe Biden,\n     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee.\n       Dear Orrin and Joe: Last week, the Senate passed a bill you \n     sponsored, the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of \n     1996. I understand the House intends to make up a similar \n     bill this week. I strongly support the Senate bill, S. 1965, \n     and urge you to work to ensure it becomes law this year.\n       In these last two months, I have visited with \n     representatives of local, state and federal law enforcement. \n     Over and over, these officials voiced concerns about the \n     increasing manufacture, potency, and availability of \n     methamphetamines. Local and state law enforcement officers \n     said they felt particularly ill-equipped to safely and cost-\n     effectively deal with clandestine labs and the hazardous \n     chemicals they contain. The high cost, technical expertise \n     and time required to investigate and eliminate these labs are \n     hampering law enforcement's ability to protect our young \n     people and communities from the threat not only of \n     methamphetamines, but of other illegal drugs as well.\n       I pledge my support in any way I can to helping ensure this \n     bill, S. 1965, becomes law. I also intend to work within the \n     Appropriations Committee to see that coordination efforts are \n     strengthened and our law enforcement officials have the tools \n     they need to combat this growing threat.\n       Thank you for all of your work to date on this issue. I \n     look forward to working closely with you on this important \n     public safety issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Patty Murray,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas a cosponsor of S. 1965.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Another important piece to solving this puzzle in the \nPacific Northwest is designation of a high-intensity drug trafficking \narea. I am happy to announce that contained in this bill is $3 million \nfor the newly created Pacific Northwest HIDTA. This will help \nenormously as we try to coordinate our efforts among Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement to fight not only methamphetamines, but all \nother illegal drugs and drug trafficking in our region.\n  The Department of Justice has also developed the National \nMethamphetamine Strategy--April 1996. This report is referenced in a \ncolloquy I will have, in conjunction with this omnibus spending bill, \nwith Chairman Hatfield and Senator Hollings about the need to address \nmethamphetamines. This plan, which will be partially implemented when \nS. 1965 becomes law, lays out a legislative, law enforcement, training, \nchemical regulation, international cooperation, environmental \nprotection, public awareness, educational, and treatment strategy. The \nmultidisciplinary, multijurisdictional program provides the needed \ncomprehensive approach to this problem.\n  Finally, money is critical. While I do not support simply throwing \nFederal dollars at this problem, the need for Federal support to help \nin coordination activities, technical assistance, and training cannot \nbe minimized. In the bill we have before us, we make some major \nimprovements in our war against these and other drugs. The DEA's budget \nwas increased by 23 percent--that's a start. The U.S. Attorneys Office \nreceived funding for additional attorney's, which are critically \nneeded. The Office of National Drug Control Policy received new money \nand additional HIDTA's. So, I believe this budget moves us in the right \ndirection.\n  As I have suggested in the colloquy, I intend to work with my \ncolleagues in Congress and in the administration to develop a funding \nand technical assistance strategy to address the unique problems posed \nby methamphetamines and clandestine labs. Our local and State law \nenforcement officials simply must have adequate money, training, and \ntechnical expertise to address the costly and dangerous threats posed \nby clandestine labs. I will then work to ensure funds are targeted to \nthis vital area in the fiscal year 1998 budget.\n  Mr. President, as with all social and criminal problems, change can \nonly occur if and when we all do our part. I pledge to work with \nFederal, State and local law enforcement, community leaders, my \ncolleagues, and others to find a way to stop the spread of illegal \ndrugs, including methamphetamines. I am committed to improving the \nquality of life, safety, and security of our children and communities. \nI look forward to continuing this important work in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized for a time period not to \nexceed 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11853-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11854-S11856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FEDERAL EXPRESS ANTI-LABOR RIDER TO FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the FAA reforms, but I \nstrongly object to the anti-labor rider that the Republican leadership \nhas attached to this bill.\n  This controversy is a good example of why the sun is setting on the \nRepublican majority in Congress. As their parting shot at American \nworkers in the closing hours of this Congress, the Republican \nleadership is demanding that an unacceptable anti-labor rider be \nattached to this needed aviation security bill.\n  That riders is special interest legislation of the worst kind. It is \ndesigned to help Federal Express Corp. block the ongoing efforts of its \ntruckdrivers in Pennsylvania to join a union.\n  Federal Express is notorious for its anti-union ideology--but there \nis no justification for Congress to become an accomplice in its union-\nbusting tactic. I intend to do all I can to see that this anti-worker \nrider does not become law. It has no place on the FAA bill, and it \ndeserves no place in the statute books.\n  I believe that as the facts of this controversy become widely known, \nworking men and women across America will be shocked at the lengths to \nwhich the Republican majority in Congress is willing to go in their \nattempt to enact their anti-worker ideology into law.\n  Why is Federal Express willing to go to such drastic lengths to force \nthis rider into law? Because they see the sun setting on the Republican \nanti-worker majority in Congress, and they know there is no hope that \ntheir special interest provision will be enacted by a Democratic \nproworker majority in Congress.\n  On September 26, under the guise of a technical correction to the \nRailway Labor Act, an unacceptable special interest provision was \nattached to the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  This provision is in no sense a technical correction. It makes a \nsignificant change in Federal law to give the Federal Express Corp. an \nedge in its blatant attempt to stop some of its employees from joining \na union.\n  Under present law, airline employees are covered by the Railway Labor \nAct, which requires employees to form a nationwide bargaining unit if \nthey wish to have a union. Truck drivers, however, historically have \nbeen subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which allows smaller \nbargaining units to be established on a more local basis.\n  This split coverage makes sense. It has been national labor policy \nsince the 1930's, when the National Labor Relations Act was passed and \nthe Railway Labor Act was amended to cover airlines as well as \nrailroads.\n  United Parcel Service, which has both airline and trucking components \nof its business and competes with Federal Express, is covered by the \nRailway Labor Act for its airline operations and by the National Labor \nRelations Act for its trucking operations. UPS truck drivers formed \nlocal unions decades ago pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act, \nand are members of the Teamsters Union.\n  Federal Express truck drivers are not unionized. However, truck \ndrivers at the Pennsylvania facilities of Federal Express have been \ntrying for nearly 2 years to organize and become members of the United \nAuto Workers. The drivers filed a petition for a union election with \nthe National Labor Relations Board in January 1995.\n  Federal Express challenged the petition, arguing that the entire \ncompany,\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\nincluding its truck drivers, is covered by the Railway Labor Act, not \nthe National Labor Relations Act, and that therefore the bargaining \nunit for its truck drivers must be nationwide. The Board has not yet \ndecided the issue.\n  This is a matter that is currently in litigation, even while we are \nhere today. We ought to let the litigation move forward. But the action \nthat was taken on the FAA bill has preempted effectively the litigation \nwhich is under consideration even as we meet here this afternoon.\n  In the final days of this Congress, Federal Express is trying to \nshort-circuit the NLRB process by including an amendment in the FAA \nreauthorization bill to guarantee that its truck drivers are covered by \nthe Railway Labor Act, and thereby block local union-organizing efforts \nby its truck drivers in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n  You can say, ``Why not just let them proceed under the existing law, \neither they have the support and have the votes or they don't?'' And \nlet the National Labor Relations Board make a judgment as to whether \nthe Railroad Act applies to them or whether they would be treated under \nthe National Labor Relations Act.\n  Just under 3 weeks ago, the Senate Appropriations Committee defeated \nan attempt to add the Federal Express rider to the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. The attempt failed on a 10 to 10 tie vote. \nEarlier, in the House of Representatives, Republicans tried to add the \nprovision to the railroad unemployment compensation bill, which had \noverwhelming bipartisan support. The attempt created so much \ncontroversy that Republicans quickly abandoned the effort.\n  It makes no sense to tie this objectionable provision to important \nlegislation like the FAA bill. This bill authorizes the FAA's programs \nfor 2 years. It provides for needed improvements in the Nation's \nairports. It streamlines the FAA's construction program to improve its \nefficiency and make it less complicated.\n  The bill also contains important safety measures, including needed \nprovisions to improve security at the Nation's airports. It is a good \nbill, deserves to pass, without the special interest rider for Federal \nExpress.\n  Supporters of the Federal Express rider claim that it is simply a \ntechnical correction. That is false. In 1995, as part of the act \nterminating the Interstate Commerce Commission, Congress deleted the \nterm ``express company'' from the Interstate Commerce Act and the \nRailway Labor Act.\n  We deleted that term because the last express company, the Railway \nExpress Agency, went bankrupt in the early 1970's. In a true \n``technical correction,'' Congress deleted this obsolete language from \nthe statutes where it appeared.\n\n       The deletion of ``express company'' from section 1 of the \n     [Railway Labor Act] does not appear to have been \n     inadvertent or mistaken.\n\n  This is the conclusion of the Congressional Research Service. We had \ndistributed to us a number of pieces of paper from some of the House \nMembers who had been active in initiating these provisions. They make \nthe point that this was really a technical amendment and was really \nbecause it was inadvertent that this language was left out of the \nrestructuring of the interstate commerce legislation in 1995 when we \neliminated the Commission.\n  This is, according to the Congressional Research Service, their \nconclusion of analyzing the history of this proposal:\n\n       The deletion of ``express company'' from section 1 of the \n     [Railway Labor Act] does not appear to have been inadvertent \n     or mistaken. To the contrary, the deletion appeared to be \n     consistent with the statutory structure and the intent of \n     Congress. Since the [Railway Labor Act] coverage had been \n     triggered by federal regulation of express companies, it \n     appears logical and necessary to eliminate the cross-\n     reference to Title 49 from the RLA to preclude ostensible \n     coverage of nonexistent express companies. The elimination of \n     ``express company'' from the RLA therefore appears to have \n     been a necessary step in harmonizing the RLA with the revised \n     Title 49 of the U.S. Code.\n\n  So here is the Congressional Research Service, when they are asked--\nas this is an action that was just taken on Friday of last week--\nwhether the changing of this with the legislation is just correcting a \ntechnical oversight or whether the elimination of those words of art \n``express company'' was intentional, their review of the history shows \nit was intentional.\n  It passed virtually unanimously in the House and the Senate for the \nreasons that have been expressed in their memoranda. We will include \nthat as a part of the Record. So this was not a technical correction.\n  But Federal Express was not and is not an ``express company'' within \nthe meaning of the Railway Labor Act or the Interstate Commerce Act. \nThey define exactly what is an ``express company'' and what has not \nbeen. They have been defining that for a long period of time, for a \nperiod of years. And they have made that judgment to date.\n  The Interstate Commerce Commission defined that term as a company \nthat provided expedited services in handling small, highly valuable \npackages over regular routes and by a regular schedule. The ICC did not \nconsider FedEx to be an express company because it did not use regular \nroutes and a regular schedule. Instead, the ICC viewed FedEx as a \n``motor carrier.''\n  Federal Express argued to numerous courts that it was a so-called \nexpress company, but no court ever adopted the arguments, and at no \npoint did the ICC ever set rates for Federal Express as an express \ncompany.\n  Federal Express claims it is an express company because it is the \nsuccessor to the Railway Express Agency. A Federal Express subsidiary \nbought some of Railway Express' operating certificates in the 1970's, \nbut those certificates covered motor carrier operations and not express \ncompany operations. In any event, Federal Express never operated under \nthose certificates. Even if Federal Express were a successor to Railway \nExpress' motor carrier operations, it is not a successor to its \n``express operations.''\n  In closing, it is important to look beyond the legal technicalities \nand talk about what is really at stake here. Hundreds of truckdrivers \nin the State of Pennsylvania want to join the United Auto Workers and \nbargain with Federal Express over the terms and conditions of their \nemployment.\n\n  Federal Express is trying to deny those employees their right to \norganize. That is basically the issue. We are being asked, as an \namendment to the Federal Aviation Act, to intercede in terms of a labor \ndispute. That is a decision that we have to make. It is only for the \nbenefit of one particular company. That is Federal Express. It does not \nhave application to any other company. Just one company. Just one \ncompany. That particular provision was put in here at the end of last \nweek, just hours before we are supposed to adjourn. It will have a very \nsignificant and important impact in terms of that particular company \nover a significant period of time in its ability to compete with other \ncompanies.\n  UPS, for example, certain parts of it deal with the Railroad Act with \nregard to its air carrier provisions. Those provisions that apply to \ntrucking deal with the National Labor Relations Act. They have a \ndivision. They have been able to make that kind of adjustment. But not \nFederal Express. They want to be able to have the legislation of the \nRailway Act to apply to the trucking industry. That has a special \nsignificance at the present time that will effectively legislate the \noutcome of a particular labor difference.\n  We here in the Senate ought to be about passing this FAA bill. This \nFAA bill is enormously important for the airlines, the communities all \nacross this country. I heard great eloquence earlier today about the \nimportance of this legislation in terms of smaller rural communities. I \nam in strong support of it.\n  None of us who support the position which I have outlined, which is \neffectively to strike this language and send the whole FAA \nauthorization over to the House--there is every indication they would \nbe willing to accept it. There was a relatively close vote over in the \nHouse of Representatives on this particular item. The House narrowly \naccepted the technical changes, the alleged technical changes, which \nhave been included here.\n  But I do not know why we should be delaying airline safety for a \nspecial-interest provision. We ought to pass the airline safety \nprovisions and get them down to the White House and get the President \nto sign those provisions, rather than taking the time of the Senate to \nskew the legislation to a particular outcome with regard to a labor\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\ndispute, and that is what is happening here.\n  We are asked about whether we are prepared to hold this legislation \nup. The fact of the matter is this FAA legislation could pass as far as \nI am concerned immediately with unanimous consent this afternoon, right \nnow.\n  Federal Express is the one that is holding this up. They are the ones \nthat are holding this up. We will have a chance to get into that in \ngreater detail over these next few days to see whether they are \njustified in that particular provision. I do not believe they are \njustified in it.\n  The effective impact, Mr. President, is, as we know, that if it is \ndefined that this particular group, those who drive trucks, are going \nto be defined as being air carriers--which is effectively what they \nwant to be able to try to do because air carriers have the requirements \nof having a national board or a national group in order to be able to \nbargain collectively, because of the definition of ``air carrier.'' But \nwe have not done that with regard to the trucking industry.\n  We have not done that with regard to the trucking industry. Now, \nFederal Express wants to have that same application for local trucking \ncompanies, and the local truck companies say, ``Let us bargain. Let us \nbecome a union. Let us make a judgment decision whether we favor to \nbecome a union or not and if we do, let us be able to bargain \ncollectively.'' Federal Express says, ``No, you have to have a national \norganization. You truckers that are there in small towns have to be \nable to get the people in the Far West, every community in this country \nthat is served by Federal Express, get every local trucking driver and \nget a national organization or a national board.'' That is what Federal \nExpress wants to be able to do.\n  Now, that is such a convoluted interpretation of what the history and \nthe interpretation of either the Railway Act or the National Labor \nRelations Act is as to be stunning. And they want to do it on this \nlegislation. They are not even prepared to let it go to the committee \nand have hearings and hear about it. No, they want it on this \nlegislation, and they want to do it for this one company, for this one \ncompany.\n  So, Mr. President, we are asked to just roll over. That is the \neffect. This idea that it is just an oversight, as I mentioned earlier, \nI think we ought to not look just at what the proponents are trying to \nsuggest, but for the analysis done by the Congressional Research \nService that has reviewed the history. There will be those that will \nsay this is not really affecting workers' rights. Of course it does. It \naffects a particular situation that is taking place today in \nPennsylvania that is under review in litigation today. Are we prepared \nto say, ``Let the litigation come to end?'' No, no, we are not. We are \nprepared to impose, we are prepared to impose a legislative answer on \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent to continue now for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11854-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11856-S11857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I just returned to the city a short time \nago, and I am sorry I did not hear the arguments earlier today relative \nto the FAA authorization bill, nor did I have an opportunity to hear my \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts and all of his comments, but \nI was interested as I walked in to hear him talk about safety.\n  Mr. President, there is a special interest. My colleague was talking \nabout a special interest. There is a special interest that I would like \nto represent that is best delineated by none other than Mark Twain. \nMark Twain said, ``Truth is such a precious thing it should be used \nvery sparingly.'' I represent that special interest of truth on this \nparticular matter, and the facts will sustain it.\n  What happens is we had the ICC Termination Act last year, and in the \nengrossing, the final drafting up of the document for the President's \nsignature, everyone had gone. There was just staff there checking. Here \nis a case of the railway express being sent to the lawyer at ICC who \nsaid, ``I think you can just leave that out.'' The two little words \n``express carrier'' were deleted from the ICC Termination Act.\n  However, there is no question, no one knows of this. I challenge the \nSenator from Massachusetts who feels so strongly and wants to tell us \nabout cases he can read to the Members, I challenge the Senator to \npoint to me, the Senator point to me, the House Member, who said I \nwanted to make sure I introduced it, or I brought it up or I discussed \nit.\n\n  The reason I emphasize that, because my colleague now talks about \njamming, and at the last minute changing and whatever it is. What the \nSenator from South Carolina wants to do is correct that jamming, if \nthat is what it was. He said it was intended. I have not seen the CRS \nopinion, but I will get it. That specifically is in contradiction to \nthe Termination Act.\n  I will read from the act of 1995, December 15, just last year, \nsection 10501 ``General Jurisdiction.'' ``The enactment of the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract coverage of \nemployees and employers by the Railway Labor Act.''\n  So, there is a manifest intent of the Congress. They were not \naffecting rights that now we are trying to grab and change around. \nHeavens above, since this institution, Federal Express is an air \ncarrier, has been, to the surprise of many, governed by the Railway \nLabor Act.\n  In fact, they had a hearing on the day he is talking about over in \nPhiladelphia and they have already ruled. They ruled November 22, 1995, \nthat Federal Express had taken the right position. They did not rely on \nthe express language in the ICC Act, but general law where they find \nthem both as an air carrier and as an express carrier. Everyone that \nhas practiced in this particular field will tell you that is the format \nof law. Some will contend, what is the matter if the law has not \nchanged? I am trying to change an ambiguity, but more than that, I am \ntrying my best to forestall an assault on the truth and the facts, an \nassault a bunch of Washington lawyers trying to take advantage of a \nmistake.\n  Teamsters--I keep hearing in the Halls, ``the Teamsters, the \nTeamsters, the Teamsters'' have the Senator from Massachusetts all \nballed up on this and he has to go to bat for them. I have more \nTeamsters than any kind of Federal Express, just with regular delivery \nservices, I imagine. We have $100 million United Parcel Service \nfacility there and the finest Teamster crowd you have ever seen. We \nhave them at Owens Corning and Mack Truck, and otherwise they have been \nvery supportive of this Senator. They have not told me of a conflict. \nAnother Senator earlier today said just exactly that.\n  The idea that we are coming here at the last minute--what happened \nafter that, the mistake was determined at the end of February or the \nbeginning of March over on the House side. When they learned that, Mr. \nPresident, they put in a measure which was blocked. I was asked--\nbecause I am the ranking member of the particular committee with the \nICC, as the distinguished Presiding Officer knows--``Well, it happened \non your watch; do you mind correcting this mistake,'' and I say, ``Not \nat all.''\n  I presented it in the Appropriations Committee we had an 11-11 vote, \nnot 10-10. I did not have the proxies or we would have passed it, and \nthe mistake would have been corrected. I did not bother with it. I \nthought everybody would want to correct an innocent mistake.\n  Come now, Mr. President, with the idea we are trying to jam or hold \nup safety legislation or the FAA bill, or this is not the place for it, \nand everything else at the last minute is totally out of the whole \ncloth. They know differently. They are playing their political \nstrength.\n\n  I do not know that Federal Express has got much political clout \nbecause they are not in South Carolina, and I am not that familiar with \nthem, but I do know that I am not only keenly interested in the truth \nbut I am interested in the operation. I might as well plead guilty on \nthis score because, Mr. President, 10 years ago when I was trying to \nfind hay for the farmers and\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\ntheir herds down in South Carolina I finally located some up in \nMassachusetts. I called over to the White House, as other Senators were \ncalling, and the White House said, ``Senator, there is no hay for \nyou.'' ``There is no plane for you.'' I said, ``Come on, Senator so and \nso.'' ``You do not understand, Senator, there is no plane for you.''\n  I said heavens above, I commented in the cloakroom to a few of my \ncolleagues, that was a heck of a note. I had the hay. I had the cattle \nthat were starving and the farmers that were ready. But the phone rang \nand there was a fellow named Freddy Smith from Federal Express. He had \nheard about it and we called, and the next thing you know, he had two \nplanes, Federal Express planes, bring it down one Sunday.\n  I had my commission of labor--the 4-H Club, and all of us there, my \nwife and myself--and we unloaded the hay all Sunday morning and \nafternoon. I said, ``I will never forget that fellow.'' So when they \ntold me about the innocent mistake and told me it involved Freddy \nSmith, I got a very, very strong feeling about this.\n  I am not going to yield to the nonsense and mythical chicanery that \nis coming about here because they have the political clout. I know he \nsaid Republican. No Republican put this in. Democrat Hollings put it \nin. It was not sneaked in or jammed in. We discussed it several times. \nIt was an appropriate measure for it. In the conference, it was 8 to 2 \nin the vote to put it in. It passed by a strong vote on the House side.\n  He is trying to make it a partisan thing, which is unfortunate, \nbecause right is right and wrong is wrong. Here is the intent put in \nthere, and I am going to get the decisions made because I have been \ncalled over now. I didn't think we were going to have to try to cave in \nfor the truth around here. But right this minute as they talk about \nthat case, the mediation board back in November 1995 ruled against \nthem. It isn't trying to try a new practice. If you can get a choke \npoint in one little town and close down a whole thing, you have no \nexpress service. And in the interest of express service, that is what \nis intended by the Congress. We are not trying to get anything new. We \nare trying to get something contained and maintained in the law that \nhas allowed this particular airline carrier to flourish and grow. There \nis nothing new about this. We are trying to get it back.\n  As stated in the statute itself--I emphasis by reading it the second \ntime--the enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither \nexpand nor contract coverage of employees and employers by the Railway \nLabor Act.\n  Now, who is trying to sneak in or jam or get something changed? If it \nis Hollings, he is trying to get it for the truth. He is trying to get \nback to the facts. He is not trying to get an advantage or \ndisadvantage. He is trying to get back to the intent of Congress.\n  We were there. The Senator from Massachusetts is not on that \ncommittee. He is not on that conference. But he talks like now we are \njamming it, and everything else of that kind. I am not going to let \nthat rat-a-tat go by on this floor. I have got good time here. I know \nabout the FAA. It is on my committee. I can tell you that right now. \nThe FAA has not only its grants given to the airports, it has its trust \nfunds to operate in a certain measure the airports. It has its trust \nfunds for the safety devices and otherwise in there.\n  So I can tell you, it is not done for one company, and we have to \nhave hearings. Come on, that ought to be ashes in their mouths. Have \nhearings? When did they have hearings to delete? Who called the \nhearings? Name the Senator. Name the House Member. Name the committee. \nThey have the unmitigated gall to come here and act like it is orderly \nprocedure; now let us get hearings when they have done the sneaking and \nthey have done the jamming. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11856-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11857-S11858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I defer to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. If the Senator will withhold for a moment, we want to \nget a unanimous consent so we can adopt the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to my opportunity to be recognized by the Chair. I \nwould be happy to withhold for a moment while the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member discuss it.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the majority leader and the minority \nleader have worked out a unanimous-consent agreement.\n  The ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and \nI have gone over this. And we also concur.\n  So, at this time, Mr. President, with Senator Byrd's presence on the \nfloor, I would like to propound the unanimous-consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that final passage of H.R. 4278, the omnibus \nappropriations legislation, occur no later than 6 p.m today, with the \ntime between now and 6 p.m. equally divided between the two leaders, or \ntheir designees; and, further, that no amendments, motions, or points \nof order be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am \nwondering if I could slightly amend to allow this Senator no more than \n5 or 6 minutes to speak on the matter that I was recognized for before \nthe request occurred.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield the floor for that purpose.\n  I would like to get the agreement first.\n  Mr. COATS. But, as stipulated, it would preclude my opportunity to do \nthat. I am just wondering if the Senator would amend his unanimous-\nconsent request so that this Senator, who had been recognized before \nthe unanimous-consent request, would be allowed to speak as if in \nmorning business for up to 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Senator \nwill have no trouble getting time from his leader. The time is equally \ndivided between the two leaders.\n  Mr. COATS. That would be acceptable to this Senator. I am not \nspeaking on the continuing resolution. So I will speak as if in morning \nbusiness. I want to make sure that I have the opportunity to get that \ntime.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. I reserved the right to object.\n  Was this other matter resolved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am sorry.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was the matter resolved to the satisfaction of the Senator \nfrom Indiana?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. We do not want to cut out the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I want to make sure I have the opportunity to speak.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I can assure the Senator from Indiana, as we have been \nspeaking as if in morning business, with the colloquy that was just \ngoing on which the Senator from Indiana would like to engage in, I will \nhave no objections to whatever parliamentary request he has to make in \norder to speak.\n  Mr. COATS. That is more than acceptable to this Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object ----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe that the minority leader will give me 5 \nminutes. But it is not on this related matter of the continuing \nresolution. It is from the minority leader's time. I wanted to have a \ncontinuing discussion on that measure. I need maybe 4 minutes or 5 \nminutes sometime.\n  So I would be glad to do whatever. The measure which they are \nmanaging is of the utmost importance. I wanted to get 5 minutes just to \nrespond quickly to the matter. So I am glad to do it in whatever way \nthe two leaders want to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the body ready to put the question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope maybe that--reserving the right to \nobject--out of that time we are going to\n\n[[Page S11858]]\n\nhave the leader to be designated to have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope that the distinguished Senator will include that in \nhis request.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Could I include the same as I did for the Senator from \nIndiana?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized to \nmake whatever motions necessary to get the 5 minutes after we get this \napproved.\n  I would have no objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I understand the Senator wishes to have his 5 minutes on \nthe continuing resolution?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, just on the earlier matter being discussed. I do not \nwant to interrupt the two chairmen on this very, very important matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the vote on H.R. 4278, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nadoption of the DOD appropriations conference report, all without \nfurther action, and that all points of order be waived.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not \nobject, I very much advocate both of these requests. I did so in the \nconference earlier today, conference among Democrats. I feel that there \nshould not be any amendments to the continuing resolution. I am not \nsatisfied with everything that is in the resolution, but I do think the \ntime has come to adopt the resolution without a great deal of debate \nthis afternoon and without amendments because amendments would simply \nmean that the continuing resolution would go to conference, and I \npresume that the leader would probably take that continuing resolution \ndown and call up the conference report, which is not amendable and \ntherefore not conferenceable.\n\n  So it seems to me that the integrity of the Senate, the integrity of \nthe legislative process within the Senate, the integrity of the \nSenate's right to amend and right to debate are all protected here, and \nthat is what I am most interested in. We could offer amendments to the \ncontinuing resolution if we wanted. Consequently, any Senator could \nhave objected to the request. We could debate at some length. I am sure \nthat we Democrats do not want to be accused of shutting the Government \ndown.\n  Therefore, it seems to me in the interest of all concerned--and as I \nsay, in full view of the fact that the integrity of the process and \nintegrity of the Senate's right to debate an amendment and amend have \nbeen fully protected--I have no objection, and I congratulate the \nSenator from Oregon and I also congratulate both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection? The Chair hears none, \nand it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of \nthe time allocated to Senator Lott, 10 minutes be allocated to Senator \nMcCain.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, does the \ndistinguished Senator wish to include Mr. Coats in that request? And I \nwill ask that the Senator from Massachusetts be included.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I would be very happy to incorporate 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Would the Senator like to include 5 minutes for the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to have Mr. Kennedy accorded 5 minutes in the \nrequest, from the time under the control of the minority leader.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That would be then 10 minutes for Senator McCain, 5 \nminutes for Senator Kennedy, and 5 minutes for Senator Coats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I do not \nwant to object--I do not think that I am going to ask to speak for 5 \nminutes, but at least if I could reserve 5 minutes in this process for \nmyself I would appreciate very much the distinguished manager allowing \nme to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Include 5 minutes to come out of the time under the control \nof the minority leader.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is that all right, 5 minutes also here for the Senator \nfrom South Carolina?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Another 5 minutes for Senator Pryor and 5 minutes for \nSenator Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection? The Chair hears none, \nand it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators and particularly those \nwho have been so courteous as to yield allowing this request to be \ngranted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would actually like to speak briefly on a \nnonrelated CR matter or a nonrelated FAA matter. This is something that \nI was fully of the understanding would be cleared on both sides and \nbecome law after it was sent to the President in final closing action \nof the Congress. I have sponsored a bill along with Representative Horn \nfrom the House designed to eliminate a very dubious double standard \nthat remains in the application of our civil rights and labor laws. \nThat double standard was eliminated relative to this body in this \nCongress by application of the civil rights and labor laws which we had \npreviously excluded ourselves from, that application now applicable to \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  For too long and to the general disgust of the American people, in \nthe laws which we passed requiring them to comply with the civil rights \nlaws of the land and the labor standards of the land, we crafted an \nexemption for the Government. We said it is good enough for you but not \nfor us. You comply with it subject to both civil and criminal \npenalties, but we are going to exempt ourselves.\n  I am proud that under Republican leadership in this Congress, we \nfinally remedied that inequity that existed for so many years because \nnow that same list of laws which applies to every American worker and \nevery American under the civil rights laws and under the labor laws of \nthis country now applies to us. The theory here is that if we have to \nbe subject to those same requirements, perhaps we will be a little more \ncareful before we impose egregious regulations on the American people.\n  I remember attending a closed meeting of Senators while we were \ndebating this, and a Senator walked in and said, ``You mean we are \ngoing to have to live by this? It is impossible. Our office cannot \ncomply with the OSHA laws. Our office cannot comply with all these fair \nlabor standard laws. We cannot do this.'' We said, ``Well, now you know \nwhat the American people are complaining about. They are saying they \ncannot do it either. Sometimes they even conflict with each other. And \nmaybe if we feel the pain ourselves, then we will be a little more \ncareful when we impose that pain on others.''\n\n  What I have attempted to do, along with Representative Horn, is \nsimply apply this same standard to the White House. Today, the only \nexempted entity in America is the White House. The White House does not \nhave to comply with the laws that the Congress now complies with and \nevery other American complies with.\n  I was encouraged because the White House sent us a statement of \nadministration policy which said that they support the bill offered by \nRepresentative Horn and myself, and I read this statement of \nadministration policy which says, ``We support H.R. 3452 that would \napply civil rights and workplace laws to the Executive Office of the \nWhite House.''\n  They, however, had a couple problems with that. They did not want an \ninspector general because they thought it raised constitutional issues, \nand they did not want equitable relief too, which really leaves a \ndouble standard in place, but the only way we could get this through \nbefore the conclusion of this Congress was to remove those. I did not \nwant to remove them. Representative Horn did not want to remove them. \nBut we were assured by the\n\n[[Page S11859]]\n\nWhite House that if we could remove these, then they would be willing \nto accept this provision.\n  Now we find objections in the last day perhaps of the Congress. We \nfind roadblocks. We find people stonewalling this, hoping the clock \nwill run out so it is not passed. Talk about a double standard. Talk \nabout a stonewalling so that the White House does not have to comply \nwith all the rest of us. We are getting resistance. We are getting \nresistance from individuals who are trying to have it both ways. ``Oh, \nyes, these ought to apply to the White House.'' The White House is \nsaying, ``Oh, yes, they should apply to us,'' whether it is the Family \nand Medical Leave Act, OSHA regulation, Fair Labor Standards Act. They \nsaid, ``Oh, well, we comply with it in policy.''\n  That is what we were saying around here: ``Oh, we comply with it in \npolicy. We don't need to comply by legal means.''\n  Obviously, that is not true, and if we are going to apply that \nstandard we ought to apply it to the American public as well. So if we \nare going to have a law, the law ought to apply equally to everybody in \nthe land. It ought to apply to Congress, it ought to apply to the \npublic, and it ought to apply to the White House. Everybody has now \ncomplied except the White House. On the one hand, they are saying, yes, \nwe support this effort if you will make these changes. We made the \nchanges reluctantly in order to get it through. And now they have \napparently sent instructions or someone has decided that they are going \nto protect the White House by letting the clock run out and not let us \npass this.\n  It passed the House 410 to 5. There were only 5 members who objected \nto this, and that is the tougher language they said they needed revised \nor weakened in order for them to support it. Reluctantly, \nRepresentative Horn and I met and agreed to drop that tougher language \nthat had passed 410 to 5--only 5 opponents.\n  So it is clearly a bipartisan bill. We dropped that language and have \nnow presented it, and we were totally under the assumption that this \nwas absolutely cleared by everybody. If we drop the one piece of \nlanguage that the White House objected to, that cleared the House by \n410 to 5, then surely there would not be a problem over here. But, yet, \nwe are getting all kinds of resistance back, in terms of passing this \nhere in the last days.\n\n  I do not understand why we are in this situation, but--well, maybe I \ndo understand. It was James Madison who wrote a long time ago, that \n``an effective control against oppressive measures by the Federal \nGovernment on the people is that Government leaders can make no law \nwhich will not have its full operation on themselves and their friends \nas well as on the great mass of society.''\n  In other words, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. \nWhat is good for the public, that we impose on them, ought to be good \nfor us. We faced up to that fact. We stepped up to the bar with that. I \nwas proud, under the leadership of Republicans, we imposed that on the \nCongress. Now we have to live by it. All we are trying to do now is \nextend it to the White House. They say they want it, yet efforts are \nbeing made to not allow it to go through.\n  Mr. President, I hope as we deal with these issues here at the last, \nwaning moments of Congress, we will take our responsibilities \nseriously, and whether it is FAA or public lands or White House \naccountability, we will deal with this before this Congress adjourns.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept what the White House says it wants to \naccept, what the House in a total bipartisan fashion has accepted, and \neven a weakened version here in the Senate, that applies to the White \nHouse, is ready for passage if we can lift the restrictions against it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think I am entitled to 5 minutes. I \nyield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the discussion of the FAA and the special \ninterest provisions that were included in the conference, I want to \njust point out there are some who have suggested this was really \ntechnical and it was not really a big deal. I hope our Members will \nreview the House debate on it. The House of Representatives voted for \nfinal FAA reauthorization 219 to 198; 30 Republicans voted no.\n  It is useful for Members to have some opportunity to review that \ndebate. Here Mr. Lipinski points out, in fact, talking about the \nconference, ``In fact, there were no discussions between the conferees \nin regard to this particular provision until the absolute end of the \nconference when everything else was decided. A Senator brought forth a \nprovision that prevailed.'' I understand that. But just because it \nprevailed in conference among 10 members, it should not mean that this \nHouse has to accept it.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the debate, Mr. Oberstar pointed out,\n\n       I thank the gentleman for yielding time. Let me just get \n     the record straight on this express issue. The reason for \n     ending the ICC investigation and oversight of express \n     carriers was the concept of express carriers had become \n     obsolete. The ICC staff itself recommended the elimination of \n     express carrier status. It was not an oversight, it was not \n     something someone neglected to do, something that was not \n     negotiated in drafting, it was not a drafting error. It was \n     done for good reason. The last express carrier went out of \n     business in the mid-1970's.\n\n  So, since it was obsolete, there were no hearings. If you are going \nto expand the definition of ``express carrier'' to include Federal \nExpress, and amend effectively the National Labor Relations Act and the \nRailroad Act, you ought to have some kind of hearings to find out what \nthe impact is going to be. That is basically what we are talking about \nhere, is changing and expanding.\n\n  That is the same conclusion that these Members had, with what the CRS \nhad. The ICC staff recommended it. Now we are being asked to put in \nthese special kinds of provisions.\n  The House of Representatives, in a very close vote, for some of the \nreasons I have mentioned here--I will have more of a chance to bring in \nsome of the excellent comments. We do not have the time this afternoon, \nbut I understand we will have some time later on, to be able to get \ninto this in greater detail. We will see why this is special \nlegislation. It is special legislation for a special company. Let us \nmake no mistake about it.\n  Federal Express wants to have a requirement that every truck driver \nin this country has to be a part of a national group in order to be \nable to be considered whether they can bargain with the company. A \ntruck driver is a truck driver. The UPS has recognized the truck \ndrivers for UPS are under the National Labor Relations Board. Why we \nought to write special legislation in the last hour on the FAA \nconference report, that has so many important matters, including \naviation safety, and that ought to be held hostage for a special \nprovision for a special company is, I think, untenable.\n  But if that is the way it has to be, that is the way it has to be.\n  Mr. President, I understand there has to be additional debate on the \nunderlying matter of the continuing resolution, so we will wait our \ntime, and I yield what time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes, just like \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, ``On balance,'' I am reading:\n\n       . . . the amendment would appear to confuse rather than \n     clarify the question of Railway Labor Act coverage. On the \n     one hand, it could be argued that the amendment would have no \n     effect. Since neither Federal Express nor any other employer \n     was certified as an express company, subject to title 49, on \n     December 31, 1995, it would follow that no employer could \n     come under the coverage of the proposed amendment.\n\n  That is an argument, if I were the lawyer for Federal Express, I \nwould be delighted to make. But it shows you how totally confused, not \nthe decision language makes it, but how confused this silly lawyer is \nover there. Because the ICC does not give an air carrier \ncertification--period. They never gave one to Federal Express. He does \nnot seem to understand that.\n  However, let us go to the basic law.\n  I read:\n\n\n[[Page S11860]]\n\n\n       The Railway Labor Act was adopted in 1926 to provide for \n     speedy administrative resolution of labor-management \n     disputes. Section 1 of the RLA describes employers who are \n     subject to the act's regulations: The term ``carrier'' \n     includes any express company, sleeping car company, carrier \n     by railroad subject to the Interstate Commerce Act.\n\n  So, they found, then, that it was an express carrier, and then in \n1936, I am reading also from the finding:\n\n       The RLA was amended to include air carriers within its \n     regulatory ambit.\n\n  That is exactly what was reaffirmed here in 1993:\n\n       Federal Express Corporation has been found to be a common \n     carrier as defined under 45 U.S.C. 151, 1st, and section \n     1(e)(1) of the Act.\n\n  Now they have been found both ways. We are not trying to start \nanything new.\n  For 25, 30 years now this thing has been governing all the cases, \nbringing it right up to date with respect to that Philadelphia case. \nThere is no question that the National Mediation Board ruled, they \nruled with respect to the Railway Labor Act. No reference was relayed \non with respect to express language.\n  On November 22--and, procedurally, the NLRB is now making a final \nruling there. So this is not any last-minute thing by Mr. Lipinski, \nsaying it was brought up at the last minute. He was prepared. He said, \n``This will kill the bill. We will filibuster it,'' and everything \nelse. They have political clout. But I think truth ought to have some \npolitical clout.\n  When an honest mistake is made, when no Senator and no Congressman \never even suggested it, now, in the aura of dignity, they say, \n``Hearings, hearings, where are the hearings?'' Well, where in the \nworld were the hearings that brought about this deletion that we are \ntrying to correct? That is exactly the point. They did not have \nhearings. No one understood it.

Mr. President, this, we hope, will be the last day of \nthis Congress, and I would be remiss if I did not have some remarks \nabout some of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, who are \nretiring.\n  The first one I would like to mention is my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Howell Heflin. He came to the Senate, when I came to the House, \nin January 1979. He had a distinguished record as a lawyer and then as \nchief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. He was very involved in the \nreform of our judicial system in Alabama.\n  In the Senate, he has served with distinction and honor. He chaired \nthe Ethics Committee for a long time. He was also very active, and has \nbeen throughout his career, as a member of the Judiciary Committee and \nas a member of the Agriculture Committee.\n  But there are a number of other colleagues, other than Senator \nHeflin, whom we will miss.\n  Senator Simpson of Wyoming, former whip, our assistant minority \nleader, a man of untold ability, wit, and intelligence.\n  Senator Simon of Illinois, a man of, I believe, unquestioned \nintegrity.\n  Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, who was on the floor just a few \nmoments ago, a former Congressman, former Governor of Arkansas, and now \nending his third term as a Member of the U.S. Senate where he, too, has \ndistinguished himself.\n  Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, one of our senior Senators, \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, very active for many, many \nyears in the area of foreign relations and international relations. He \nalso has made his mark in the field of education. We all know about the \nPell grants and other things that he has spearheaded in America.\n  My colleague Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. We will certainly miss \nSenator Nunn, because I always thought he brought a very reasoned \nposition to foreign relations and to the Armed Services that we all \ndeal with from time to time. I thought he was an outstanding--and this \ngoes without saying--chairman of the Armed Services Committee where I \nhad the privilege to serve with him on that committee for 8 years.\n  Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican from Kansas, currently \nthe chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, a distinguished \nSenator in her own right. We will certainly miss her. Look at just her \nrecent leadership, working with the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, in the insurance field in which we have made tremendous \nreforms, thanks to her.\n  Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, former chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. We are certainly going to miss him. He \nhas had a distinguished career here, 24 years in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the current chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee that I now serve on. He has served with untold \ndistinction, too, on that committee and has been involved in recent \ndays and nights in the negotiations with the White House on this budget \nresolution that we are getting ready to deal with in just a few hours.\n  Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, a former Governor of Nebraska, three-\nterm Senator from Nebraska. I had the privilege of serving with him on \nthe Armed Services Committee where he, too, served with honor and \ndistinction.\n  Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican from Maine, a former \noutstanding Member of the U.S. House of Representatives before he was \nelected to the Senate. This is someone we will miss, not only his wit, \nhis intelligence, his thoughtfulness, but also his writing ability at \ntimes helps us all.\n  Senator Hank Brown, a Republican from Colorado. I had the honor to \nserve with him in the U.S. House of Representatives. What has saddened \nme, along with a lot of others, is, he will leave this body with such a \nbright and promising career after only 6 years.\n  Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, 18 years in the Senate, who has \nspent days and nights and weeks and months up here, I think not in \nvain, most of the time dealing with a commonsense income tax program \nfor all Americans.\n  Mr. President, we will miss all these people because individually and \ncollectively they have added a lot to this body. I wish them well in \ntheir future endeavors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11860-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11860-S11864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Age Discrimination\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it will take weeks before we find out \neverything that has been included in the omnibus appropriations bill, \nbut already we know it contains provisions that were not included in \nthe appropriations bills of either body.\n  One of these provisions is section 119 of the Department of Defense \nAppropriations conference report, which contains amendments to the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act.\n  This section would reinstate and substantially broaden a temporary \nexemption from the provisions of the ADEA given to public safety \ndepartments from 1986 through 1993.\n  Proponents of this language argue, and would probably like to \nbelieve, that this section does not amount to codification of \ndiscrimination. But here's how Webster's defines discrimination:\n  ``To make a difference in treatment or favor on a class or \ncategorical basis in disregard of individual merit.''\n  That is a pretty clear statement. It is also a pretty good summary of \nthe section in question. It says, in essence, that no one who is older \nthan 55 can effectively serve as a police officer or firefighter, \nregardless of whether they are fit or unfit.\n\n[[Page S11861]]\n\n  But you don't need to take my word for it, and you don't need to take \nWebster's. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, this country's \npreeminent civil rights organization, opposes this legislation as \ndiscriminatory.\n  Let me read from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights' letter on \nthe bill that formed the basis of section 119:\n\n       This bill sanctions--indeed encourages--state and local \n     governments to discriminate against their older workers. . . \n     . Such conduct, which denies an individual a job based upon \n     stereotypical and unproven assumptions about a class of \n     workers, is precisely what Congress has prohibited in federal \n     laws protecting employees' civil rights, e.g., Title VII of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and other \n     statutes.\n\n  This is the same view held by the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, which is charged with enforcing the ADEA. In its comment on \nthis bill in an earlier Congress, the EEOC stated that:\n\n       ``If signed into law, [the bill] would undercut years of \n     EEOC litigation in which we routinely challenged the use of \n     arbitrary age limitations by police and fire departments. \n     Further, the proposed amendment to permit state and local \n     governments to require the retirement of firefighters and law \n     enforcement officers as early as age 55 is inconsistent with \n     a substantial body of case law under the ADEA that prohibited \n     mandatory retirement of law enforcement officers and \n     firefighters on the basis of an arbitrary age cut-off.\n  The EEOC is of course not the final word in adjudicating these \nmatters. But the courts have generally agreed. In fact, the Supreme \nCourt in 1985 rejected a mandatory retirement age for firefighters in \nthe case Johnson versus Baltimore because Baltimore had failed to \nestablish age as a bona fide occupational qualification, or BFOQ.\n  This brings up the point that employers can use a mandatory \nretirement age under the law today if they can prove it is a BFOQ, that \nis, the employer is compelled to rely upon age because all or \nsubstantially all of the class would be unable to perform the work \nsafely or because it is highly impractical to deal with employees \nindividually.\n  So we are left with two possibilities. Either public employers can \nprove age is a necessary proxy under the law and the Supreme Court \nprecedents, in which case this bill is unnecessary, or they cannot, in \nwhich case the argument for this bill, that age is a necessary proxy, \nis unfounded.\n  Civil rights are messy. Look at all the voting rights cases still \nbeing played out across the country today, some 6 years after the last \ncensus. The EEOC and the courts are swamped with cases of all kinds.\n  From time to time there has been debate on the exact standards we \nshould use in judging these cases, or what kind of damages should be \navailable to plaintiffs.\n  But today marks the first time in my two decades in Congress that we \nhave stood on the verge of turning back the clock and rolling back \ncivil rights protections for an entire class of individuals.\n  Yes, individuals. Because our civil rights laws are not supposed to \nbe about codifying group characteristics but about preserving \nindividual liberties. Since Asian-Americans have a lesser risk of heart \nattacks than whites or blacks, should they be given preference in \nhiring as police or firefighters? Since women have a lower risk than \nmen, should they be preferred?\n  Of course not, since doing so would be rank discrimination. But by \nwhat leap of logic can we conclude that applying this same approach to \nage is not discriminatory? Of course there is none.\n  Proponents of this bill claim that they don't want to discriminate, \nbut that, in effect, the devil makes them do it. The devil in this case \nis allegedly a lack of tests that can determine individual fitness for \nduty.\n  That would be a powerful and attractive argument but for one fact. It \nisn't true.\n  This bill itself speaks to why it is not true. Unlike the temporary \nexemption enacted in 1986, which merely grand fathered the retirement \npolicies in effect 3 years earlier, this bill would permit any police \nor fire department in the country to put in place mandatory retirement, \nwhether or not it has even had such a policy over the last decade.\n  The fact is, a lot of departments have not relied on mandatory \nretirement. Researchers from the EEOC study sent out a survey to over \n400 departments across the country. It was not a scientific sample, but \ndid produce a wide cross-section of respondents. Of the hundreds of \ndepartments that responded, 55 percent had maximum age entry limits or \nforced retirement policies, but more importantly, 45 percent did not. \nSome of these departments face challenges every bit as rigorous as any \nother. The Los Angeles County Fire Department, for example, does not \nhave a mandatory retirement age, but relies on fitness testing to \ndetermine whether individuals can still do the work. That testing has \nsurvived judicial scrutiny and can be replicated or modified and put in \nplace in every other city in the country. Reno, NV, a smaller city, has \nmade the transition and is quite happy with it. Its system is based on \nthe testing put together by the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research, \nthe same company that designed testing for Boston, New York, and \njurisdictions across the country. The Massachusetts Police Association, \nwith 17,000 members, also supports performance based retirement, as \ndoes the Police Executives Research Forum.\n  The fact that this testing exists should not come as a great shock. \nTesting is used to screen applicants in virtually every department in \nthe country. It is used widely to certify individuals as ready for \nreturn from disability. And as I have mentioned, it is used to certify \ncontinued fitness for duty as well. It is simply untrue that testing \ndoes not exist.\n  This testing has both costs as well as benefits. Obviously setting up \nsuch a system, and requiring periodic screening, takes some time and \nmoney. And it cannot be easy to confront a longtime colleague with the \nnews that he is no longer fit to serve.\n  But these costs are minimal compared to the benefits of avoiding a \npatently discriminatory approach. And if the real purpose behind this \nlegislation were the safety of officers and the public, there is little \ndoubt we should engage in health screening rather than arbitrary \nretirement.\n  Why? Well, let's look at the facts. Proponents of this legislation \nmake a lot of arguments about the potential for catastrophic health \naccidents amongst older firefighters or police. That sounds reasonable, \nas we know firefighters and police work in very hazardous environments.\n  But as it turns out, the rate of fatal injuries is as much as 6 times \ngreater in industries such as logging, fishing and construction. A \ntaxicab driver is twice as likely to be killed on the job as a \nfirefighter. Yet all those industries operate without mandatory \nretirement.\n  Firefighting is a high risk occupation, with a fatality rate 4 times \nthe national average. But what is the best way to combat this risk?\n  In 1994, the last year for which data are available, there were 42 \ndeaths for all reasons among career firefighters, while the total \nnumber of these paid, permanent positions was 265,000. Thus, the \ntotal death rate for all reasons was .0001, or 1/100 of 1 per cent. Of \nthese deaths, a little more than half, or 26, were at the fire scene.\n\n  Most of the deaths have nothing to do with this debate. They are the \nresult of suffocation or trauma, accidents that happen without regard \nto age. At the same time, there were 13 heart attacks, and 1 stroke. \nBut contrary to the claims of proponents of this bill, none of these \nheart attacks occurred in firefighters over the age of 60, and the \nincidence for firefighters in the age 56 to 60 cohort was the same as \nin the 31 to 35 age cohort. In fact, the heart attacks were spread \nfairly evenly over all age cohorts.\n  Out of the thousands of firefighters over the age of 55, there were \ntwo deaths due to heart attack. This is less than the death rate for \nheart disease in the population as a whole, which is 357 per 100,000 \nfor Americans aged 55 to 64.\n  But most importantly, most of the heart attacks among firefighters \noccurred in people with known heart conditions. According to the \nNational Fire Protection Association, which gathered and studied the \ndata:\n\n       . . . a large proportion of the heart attack victims \n     (approximately 8 of 13 paid firefighters) were known to have \n     had heart conditions that should have precluded them from \n     engaging in active firefighting duties.\n\n\n[[Page S11862]]\n\n\n  If this bill were designed to improve public and occupational safety, \nit would attack the biggest problem, people with heart conditions that \ncontinue to fight fires. It does absolutely nothing to combat this \nproblem. In fact, it probably makes it worse.\n  Fire departments now lack the authority to rely on mandatory \nretirement as a bad proxy for fitness. If they are going to act \nresponsibly, they have instituted or will institute screening that \nshould prevent people with known heart conditions from staying on the \njob. Such screening could have prevented 60 percent of the firefighter \nheart attacks in the last year for which we have data.\n  This bill, on the other hand, would make matters worse. Those \ndepartments that now monitor health would lose a major reason for \nmaintaining their fitness programs, and other departments would have \nless reason to institute them.\n  This is exactly what happened in departments after the 1986 \namendments, and it will happen again if section 119 is adopted.\n  If we want to prevent heart attacks and strokes, the effective \navenues are not mysterious and do not include age discrimination. We \nshould set up fitness programs and attack known risk factors like \nsmoking and obesity and cardiovascular fitness.\n  We should reward individuals who maintain their fitness for duty \nrather sending them the message that it does not matter what kind of \nshape they are in, that they can just limp along until their mandatory \nretirement age.\n  I wish my colleagues could have heard the testimony we did in the \nLabor Committee from one of those individuals, Detective Bill Smith. \nDetective Smith is 55 going on 40. He weighs almost exactly what he did \nwhen he entered the Indiana State Police years ago, and when he \ntestified that he remains physically and mentally fit, there was not a \ndoubter in the audience.\n  Detective Smith is the State's senior hostage negotiator, and has \nyears of training and experience that we will lose if we pass this \nbill.\n  In fact, one of the witnesses on the other side of the debate made \nclear that he would be proud to serve with Detective Smith, and that he \ndidn't think that this legislation was about exceptional individuals \nsuch as the detective.\n  That is not an uncommon sentiment. But of course it goes to the very \nheart of this debate, whether we are interested in protecting the \nrights of those few officers who want to continue to work and are fit \nenough to do so.\n  Proponents of this legislation seem unconcerned about the individual \nrights at stake in this debate. Instead, they want to fire Detective \nSmith and thousands of other dedicated officers across the country in \nthe interest of administrative convenience.\n  But it gets worse. Since 1986, state and local police and fire \ndepartments knew that mandatory retirement would become unlawful at the \nend of 1993. Apparently some jurisdictions maintained mandatory \nretirement policies, because this bill would reach back and extinguish \nthe legal claims of individuals who were unlawfully fired over the past \n3 years.\n  This is an extraordinary step. Under the ADEA, an individual is \nentitled to recover double back wages where the violation is willful, \nwhich I should think would be the case here for anyone terminated after \nthe exemption expired.\n  Thus, we could be denying tens or even hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in back wages rightfully owed to individuals by jurisdictions \nthat have flouted the law over the past 3 years.\n  We struggled mightily with the issue of retroactivity when Congress \nconsidered the Civil Rights Restoration Act a few years ago. There, the \nissues were fairly subtle, the courts narrowly divided, the changes by \ndegree. Here, there is no subtlety whatsoever, there is no room for \ninterpretation. Mandatory retirement became illegal in January, 1994--\nperiod. For any of my Republican colleagues concerned about retroactive \ntaxation, this provision amounts to as much as a 200-percent \nretroactive tax on the wages due American workers.\n  And as for my Democratic colleagues, I would draw their attention to \nthe Senate Democratic Action Agenda they unveiled with much fanfare \nsome time ago. It promised action on three fronts: paycheck security, \nhealth security, and retirement security. Any of my colleagues who are \ntruly concerned about that agenda will oppose this legislation, because \nit represents a retreat on all three fronts. Paycheck security. This \nbill is a legislative pink slip for thousands of hard working, \ndedicated and able Americans. No security there.\n\n  Health security. Public police and fire departments have almost \nuniversal coverage. What kind of jobs 55-year-olds will land, if any, \nis anybody's guess. Health coverage goes from a sure thing to a roll of \nthe dice. Not much security there.\n  Retirement security. Detective Smith, if he could work a few more \nyears, would add more than $6,000 a year to his pension. He doesn't \nneed more laws from Washington to promote his security, he just needs \nus to let him do his job. Little security there.\n  As a footnote, one of the things the Democrats want to do is pass a \ntax deduction for education costs. That's great. One of the reasons \nDetective Smith wants to stay on the job is to help pay for his \ndaughter's college education.\n  Proponents of this legislation argue that Detective Smith is simply \nan unfortunate casualty for the greater good, collateral damage in the \nwords of the military.\n  But the tragedy is that the greater good does not require putting \nDetective Smith out on the street. The greatest good comes from \ntreating him as an individual, from strengthening our public safety \ndepartments through a rational rather than an expedient personnel \nprocess.\n  I think the adoption of this provision is shameful. Mandatory \nretirement is age discrimination. If public employers could not \nconvince the EEOC or the courts otherwise, they should not convince us.\n  But apparently they have. It is a sad day in the history of civil \nrights in this country. We have turned the clock backward.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL.\n  Mr. President, last Saturday afternoon, I joined some 15,000 of my \nfellow Rhode Islanders in a huge rally to welcome President Clinton to \nProvidence. It was in Providence that the President announced his \nsupport for the omnibus appropriations bill that will soon be \nconsidered by this body. And it was in Providence that we heard the \nbest news for education funding that we have heard in almost 2 years.\n  Approval of the legislation before us will increase Federal education \nfunding by more than 12 percent over last year. Because of the \nPresident's leadership and particularly because of his commitment to \neducation, this increase stands in stark contrast to the dire \npredictions of drastic cuts in education programs that marked the \nbeginning of this Congress. It is a dramatic and encouraging end to \nthis session of Congress.\n  Next year we will have the largest Pell grant in history. The maximum \ngrant will be $2,700, an increase of $230 in one year. The number of \nlow and middle income students receiving Pell grants will increase by \n150,000. And the total number of students receiving Pell grants next \nyear will reach 3.8 million.\n  We have also strengthened our commitment to education reform by \nincreasing appropriations for the Goals 2000 program by almost 29 \npercent and upping funds for professional development by more than 11 \npercent.\n  We have provided a 16 percent increase in funding for Safe and Drug \nFree Schools. Less than 2 years ago we were fighting to keep this \nprogram from suffering a 40 percent cut.\n  The title I program will be increased by some $470 million next year, \nand two-thirds of that increase will go to our most needy and deserving \nschools.\n  Mr. President, in area after area in education we have good news and \nsolid progress. This is an education budget we can cheer. It deserves \nour strong support.\n  We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to President Clinton and his \nadministration for the strong leadership they have shown on behalf of \neducation. And, we owe an equally enormous debt of gratitude to those \nfrom\n\n[[Page S11863]]\n\nthis body who played such an important part in helping fashion this \nagreement and bring forth such an encouraging education budget. In \nparticular, I personally want to thank Senator Hatfield, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Specter, and Senator Harkin for the vital role they have played \nin this dramatic achievement.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will act with dispatch in approving \nthis legislation\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I again express great appreciation for \nthe statement that was made by our friend and colleague, Senator Pell, \nwho reviewed for the Senate the various provisions in this agreement \nrelated to education. I think all of us are once again enormously \nimpressed, as I know the people that he represents are, by his \nextraordinary commitment to enhancing the quality of education for \nyoung people all across this country. He diminishes his own strength by \nnot mentioning his own very important participation and involvement \nover the period of recent years in maintaining a strong priority in \neducation which is really reflected in this budget.\n  As a member of that committee, I commend him for all he has done over \na very long and distinguished career in the area of education, and I \nthink his tireless desire to ensure that we have a bipartisan effort in \nthe area of education has been always a trademark of his leadership as \nwell. So I think all of us who will read the history of this discussion \nabout development of the continuing resolution know full well that in \nthe area of education he played a very significant and major role, and \nI know everybody in the Senate understands it and appreciates it.\n  Mr. President, exactly 2 years ago, the late Barbara Jordan, Chair of \nthe Commission on Immigration Reform, submitted to Congress a \ncomprehensive set of recommendations to address the illegal immigration \ncrisis in America. At that time, Barbara Jordan said, ``Our message is \nsimple. The United States must have a more credible immigration policy \nthat deters unlawful immigration while supporting our national interest \nin legal immigration.''\n  The bill that the Republican leadership tried to ram hastily through \nthe Congress was weak in addressing illegal immigration and reflected \nthe antiworker, antifamily, anti-immigrant, antirefugee, and anti-\nenvironment agenda of the Republican right wing and was an extreme \nRepublican assault on the American worker and on working families. It \ndid more harm to the country than good.\n  But after extraordinary negotiation last week involving the White \nHouse, the Republican leadership, key Members of Congress, those \nfeatures of the Republican bill that came out of their conference that \nassaulted legal immigrants and made it impossible for working Americans \nto reunite their families here are now gone. Gone, too, is the \nunacceptable Gallegly amendment which would have allowed States to \nexpel immigrant children from public schools and dump them on the \nstreets. This unwise amendment would do nothing to stem the tide of \nimmigration. It was vigorously opposed by police groups and educators \nbecause of the harm it would do to our communities. Congress is right \nto reject this provision.\n  Although the worst provisions in this bill on legal immigrants are \ngone, it is still not the hard-hitting crackdown on illegal immigration \nit ought to be. Republicans rejected our efforts to include strong \nprovisions to punish unscrupulous employers who hire illegal immigrant \nworkers and then exploit them with cheap labor and unsafe workplace \nconditions knowing they will not protest such conditions.\n  This bill winks at this shameful sweatshop practice. Americans will \ncontinue to lose their jobs as long as unscrupulous employers can get \naway with hiring and abusing illegal workers. Clearly, stronger \nlegislation is needed if we are serious about dealing effectively with \nillegal immigration. And I intend to renew this battle again next year.\n\n  In addition, the provisions in this bill related to refugees and due \nprocess of law represent an improvement over the recently enacted \nantiterrorism law. But they still do not go far enough in restoring \njudicial revue and giving persecuted refugees a fair opportunity to \nseek asylum in America.\n  Most of the credit for what is before us today as part of this \ncontinuing resolution goes to our respected friend and colleague, \nSenator Al Simpson. We will miss his able leadership, vision and \ncourage on the complex and challenging issues of immigration.\n  As I have said on many different occasions, immigration is not a \nhigh-profile issue in the State of Wyoming. They are not inundated with \nillegal immigration. There are important historical strains of legal \nmigration in Wyoming, but certainly it is not a State that is \nconfronted with these types of issues. But the fact that Senator \nSimpson over a very long and distinguished career in the Senate was \nwilling to take the time, make the effort and had the energy to master \nthe very complex policies that are affected by immigration and refugee \npolicies and asylum reflects great national service. He was always \nthere to make sure that no matter where the political winds were \nblowing, we kept our eye on the ball on matters of immigration, illegal \nimmigration, and refugees. He and I did not always agree, but we found \ncommon ground, and everyone on that committee always found that Senator \nSimpson was willing to listen and to find the broadest of coalitions in \nthe best interests of our country. And again the provisions that are \nincluded in this legislation to a great extent reflect the long effort \non his part to make sure that we were addressing these matters in a \nresponsible way.\n  I know there are provisions that were excluded that he would have \nfavored to have included but nonetheless I would like to think that the \nmore positive aspects of the provisions that we have included can be \ntraced in origin back over a long period of time to the work of Senator \nSimpson, the Jordan Commission, the Hesburgh Commission, and other \nefforts of the committee.\n  Senator Simpson took the Jordan Commission's recommendations, \nconducted extensive hearings on them in our subcommittee, visited each \nSenator individually to obtain their views on what needs to be done, \nand conducted a fair and open process of debate on the bill in the \nsubcommittee. When the full Judiciary Committee considered the bill \nlast spring, he and Senator Hatch gave all members a full opportunity \nto present their views. Over 150 amendments were debated over 8 days \nand all members of the committee feel that the result was a much better \nbill.\n  In a similar spirit of bipartisanship, the Senate debated the bill \nfor 2 weeks in April and May and after full and fair debate and votes \non numerous amendments the result was an outstanding tribute to the \nleadership of Senator Simpson. The bill passed 97 to 3, a remarkable \ncapstone to the commitment of this extraordinary Senator over almost 2 \ndecades to ensure that our immigrant heritage is carried forward. As a \nresult of his efforts, the Nation will look ahead to the next century \nbetter able to draw on the positive contributions of immigration to our \ncountry, while equipped with more effective tools to combat the \nunlawful immigration that is so harmful to our country.\n\n  The subsequent course of this legislation was less satisfactory for \nthose of us who care so deeply about preserving our immigrant heritage \nwhile cracking down on illegal immigration. After extraordinary \nbipartisanship in passing the legislation in both the House and Senate, \nDemocrats were suddenly shut out. Republicans sought to convert the \nlegislation into a partisan political document to aid the Dole \nPresidential campaign in California.\n  As a result, unusual steps were necessary to reinject bipartisanship \nin this important legislation. The events of the past few days and the \nagreement achieved early Saturday morning have produced a far better \nbill for the Nation than the Republican conference report on which the \nSenate was scheduled to vote today.\n  President Clinton provided the strong leadership needed to persuade \nRepublican leaders to back away from their extreme positions and come \nto the table to work out genuine bipartisan legislation for the good of \nthe country.\n\n[[Page S11864]]\n\n  The agreement addresses illegal immigrant head on. It reverses the \nserious mistakes by the Republican leadership to use illegal \nimmigration as a pretext to attack legal immigrants.\n  Entirely different considerations apply to legal immigrants. They \ncome in under our laws, serve in our Armed Forces, pay taxes, raise \ntheir families, enhance our democracy, and contribute to our \ncommunities. The original Senate bill had rightly rejected harsh \nattacks on legal immigrants, and so does this agreement. That is a \nmajor victory.\n  First, this agreement drops harmful provisions that would have made \nthe recent welfare reforms even harsher for legal immigrants. Having \nbanned SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, cash assistance, and other services \nfor legal immigrants in the welfare bill, the Republican immigration \nbill would have expanded the restrictions to include Head Start, job \ntraining, and English classes. This was wrong, and this agreement \ncorrects this grave mistake.\n  The Republican bill would have shifted the rules in midstream for \nlegal immigrants already in America and their sponsors. The bipartisan \ncompromise, on the other hand, retains the formulation in the new \nwelfare law, which applies primarily to future immigrants. Without this \ncompromise, the Nation's hospitals, clinics, and community based \norganizations would have been overwhelmed, and would have lost millions \nof dollars in Federal help.\n  Second, the comprehensive welfare reforms made legal immigrants \nineligible for many types of assistance. The Republican bill penalized \nthe few legal immigrants who still qualify for assistance by \nthreatening them with deportation if they actually used the assistance.\n  If there are immigrants who abuse welfare--or use it illegally--they \nshould be deported. In fact, current laws permit this step, and we \nshould enforce them.\n  But it is wrong to add to the harsh new welfare reforms by saying to \nlegal immigrants who qualify for child care assistance that if they \nactually use it, they can be deported. No parent should face that \nchoice--of leaving their children home alone while the parent works or \nrisking deportation by obtaining child care. It was right to eliminate \nthese deportation provisions under the new bipartisan agreement.\n  Finally, it was wrong for Republicans to insist on putting family \nsponsorship off limits to lower income working American families. Under \nthe Republican bill, 40 percent of American citizens would have been \ndenied the right to bring in their families. The Republicans try to \nclaim that their party is the party of family values, but this bill was \na flagrant denial of such values. Under the Republican proposal, for \nthe first time in the Nation's long immigrant history, low-income \nworking American citizens would have been denied the opportunity to \nhave this spouses and young children join them in America.\n\n  Republicans argue that most Americans who sponsor family members are, \nin fact, former immigrants, who knew when they immigrated that they \nwould be leaving families behind. The fact is, according to the General \nAccounting Office, 64 percent of those sponsoring their families in any \ngiven year are native-born American citizens who were never immigrants \nthemselves.\n  Republicans also argue that if we do not set high income standards \nfor sponsors, then low-income sponsors will be pushed onto welfare \nbecause they have to support themselves and the sponsored immigrant as \nwell.\n  To guard against this possibility, the bipartisan agreement \nestablishes an income test for sponsorship at 125 percent of the \npoverty level. The agreement requires sponsors to sign an enforceable \nsponsorship contract that requires sponsors to care for those they \nbring in. And it requires sponsors to prove they can meet the \nrequirement by submitting their tax returns for the past 3 years.\n  This is the approach which the Senate adopted in May and which was \nactively supported by many Republicans, including Senator Abraham, \nSenator DeWine and others. In fact, in June, Jack Kemp urged \ncongressional leaders to adopt this sponsorship formula. He wrote, \n``The Senate bill reasonably requires that sponsors have income equal \nto 125 percent of the Federal poverty level,'' and he called on \nCongress to oppose sponsorship formulas that imposed stiffer burdens on \nsponsorship.\n  The 125 percent requirement ensures that very few sponsors will be \npushed onto welfare. Virtually all welfare programs require 100 percent \nof poverty or less in order for applicants to qualify. Those with \nincomes above 125 percent of the poverty level qualify for very few \nprograms. And where they do, they normally qualify for only a few \ndollars of help.\n  The price tag that the Republican bill placed on family unity was \nunnecessary, harsh, and punitive. It was intended as a backdoor \nreduction in legal, family immigration. The Republican wealth test for \nsponsorship was 140 percent of the poverty level for those sponsoring \ntheir spouses or young children and 200 percent for those sponsoring \ntheir parents, adult children, or brothers and sisters. The Republican \nplan was anti-family. It said to working Americans that their jobs were \nnot good enough to qualify them for sponsorship. This draconian, class-\nbased proposal would have caused unfair hardship for working American \nfamilies, and was rightly rejected as part of this bipartisan \nagreement.\n  In addition, this agreement contains three other worthwhile \nimprovements. It provides assistance to immigrants who are victims of \ndomestic violence. It continues assistance under the Ryan White Act for \nimmigrants with HIV infection or battling AIDS. It allows non-profit \norganizations, such as Catholic Charities, church social service \nprograms, or community-based organizations to continue to assist \ncommunities with Government funds, without having to check the \ncitizenship and green cards of everyone who walks in their doors.\n  Rather than making harsh welfare reforms even harsher for legal \nimmigrants, this bipartisan agreement provides modest but needed \nimprovements over those reforms for battered immigrants and for \ncharities and other non-profit organizations that are a lifeline to \nimmigrant communities.\n  As President Kennedy wrote in his book, ``A Nation of Immigrants'':\n\n       Immigration policy should be generous; it should be fair, \n     it should be flexible. With such a policy we can turn to the \n     world, and to our own past, with clean hands and a clear \n     conscience. Such a policy would be but a reaffirmation of old \n     principles. It would be an expression of our agreement with \n     George Washington that ``The bosom of America is open to \n     receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but \n     the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions; \n     whom we shall welcome to a participation of all our rights \n     and privileges, if by decency and propriety of conduct they \n     appear to merit the enjoyment.''\n\n  This bipartisan agreement is largely consistent with that goal. It \ntakes a number of worthwhile steps to deal with the problems of illegal \nimmigration, although much more significant steps could have been taken \nand should have been taken to deal with this serious problem. Equally \nimportant, this bill keeps the Nation's doors open, with reasonable \nlimitation, for those who come here as legal immigrants and contribute \nto a stronger and better America, as they have done throughout the two \ncenturies of our history. I commend all of those who have helped to \ndevelop this proposal and have it included in the underlying document.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota and 5 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11860-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11864-S11866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEDERAL AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, it is critically important we finish the \nFederal aviation reauthorization legislation before the Senate \nadjourns. This legislation is vital to air service in my home State of \nSouth Dakota. For example, in my State of South Dakota, the FAA bill we \nare struggling to bring to closure doubles the size of the Essential \nAir Service Program to $50 million. This is particularly important to \nBrookings, Mitchell, and Yankton, SD. The Essential Air Service Program \nprovides the only air service link these\n\n[[Page S11865]]\n\ncommunities have to the national air service network.\n  The FAA legislation also will make more Airport Improvement Program \n[AIP] funds available to small airports for safety-related repairs and \nimprovements. For instance, under this legislation, the Sioux Falls \nAirport will receive an annual increase in AIP funds of at least \n$227,000. The Rapid City Airport will receive an annual increase of at \nleast $170,000. The same is true for the Aberdeen Regional Airport and \nthe Pierre Regional Airport which each will receive an increase in AIP \nfunds of at least $100,000. AIP funds are the only source of money for \nsafety-related repairs at these airports and that is one key reason why \nthis legislation is so important to air service in my State.\n  In addition, the FAA legislation addresses a widely held concern in \nmy home State that air fares to small cities are too expensive. The \nbill directs the Secretary of Transportation to study why city air \nfares are so exorbitant and recommend what measures can be taken to \nmake air travel to small cities more affordable.\n  The FAA legislation contains many very important aviation safety \nmeasures. One such measure will ensure the flight service station in \nour capital city of Pierre will remain open. Constituents traveling to \nand from Pierre were very concerned that closing the flight service \nstation would compromise safety at the Pierre Regional Airport. I am \nvery pleased the provision I added to this legislation addresses this \nconcern.\n  Mr. President, there is a continuing struggle over one provision in \nthis vitally important aviation safety and security legislation which \nis preventing it from being considered by the Senate. I commend the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle for trying to bring the FAA bill \nto closure. We cannot leave this city without finishing the FAA bill. \nIt is one of the most important pieces of legislation in this Congress. \nThe air service provisions in this legislation also make it one of the \nmost important pieces of economic development legislation for South \nDakota of this or any Congress.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the conference on H.R. 3539, The \nFederal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996, I again rise to urge my \ncolleagues to permit the Senate to proceed to consideration of the \nconference report for this critically important legislation. H.R. 3539 \nis a bipartisan, omnibus aviation bill which reauthorizes the Airport \nImprovement Program [AIP], reforms the Federal Aviation Administration, \nimproves aviation safety and security, and provides long overdue \nassistance to the families of victims of aviation disasters.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely imperative that the Senate approves \nthis conference report before we adjourn and that the President signs \nthe report. Friday, the House met its responsibility to the American \ntraveling public by passing this legislation. If the Senate fails to \napprove this excellent legislation which represents another significant \nlegislative accomplishment for this body, we will have failed to meet \nour responsibility to the American traveling public. For example, if we \ndo not approve this report, airports across the country will not \nreceive Federal funding which is vital for safety-related repairs and \nother improvements.\n  If we fail to pass this report, the Senate will have neglected our \nresponsibility to ensure the United States maintains the safest and \nmost secure aviation system in the world. For example, the conference \nreport implements many of the aviation security recommendations made by \nthe White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security earlier this \nmonth.\n  Mr. President, there are dozens of important provisions in this \nlegislation, but I would like to focus my remarks on four main areas.\n  First, aviation safety. Air transportation in this country is safe. \nIndeed, it remains the safest form of travel. However, we can and we \nmust do more. This legislation facilitates the replacement of outdated \nair traffic control equipment. It puts in place a mechanism to evaluate \nFAA's long-term funding which is critically important at a time in \nwhich enplanements continue to increase yet Federal budget constraints \nlimit the ability of the FAA to respond to the increased needs of our \naviation system. Additionally, this legislation eliminates the FAA's \ndual mandate. It ensures the FAA finally focuses solely on aviation \nsafety.\n  A second area I want to highlight is aviation security. This \nconference report contains numerous provisions designed to improve \nsecurity at our Nation's airlines and airports. The measure before us \ntoday incorporates many of the recommendations of the White House \nCommission on Aviation Safety and Security of which I am a member. In \nfact, this legislation provides statutory authority requested by the \nPresident to implement several of the Commission's recommendations. \nPassage of this bill will improve aviation security by: Speeding \ndeployment of the latest explosive detection devices; enhancing \npassenger screening processes; requiring criminal history record checks \non screeners; requiring regular joint threat assessments; and \nencouraging other innovative procedures to improve overall aviation \nsecurity such as automated passenger profiling.\n\n  The third area I wish to highlight is how this legislation will help \nsmall community air service and small airports. The legislation before \nus today reauthorizes the Essential Air Service program at the level of \n$50 million. This program is vital to States such as South Dakota. By \nadjusting the formula for Airport Improvement Program [AIP] funds, we \nwould now ensure that all airports receive virtually all their \nentitlement funds in addition to being eligible for discretionary \nfunds. This is great news for small airports which in recent years have \nreceived far less than their full and fair share of these funds.\n  Also, the legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation to \nconduct a comprehensive study on rural air service and fares. For too \nlong, small communities have been forced to endure higher fares as a \nresult of inadequate competition. The Department of Transportation will \nnow look into this issue as a result of this conference report. This \nfollows on the important work that I instructed the General Accounting \nOffice to initiate last year.\n  Mr. President, the final area I wish to highlight is the \ncompassionate measures this legislation would put in place for the \nfamilies of victims of aviation disasters. Last week, I chaired a \nhearing of the Commerce Committee in which the families of victims of \nfive aviation tragedies courageously told the committee of their \nharrowing experiences. I promised those witnesses, as well as other \nfamilies of victims in the room, that Congress finally would act this \nyear to put in place measures to improve the treatment families \nreceive, protect their privacy in a time of grief, ensure they receive \ntimely and accurate information, and address a number of other concerns \nthey eloquently voiced to the committee. The family advocacy and \nassistance provisions in this conference report are supported by these \nfamilies and I hope the Senate will help me keep my promise to families \nwho already have suffered enough. I hope we do not disappoint them.\n  Mr. President, despite all the vitally important aviation safety and \nsecurity provisions in this legislation, I understand some members are \ntroubled by one provision. I refer to the amendment the ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, offered in conference to \ncorrect a technical error in the Interstate Commerce Commission \nTermination Act of 1995. The Hollings amendment, which I strongly \nsupport, is not the partisan provision some have claimed it to be. All \nfive Senate conferees--Senator McCain, Senator Stevens, Senator \nHollings, Senator Ford, and I--voted in favor of that amendment \nbecause, despite all the rhetoric, it is simply a technical correction \nwhich fairness dictates the Congress make.\n  I would like to briefly discuss the rhetoric that has clouded the \nHollings amendment issue and, regrettably, has transformed the Hollings \namendment into an issue which some now feel is more important than \nenhancing aviation safety and security. When the House debated the \nconference report, I heard a number of Members make blanket statements \nthat the Hollings amendment is not truly a technical correction. Those \nsame Members claimed their statements were based on their purported \nknowledge of the Senate's intent when it considered and\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\noverwhelmingly passed the ICC Termination Act. With all due respect to \nthose Members of the House, I authorized the ICC Termination Act and \ncan unequivocally say they are dead wrong. The Hollings amendment is \nnothing more than a technical correction. In the ICC legislation, the \nSenate never intended to strip Federal Express or any person of rights \nwithout the benefit of a hearing, debate, or even discussion. Now, \nfairness dictates we correct that inadvertent error. That is precisely \nwhat the Hollings amendment does. It is exactly why I supported it in \nconference. It is why I continue to strongly support it.\n  Today's debate should be about this truly historic piece of aviation \nlegislation which reflects the outstanding work Congress does when it \nproceeds on a bipartisan basis. Unfortunately, I fear the debate \nregrettably will focus on the Hollings amendment which is contained in \njust 5 lines of a 189-page bill. All too often, Congress is criticized \nfor losing sight of the big picture. Today, if this debate proceeds as \nI fear it may, the Senate will reinforce that perception.\n  Some members of the American public watching this debate from the \ngallery of a C-SPAN will understandably ask themselves ``has the Senate \nlost sight of the goal of ensuring the safety and security of air \ntravel in the United States?'' Others will ask themselves ``has the \nSenate forgotten the importance of safety-related repairs and other \nimprovements of our Nation's airports?'' And the family members of \naviation disaster victims will correctly ask ``why has the Senate \nfailed to listen to our pleas to put in place measures to improve the \ntreatment of families of future aviation disaster victims?''\n  And, Mr. President, each and every one of these questions will be \nperfectly valid. I would hate to be in the position of having to answer \nthem.\n  We owe it to the American public to preempt these questions by \nresisting the invitation to lose sight of the bigger picture. Today, we \nare trying to pass a historic aviation safety and security bill. Let's \nmove beyond 5 lines in a 189-page bill. Let's get the job done for the \nAmerican public. I urge that the Senate immediately take up for \nconsideration the conference report to accompany H.R. 3539.\n  Mr. President, earlier today I wrote the Vice President of the United \nStates urging him to support swift and final passage of the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 3539. In that letter, I reminded the Vice \nPresident that two of the most important aviation security \nrecommendations made by the White House Commission on Aviation Safety \nand Security--deployment of explosive detection devices at our Nation's \nairports and criminal background checks for baggage screeners--cannot \nbe implemented without the statutory authorization to do so provided in \nthis legislation. These important recommendations to enhance the \nsecurity of air travel in the United States cannot wait until we \nreconvene next year. We must pass those two provisions before we \nadjourn. We must pass this legislation before we adjourn. I ask \nunanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,    \n                                   Committee on Commerce, Science,\n\n\n                                            and Transportation\n\n                                   Washington, September 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Albert Gore, Jr.,\n     Vice President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: As the Senate Majority Leader's \n     designee to the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and \n     Security, I am writing to urge you to actively support final \n     passage of the Conference Report accompanying H.R. 3539, the \n     Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. As you know, \n     H.R. 3539 is a bipartisan, omnibus aviation safety and \n     security bill. It is vitally important the Conference Report \n     passes the Senate prior to adjournment.\n       Based on a meeting with your staff, I understand several of \n     the Commission's recommendations require statutory authority \n     to be undertaken. Without such authorization, I was told \n     these recommendations to enhance our nation's aviation \n     security cannot be implemented. Specifically, I am referring \n     to statutory authority to deploy government purchased \n     explosive detection devices in our nation's airports and to \n     conduct criminal background checks on baggage screeners.\n       The Conference Report to H.R. 3539 responds to the \n     Administration's request for statutory authority in these two \n     areas. Section 305(b) authorizes the deployment of explosive \n     detection devices and Section 304 permits criminal background \n     checks on baggage screeners. In addition, the legislation \n     embraces a number of other recommendations made by the \n     Commission which enjoy bipartisan support such as \n     comprehensive measures to improve the treatment of the \n     families of aviation disaster victims.\n       Mr. Vice President, I hope you agree the Senate must \n     approve the Conference Report accompanying H.R. 3539 before \n     it adjourns. Otherwise, according to your staff, two of the \n     most important recommendations of the Commission--interim \n     deployment of government purchased explosive detection \n     devices and criminal background checks for baggage \n     screeners--cannot be implemented. We must not let that \n     happen.\n       I look forward to working with you to ensure this \n     critically important aviation safety and security legislation \n     passes the Senate as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I earlier spoke about the problems with \nthis bill actually resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of \nindividuals actually being fired from their jobs.\n  I would like to turn to some good news this time about the bill about \nthe District of Columbia. It includes important provisions for the \nDistrict of Columbia. In addition to provisions on school facilities, \nthe conference agreement improves the ability of public charter schools \nto operate in the city.\n  The condition of school facilities in the District of Columbia has \nreached a crisis stage. Those who live here know that. It has been \nfront-page news in the papers for weeks.\n  As of Friday, four public schools still remained closed due to fire \ncode violations, displacing almost 2,000 students. A breakdown in \noversight and accountability has occurred at the expense of the \nchildren in this city.\n  Strong and immediate action must be taken to reverse this situation. \nThis bill does it. Children in the District of Columbia must be able to \nattend public schools that are safe and free of facility deficiencies \nthat lead to their closure. The General Services Administration \nestimates the cost of repairs at $88.6 million for severe facility \ndeficiencies in fiscal year 1997. The total deficiencies are about $2 \nbillion.\n  As estimated, $40.7 million will be available from existing \nappropriations and borrowing. Additional resources are needed to \nprevent unsafe conditions and school closures. But these resources \ncannot be provided to a school system which has demonstrated an \ninability to effectively manage its resources.\n  I have, therefore, sought inclusion of a provision in the omnibus \nbill to provide resources to combat facility deficiencies while placing \nresponsibility for the expenditure of funds with the DC Financial \nControl Board, not the school system. In addition, the General Services \nAdministration will provide program management services for the repairs \nand capital improvements.\n  The provision makes available an estimated $52.7 million to the \ncontrol board to carry out a program of facility repairs and capital \nimprovements. The bill makes these funds by reallocating $40.7 million \nto the Authority from operations funds appropriated, and capital \nfinancing authority provided, in previous appropriations acts.\n  The provision also makes available an estimated $12 million from the \nprivatization of both the Student Loan Marketing Association, fondly \nknown as Sallie Mae, and the College Construction Loan Insurance \nAssociation, commonly known as Connie Lee, as the Senator from \nConnecticut, who is on the floor, is well aware. We acted at his \nrequest.\n  The availability of these resources means that immediate action will \nbe taken to repair facility deficiencies in DC schools. In addition, \nthe Congress will closely monitor the progress of facility repairs and \nwill consider providing additional funds in a supplemental\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\nappropriation during the spring of fiscal year 1997. This comes from my \nconsultation with the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \nIn the interim, the control board will be able to reprogram funds for \nfacility repairs, if necessary.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the concern that some of my colleagues, \nno doubt, have about any increase in Federal assistance for the \nDistrict of Columbia, given its dismal track record in managing \nresources. However, I remind my colleagues that we have previously \ntaken strong action to prevent future mismanagement by establishing the \ncontrol board and the chief financial officer.\n  The additional funds provided for improving school facilities, as \nwell as previous funds provided, will be fully managed by the control \nboard, not the school system nor the District of Columbia government. \nMoreover, I must also point out that we have an obligation to the well-\nbeing of the children in the Nation's Capital. We have accepted that \nresponsibility. This obligation includes the condition of the schools \nthey attend.\n\n  I thank Chairman Hatfield for including a provision for the District \nof Columbia in the conference agreement, given that the regular \nappropriations bill for the District has already been signed into law. \nHe recognizes, as I do, and as Chairman Livingston does, the obligation \nof the Congress to the children of the Nation's Capital. We have a \njoinder on that understanding and have acted quickly and decisively to \nmake sure what happened this year does not happen next year. I would \nalso like to thank the ranking minority member on the Subcommittee on \nthe District of Columbia, Senator Kohl, for working with me to include \nthis provision.\n  This is only a start. There is much more we need to do for the kids \nin this city. As long as I am in the Senate, I assure you I am going to \ndo everything I can to make this a city we can be proud of, especially \nwith respect to education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, several weeks ago, during the consideration \nof the welfare reform bill, I came to the floor and expressed my views \non that legislation. At the time, I characterized the bill as an \nunconscionable retreat from our Nation's more than 60-year commitment \nto America's poorest children.\n  Unfortunately, I still believe that to be the case today. In the past \n60 years, while we have disagreed and quarreled in this country on some \nissues, all Americans, regardless of party or ideology, understood that \nit was in our national interest to protect the most innocent and \ndefenseless of our people--the 9 million children who collect Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children. Whether you are from Connecticut, \nCalifornia, Maine or Mississippi, if all else fails, your National \nGovernment would not rip the safety net from underneath a poor child's \nfeet.\n  With the passage of the welfare reform bill, I believe we have \nabandoned that 60-year-old commitment. While the welfare reform \nlegislation may have been, in my view, a retreat, it is by no means a \nsurrender. A surrender would indicate that we are throwing up our arms \nbecause the struggle is over. A retreat, on the other hand, means it is \na temporary setback, not the end of the battle. Unfortunately, the \nbattle is not going to be fought in the remaining hours of the 104th \nCongress. But I pledge to my colleagues here that one of my first \npriorities in the 105th Congress will be to propose legislation that \nwill correct what I consider to be major flaws in the welfare reform \nbill.\n  Already I have instructed the General Accounting Office to begin \nassessing the effect of the welfare reform bill so that Congress can \nclosely monitor its impact on America's welfare system and particularly \non our Nation's children.\n  While I disagree with many aspects of the welfare reform legislation, \nits passage brings us to a new point, I believe, in how we deal with \npoverty and social issues in this country. We are now waging this \nbattle on a new front and with a new set of parameters. The blame game \non welfare is over. The time has come to move beyond divisive rhetoric \nand to find innovative ways to make this welfare legislation work for \nAmerica's poorest children. Simply passing the problem on to the States \nand our local communities--as if they have all the answers and all of \nthe resources to grapple with this problem--is not a solution. It is, \nas President Clinton has often stated, only the beginning. There is \nstill significant work to be done.\n  First and foremost, Mr. President, we must redouble our efforts to \ncreate good-paying jobs for welfare recipients striving to end the \ncycle of poverty and dependency. The bill that this Senate and this \nCongress passed, while professing to move people from welfare to work--\na concept that I wholeheartedly endorse--failed to provide the funds \nneeded to reach that goal. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the bill is $12 billion short of funds needed to meet \nthe bill's stringent requirements.\n\n  Consider, for example, that if today every new job in New York City \nwas to be filled by a current welfare recipient, it would take 21 years \nfor all these people to be absorbed into the city's economy. Does any \nMember of this body really think that millions of jobs offering good \nwages with health benefits are suddenly going to appear out of thin \nair? Absolutely not, particularly if we fail to focus on job creation \nand providing greater funds for assistance, training, and education, \nthat give welfare recipients, in our cities and our States, the chance \nto achieve the self-sufficiency this bill calls for.\n  As important as job creation is, Mr. President, to the success of \nwelfare reform, it will mean nothing if we do not allocate significant \nresources to child care. While I was pleased to see that more funds \nwere provided for child care in the legislation than was originally \nproposed, more is needed on this front.\n  If this bill is to be successful in permanently getting people off \nwelfare, as well as helping those already in the job market, working \nparents must be sure that their children will be well taken care of. \nThe Congressional Budget Office again estimates that there is close to \na $1.4 billion shortfall in the child care funds for the working poor \nand people in transition from welfare to work. This discrepancy has to \nbe addressed in the next Congress if this legislation is going to \nsucceed. So, too, must the provision allowing mothers with children \nbetween the ages of 6 and 10 to be sanctioned and potentially lose \nbenefits if they cannot find or afford child care.\n  Remember, we tried to strike that provision, but we lost. And so \ntoday, if you have children between the ages of 6 and 10, and you are \nout trying to find work, the fact that you cannot find child care and \ncannot marshal the adequate resources could cause you to lose all your \nbenefits. Again, I do not understand the wisdom of that. What happens \nto 6- and 7- and 8- and 9-year-olds and 10-year-olds in this situation? \nIf their mothers cannot find child care, who is to take care of them? \nWhat happens to these children? And yet, that is not provided for in \nthe legislation. My hope would be that this is one of the provisions we \nwould try and correct in the next Congress.\n  At the absolute least, we, as a nation, should be able to guarantee \nto children under the age of 10 that they will not be left home alone, \nto fend for themselves while their parents are out trying to make the \ndifficult adjustment from welfare to work. However, it seems that when \nit comes to the discussion of welfare reform in this Chamber, there \nseems to be a constant fundamental disconnect between rhetoric and \nreality. The fact is, we simply cannot ask welfare recipients, \nstruggling to get by, struggling to make ends meet, struggling to raise \na family, to keep a job if Congress does not provide adequate child \ncare.\n  Of course, the issue of child care rubs both ways, for both working \nparents and, of course, their young children. Obviously, child care is \nabout more than just helping working parents. It is about ensuring that \nour Nation's poor children will not be neglected.\n  When we debated the welfare reform bill, we came just short of the \nnecessary votes of providing vouchers for children whose families reach \nthe 5-year limit. To my colleague's credit, from the State of \nLouisiana, Senator\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\nBreaux, who tried to include these vouchers so that at the end of the 5 \nyears--whatever else you do to the parents, you do not visit that \nproblem on the children. We lost that vote on a narrow decision here in \nthe Senate.\n  Under the welfare bill which became law, States are prohibited--they \nare prohibited--from even providing vouchers for children from block \ngrant funds. That we punish children because of the actions of their \nparents, no matter how irresponsible they may be, is, in my view, \nabhorrent. By not providing adequate protections for poor children, we \nrisk doing just that.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, the next Congress must work to address \nissues of concern for food stamp recipients and legal immigrants. These \nfood stamp cuts will be disproportionately borne by families with \nchildren. In fact, these families will absorb two-thirds of these \ncutbacks.\n  Also, as we speak, Mr. President, legal immigrants are being cut off \nfrom their food stamp benefits and SSI insurance as well. Many have no \nidea what is about to happen to them. The poor, the elderly, the \ndisabled will simply lack the means to care for themselves, and, what \nis worse, they have no grace period to prepare for these changes.\n  Mr. President, to give you an idea of the practical impact of these \nprovisions, I want to bring to my colleagues' attention the plight of \nsome 2,000 Cambodians, legal immigrants--legal immigrants--who live in \nmy home State of Connecticut. Of those 2,000 Cambodians, at least 250 \nof them suffer from concentration camp syndrome, from living under the \nmurderous Khmer Rouge. Due to this legislation, they will lose access \nto SSI, food stamps, and health care benefits. What is worse, many of \nthem do not meet the criteria for naturalization. The local Khmer \nhealth advocates estimate that people may well die as a result of this \nelimination of care.\n  Mr. President, is this how we treat the downtrodden and vulnerable \nlegal immigrants we brought to this country because of the \ncircumstances they faced in Cambodia? The number may not seem high, \nonly 250 out of 2,000, but these are people we brought to America \nbecause we wanted to give them a better chance and to get away from the \nmurderous regime of the Khmer Rouge. And now we are going to cut them \noff from SSI benefits and health care? I do not understand the logic of \nthat.\n  These people played by the rules. In many cases, we brought them \nhere. They pay taxes. And yet we voted to cut off essential care to \nthese people, as well as millions of others. Who would have imagined \nthat those Cambodians who bravely fled their nation's killing fields \nwould now find themselves being told by the greatest democracy the \nworld has ever known, ``We're not going to help you out on basic health \ncare needs.''\n  Mr. President, these are mean-spirited provisions masquerading as \nbudget cuts. Nearly every Member of this body is a descendant of \nimmigrants. By failing to correct the flaws in this bill, we risk \nrepudiating America's legacy of immigration which has defined our \nNation for more than 200 years.\n  Let me also say, Mr. President, that one of the most important \naspects of this bill is our constant vigilance in monitoring the impact \nof this legislation. Language in the welfare reform bill allows \nCongress to closely study how the bill is implemented. This body must \nensure that the States remain accountable to the spirit of this \nlegislation.\n  For example, recent press reports indicate that States will receive \ncredit for moving welfare recipients to work simply by dropping them \nfrom welfare rolls. That is not reform. That is abandonment of our \nnational priorities. And Congress must ensure that it does not happen.\n  That is why I have already talked to the General Accounting Office, \nas I mentioned at the outset of these remarks, about monitoring the \nmajor areas of this legislation. I will ask the General Accounting \nOffice to examine the impact of the reductions, terminations of cash \nbenefits, and food assistance on the well-being of children.\n  Also, Mr. President, I believe we need to look closely at the \nfinancial impact of this legislation on counties and cities who, under \nthe welfare reform bill, bear new and more difficult burdens. We must \nbe sure that we are not giving them unfunded mandates that they cannot \nafford to carry out. We must also monitor how States plan to implement \nchanges in the Food Stamp Program that are allowed under this new \nlegislation.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, I will ask the General Accounting Office \nto determine if adequate resources are being devoted to child care for \nthe working poor and parents leaving welfare for work. These are just a \nfew of the issues on which we as a nation, I think, are entering \nunchartered territory. In fact, a recent article in the New York Times \nnotes that, not only is data ``skimpy'' on the impact of welfare reform \nmeasures, but also research results are largely ``ambiguous, \ncontradictory, confusing, or nonexistent,'' to quote that article.\n\n  This lack of empirical data underscores the need for this coming \nCongress to keep a close eye on how welfare policies are being \nimplemented across the country. It is my hope, Mr. President, that when \nwe reconvene in January we will address some of these critically \nimportant questions.\n  For those of us who both opposed and supported this legislation, we \nhave a solemn responsibility to move beyond rhetoric and ensure that we \nfulfill the mandate to move Americans from welfare to work, from \ndependency to self-sufficiency, and from hopelessness to opportunity.\n  My hope is, Mr. President, the coming Congress will focus a lot of \nits energy and time on these questions so that we might correct some of \nthe shortcomings of the welfare reform bill that was passed in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment that the \nbanking provisions of the omnibus appropriations bill currently before \nus fails to include a very important licensing provision for bank \ninsurance sales. Over the past few weeks, I have heard from hundreds of \ninsurance agents in Kentucky who believe it is only fair that all \nprofessionals who sell insurance, regardless of what institution one \nmay be affiliated with, be licensed by the appropriate State agency. \nRegretfully, in the push to leave town and adjourn for the year, the \nnegotiators failed to include this important measure in the banking \nprovisions of the appropriations legislation.\n  The State licensing question recognizes one simple straightforward \nissue--the commonsense notion that anyone selling insurance should be \nlicensed. No one questions the fact that lawyers, doctors, real estate \nagents, and other professionals must pass examinations and be licensed \nby the appropriate State authority. Insurance agents are professionals, \nwhether they work for a bank or an insurance agency. I see no \ndistinction.\n  Mr. President, the licensing standard would establish an important \nsafeguard to ensure fair competition in the insurance marketplace. \nAllowing bankers or any other professional to escape licensing \nstandards represents an unfair advantage over insurance professionals \nwho have diligently met such standards for years. Anyone selling \ninsurance to consumers, bankers and agents alike, should be sanctioned \nby the proper State authority.\n  Perhaps more importantly, Mr. President, this issue is about more \nthan a level playing field for insurance agents. It is about confidence \nand trust. By requiring licensing for insurance sales, Congress will \nreassure American consumers as they seek insurance protection for their \nfamilies, homes, automobiles, and their lives, that their agent has a \nlicense, meets State education requirements, and all appropriate \nqualifications. This is no small consideration. I believe American \nconsumers rely on and trust the individuals they consult for financial \ndecisions, whether that individual is an insurance agent, lawyer, or a \nrealtor.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n We must ensure that minimal standards are met in order to preserve \nthis important confidence.\n  Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that Congress will address this \nimportant issue next year when we return. I believe it is about common \nsense and fairness. However, above all, this issue represents sound, \npublic policy and would safeguard the trust consumers place in \ninsurance professionals. Again I say, Mr. President, I hope that \nCongress will take action soon after we return next year to ensure this \ntrust continues.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention the \nenactment of a vital piece of consumer legislation. In fact, I believe \nthat the Fair Credit Reform Act of 1996, which is incorporated in the \ncontinuing resolution that we are about to vote upon, marks the most \nsignificant piece of consumer legislation enacted in this Congress.\n  This legislation will improve the accuracy of credit reports and it \nwill reduce the frustration of tens of thousands of Americans as they \nexperience difficulties with inaccurate information in their credit \nreports and the consequent difficulties of getting that inaccurate \ninformation removed.\n  Mr. President, it has been more than a quarter of a century since the \noriginal Fair Credit Reporting Act was enacted by the Congress. While \nthe credit reporting industry has initiated a number of improvements \nvoluntarily, the time has come to update the law. Senator Bond and I \nhave been working on problems that individuals experienced with \ncorrecting inaccuracies in their credit files for more than 5 years. \nErrors in consumer credit reports have been the No. 1 item of complaint \nat the Federal Trade Commission and States attorneys general have \nexperienced similar levels of complaint.\n\n  That is why this legislation is so vitally needed. Credit financing \nhas become a way of life for us in America. It is an integral part of \nour economy and it is hard to imagine our lives without it. Without the \ncredit reporting system consumers would not have the easy access to \ncredit that they now enjoy and America's economy would suffer as a \nconsequence.\n  The credit reporting industry keeps files on more than 190 million \nAmericans, sells more than 1.5 million credit reports each and every \nday, and makes over 2 billion new entries each and every month. With \nthis kind of overwhelming data flow there are bound to be mistakes in \nthe system. Most of the time, errors are unintentional but they can be \nvery damaging. While we expect mistakes when 2 billion bits of \ninformation are entered into a credit reporting system every month, \nwhat we should not tolerate are companies that show little regard for \nthe accuracy of the information they provide to credit bureaus, and we \nshould not accept the frustrations that consumers experience in trying \nto get erroneous information removed from their records.\n  Mr. President, even as I speak, people are being turned down for \nstudent loans, car loans and mortgages. People are being turned down \nfor jobs and for promotions all because of faulty information in their \ncredit reports. While we will never eliminate human error or computer \nerror altogether, I believe we can and should do a substantially better \njob. Over the past 5 years I have been working on this, the Senate has \nheld extensive hearings on this topic. We heard that the credit \nreporting system, in a majority of cases, works extremely well and \nbenefits American consumers by providing them with ready access to \ncredit. However, we also heard from far too many consumers who endured \nfrustrating experiences in getting errors removed from their credit \nfiles.\n  I remember a hearing that we had in Nevada in which two cases come to \nmind. One involved a Bill and Barbara Kincade from a small town in \nnorthern Nevada, McDermitt, who corrected a mistake on their credit \nreport that arose when their bank sold their mortgage to another \ninstitution. They believed that they had corrected that information. \nThree years later, they discovered that the erroneous entry had \nreappeared on their credit history when they were turned down for a \nloan to finance a satellite dish. Our legislation would prohibit the \nreinsertion of deleted information without notifying the consumer \nfirst.\n  I also remember the story of Mary Lou Mobley who almost had to drop \nout of graduate school after she was denied a school loan because her \ncredit report reflected that she was married to a man from Arizona with \nnumerous financial defaults. The problem, Mr. President, is that Mary \nLou had never been married, never been to Arizona. Although Mary Lou \nhad an excellent credit history other than this erroneous entry, she \nwas required to obtain a cosigner on a student loan and pay a \nsignificantly higher interest rate in order to process her loan. Four \nyears later, after graduating from school, she was victimized once \nagain by the same erroneous information and denied a car loan. These \nkind of stories demonstrate the need to improve our system of getting \nerrors fixed.\n  There are two provisions in this legislation which are especially \nimportant to fix the gaps in the current system. First, the bill \ncreates a consumer friendly process for removing mistakes from your \nfile. Anyone who has tried to correct a mistake in their credit history \nknows firsthand the immense frustration it causes.\n  The consumer has to prove the information in his or her report is \nerroneous. This can often be exceedingly time consuming, costly and, in \nsome cases, nearly impossible to prove the negative; namely, that the \nindividual whose credit history is erroneously inserted in the \napplicant file for credit is not that same individual. Consumers should \nnot be burdened with these costs and these frustrations.\n  The legislation, which we will adopt in a few hours, changes the \nburden of proof from the consumer to the credit reporting agency when \nthe consumer notifies the credit reporting agency that the information \nreportedly contained in his or her file is erroneous. Once that notice \nis given to the reporting agency, the reporting agency has 30 days to \nverify the information. If the reporting agency is unable to verify the \ninformation, the erroneous information must be removed.\n  The second critical feature of this bill deals with those companies \nthat furnish information to credit bureaus. The information in the \ncredit bureau database is only as good as the data sent in by banks, \nretailers, and other furnishers of credit information. This legislation \nmakes these furnishers of information liable if they fail to correct \nmistakes after consumers brought such mistakes to their attention.\n  While none of us want to discourage companies from supplying accurate \ninformation to credit bureaus, it is equally important to hold them \naccountable for the accuracy of the data they supply. This legislation \nwill provide companies with the necessary incentives to improve their \nreporting and, thus, result in fewer mistakes.\n  Mr. President, I want to say a word about one of my colleagues with \nwhom I have worked on this issue for the past 5 years--Senator Bond. He \nand I have worked closely on this legislation. With his support and \nthat of his staff, we have been able to progress to the point where in \na few short hours, this legislation will have passed the Congress and \non its way to the President for signature.\n  Interested parties have very strong feelings about this legislation. \nSenator Bond and I have spent countless hours trying to bridge these \ndifferences. And I greatly appreciate his persistence and determination \nin working toward reform of the credit reporting system.\n  Let me also say, as every one of my colleagues know, major \nlegislation such as this is not enacted without the strong and \ncontinuous support of very effective staff backup. I want to cite one \nof my staff members in particular, and mention some others before \nconcluding my comments.\n  Andy Vermilye has given literally hundreds and hundreds of hours, a \nfrustrating experience as progress was offset by other problems that \nsurfaced as\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nthis legislation was processed. In the 103d Congress, we had this \nlegislation cleared in both Houses. A change was made at the last \nminute, and because it was the concluding day or two of the session, \none colleague was able to hold up this legislation and literally wipe \nout the work of Senator Bond and our respective staffs, but \nparticularly my legislative director, Andy Vermilye.\n  So back again we came, and now we are on the threshold of victory. \nThe record on this legislation should reflect that without Andy \nVermilye's patience and persistence, this legislation would not have \noccurred.\n  Other staffers need to be mentioned: Kris Siglin, Maggie Fisher, and \nMark Kaufman, who have gone on to greener pastures, but labored \nmightily in behalf of the cause. John Kamart, Susan McMillan, Doug \nNappi, and Kimberly Cobb worked long and hard on this bill. Amy Friend \nand David Medine were instrumental in getting this passed. Michele \nMeier, Ed Merwinski, Emmitt Carlton, Mike MacInney, Tim Jenkins, and \nBarry Connely deserve recognition for their contributions on this bill \nas well because all sectors--both the business community and consumer \ninterests --are involved in making this legislation a reality.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation marks an important event for \nconsumers in our country. We are making significant improvements in the \ncredit reporting system, and the lives of thousands of Americans who \nhave encountered difficulty in their credit reports will be made easier \nas a result of the changes made by this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like at this time to take a few \nmoments to reflect on my leaving the Senate, and to comment upon the \nextraordinary staff that I have enjoyed over the years, the tremendous \nwork that they do every day, and the staffs for all of the Senators I \nam sure would mete some of the same comments and earn some of the same \naccolades that I would like to extend to my staff.\n  I have always said that I believed that the soul of my office is \nreally the casework where you can make a difference in the life of some \nindividual--it may be a Social Security check that is fouled up; it may \nbe an immigration problem in which a family can be reunited. We all \nhave similar work in this category. But I really think that has \nprobably more bridge-building impact upon people thinking and knowing \nthat their Government does care and that they have compassion.\n  I would like to thank particularly Melanie Curtis, Chris Tye, Chris \nBrown, and Lisa White. They have served the people of my State in an \nextraordinarily capable and compassionate fashion.\n  My Washington office has been kept running by a dedicated group of \nadministrative professionals led by my office manager, Lynn Baker, who, \nlike many in this Senate, is raising a family as a single parent and \njuggling her workload in order to meet both her duties to the office \nand, more especially, to her young son. She is assisted by a dedicated \ngroup of Senate professionals as well.\n  I am sure that no Senator fully knows all the details that go into \nthe creating of a daily schedule. We all carry these little cards \naround. We all know, too, that situations change during the day. Brenda \nHart has been, for the last 5 years, my chief scheduler. She has been a \nconfidant, she has been a political operative, and she has been the \ncheerleader of our office by her extraordinary talent of baking. She \nkeeps that bakery going at her home and brings the results to the \noffice to share, whether it is late at night or whether it is during \nthe day. I think she is the first to arrive in my office in the morning \nand the last to leave. I can't believe that an office could run more \nsmoothly than she directs. One of the newsmen the other day dubbed her \nthe den mother for all the people in my office. I refer to her as \nmother superior, as she takes a very direct role by not just handing me \na card, but she helps direct me.\n\n  Of course, the reason we are here is to pass legislation, and there \nis no legislative staff I feel that is as skilled mine. I take great \npride in all parts of my office, especially the legislative staff.\n  For some 6 years a young lady by the name of Sue Hildick has been my \nlegislative director. She became my legislative director at the age of \n26. I doubt that history will show that a legislative director of an \noffice has started that undertaking being so young, but she has done it \nas a mature professional with great judgment, along with all of her \ndirecting and coordinating of legislative staff.\n  Of the 14 members of my policy team, 11 started in my office as \ninterns, including my chief of staff, Steve Nousen.\n  Mr. President, we all know that offices have to have a tight hand. \nThey have to have an understanding hand, and I believe that Steve \nNousen has performed that duty in such an extraordinary way in terms of \nefficiency and keeping a happy, well-run operation. I suppose I would \nsay that Steve had a very good beginning. He had professional training \nas a school-teacher and as a civics teacher in a high school in a small \ncommunity in my State. There in small communities you know everyone. \nEveryone knows you. They know your strengths. They know your weaknesses \nand yet you have to be a good neighbor especially in school because \nparents in that type of school take a very active interest. As a \nconsequence, they are watching you as well to inspire, teach, and to \nset the example before their children. Steve Nousen, as I say, has a \ngreat and wonderful record as my chief of staff, has my total \nconfidence.\n\n  There are three members of my staff as part of my legislative team: \nDoug Pahl, Karen Matson, and Kristi Gaines. They earned their law \ndegree while going to night school and carrying a full load during the \nday as staff members. I am proud of that record. Ken Hart, my current \npress secretary, started as an intern and finished his master's degree \nprogram at American University while serving as a staff assistant. I \ncome from an academia background, and, of course, there is nothing that \ngives me more satisfaction than watching my staff grow in maturity and \nacademic accomplishment. We have been supportive of their efforts. \nThese are a few of them that I refer to, not every single person, \nbecause that would take us into a time beyond my allocation at this \nmoment.\n  I have praised my staff on the Appropriations Committee many times \nbecause each bill we have keyed in upon the performance of the staff in \ncharge, but let me again refer to the chief of staff of the \nAppropriations Committee. I have to say that he came as an intern from \nthe divinity school at Duke University. He was headed for the Methodist \nministry. I feel sort of a guilt complex here at the moment because in \ncoming as an intern he never left. So the Methodists have suffered as a \nresult. I have always said, being ecumenical, my previous staff \ndirector came from the Princeton seminary and never returned. I think \nthey are doing the Lord's work when they are involved in public \nservice, and I think we will know they affected the kingdom in a very \nspecial way at some point in the future.\n  Keith Kennedy came, as I say, as an intern and almost 25 years later \nwe have reached this point of our relationship. Again, I would have to \nhave volumes to describe the history, the experiences we have shared \ntogether. But I like to think that because we have really a \ncomparatively low turnover, probably the least turnover--I know a few \nyears ago there was a survey done, and we had the least turnover of any \nstaff in the Senate. I would think the longevity of that staff adds to \ntheir abilities and the quality of their service to the citizens of \nthis country.\n  I just have to say I have been blessed by the quality of the people \nwho have served and are the working relationships that I have enjoyed. \nI have learned a great deal from my staff. I have learned that young \npeople are so enthusiastic. They have so much trust and faith in the \nsystem, this great political system of ours and they are determined to \nmake it work, and so individually and corporately I take my hat off to \none of the great reasons why I have been able to stay here for 30 years \nand have achieved a certain degree of success in a certain number of \nfields.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to add to the remarks \nthat I\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\njust made to further commend the excellent staff that we are fortunate \nto have here in Congress.\n  Over the course of the last week, I have had the opportunity to see \nthe Appropriations process at work like few others do. Working around \nthe clock, our negotiations with the House of Representatives and the \nWhite House was an all consuming task. Mr. Panetta and OMB Director \nRaines ably represented the priorities of the White House while \nCongressmen Livingston and Obey did the same for the House.\n  I wish to highlight the efforts of three people who are the mechanics \nof this effort. The people who ensure that the decisions that are made \nare translated into words that are properly included in the bill and \nreport and do what is intended they do.\n  John Mikel and Dennis Kedzior of the House Appropriations Committee \nand Jack Conway of the Senate Appropriations Committee are the \nmechanics that have so developed the confidence of both bodies that we \ncan confidently vote on this large piece of legislation knowing that it \nis technically correct and properly drafted.\n  With over 60 years of combined service to the Federal Government, \ntheir commitment to the process and making government a better place \nserves as an example for all who work here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum to be--first of all, \nMr. President, what is the time factor remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 58 minutes 20 seconds; \nthe minority controls 70 minutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would suggest the absence of a quorum. \nI ask unanimous consent that it be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I think under a unanimous-consent agreement \nI am to be recognized now for 5 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair for recognizing me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11870-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11871-S11872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I stand here this afternoon in the waning \nhours of this Congress urging our colleagues to support not only the \nFAA reform authorization bill but to urge with all my heart this body \nto include the language adopted by the conference offered by Senator \nHollings of South Carolina, the so-called Hollings amendment. I think \nthat we should approach this rationally. I think that we should \napproach this matter with understanding and certainly with truth, a \ncalm atmosphere. I know it has gotten remarkably emotional in the last \nseveral hours.\n  First, I hope our colleagues will know that this is not some \namendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina to make it \ndifficult for unions to organize. It is not a union-bashing amendment. \nIt is nothing of the sort.\n  Furthermore, in my humble opinion, this was a mistake. It was a \nmistake when we phased out the Interstate Commerce Commission and moved \nthose areas of concern and jurisdiction to other parts of our \nGovernment. Clearly, there was a disclaimer by the Congress and it said \nin section 10501 of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination \nAct--it has been cited in the Chamber by the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina. Once again I will cite that language:\n       The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall \n     neither expand nor contract coverage of the employees and \n     employers by the Railway Labor Act.\n\n  That is precisely what I think this debate is all about. Why the so-\ncalled express carrier language was omitted in 1995, I, frankly, do not \nknow. I think it was an error. I think it was a drafting error.\n  If that be the case, then I think it is incumbent upon this body to \ncure that error and to set the record straight. I do not believe that \none person can be produced who can come and testify before this body, \nor tell this Senator, or perhaps any other Member of this body, that \nthis was not an error. I do not know who that person is.\n  That is notwithstanding a report that is being cited freely on the \nfloor of the Senate this afternoon by the American Law Division of the \nCRS, the Library of Congress.\n  In all due respect to whomever authored this particular rendition of \nwhat they felt the law was, I think that this is, perhaps, one of the \nmost confusing, ambiguous memoranda that I have read from this \nerstwhile very, very reputable division of the Library of Congress.\n  This flies also in the face of the staff of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and also of the staff of the House of Representatives \nCommerce Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent their rendition of what \nactually happened in this area be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 1996.\n     Hon. Robert Livingston,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I understand that some questions have been raised \n     recently concerning the effect of the recently enacted ICC \n     Termination Act on the Railway Labor Act. The new statute \n     replaces the ICC with a Surface Transportation Board at the \n     Department of Transportation. It also explicitly states in 49 \n     U.S.C. 10501(c)(3)(B) the intention of the Congress that the \n     ICC Termination Act is not to change the coverage of any \n     employer or employee under the Railway Labor Act. This was \n     the clear understanding of the Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee, the Senate Commerce Committee, and \n     the members of the conference committee. If there are any \n     ambiguities in the new law concerning its effect on the \n     Railway Labor Act, they were created unintentionally. Any \n     such ambiguities should not be allowed to negate the clear \n     intent stated in Section 10501(c)(3)(B).\n       I hope you find this information useful. If I can be of any \n     further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Susan Molinari,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Railroads.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Speaker: We are writing to \n     you to set out the facts regarding a technical error in the \n     ICC Termination Act of 1995, Public Law 104-88. The mistake \n     concerns the context in which the ICC Termination Act \n     addressed the relationship between the economic regulation of \n     transportation under Subtitle IV of Title 49, United States \n     Code, and the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\n       The ICC Termination Act abolished the former Interstate \n     Commerce Commission, reduced economic regulation \n     substantially in both rail and motor carrier transportation, \n     and transferred the reduced but retained regulatory functions \n     to a new Surface Transportation Board, part of the Department \n     of Transportation.\n       One form of ICC regulatory jurisdiction under the former \n     Interstate Commerce Act was exercised over ``express \n     carriers''--as defined in former 49 U.S.C. 10102, a person \n     ``providing express transportation for compensation.'' This \n     was part of the ICC's jurisdiction, since express service \n     originated as an ancillary service connecting with rail \n     freight service.\n       The Railway Labor Act included in Part I coverage of ``any \n     express company . . . subject to the Interstate Commerce \n     Act.'' [45 U.S.C. 15]\n       In the ICC Termination Act, economic regulation of express \n     carriers was eliminated from the statutes to be administered \n     by the new Surface Transportation Board, on the ground that \n     this form of regulation was obsolete. (Another category of \n     ICC and Railway Labor Act ``carrier''--the sleeping-car \n     company--was similarly eliminated from STB jurisdiction.)\n       In light of the abolition of economic regulation, the ICC \n     Termination Act contained a conforming amendment (Section \n     322, 109 Stat. 950) which also struck the term ``express \n     company'' from the Railway Labor Act definition of a \n     ``carrier.'' Although unaware of any possible effects of this \n     conforming change on the standards applied under the Railway \n     Labor Act, Congress plainly delineated its intent in new \n     Section 10501(c)(3)(B) of Title 49, U.S. Code [109 Stat. \n     808]: ``The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 \n     shall neither expand nor contract coverage\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\n     of employers and employees by the Railway Labor Act.''\n       The apparent contradiction between the legislative intent \n     stated in Section 10501(c)(3)(B) and the conforming Railway \n     Labor Act in Section 322 could be interpreted to alter the \n     legal standards by which companies are determined to be \n     governed, or not governed, by the Railway Labor Act. \n     Therefore, a technical correction is necessary to restore the \n     former Railway Labor Act terminology and thus avoid any \n     inference that is at odds with the clearly stated legislative \n     intent not to alter coverage of companies or their employees \n     under the Railway Labor Act.\n       We hope that this brief summary of the facts will provide \n     you with information useful in your future deliberations.\n           Respectfully,\n     Bud Shuster,\n       Chairman.\n     Susan Molinari,\n       Railroad Subcommittee Chairwoman.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is very clear to me that there is, in \nfact, confusion. But the quickest and best way to eliminate that \nconfusion is to simply support the Hollings amendment, return us to \n1995, December, under that particular Act which for 62 years guided and \nhad jurisdiction over ``express carriers.''\n  We could go into a long legal argument, and I am sure that legal \narguments will be made on the floor of this body as to who is right and \nwho is wrong. The substance of this issue must and should be debated. \nBut now is the time, we think, that we should correct the issue, that \nwe should go back to where we were, that we should once again set the \nrecord straight and start from there.\n  If hearings are needed next year, that is fine. But we should in this \nlegislation support the Hollings amendment to the FAA Authorization and \nReform Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe under the previous unanimous \nconsent agreement I had 10 minutes, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his support of the \nHollings amendment. I pray, because of the importance of this \nlegislation, that we get an agreement and get moving on this. I again \nthank the Senator from Arkansas for his continued support and his \nstatement in support of very important legislation. I hope, following \nthe vote on the CR, we will take that bill up and get it resolved \ntonight. I hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11871-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11872-S11886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I applaud the managers of the bill and the \nleaders for all the hard work and long hours they have put into \ncrafting this bill. The mere size of this bill alone--if we look at it \nhere, 2,000 pages--is testament to the immense amount of work that they \nhave done.\n  I also, of course, express my special thanks and appreciation to the \nSenator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, who not only this year but every \nyear for the previous 30 years has done such a magnificent job. He will \nbe sorely missed, not only because of his accomplishments, but because \nthe Senator from Oregon has always, invariably, unwaveringly been a \ngentleman, and his unfailing courtesy to all of us, even if there is \nsignificant disagreement, will not only be long remembered but, I am \nsure, from time to time deeply missed.\n  There is much in this bill that merits support. The bill funds six \nCabinet departments and hundreds of agencies and commissions. We must \nfund these departments and keep the Government open and operating. That \nis our duty.\n  Before I go on, I also want to pay special thanks to Keith Kennedy, \nwho, again, unfailingly has been courteous and considerate to me for \nmany years now. The work he has done will never be fully appreciated \nexcept by those of us who have observed the incredible labors which he \nhas had to go through in satisfying some pretty enormous egos, and \nbalancing the very difficult, competing priorities that exist here. I \ndo not know of anyone who has done the job the way that Keith Kennedy \nhas, not only for the State of Oregon, not only for the Appropriations \nCommittee and not only for the Senate, but for the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  Mr. President, we also have a duty not to waste the people's money. \nTo spend simply for spending's sake is wrong. It is even more egregious \nto use the taxpayers' money in a manner designed to reap political and \nelectoral gains. Unfortunately, that has occurred here.\n  It is common knowledge that as the end of the fiscal year approaches \nand Congress is forced to take up omnibus bills that must be passed, \nsuch legislation tends to be a vehicle for every Member's pet project. \nThe term heard most often is that the bill becomes a ``Christmas \ntree.'' Mr. President, this bill is definitely a Christmas tree, and a \nglorious one at that.\n  I note for the Record that those on this side of the aisle, while not \nwithout blame for much of the pork in the bill, did attempt valiantly \nto pass the appropriations bills in the normal fashion. Following the \nproper procedure would have allowed all the provisions of this bill to \nbe examined and scrutinized in the light of day. Many would have been \ndropped, others amended or changed. Now, effectively, we do not have \nthose options.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have made it so that \nthis situation is very clear. They would offer a constant stream of \nnongermane, nonrelevant amendments to the appropriations bills. These \namendments were designed to further a certain agenda. While such action \nis allowable under the rules, it was unfortunate and has resulted in \nthe situation we now find ourselves.\n  I intend to vote against this bill. As I just stated, there is much \nin the bill that is meritorious and should be funded. However, the bill \nis indeed a Christmas tree, loaded with pork-barrel projects, and \nnonrelevant, not appropriate authorizing language. I would like to \ndiscuss many of the items I found in this bill that caused me \nconsternation.\n  When a bill contains earmarks that forces the administration to spend \nmoney on one specific project, it denies other worthwhile projects the \nopportunity to receive funding. The following is a partial list of \nearmarks that I have found in the bill.\n  On page 16, the bill earmarks $1,900,000 for supervision of the \nBrotherhood of teamsters national election. While I do not question the \nneed for Federal involvement in this matter, there is simply no need to \nspecifically earmark and mandate that this spending occur at this exact \nlevel.\n  On page 92, a special trust fund is established with $60,000,000 \ndeposited in it, for the payment of money to telecommunications \ncarriers for burdens placed upon them due to law enforcement efforts. \nWhile I have always opposed unfunded mandates, many do in fact exist \nand many companies, especially many small businesses are excessively \nburdened by such unfunded mandates. I am concerned that while these \nsmall businessmen and women continue to be burdened, we are \nestablishing a trust fund to pay some of our Nation's largest, most \nprofitable companies.\n  This issue certainly merits debate, but not in the context of the \nunderlying legislation. There is no pressing need that forces us to \ntake this action at this time. This is an appropriations bill and if \nthe Senate sees fit to establish such a trust fund, we should do so on \nother legislation.\n  This bill also contains language regarding Sallie Mae and library \nservices and numerous other authorizing legislation that should not be \nhere.\n  Mr. President, on page 126 of the bill, the funding for the Advanced \nTechnology Program of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology is funded at a level of $225,000,000. This number is an \nincrease over the funding previously contained in legislation. This \nprogram is nothing but a corporate subsidy program. It is clear case of \ncorporate welfare and I must object to the funding level for this \nprogram.\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\n  On page 182 of the bill $8,500,000 is earmarked specifically for the \nUniversity of New Hampshire for construction and related expenses for \nan environmental technology facility. Mr. President, I have no way of \nassessing on behalf of my constituents whether this spending is \nmeritorious or not. Further, I have no way of knowing whether other \nschools or entities that may engage in similar tasks and have similar \nor even more pressing needs.\n  Mr. President, numerous earmarks are contained on page 262. Three \nmillion is earmarked for the WVHTC Foundations outreach program. There \nis no explanation what WVATC is. Mr. President, $7,000,000 is \ndesignated for the grant to the Center for Rural Development in \nSomerset, KY; $1,000,000 is designated for a grant to Indiana State \nUniversity for the renovation and equipping of a training facility; and \n$500,000 for the Center for Entrepreneurial Opportunity in Greenburg, \nPA.\n  On page 268, the State Justice Institute is funded at $6,000,000. \nThis program was zeroed out by the House. I believe that such action \ntaken by the House was entirely appropriate. I had hoped that we would \nhave been able to end this program. However, due to the process in \nwhich this bill was crafted, I had no opportunity to seek to eliminate \nthis program.\n  The conference report also includes a provision that waives ship \nbuilding loan guarantee procedures intended to protect Federal \ntaxpayers.\n  Current law requires the Department of Transportation to apply \neconomic soundness criteria before the Federal taxpayer is asked to \nguarantee any shipbuilding loan under title XI of the Merchant Marine \nAct.\n  The purpose of the safeguard, of course, is to ensure that the vessel \nwill be able to successfully compete in the market, so that Federal \ntaxpayers are not left holding the bag for the defaulted loan.\n  This bill waives the economic soundness criteria for certain \nshipyards, making it easier to build ships that can't compete in the \nmarket. Mr. President, the provision is bad policy and it has \nabsolutely no place in this bill.\n  To continue, on page 622, there is an earmark for Hot Springs, AR. On \npage 623, language regarding the Elwha and Glines Dams in the State of \nWashington is contained in the bill. On page 656 is even more language \nregarding the Elwha river. And on page 657, is language regarding the \nUniversity of Utah. Additionally, beginning on page 659 is a series of \nland transfers in Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I note all these items not because I am questioning \nthe integrity of the Members that requested them. But I am questioning \ntheir need, their merit, and their importance. And, unfortunately, I \nhave no way to divine the answers to any of these questions.\n  This bill also contains numerous ``emergency designations.'' When \nspending is designated an emergency, it does not have to be paid for--\nin other words, it will result in an increase to the deficit. This bill \ncontains emergency funding to repair the damage done by Hurricane Fran \nand to pay for important anticrime and antiterrorism legislation.\n\n  However, I am very concerned that sometimes we are too quick to \ndeclare items emergencies. I see that $1.6 million is designated \nemergency spending for the Kennedy Center. The Kennedy Center is indeed \na national treasure, but I must seriously question increasing the debt \nby $1.6 million for this funding at this time. I am sure we could find \nappropriate offsets to conduct the work.\n  When bills are crafted in this manner, there is no end to the \ndiscoveries that we might find. For example, I have fought for years to \nensure that Department of Defense dollars are not wasted on \ninternational sporting events. As we all know due to the horrible \nterrorist act that occurred in Atlanta, there is an appropriate role \nfor our military and police in ensuring that such events are safe.\n  But we must ensure that the Department of Defense budget does not \nbecome a cash cow to fund every other program. I worked with others \nlast year to develop a manner in which DOD money used for sporting \nevents would only be used for necessary security purposes.\n  I discovered when reading this bill a provision that establishes an \naccount at DOD to support these events. Any unobligated balances \nappropriated for the Atlanta Games and any reimbursements received by \nDOD for the World Cup Games would go into this fund. The fund would \nthen be used to fund DOD involvement in other international sporting \ncompetitions.\n  This account is merely a way to funnel more defense dollars to the \norganizers of international sporting events. It is wrong and it should \nnot be in this bill.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to the fiscal year 1997 Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act contained in this bill.\n  My colleagues are all too painfully aware of my strong feelings about \nwasting scarce defense resources on pork-barrel projects. For many \nyears, I have pointed out the billions and billions of defense dollars \nwasted on programs and projects that have little or nothing to do with \nensuring our national security, but have everything to do with the \npopularity of their sponsors back in their States and districts.\n  Sadly, this year is no different from past years. The defense \nappropriations bill once again represents an egregious display of pork \nbarrelling by Members of both the House and Senate.\n  The Republican-led Congress has worked hard to increase President \nClinton's inadequate defense budget requests, adding a total of nearly \n$18 billion in the past 2 years. I fully supported these increases \nwhich have slowed, although not halted, the too-rapid decline in the \ndefense budget over the past decade. Failure to provide adequate \nfunding for defense will seriously hinder the ability of our military \nservices to ensure our future security and will have a deleterious \neffect on our Nation's ability to influence world events and maintain \npeace.\n  I believed that most of my Republican colleagues shared my deep \nconcern about our future security when we added $18 billion to the \ndefense budget. However, after fighting hard for this additional $18 \nbillion on the grounds of urgent national security requirements, the \nCongress failed to curb its traditional tendency to send scarce defense \nresources on special interest, pork-barrel projects.\n  On its face, this defense appropriations bill appears to address the \nserious shortfalls in military modernization funding in the President's \ndefense budget plan. The bill adds a total of $5.7 billion to the \nprocurement accounts, including tactical aircraft, sealift and airlift \nassets, improved communications systems, surveillance and \nreconnaissance, and other important warfighting equipment. The bill \nalso adds $2.7 billion for research and development, to maintain the \ntechnological edge of our military forces on the battlefields of the \nfuture, including a significant increase in both theater and national \nmissile defense programs.\n  Unfortunately, a closer look at the bill reveals the same sort of \nearmarks for special interest programs that have resulted in the waste \nof so many billions of defense dollars in the past.\n  There are, of course, the perennial adds, such as: $780 million for \nunrequested Guard and Reserve equipment, including more C-130 aircraft; \n$15 million for continued aurora borealis research and construction of \nthe High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program [HAARP], for which \nthere is no current military requirement or validated use; $300 million \nto be transferred to the Coast Guard; $27 million for the Justice \nDepartment's National Drug Intelligence Center; $10 million for natural \ngas vehicles and $15 million for electric vehicles; $20 million for \noptoelectronics consortia; and $493.6 million for medical research.\n  Let me take a moment to list some of the earmarks in the medical \nresearch area. They include breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian \ncancer--a new earmark, as well as the usual brown tree snakes, rural \nhealth care, freeze-dried blood, and a long list of other special \nmedical programs. Again this year, we see an earmark in the bill for \nmedical research performed by--and I quote--``private sector or non-\nFederal physicians who have used and will use the antibacterial \ntreatment method based upon the excretion of dead and decaying \nspherical bacteria.'' My question is this: if this particular program \nshows merit in a peer reviewed competition among research\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\nprograms, why is it necessary to earmark funds for it? I must assume \nthat the program cannot stand up to examination and, therefore, must be \ntreated specially to ensure its continuation. What a waste.\n  Mr. President, this litany of pork-barrel projects is all too \nfamiliar to my colleagues. But let me take a moment to explore some of \nthe interesting, new items included in this bill: $14 million for \ndefense conversion activities in San Diego and Monterey, CA; language \ndirecting that the Department of Defense forgive the monetary value and \nforego the return of 5,000 ballistic helmets loaned to the Los Angeles \nCounty Sheriffs Department since April 1993; $1.5 million to electronic \nrifle targeting systems from the Atlanta Olympics and install them at \nFort Benning, GA; a myriad of location-specific earmarks of \nenvironmental remediation, restoration, and technology development \nfunds, including Jefferson Proving Ground, Bremerton Shipyard, Hawaii \nSmall Business Development Center, National Defense Center for \nEnvironmental Excellence, as well as Fort Polk, McGregor Range, and \nFort Bliss; $13 million for an unnecessary, duplicative, and cumbersome \nbureaucracy for oceanographic research, which the Navy does not need or \nwant; and $650,000 for marine biocatalysts for defense and industrial \napplications, using an organization with tropical marine microorganisms \ncollected from two major geographical regions, one of which is the \nPacific Ocean.\n  Mr. President, this bill also includes more than $100 million in \nearmarks for programs which were not in either bill and were never \nconsidered by the Senate or the House. These projects just appeared in \nthis conference agreement, often without explanation, and there is \nnothing any Member can do about it.\n  Of course, Mr. President, the administration also sought, and \nachieved, inclusion of a few more provisions in this conference \nagreement as late as last Friday night. These include another $100 \nmillion for the Dual Use Applications Program, formerly the Technology \nReinvestment Project, or TRP, which has been plagued with politization \nfrom both Congress and the administration since its inception. In \naddition, as I mentioned before, the administration sought and achieved \nthe addition of a provision establishing a new account to fund DOD \nassistance to international sporting events. This fund is entitled to \nreceive not only direct appropriations but any reimbursements due to \nthe Department of Defense for services rendered in the past or the \nfuture. This provision was not considered by either House of Congress, \nbut again, there is nothing any one Member can do about either \nprovision now.\n  Mr. President, it never ceases to amaze me how innovative and \ncreative my colleagues can be in creating and earmarking funds for \nthese pork-barrel projects. Perhaps we should spend as much time on \nreducing the deficit and ensuring that our military forces have the \nright equipment to fight and win in future conflicts.\n  Mr. President, I have mentioned just a few of the earmarks and add-\nons in this bill, and I ask unanimous consent that a more complete list \nbe included in the Record at this point.\n  These pork-barrel projects total more than $2.4 billion. When added \ntogether, pork-barrel spending in the defense bills in just the past 2 \nyears totals more than $6 billion. That is one-third of the entire \nincrease in the defense budget--an increase for which this Republican \nCongress fought so hard on the basis of national security.\n  Mr. President, these projects have little or nothing to do with \nnational security. They are special interest items designed to enhance \nthe reputations of their sponsors back in their States. They are \nprojects which serve the political and economic interests of their \nsponsors, rather than the security interests of all Americans.\n  The simple fact is that wasting money on projects like these, which \nhave little or no military relevance, is dangerous. It takes money away \nfrom the high-priority requirements of the military services. It is \ncounter-productive to our efforts to ensure that our troops are trained \nand equipped to successfully perform their missions in any future \nconflict. Pork-barrelling harms our national security.\n  The American people are entitled to know how the Congress is spending \ntheir tax money. The simple fact is that the American people are sick \nand tired of congressional pork-barrel politics. By continuing the \npractice of pork-barreling with defense dollars, we run the serious \nrisk of further eroding the already low level of support for defense \nspending among the voters. But we seem unable to change our long-\nstanding tradition of bringing home the bacon.\n  The American people will not stand for this type of wasteful spending \nof their tax dollars. If we in Congress refuse to halt the pork-\nbarrelling, it will be more and more difficult to explain to the \nAmerican people why we need to maintain adequate defense spending. I \nwould prefer that the $2.8 billion wasted on pork-barrel projects had \nnot been included in the bill. I hope that, next year, with the very \nreal threat of a line-item veto of some of these items, the Congress \nwill stop wasting defense dollars on these kinds of special interest \nitems.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I believe this is a sad display of the \nCongress putting its Members' interests ahead of the interests of the \nmajority of the American people. I cannot support this bill.\n  I am also concerned about provisions in the bill regarding native \nAmericans and gaming. These provisions should have been considered by \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs. This bill is not the appropriate \nvehicle for this debate.\n   Mr. President, I also want to express my concern regarding an \nopposition to section 330 of the general provisions of the Interior and \nrelated agencies portions of this omnibus appropriations bill because \nsection 330 would, in a discriminatory fashion, dismantle the rights of \none Indian tribe to conduct gaming activities on its lands like all \nother Indian tribes.\n  Section 330 is specific to Rhode Island. It would expressly deny to \nthe only federally recognized Indian tribe in Rhode Island, the \nNarragansett Indian Tribe, the rights other Indian tribes have under \nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  I will focus most of my remarks on why I think section 330 should be \nrejected as bad policy. But first, I want to say a few words about why, \non procedural grounds alone, I oppose this section on this \nappropriations bill from my perspective as chairman of the authorizing \ncommittee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  I have the deepest respect for my colleagues from Rhode Island, \nSenators Chafee and Pell, and for the others who have been involved in \nshaping section 330. But I must say that section 330 of this \nappropriations bill is an unfair, end-run around the ongoing work of \nthe authorizing committee.\n  None of the provisions of section 330 have ever before been part of \nany bill or introduced or amendment filed in either House or Senate. It \nis new language added for the first time last week by the House to the \nomnibus appropriations bill. Section 330 would substantially amend \nauthorizing legislation on an appropriations measure without the \nbenefit of any legislative hearings, without any contribution by the \nauthorizing Committees of jurisdiction, and without any public debate \nby those most affected--the Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island.\n  Let me say that, at the same time, I appreciate the position of \nSenators Chafee and Pell and understand why they have taken it. This \nissue has been quite troubling to them, to Rhode Island officials, and \nto the Narragansetts themselves. It stems from an apparent \nmisunderstanding about whether the Congress intended the tribe or the \nState to have civil jurisdiction over gaming on tribal lands acquired \nunder the Narragansett Land Claims Settlement Act of 1978.\n  In 1988, Senators Chafee and Pell withdrew a floor amendment during \nconsideration of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act legislation which \nthey had drafted to resolve this issue in favor of the State after they \nreceived what they understood to be assurances that jurisdiction over \ngaming resided exclusively with the State. The meaning of those \nassurances have been in hot dispute ever since.\n  This past January, I met with Senators Pell and Chafee at their \nrequest to review their concerns and discuss what they could do. At \nthat time I made it clear to them that, although I\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nopposed them on the merits, I would not use my position as chairman of \nthe committee of jurisdiction to block a bill they would introduce to \namend the Narragansett Land Claims Settlement Act to gain the clarity \nthey sought against the tribe. Indeed, I told them I would schedule a \nhearing and allow the bill to move to the Senate floor for \nconsideration. I was surprised to see that they did not take any such \naction during this entire session. Had they done so, we would have long \nago voted on authorizing legislation, with the benefit of a full and \nfair hearing record.\n  Now, on the eve of adjournment of the 104th Congress, without the \nbenefit of any hearing or public debate, and without any involvement of \nthe Indian tribe directly affected, the sponsors of section 330 have \nattached it to an appropriations vehicle. I oppose this effort on these \ngrounds alone, and urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  On the merits, I oppose any effort to deny to the Narragansetts or \nany other individual Indian tribe what is protected for all other \nIndian tribes--the right to conduct governmental gaming activity on \ntheir own lands. It is unseemly to single out one Indian tribe for \ndiscriminatory treatment in this way.\n  If Rhode Island finds gaming so offensive, it now has the power to \nenact a criminal ban on such activity, as have Utah and Hawaii, and \nthereby preclude under Cabazon and IGRA the Narragansett Tribe from \nconducting any such gambling activity. Rhode Island now permits some \ngaming activity within its borders. The U.S. Supreme Court in Cabazon \nsaid an Indian tribe may exclusively regulate the conduct of those \ngames not otherwise prohibited under the criminal law of a State.\n  I have studied the situation in Rhode Island. I fail to see why the \nproponents of this section 330 feel a need to move it through on the \neve of adjournment in this way. The decided trend in the courts has \nbeen favoring States over the Indian tribes. The latest decision in \nSeminole has meant that an Indian tribe has no effective remedy against \na State for a State's refusal to negotiate.\n  I must say I would understand the position of the proponents of \nsection 330 if they were to raise it early next year rather than on the \neve of adjournment. For if the Secretary does issue proposed \nregulations in early 1997 in the way that was referenced in the 11th \nCircuit Court of Appeals holding in Seminole versus Florida, and if \nthey are written in such a way as to give the tribe something the State \ndoes not support, I would understand efforts made at that time by the \nSenators from Rhode Island to ban gaming on Narragansett Indian lands. \nI would still oppose them, in principle, but again, I would not block \nthem from having an opportunity to gain the full consideration of the \nSenate after a fair and full hearing of the authorizing committees of \njurisdiction.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, although as of last week this section 330 was \nopposed by the administration, and Interior Secretary Babbitt had \nwarned, in a letter to Senator Chafee, that if this language is \nincluded in an appropriations bill he would recommend that the \nPresident veto the bill, it now appears that section 330 was approved \nby the administration negotiators. The apparent turnabout of the \nadministration on this issue over the weekend, while not necessarily \nsurprising given this administration's pattern of flipping and flopping \nfrom 1 day to the next, is highly unfortunate. I for one cannot and \nwill not support such language.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I oppose section 330 \nand ask that both my colleagues and the administration never again \ncondone such an assault on one Indian tribe's basic rights and \nresponsibilities. Consideration of such a dramatic change in Federal-\nIndian policy should be reserved to the deliberate care of the \nauthorizing committees of jurisdiction.\n  I also strenuously oppose a new provision added late last week to the \nomnibus appropriations bill that would prohibit any effort to provide \ndirect funding to an Indian tribe of that tribe's share of Bureau of \nIndian Affairs central office or pooled overhead general administration \nfunds under Tribal Self-Determination or Self-Governance contracts, \ngrants, or funding agreements.\n  The new language appears in the unnumbered ``administrative \nprovisions'' section at the end of the funding provisions for the \nBureau of Indian Affairs--page 640 of the House-passed bill. The \nlanguage added is as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds \n     available to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for central office \n     operations or pooled overhead general administration shall be \n     available for tribal contracts, grants, compacts, or \n     cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     under the provision of the Indian Self-Determination Act or \n     the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-413).\n\n  Mr. President, I object to this language for two reasons. First, this \nrestrictive provision surfaced for the first time over the weekend. It \nhas not been part of any authorizing or appropriations committee bill \nlanguage this year.\n  Second, in 1994 the Congress expressly directed, in Public Law 103-\n413, that these BIA central office and general administrative funds be \navailable for negotiation into direct funding of tribal shares to all \ntribes asking for these funds. The new provision added during the \nweekend would expressly override Public Law 103-413.\n  I have always supported every fair and reasonable effort to shift \nmore of appropriated funds into direct, block-grant type transfers to \nIndian tribes. For this reason we have steadily opened up more and more \nof the BIA's funding sources to tribal Self-Determination and Self-\nGovernance negotiations, in order to allow those Indian tribes choosing \nto do so to receive these funds directly and administer them according \nto tribal priorities. Shifting funds in this way to Indian tribes is a \nvery effective way of reorganizing more and more on the BIA. One last \nbastion of bureaucratic power is the BIA central office and the general \nadministration or pooled overhead accounts maintained by the BIA. \nDespite Public Law 103-413, the administration has refused to transfer \nto Indian tribes the funds appropriated for these central office \naccounts on the basis that the Committees on Appropriations have \nobjected. Now, on the eve of regulations being issued that will fully \nimplement Public Law 103-413, the Committees on Appropriations have \nincluded express language nullifying the relevant provisions of Public \nLaw 103-413. I object to this process and oppose the outcome.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs actively addressed the issue of BIA \nreorganization during the 104th Congress. Early in 1996 we reported a \ncomprehensive BIA reorganization bill, S. 814, but further \nconsideration by the full Senate of S. 814 was precluded until last \nmonth when Senator Gorton removed a hold he had placed on the bill.\n  In the course of our discussions on his objections to S. 814, Senator \nGorton suggested we find some areas of common agreement as an interim \nstep that would increase the proportion of Federal funding that is \nplaced under the direct and flexible control of tribal governments. Our \nefforts were partially reflected in a section 118 which Senator Gorton \nadded to the Interior appropriations bill in committee, describing it \nas a ``work in progress.'' Unfortunately, our progress in developing \nlanguage to provide Indian tribes with direct and flexible control of a \nlarger share of Federal funding ground to a halt over several \nfundamental differences in approach.\n  In our discussions concerning section 118, I maintained my firm \nbelief that any such language must preserve an Indian tribe's choice to \nadminister some or all of the funds appropriated for its benefit, \nconsistent with the time-tested policies under the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act. I insisted that section 188 should be drafted in \nsuch a way as to allow an Indian tribe to decide to take over the \noperation of some or all programs. For example, a tribe may in its \nsovereign authority choose not to take over law enforcement operations, \nor some other particularly problematic area. Instead of some or all, \nSenator Gorton insisted that section 188 authority be for all or \nnothing, that a tribe choosing not to do everything would be precluded \nfrom doing some things. Another issue that divided us involved some \noversight language I felt was overly broad and sought to replace with a \nrequirement that applied to Indian tribes the financial accountability \nrequirements of the Indian Self-Determination Act, as amended. Whether \nor not education and transportation funds administered by the BIA \nshould have\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\nbeen excluded from the formula negotiations remained another area of \ndisagreement. Given these important differences, Indian tribes across \nthe country asked that section 118, in its incomplete form, be removed.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Gorton agreed to remove section \n118. I want to make something very clear--Senator Gorton and I have \nagreed that the BIA is in dire need of dramatic reorganization. He and \nI also have agreed that a preferred approach is to expand opportunities \nfor tribal self-determination and tribal self-governance. And so I am \nglad that he agreed to lift the annual limit on the number of tribes \nwho can be added to the 63 compacts now serving 210 of the total of 557 \ntribes. This amendment will permit 50 additional tribes to be added to \nthe Self-Governance Program each year.\n  However, I am profoundly disturbed by the fact that, without \nnegotiation or discussion, the Committee on Appropriations added a new \nprovision over the weekend to completely insulate nearly 100 million \ndollars' worth of BIA centralized bureaucracy from any transfer of \nfunds and associated authority to Indian tribes.\n  Appropriations staff say the administration asked for this provision. \nWell, this provision was not in the President's budget request. It was \nnot in the official administration testimony provided to the Committee \non Indian Affairs during our consideration of S. 814, the BIA \nreorganization bill. This provision is in direct contravention of \nprovisions of existing law in Public law 104-413, and I oppose it.\n  I strenuously oppose this end-of-the-session effort to protect the \nBIA bureaucracy from the tribal direct-funding initiatives that are now \nin existing law and I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this \nprovision.\n  Mr. President, in closing, again, I want to thank the managers of the \nbill for all their work. It does not go unappreciated. I only wish I \ncould support what they crafted, but for the reasons I have just \nexplained, I cannot.\n  Mr. President, sooner or later we are going to stop this. We are \ngoing to stop this kind of spending, and we can do it by passing \nappropriations bills one at a time with proper scrutiny and amending. \nBut, also, we can understand that our national defense and national \nsecurity deserves far better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of items \ndesignated as ``Emergency'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            ITEMS DESIGNATED AS ``EMERGENCY'' IN OMNIBUS BILL           \n              [Dollars in millions unless otherwise noted]              \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Dollars                     Item                     Page       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.6m..................

I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself 10 minutes on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the legislation before us includes a \nprovision that I authored that will prohibit anyone convicted of a \ncrime involving domestic violence from possessing firearms. I want to \ntake a few minutes of the Senate's time to reflect on just what that \nmeans.\n  We are today about to perform a great and moral act that a human \nbeing can perform--one of the best. We are about to save the life of \nanother person. Today, we are going to save the life of the ordinary \nAmerican woman, a woman who loves her kids, a woman who loves her \nfamily. Today, this ordinary American woman is married to someone who \nis generally a decent, law-abiding guy, but with one exception. \nSometimes when things get rough and the stresses of life build, he \nloses his temper because his emotions get the best of him. He loses \ncontrol, flies into a rage and then strikes out violently at those \nclosest to him.\n  Once he beat his wife brutally and was prosecuted, but like most wife \nbeaters, he pleaded down to a misdemeanor and got away with a slap on \nthe wrist.\n  Mr. President, next year, this fellow is going to lose his cool at \nwork, or with the boys, and he is going to go home one day and get into \nanother argument with his wife. As arguments often do, it will \nescalate, and this time, as before, it will get out of control. As \ntheir children huddle in fear, the anger will get physical, and almost \nwithout knowing what he is doing, with one hand he will strike his wife \nand with the other hand he will reach for the gun he keeps in his \ndrawer. In an instant their world will change. And this woman, this \nloving mother, this ordinary American, will die or be severely wounded.\n\n  Later, maybe the husband will go to prison. The children will be left \nparentless, and the effects of the tragedy will ripple for years \nthroughout their lives and throughout the lives of so many others.\n  Except, Mr. President, because of what we are about to do, this story \nis going to have a different ending.\n  Yes, the husband may lose his cool at work and, yes, maybe they will \nget into the same argument; yes, his rage will fly out of control; and \nyes, it will probably lead to violence. But when this man's hand \nreaches into that drawer, there will not be a gun there. So that fatal \ninstant, that moment of fleeting madness, will never happen.\n  In the end, that ordinary American woman, that loving mother, will \nend up being bruised, maybe she will end up unconscious in the \nhospital. But when the next day comes, hopefully, she will awaken, she \nwill see the morning Sun through her swollen eyes, and, if lucky, she \nwill leave the hospital and get on with her life, a life to see that \nfrightened child grow up and go to school. She will live to see him \ngraduate, find a job, and create his own family. That will happen \nbecause--and only because--we are about to save her life this day.\n  Mr. President, over the years there will be thousands of women like \nthis, each one with a family of loved ones, each one with their own \ndreams. And there will be children. And they will all live, Mr. \nPresident. They will all live because of what we do here this day.\n  Mr. President, you and I will never know the women and children whose \nlives we are about to save. They will never have a chance to thank us. \nThey will never know that their lives were spared.\n  But for the rest of our lives, you and I and other Senators, we will \nhave the privilege of knowing that we have lived up to the very highest \nof our own ideals. We have done nothing less than reach forward into \ntime, put our hands around tragedy and death and remolded it back into \nlife itself. We have done that many, many times, over and over and over \nagain.\n  Mr. President, this tremendous victory for the forces of life would \nnot\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\nhave happened but for the hard work and dedication of many people. I \nwant to express my deep appreciation to all of those who played a role.\n  In particular, I want to thank President Clinton, Leon Panetta, many \ndedicated men and women in the Clinton administration.\n  A moment ago, we saw the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mark Hatfield, on the floor. I want to thank him. He \nwas solidly behind our effort.\n  The commitment of the people I just mentioned to this cause was \nabsolutely essential to getting this done. I am grateful to the \nPresident for that support.\n  I also want to thank our distinguished Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle. He supported me in this effort from the beginning, from way \nback in the beginning of the year. His efforts in the final hours were \nof great help. I very much appreciate his commitment to the victims of \ndomestic abuse and for his friendship, notwithstanding my repeated \nphone calls to him to discuss this legislation.\n  I also want to publicly thank those who work in my office and in the \nSenate and many others here in Washington and around the country who \nhave helped make this possible. Over 30 national organizations got \nbehind this effort. Many, many people made significant contributions.\n  I particularly am appreciative of Sarah Brady and Handgun Control for \nraising this issue at the Democratic convention and giving it the \npublic attention that it required and deserved.\n  I want to thank the American Bar Association, whose public statement \non a weaker alternative version was critical in persuading my \ncolleagues not to try to water down the proposal. Also, the Coalition \nto Stop Gun Violence, who took the initiative to build support among a \nwide variety of other organizations, and the Violence Policy Center, \nthe National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Network \nAgainst Domestic Violence, all of whom helped sound the trumpet about \nthis legislation.\n  Many other groups also played important roles.\n  Mr. President, for the historical record, I would like to take the \nopportunity to discuss some of the history behind the domestic violence \ngun ban, and the changes in the legislative language that are \nincorporated into the final agreement.\n  Mr. President, I originally introduced the domestic violence gun ban \nas S. 1632 on March 21 of this year. After extensive negotiations with \nthe Republican leadership, including Senator Lott, Senator Craig, and \nSenator Hutchison, the proposal was then modified slightly and \nincorporated into an antistalking bill by a voice vote. Unfortunately, \nthe House failed to act on the antistalking bill. I then offered the \nmodified version of the legislation as an amendment to the fiscal year \n1997 Treasury, Postal Service and general Government appropriations \nbill, and the amendment was approved by a vote of 97 to 2. However, \nSenator Lott pulled the Treasury, Postal bill from the floor, and a \nversion of that legislation has now been incorporated into this omnibus \nspending bill.\n  The language in the final agreement was worked out early Saturday \nmorning, September 28, through further negotiations with the Republican \nleadership. Initially, opponents of my legislation had proposed to gut \nthe legislation, primarily by inserting three major loopholes. First, \nthey proposed to exclude child abusers from the ban, by limiting its \napplication only to crimes against intimate partners. This outrageous \nproposal was withdrawn once it was held up to public scrutiny.\n  Second, opponents of the gun ban proposed to limit the ban only to \noffenders who had been notified of the ban when they originally were \ncharged. This effectively would have exempted all currently convicted \noffenders from the ban. It also would have meant that most offenders in \nthe future would escape the ban, since there was no requirement that \nthey actually be notified. In effect, gun ban opponents wanted to say \nthat ignorance of the law would be an excuse for wife beaters, even \nthough it is not an excuse for anybody else. Eventually, this proposal, \ntoo, was dropped.\n  The third major loophole proposed by gun ban opponents was to limit \nthe ban only to offenders who had been entitled to a jury trial. This \nwould have rendered the ban close to meaningless, as the vast majority \nof these cases are heard before a judge, in a bench trial.\n  Those who proposed this new loophole eventually agreed to drop it \nentirely. Therefore, the ban will apply to all wife beaters and all \nchild abusers, regardless of whether they were convicted in a trial \nheard by a judge or a jury.\n  Mr. President, after agreeing to drop the jury trial requirement, \nopponents of a strong gun ban continued to express concern that gun \nrights should not be lost without an assurance that offenders will be \nprovided with all appropriate due process protections. To reassure them \non this point, we agreed to include in the final agreement a provision \nthat has no real substantive effect, but that may help to assure some \npeople that nobody will lose their ability to possess a gun because of \na flawed trial. This provision, in essence, states that the ban will \nnot apply to someone who was wrongly denied the right to a jury trial. \nMore specifically, the language protects from the ban anyone who had \nbeen entitled to a jury trial, but who did not receive such a jury \ntrial, or who did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a \njury trial.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, if an offender was wrongly denied the right \nto a jury trial, he was not legally convicted. And so this language \nreally does not change anything. But, again, as it provided needed \nreassurance to some, I agreed to it in order to facilitate the final \nagreement.\n  I do want to make very clear, however, that this language should not \nbe interpreted to indirectly include any requirement of notice for a \nwaiver to be considered to have been made knowingly and intelligently. \nThat is, one can plead guilty or otherwise effectively waive one's \nconstitutional right to a jury trial, and in considering the validity \nof such a waiver it is irrelevant whether the individual knew that a \nconviction will lead to a firearm ban. Although that should be clear \nfrom the face of the statute, given opponents' efforts to seek a notice \nrequirement, I wanted to state this definitively for the record. This \npoint was made very explicitly in the negotiations, and was agreed to \nby all sides.\n  Mr. President, the final agreement does include some minor changes to \nthe Senate-passed version that actually strengthen the ban slightly. \nLet me review some of them now.\n  First, the revised language includes a new definition of the crimes \nfor which the gun ban will be imposed. Under the original version, \nthese were defined as crimes of violence against certain individuals, \nessentially family members. Some argued that the term crime of violence \nwas too broad, and could be interpreted to include an act such as \ncutting up a credit card with a pair of scissors. Although this concern \nseemed far-fetched to me, I did agree to a new definition of covered \ncrimes that is more precise, and probably broader.\n  Under the final agreement, the ban applies to crimes that have, as an \nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened \nuse of a deadly weapon. This is an improvement over the earlier \nversion, which did not explicitly include within the ban crimes \ninvolving an attempt to use force, or the threatened use of a weapon, \nif such an attempt or threat did not also involve actual physical \nviolence. In my view, anyone who attempts or threatens violence against \na loved one has demonstrated that he or she poses an unacceptable risk, \nand should be prohibited from possessing firearms.\n  Mr. President, another new provision in the final agreement clarifies \nthat a conviction will not lead to a firearm disability if the \nconviction has been expunged or set aside, or is for an offense for \nwhich the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored. \nThis language mirrors similar language in current law that applies to \nthose convicted of felonies.\n\n  I would note that the language on civil rights restoration, as it has \nbeen applied in the past, and as it should be interpreted in the \nfuture, refers only to major civil rights, such as the right to vote, \nto hold public office, and to serve on a jury. Loss of these rights \ngenerally does not flow from a misdemeanor conviction, and so this \nlanguage is probably irrelevant to most, if\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\nnot all, of those offenders covered because of the new ban. But I want \nto make it clear that the restoration of any firearm rights under state \nlaw would not amount to a civil rights restoration for these purposes. \nIn fact, any such State law effectively would be preempted by this \nlanguage, and so could not have any legal effect.\n  Mr. President, I now want to take a moment to briefly discuss the \nimplementation of this new law.\n  Mr. President, the final agreement does not merely make it against \nthe law for someone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic \nviolence from possessing firearms. It also incorporates this new \ncategory of offenders into the Brady law, which provides for a waiting \nperiod for handgun purchases. Under the Brady law, local law \nenforcement authorities are required to make reasonable efforts to \nensure that those who are seeking to purchase a handgun are not \nprohibited under Federal law from doing so.\n  Mr. President, convictions for domestic violence-related crimes often \nare for crimes, such as assault, that are not explicitly identified as \nrelated to domestic violence. Therefore, it will not always be possible \nfor law enforcement authorities to determine from the face of someone's \ncriminal record whether a particular misdemeanor conviction involves \ndomestic violence, as defined in the new law.\n  Mr. President, I would strongly urge law enforcement authorities to \nthoroughly investigate misdemeanor convictions on an applicant's \ncriminal record to ensure that none involves domestic violence, before \nallowing the sale of a handgun. After all, for many battered women and \nabused children, whether their abuser gets access to a gun will be \nnothing short of a matter of life and death. I am hopeful that law \nenforcement officials always will keep that in mind as they implement \nthis requirement.\n  Having said this, Mr. President, I recognize that there are limits to \nthe ability of many law enforcement agencies to conduct in depth \ninvestigations of large numbers of applicants for handgun purchases. \nThe law requires that these agencies make a reasonable effort to \ninvestigate applicants. What is a reasonable effort depends upon the \nlocal law enforcement officials' available time, resources, access to \nrecords, and their own law enforcement priorities.\n  In my view, the reasonable effort requirement should not be \ninterpreted so broadly that it would substantially interfere with the \nability of a law enforcement agency to carry out its central mission of \napprehending criminals and protecting the public from crime. At the \nsame time, it should not be interpreted so narrowly that it would allow \nlaw enforcement agencies to routinely ignore misdemeanor convictions \nfor violent crimes, without further exploration into whether these \ncrimes involved domestic violence. So long as an agency makes a \nreasonable effort to do so, the requirements of the law would be met. \nHowever, again, I would strongly urge law enforcement officials to make \nthis a top priority.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to acknowledge some of the many people \nwho have played a role in moving this legislation forward.\n  As I noted earlier, I am especially grateful to President Clinton for \nhis strong support of this initiative, which was absolutely essential \nto its enactment.\n  I also want to again thank many of the organizations and people who \nhave supported the effort. In addition to those I mentioned earlier, \nthese include the American Academy of Pediatrics; Children's Defense \nFund; Consumer Federation of America; Family Violence Prevention Fund; \nthe National Center on Women and Family Law; the Center for Women \nPolicy Studies; American Ethical Union; Church of the Brethren; \nAmerican Friends Service Committee; Friends Committee on National \nLegislation; Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs; American Public \nHealth Association; American Jewish Committee; AYUDA; Church Women \nUnited; Congress of National Black Churches; Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch in America; YWCA of the USA; United Methodist Church, General \nBoard of Church and Society; Peace Action, National Clearinghouse for \nthe Defense of Battered Women, National Urban League; NOW; National \nCouncil of Jewish Women; Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence; Physicians for Social Responsibility; Presbyterian Church \nUSA; Union of American Hebrew Congregations; Unitarian Universalists \nAssociation; United Church of Christ; and Justice for Kids.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will \nsave the lives of many battered wives and abused children. And it will \nsend a message that, as a nation, we are determined to take the problem \nof domestic violence seriously.\n  Mr. President, getting this legislation enacted has been a long and \nvery difficult struggle. We had to overcome intense opposition from one \nof the most powerful special interests in American politics. We have \novercome one roadblock after the next, and there have been several \ntimes when I did not think we would make it.\n  But throughout it all, the supporters of this bill have always kept \nin mind that we were fighting for literally a matter of life and death. \nThat knowledge has helped sustain us and make us that much more \ndetermined as we have worked our way through the legislative minefield.\n  So, in the end, we have a glorious victory, a victory for America's \nfrightened, battered women, a victory for our abused children, a \nvictory of life over death.\n  I am honored and humbled to have been able to play a part in this \nlegislation. We hope that the enforcement of the law will be as rigid \nas the law very simply defines it. If you beat your wife, if you beat \nyour child, if you abuse your family and you are convicted, even of a \nmisdemeanor, you have no right to possess a gun. That is the way it \nought to be. Lord willing, it will be. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 4 minutes and Senator Helms be permitted to \nspeak for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I may not use all of my time.\n  Mr. President, first, I want to say this is not a pretty bill. There \nare plenty of reasons to be against it. But there are far more reasons \nto be for it, not the least of which is the fact that this bill will \nclose out the appropriations for the year and the Government of the \nUnited States will continue to operate for the next 12 months.\n  Having said that, I think there are a couple of people we should \nthank: First of all, the chairman of the full committee, Senator Mark \nHatfield, for his hard work, long hours, and diligent insistence on \ngetting this done. To our distinguished majority leader, who, in a \nshort time as leader, has understood these processes better than most \nof us who have been here a long time. Indeed, he did what most of us \nthought was the right thing to do, and he got right in the middle of it \nand got this job done. My compliments go out to him.\n  Mr. President, I have commented here on the floor and included an \namendment heretofore in the foreign operations appropriations bill with \nreference to the drugs that are coming across the southwest border. I \nhave not been very congenial with the Mexican Government because I \nbelieve they are not doing everything they can to prosecute the drug \nkingpins residing in Mexico. I think these kingpins are going to bring \nMexico's Government to a standstill in the very near future.\n  So, to make sure that the United States is doing its share with \nrespect to the southwest border, where 70 percent of the cocaine comes \ninto America--it does not come other ways, it comes right across the \nland of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California--many of us said we \nbetter do as much as we can to make sure that the border is as well \nprotected as possible.\n  I want to say to the U.S. Senate and to the people of this country \nthat we have done that in this bill. There is total funding in this \nbill for the U.S. attorneys of $987 million, including a setaside of \n$4.6 million to prosecute cases on this southwest border where there is \nan enormous overload because of this drug trafficking.\n  There is over $1 billion for the Drug Enforcement Agency, an increase \nof\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\n$200 million over last year. This includes a southwest border \ninitiative which provide the following: $9 million for cooperative \nefforts with the FBI to penetrate command and control communications of \nMexican drug traffickers; $8 million and 50 agents to investigate leads \nobtained from new wiretap authority to be used against drug dealers on \nthe border; over $2 million to focus on methamphetamine trafficking; \nand $4 million for classified intelligence research; $11 million for \n130 new special DEA staff and field office needs to support the mobile \nenforcement teams on that border. The DEA funding also includes $55 \nmillion to expand the DEA's current supply reduction efforts and \nrestore funding for international drug control Program to the same \nlevel as it was in 1992. It has been reduced since then, and it is now \nback to that 1992 level. Mr. President, this bill also includes $2.1 \nbillion for the INS, including $121 million for 1,000 new Border Patrol \nagents, $27 million for equipment, including infrared scopes and \ncensors to track and intercept drug smugglers, and $12 million for 150 \nnew land border inspectors.\n\n  I believe this is an excellent commitment on the part of the U.S. \nGovernment, and when signed into law it will do as much as we can to \ncontrol drugs on the border.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when Hurricane Fran swept across North \nCarolina on September 5, it left a path of unprecedented destruction; \nthousands of citizens lost their homes, their cars, their farms, or \ntheir businesses. The cost of the damage exceeds $5 billion, making \nthat the most devastating disaster in North Carolina's history.\n  I am delighted that after weeks of negotiations, North Carolina will \nreceive a total of $1.8 billion in disaster aid. This much needed \nassistance will assist farmers, homeowners, and small businessmen in \ngetting back on their feet.\n  From the outset, we worked closely with the North Carolina delegation \nand with Gov. James B. Hunt in developing a package to provide adequate \nfunds for disaster relief. We made clear that in light of the enormous \ndamage to North Carolina, we would seek a total of $2 billion. Last \nweek, we secured $1.3 billion for FEMA for funds to provide emergency \nassistance, temporary housing, and debris removal.\n  Mr. President, the pending legislation allocates an additional $500 \nmillion for various programs that provide needed services. For example, \nthe Department of Agriculture is authorized to provide emergency loans \nto farmers, the Army Corps of Engineers can perform debris removal, \ndredging, and beach renourishment, and the Small Business \nAdministration can help out with low-cost loans.\n  I am deeply grateful to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Assistant \nMajority Leader Don Nickles, and the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Mark Hatfield, the ranking member, Senator \nRobert C. Byrd, and others, for standing firm and helping preserve the \n$1.8 billion total.\n  In the process, President Clinton proposed in effect to cut North \nCarolina's request by $434 million. It was reported that the President \nsought an increase of $225 million of the U.S. taxpayers' money to be \ngiven to the United Nations and the State Department while cutting the \ndisaster aid to North Carolina.\n  In the end, we worked with Senators Lott, Nickles, Byrd, Hatfield, \nand others to ensure that sufficient funds would be allocated for \ndisaster relief irrespective of any request for funds filed by the \nWhite House.\n  North Carolinians have unfailingly supported other States where \ndisasters have struck. So we are thankful that other states have now \nsupported our efforts to secure adequate funds for North Carolina in \nits effort to recover from disaster.\n  The road to recovery will be a long one, but I hope that these \nFederal disaster funds will make the process a bit easier for our \ncitizens who have suffered so much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate contains the \nconference agreement reached by the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nwith the House on the bill H.R. 3610, the Fiscal Year 1997 Department \nof Defense Appropriations Act. I am proud of this bill, and urge all \nMembers to support the conference report.\n  We initially reported this bill to the Senate on June 21, 1996. We \npassed the bill in July, and intended to proceed to conference. Sadly, \nthe House chairman, Bill Young, was temporarily out of action due to \nheart surgery. I am pleased to report that Chairman Young's vigorous \nand determined leadership this past month testified to his complete \nrecovery from the problems that caused his brief absence in July.\n  Despite this delay, we completed our work on Thursday, September 12, \nand expected the bill to come back before Congress the following week. \nIntervention by the White House resulted in the delay that brings the \ndefense bill before the Senate today, as part of this omnibus \nappropriations package. Happily, the content of the bill remains as set \nby the conferees earlier this month.\n  The conference report provides a total of $243.946 billion in new \nbudget authority for the Department of Defense for 1997. That total is \n$950 million less than the level passed by the Senate, and $1.3 billion \nless than the House passed bill.\n  Compared to the President's budget, the bill provides $9.268 billion \nmore than he sought for 1997. But when compared to the 1996 level, \nincluding all the supplementals for Bosnia and other overseas \ncontingencies, this bill is effectively a freeze at the 1996 level. In \nmy view, the amounts provided in this bill are the bare minimum that \ncan be provided for our national defense.\n  This conference report remains true to the priorities set by the \nSenate in its version of the bill. We have fully funded the pay raise \nfor military personnel, and added funds above the President's request \nfor housing, barracks, and health care. This conference report truly \nenhances the quality of life for military personnel, their families, \nand retirees. That is our obligation and duty, and we have discharged \nthat responsibility in this bill.\n  The increases in the bill compared to the President's budget are \nspread among all titles. Personnel spending is increased by $233.7 \nmillion. Operation and maintenance spending is increased by $701 \nmillion. Procurement spending is increased by $5.7 billion, but remains \n$253 million less than the amount provided by Congress for 1996. \nResearch and development accounts are increased by $2.7 billion, an \nincrease of $951 over the level provided for 1996.\n  The increase for R addresses the commitment of this Republican \nmajority Congress to put us on the path to a meaningful ballistic \nmissile defense program. I especially note the increase of $325 million \nfor national missile defense, including funds for the Air Force \nMinuteman II based national missile defense concept. We must accelerate \nto the maximum extent technology will permit work on a real national \nmissile defense system. The funds in this conference report keep us on \nthat path.\n  Additionally, we provide $137 million for breast cancer research in \nthe conference report, and $45 million to establish a new prostate \ncancer research initiative through DOD. I want to note Chairman \nHatfield's leadership in expanding the funding in the bill to fight \nprostate cancer.\n  I want to close by thanking my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, \nfor his commitment to getting this bill through, and working to achieve \na true bi-partisan consensus. Additionally, it was a great pleasure to \nwork once again with the House subcommittee, led by Chairman Bill \nYoung, and the ranking member, Jack Murtha.\n  This conference report is a compromise. We sought to accommodate the \nconcerns of the Joint Chiefs, our colleagues, and the Secretary to the \nmaximum extent possible. I ask all my colleagues understanding where we \nwere not able to fully fund their concerns--we started this conference \nwith a difference of $16 billion between the two bills. I believe the \nbill reflects a fair settlement between the House and Senate positions, \nand I urge adoption of the conference report by the Senate.\n\n\n        fiscal year 1997 department of defense conference report\n\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could get the attention of the distinguished chairman \nof the Defense Subcommittee, I would\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\nlike to discuss a matter of great importance to our National Guard and \nReserve forces.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to engage in a discussion with the \ndistinguished majority leader in any matter dealing with enhancements \nof our Reserve component forces.\n  Mr. LOTT. As the chairman is well aware, the primary antitank missile \nsystem deployed by Reserve component forces is the 1970's vintage \nDragon missile. While the Active forces are just now beginning the \ninitial procurement and deployment of the vastly superior Javelin \nmissile system, the Dragon will remain the mainstay in the Reserve \ncomponents' inventory well past the turn of the century. Being that \nthis is the case, the National Guard Bureau has identified the need to \ndevelop safety and capability improvements to the Dragon system to make \nNational Guard units more compatible with Active component forces. As I \nhave been briefed, this will be a two part process.\n  The first issue the National Guard Bureau wishes to address is safety \nmodifications to the Dragon missile. A majority of the on-hand \ninventory has a safety flaw that has been identified and for which a \nsolution has already been developed. In fact, the Marine Corps has \nalready contracted to have their Dragon assets modified to resolve this \nsafety shortfall. There is an urgent need to apply this modification to \nthe Army's missile inventory.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The majority leader is well informed about this critical \nsafety shortfall in the Dragon missile system and because of his \nleadership on this issue, the Senate-passed Defense appropriations bill \nincluded $4.9 million to complete safety modification on the entire \ninventory of National Guard Dragon missiles. I am also pleased to \ninform the leader that because of his interest and support, the \nconference report before the Senate today includes the full amount \nproposed in the Senate bill for the safety modifications.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am very pleased the Senate was able to prevail on this \ncritical safety enhancement for our Reserve component forces and that \nthese funds are included in this conference report. I would, however, \nlike to also point out that there is a capability shortfall identified \nby the National Guard that also need to be addressed by this body.\n  With the knowledge that the Dragon missile may remain in the Reserve \ncomponents' inventory for as much as 10 more years, I believe it is \nimperative that the National Guard Bureau look at all possible \nmodifications that can improve the range and lethality of the Dragon \nsystem. My staff and I have been briefed on a modification known as the \nSuper Dragon that can potentially improve the current generation \nDragon's capability to 95 percent of the Javelin missile system. The \nmodification will significantly increase the Dragon's range, minimize \nits launch signature, double its speed, and give the Dragon missile the \ncapability to defeat all known modern armor threats. Much of the \ndevelopment work has already been completed and with a modest \ninvestment of an additional $25 million, development, pre-production \nengineering and system qualification work can be completed in less than \n16 months.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to inform my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi that this conference report includes explicit directions to \nthe Secretary of the Army to submit a report to the congressional \ndefense committees, no later than April 1, 1997, detailing the \nrequirement, cost, and schedule for the various Dragon upgrade options \nunder consideration. Further, the conference report also includes $100 \nmillion of miscellaneous procurement funds under the direct control of \nthe Chief of the Army National Guard, a portion of which, could be used \nfor the Dragon development effort. If the report from the Secretary of \nthe Army is supportive of the Dragon modification, I would expect the \nChief of the National Guard Bureau to give immediate consideration to \nusing miscellaneous procurement funds under his control to proceed with \nthis development effort.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman for his \nsupport in this conference report for Dragon missile system \nimprovements and look forward to the Secretary of the Army's report on \nthis important issue to our National Guard forces.\n\n\n               environmental restoration database funding\n\n  Mr. SPECTOR. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee an \nimportant provision in the Defense Department appropriations conference \nreport. In particular, I would like to confirm my understanding that \nthe Department of the Air Force is expected to provide initial start-up \nfunds in the amount of $72,000 for the establishment of a comprehensive \ndatabase which incorporates data from current and future environmental \ninvestigations at the former Olmsted Air Force Base, to be located at \nPennsylvania State University at Harrisburg, PA.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nknows, the conference report provides $123,000 over 5 years for \nestablishing and maintaining the database, which is necessary for \nsafety and hazard mitigation after the site is delisted from the \nnational priority list of Superfund sites. I understand that the \ninitial start-up costs are a disproportionate amount of the total \n$123,000 and would occur that the Department should provide at least \n$72,000 in fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. SPECTOR. I thank my good friend, the chairman, and again express \nmy appreciation for his effort on the Olmsted AFB cleanup issue.\n\n\n           federally funded research and development centers\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague and \nchairman on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee about the \nconference report's treatment of Defense's federally funded research \nand development centers, or FFRDC's.\n  These institutions are unique in their capabilities to provide the \nDefense Department (DOD) with specialized scientific, engineering, and \nanalytical knowledge important to national security.\n  I am very proud that New England is the home of two of the premiere \ndefense FFRDC's: the Lincoln Laboratory operated by the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, and the Mitre Corporation. Lincoln Lab is \nsponsored by the Air Force, and Mitre is sponsored by the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I want to discuss an issue affecting the Lincoln Laboratory. Lincoln \nLaboratory has been a leader in the fields of ballistic missile \ndefense, communications, space and surface surveillance, and advanced \nelectronics.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues, and as guidance to the Defense \nDepartment, would the chairman be willing to elaborate on the \nconferees, action regarding defense FFRDC's?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to highlight our action. In past years, \nthe annual Defense Department appropriations acts have included a \nstatutory ceiling on the total amount of funds which might be allocated \nby the Department for its 10 FFRDC's.\n  In response to DOD's request that it be allowed to manage overall \nFFRDC resources through staff years of technical effort instead of \ndollars, the conference agreement for fiscal year 1997 includes such a \nstatutory limit.\n  The Department is required to control its staff years to maintain \ntotal FFRDC spending at the fiscal year 1996 level, but the conferees \ndid agree that limits on staff years were a more appropriate management \nmechanism for fiscal year 1997. This was a reasonable compromise which \ntries to address DOD's concerns while at the same time not obscuring \nthe budgetary impacts of funding FFRDC's, which has been a concern to \nthe Defense Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GREGG. As the chairman knows, the use of a statutory dollar \nlimitation during fiscal year 1996 inadvertently perturbed the funds \nmade available to Lincoln Laboratory to acquire industry support for \nmajor development or demonstration activities. Would the chairman \ncomment on this situation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The problem faced by Lincoln Laboratory for fiscal year \n1996 was caused not by the statutory dollar ceiling but by the Defense \nDepartment. DOD chose--unwisely in my view--to assign a lower priority \nto the lab's allocation and a higher priority to funding the studies \nand analyses FFRDC's. I disagreed with that decision. I wrote to the \nDepartment and urged it to assign a much higher priority to the Lincoln \nLaboratory programs. The Department chose to do otherwise, and I regret \nits choice.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the distinguished chairman believe that the \nconference agreement now before us eliminates this dilemma for Lincoln \nLaboratory for fiscal year 1997?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I certainly do. The limitation on staff years \nspecifically does not apply to the funds needed by Lincoln Lab to \nacquire industry support for major system development or \ndemonstrations. It is the conferees, understanding that these funds are \nused to contract with industry and are not used to expand staff years \nof technical effort at the laboratory.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman for this clarification.\n\n\n    undergraduate flight officer training T-39N AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend and \ndistinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in a \nbrief colloquy regarding section 8110 of the Defense Appropriations \nconference report now before the Senate.\n  Section 8110 governs the procurement by the Navy of T-39N aircraft to \nconduct undergraduate flight officer training. These aircraft currently \nare provided to the Navy under a services contract. The Navy needs to \nacquire these aircraft expeditiously in order to avoid a break in \ntraining, and procurement of the T-39N aircraft under the conditions \noutlined in this section is in the best interests of the Navy and of \nthe taxpayers.\n  In this regard, I understand that some in the Navy need clarification \nabout the conditions regarding this procurement contained in section \n137 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 and \nin Section 124 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 1997.\n  I would like to provide this clarification by discussing the matter \nwith the Defense Subcommittee chairman. Would the distinguished \nchairman agree with me that section 8110 states clearly that the \nprocurement of these T-39N aircraft should go forward ``notwithstanding \nany other provision of law''?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Would the chairman also agree that these words were \nincluded to waive expressly any other statutory language regarding this \nissue, including sections 137 and 124 of the respective authorization \nacts? Would the chairman also agree that the conferees agreed that \nprocurement of these T-39N aircraft for undergraduate flight officer \ntraining is important for our national security and should occur \nwithout further delay?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with my colleagues on both statements.\n  Mr. BOND. Would the chairman agree further that the inclusion of this \nphrase should remove any doubt in any quarters about which aircraft \nshould be procured and under what conditions they should be procured?\n  Mr. STEVENS. My colleague is correct. That was the objective of the \nconferees in including this language.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my friend for his clarifying remarks.\n\n\n                       Attention Deficit Disorder\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to take a moment to discuss language included \nin the statement of the managers to the fiscal year 1997 Defense \nappropriations bill conference report relating to attention deficit \ndisorder.\n  First, I want to thank the managers, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nStevens] and the distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] for their sensitivity in recognizing the importance of \nthis issue. I also want to thank the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] \nfor his work on this issue.\n  Attention Deficit Disorder [ADD] and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder [ADHD], are neurobiological disorders characterized by \ninattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. In the past it was \nbelieved that these were disorders that primarily affected children. \nMore recently, however, experts have concluded that this is not true. \nAs many as 40 percent of children with ADD or ADHD have functionally \nimpairing symptoms which continue into adult life. This is especially \ntrue of young males.\n  As the managers noted, in some cases these disorders can make \nsuccessful service difficult without some accommodations, especially \nfor those who require the moderating influence of certain prescription \npharmaceuticals, the use of which is prohibited by military \nregulations. It is important to note, however, that many individuals \nwith ADD and ADHD serve successfully in the military and it is not our \nintention to bar or discourage individuals with ADD and ADHD from \nmilitary service.\n  Mr. GRAMS: I want to second the comments of my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, and I, too, want to thank the distinguished \nsenior Senators from Alaska and Hawaii for their work in ensuring that \nthe conferees addressed the issue of attention deficit disorder and \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the military before they \ncompleted action on the fiscal year 1997 Defense budget.\n  Unfortunately, it came to our attention that the services had no \nprograms in place to educate key personnel about how to recognize and \ntreat ADD/ADHD. We became aware of this deficiency through tragic \ncircumstances. A constituent, Thomas Swenson of Marshfield, WI, had a \nson who was murdered while serving in the Navy. Aaron Swenson had ADHD. \nAs Senator Kohl noted, in its severest form, this disorder can create a \ndramatic level of impulsivity, restlessness, and difficulty modulating \nresponses to given situations. Aaron Swenson's parents believe that his \nADHD--which he concealed at the time of his recruitment--made it \ndifficult, if not impossible, for him to serve 6 years in the Navy's \nelectronics school at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Further, \nthey believe that Aaron's ADHD played a role in putting him in harm's \nway.\n  There is widespread public awareness of ADD/ADHD. Yet, after his many \nmeetings with Navy officials--some of them very senior officials--\nThomas Swenson concluded that the services have little knowledge of \nADD. He subsequently met with both of us and urged us to do something \nto educate the services about the prevalence of ADD/ADHD among young \nadults, particularly as these disorders relate to potential recruits.\n  Thus, it is our hope that this language encourages the military \nservices to do all they can to recognize, treat, and humanely deal with \nrecruits and service members with ADD and ADHD.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the work of the Senators from Wisconsin and \nMinnesota on this issue. As my colleagues are aware, the Defense \nDepartment has informed me that it has a familiarization program to \nhelp training instructors and health care professionals recognize and \nevaluate recruits with attention deficit disorder and attention deficit \nhyperactivity disorder at basic training bases. The conferees have \nencouraged the Department of Defense to continue this familiarization \nprogram so that personnel who deal with potential recruits and service \nmembers beyond basic training are able to recognize the characteristics \nand markers of these disorders.\n  Mr. KOHL. I welcome the comments of the senior Senator from Alaska. I \nunderstand that since we first approached the Defense Subcommittee \nabout this issue that the Defense Department has agreed to meet with a \nprominent national organization, Children and Adults with Attention \nDeficit Disorders [CHADD] to discuss these issues further. I am glad \nthat the Department of Defense is drawing on the expertise of \norganizations and national experts who already have extensive knowledge \nabout ADD and ADHD. I encourage the services to do all they can to \naddress the needs and ensure the success of persons with ADD and ADHD \nin the services.\n\n\n   combating illegal immigration: an opportunity to make a difference\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, we will pass legislation we hope will \nsignificantly reduce illegal immigration in this country.\n  We could have passed this bill in the Senate last week. \nUnfortunately, partisan politics almost derailed efforts of the \nCongress, and particularly the efforts of the chairman of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, Alan Simpson, who, under extraordinary \ncircumstances, has worked long and hard to produce a bipartisan, far-\nreaching immigration bill.\n  That is because, in the end, the Clinton administration threatened to \nveto either the omnibus appropriations\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\nbill--and shut down the Federal Government--or a stand-alone \nimmigration bill unless some of our reforms were deleted from title 5 \nof the immigration conference report. It is interesting that the \nimmigration conference report, with title 5 intact, passed the House \nlast week with bipartisan support by a vote of 305-123. Notwithstanding \nthis strong support, in order to ensure passage of this historic \nimmigration measure, important provisions of title 5 have been deleted.\n  One of the most important provisions dropped from title 5 would have \nrequired that sponsors who bring their immigrant relatives into the \nUnited States earn 200 percent of poverty in order to bring in extended \nrelatives or 140 percent of poverty when they sponsor their spouses or \ntheir minor children. Revised title 5 changed the income requirement \nfor all sponsors to 125 percent of poverty. At that income level, the \nsponsor could already be participating in several welfare-related \nprograms, including, but not limited to, food stamps, reduced school \nlunch, Medicaid for pregnant women and children under the age of 6, and \nthe Women, Infants, and Children [WIC] program. In other words, the \nsponsors may well not be capable of supporting the immigrants they \nsponsor.\n  Another provision that was removed from title 5 would have clarified \nthe definition of ``public charge.'' Under the House-passed conference \nreport, an immigrant could be deported--but would not necessarily be \ndeported--if he or she received Federal public benefits for an \naggregate of 12 months over a period of 7 years. That provision was \ndropped during Saturday's negotiations.\n  The House-passed conference report would have required that public \nhousing authorities verify the status of individuals who obtain public \nhousing benefits. Individuals would have had 3 months to verify their \nstatus with a public housing authority or they would be required to \nvacate the unit. Revised title 5 will give an illegal alien 18 months \nto vacate the housing unit. In addition, revised title 5 will now give \ndiscretionary authority to public housing authorities to determine \nwhether or not they will verify if someone in this country has a legal \nright to federally-assisted housing. This doesn't make sense to me \nsince, in my home State of Arizona, officials of the Maricopa County \nHousing Authority alone estimate that 40 percent of the people \nreceiving housing assistance in the county are illegal aliens. In \nMaricopa County, there are 1,334 section 8 units and 917 units \navailable. There are over 6,500 individuals on the waiting list there.\n  There are other provisions in title 5 that shouldn't have been \ndropped from the immigration conference report. It is my hope that in \nthe future, partisan politics will play a smaller role than it did on \nSaturday in efforts to effectively reform our Nation's immigration \nlaws.\n  Having said that, I do believe it would be a great disservice to the \npeople of Arizona and the rest of the Nation if this illegal \nimmigration conference report were not to pass the Congress during the \n104th Congress.\n  In Arizona's Tucson sector alone, the U.S. Border Patrol has \napprehended more than 300,000 illegal aliens this year. It is estimated \nthat for every illegal immigrant arrested, four slip through \nundetected. These undetected entrants are costing Arizonans millions of \ndollars. In fact, the State of Arizona estimates that it spends over \n$200 million each year on the medical care, education, and \nincarceration of undocumented immigrants. That's about equal to what \nthe State spends each year to run Arizona State University.\n  With this immigration bill, we have the opportunity to lift this \nfinancial burden off the States by forcing the Federal Government to \ntake responsibility for reducing illegal immigration, and to reimburse \nStates for many of the illegal immigration-related costs they incur.\n  Perhaps most importantly for Arizona, under the immigration \nconference report, our borders will be better secured. One of my \namendments to the bill will increase the number of border patrol agents \nby 5,000 over 5 years, nearly doubling the current number of agents. An \nincreased border patrol presence in Arizona will help cities and towns \nsuch as Nogales, Naco, and Douglas, which have experienced surges in \nillegal immigration and border-related crime.\n\n  The immigration bill will also require that the security features on \nthe border-crossing card be improved to counter fraud. There will be \nnew monetary and civil penalties for illegal entry. In addition, every \nillegal immigration apprehended will be fingerprinted. Preinspection at \nforeign airports of passenger bound for the U.S. will be increased. The \nbill creates a mandatory, expedited removal process for aliens arriving \nwithout proper documentation, except if they have a credible fear of \npersecution in their home countries. Penalties for alien smugglers will \nbe increased and deportation of criminal aliens will be expedited.\n  In addition to beefing up our borders, the bill cracks down on those \nindividuals who overstay their visas. Half of those who temporarily \nenter the country legally remain here illegally. The bill requires that \nan entry-exit control system be developed to track those individuals. \nVisas overstayers will also be ineligible to return to the U.S. for a \nnumber of years, depending on how long they overstayed their visas.\n  The immigration bill also provides for mandatory detention of most \ndeportable, criminal aliens and requires that those aliens be deported \nwithin 90 days. The bill also authorize $150 million for the costs of \ndetaining and removing deportable or inadmissible aliens and increases \nthe number of detention spaces to 9,000 by the end of 1997.\n  Finally, this immigration bill will remove many of the incentives for \nillegal entry. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates \nthat 10 percent of the workforce in Arizona is made up of illegal \naliens. H.R. 2202 sets up three pilot projects, to be implemented in \nhigh illegal immigration States, that will determine the employment \neligibility of workers and thereby reduce the number of illegal aliens \ntrying to get U.S. jobs.\n  While I may well vote against the omnibus bill to which this \nlegislation is attached and while I am very disappointed about the last \nminute changes to the immigration part of the bill, I nevertheless \nbelieve that part of the omnibus bill should be passed. I am confident \nthat this legislation is the keystone we will build upon in the future.\n\n\n                                  hcfa\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we consider funding for the Health Care \nFinancing Administration [HCFA], I would like to commend the conferees \nfor including a reference in the Statement of Managers of the \nConference to a demonstration program that will demonstrate and \nevaluate the best approaches for a community health care center to \nprovide services through a health care network.\n  We are well aware of the tumultuous changes occurring in the health \ncare field as managed care becomes more and more predominant. For those \nwho are involved in the services of community health centers, whether \nas providers or patients, the uncertainty of the current health care \nlandscape can be overwhelming. As health care networks are formed, \ncommunity health centers can either participate in this phenomenon or \nrisk being excluded from the networks. Exclusion is tantamount to \nseverely limiting the patient's medical options, which is a repudiation \nof the centers' mission and mandate to serve the less advantaged among \nus.\n  One community health center in particular, with which I am familiar, \nis Swope Parkway Health Center in Kansas City, MO. Swope Parkway was \nfounded in 1969 and serves about 35,000 patients each year as a \nfederally qualified community health center. Its approach to health \ncare is uniquely comprehensive, combining medical and behavioral health \nand social services, housing and economic development. Swope Parkway \nhas decided to assure its patient continued quality health coverage by \nforming a health maintenance organization [HMO] and developing its own \nnetwork of providers.\n  It is my understanding that Swope Parkway is one of the first--but in \nall likelihood not the last--federally qualified community health \ncenters in the Nation to assume full risk and has formed a new HMO. \nGiven the Federal funding that has been dedicated over the years to \ncommunity health centers, it would seem logical in this time\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\nof transition to managed care to demonstrate various approaches for \ncommunity health centers to determine and deliver the most cost-\neffective way to provide services and maintain the quality of care to \nlow-income patients in urban settings.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the conferees are recommending that \nHCFA conduct such a demonstration as part of its Research, \nDemonstration, and Evaluation Program, and I strongly urge them to \nconsider Swope Parkway Health Center as the site for this \ndemonstration.\n\n\n                          ryan white care act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to engage the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee in a brief colloquy concerning \npediatric AIDS demonstrations funded under title IV of the Ryan White \nCARE Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I, too, would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would first like to commend and thank the chairman \nand the ranking member for their work to ensure our Nation's continued \nstrong commitment to our children and families tragically infected with \nHIV by providing a funding increase for title IV of the Ryan White CARE \nAct. Title IV programs are designed to coordinate health care and \nassure that it is focused on families' needs and based in their \ncommunities. These programs are the providers of care to the majority \nof children, youth, and families with HIV/AIDS in our country, ensuring \nthese families have access to the comprehensive array of services they \nneed.\n  The original Senate report stated that a portion of the title IV \nfunds should be used to provide peer-based training and technical \nassistance through national organizations that collaborate with \nprojects to ensure development of innovative models of family centered \nand youth centered care; advanced provider training for pediatric, \nadolescent, and family HIV providers; coordination with research \nprograms, and other technical assistance activities. Is it correct that \nthe managers intend to continue support of national organizations \nproviding training and technical assistance, including the National \nPediatric and Family HIV Resource Center located within the University \nof Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in this legislation?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, the Senator from New Jersey is correct. The \ncommittee intends that a majority of title IV funds be awarded to \nexisting comprehensive HIV care projects. Title IV also supports \nnational training and technical assistance centers that include: The \nNational Pediatric and Family HIV Resource, the AIDs Policy Center for \nChildren, Youth and Families, and the Institute for Family-Centered \nCare, all of which will be eligible to apply for funding in the coming \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I concur with the chairman.\n  LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nsupport, and for their continued work in this very important component \nof our national HIV/AIDS strategy.\n\n\n                              doj section\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Chairman, this bill provides many tools with which \nwe, as a nation, can fight crime and drugs. I would like to highlight \none area about which many law enforcement officials of my home State of \nWashington have expressed growing concern: methamphetamines. The \nDepartment of Justice, working with other agencies, has developed a \ncomprehensive approach to battling the use and manufacture of \nmethamphetamines entitled ``National Methamphetamine Strategy'', April \n1996. Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight the managers' support for \ninteragency and Federal, State, and local law enforcement cooperation \nin combating this growing menace. It is particularly important to \ninvolve the Environmental Protection Agency and other appropriate \nagencies to provide technical and financial assistance to State and \nlocal law enforcement as they remove hazardous chemicals and waste \ndeveloped in clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I agree, Senator Murray. We need a united front to \nreduce methamphetamine use and eradicate clandestine manufacturing \nfacilities. The managers support a comprehensive, interagency strategy \nin which the Federal agencies work in partnership with State and local \nlaw enforcement to solve this problem.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to working as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee--unfortunately, without you--\nnext year to ensure a comprehensive approach is fully funded.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I want to thank Senator Murray for reminding us of the \nimportance of combining resources and expertise to address not only \nmethamphetamines, but all narcotics. Senator Murray has been and \ncontinues to be a leader in protecting and providing for children, \nfamilies, and communities. In this bill, we have supported several \nprograms that will assist us in reducing the threats posed by \nmethamphetamines. Specifically, the Drug Enforcement Agency's budget \nhas been increased by 23 percent from last year. The subcommittee looks \nforward to working with you on the fiscal year 1998 budget.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I note in the report on H.R. 3814 that \nour committee urged the Economic Development Administration [EDA] to \nconsider applications for grant funding for several worthwhile economic \ndevelopment proposals throughout the country. These were not \nspecifically repeated, however, in this Omnibus Appropriations \nconference report.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. That is correct. The committee listed nine such \nproposals on page 58 of the report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to make the Senator from Oregon, the \nchairman of the committee, aware of a particularly meritorious economic \ndevelopment project from my home State of South Carolina that was not \nlisted in the report. The proposal calls for the renovation of the Main \nStreet theatre in Conway, SC Located in the town's historic downtown \ndistrict, the theater has the potential to become a center for \ntheatrical and economic activity.\n  I ask the Senator from Oregon if, in his opinion, the Conway project \nis similar to those listed in our committee report.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. It is, and it certainly appears to meet the same \ncriteria for inclusion in the report.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That being the case, I ask the Senator that we deem the \nConway project part of the committee's recommendation to the EDA.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. As the Senator knows, we cannot amend the report or \nstatement of managers at this point, however, I speak for this side of \nthe aisle in requesting that the EDA evaluate the Conway project in the \nsame manner along with those listed in the report. Like the committee \nrecommended projects, the Conway proposal should be given every \nconsideration by the Economic Development Administration.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree, and thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                assistance for victims of hurricane fran\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in light of the estimated $5 billion in \ndamage to homes, businesses and farms in North Carolina, it is \nimperative that critical Federal disaster relief efforts not be \ndelayed, and I am deeply grateful to the distinguished chairman, Mr. \nHatfield, and the equally distinguished ranking member Mr. Byrd of the \nAppropriations Committee for their fine help in allocating adequate \nfunds in this bill for disaster relief.\n  A tremendous amount of time was spent last week in working out the \ndetails of the disaster relief package. Needless to say, I was \nconcerned about the prospect of disaster relief funds running out.\n  After extensive consultations last week, a total of nearly $400 \nmillion in new funds was provided for various programs to provide \nassistance to citizens affected by Hurricane Fran.\n  It is my understanding that existing unobligated funds are also \navailable for programs within the Departments of Agriculture and \nCommerce, as well as FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, and I \nrespectfully inquire of the chairman and the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee if they agree that more than $150 million in \nexisting unobligated funds from these programs will be available for \ndisaster relief for North Carolina victims of Hurricane Fran?\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from North Carolina in bringing the \nSenate's attention to the plight of many Americans who have suffered \nfrom the fury of Hurricane Fran. I might remind Senators that this \nterrible storm swept over much of the eastern United States, including \nmy own State of West Virginia, leaving a path of destruction to homes, \nbusinesses, and most tragically, injury and loss of life.\n  I am aware that the Senator from North Carolina has made a request to \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations for levels of assistance similar \nto and, in some cases, exceeding those submitted to Congress by the \nPresident. The agreement contained in the continuing resolution \nincludes emergency supplemental appropriations of nearly $400 million \nin new budget authority for agencies of the Department of Agriculture, \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Economic Development \nAdministration, and the Small Business Administration to respond to the \nunmet needs for hurricane relief.\n  During negotiations with the administration, an agreement was reached \nto make available an additional $150 million in Federal assistance for \nrelief from fiscal year 1996 unobligated funds. These amounts include \n$100 million provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the \nCrops of Engineers. In addition, there are funds remaining at the \nDepartment of Agriculture for debris removal, utility repair, and \nemergency loans to farmers and ranchers. In all, this brings the level \nof funds available for victims of Hurricane Fran to more then $500 \nmillion which achieves the level included in the request by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. Is this the same \nunderstanding of the Senator from Oregon, the chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, this is my understanding.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senators from West Virginia and Oregon for \nthis explanation. In addition to these funding levels, have any other \nactions been taken to eliminate obstacles that may affect the \navailability of assistance to North Carolinians?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from North Carolina may be referring to a \nrestriction of assistance to landowners requesting assistance from the \nDepartment of Agriculture for debris removal. Normally, landowners are \nineligible for this assistance if their lands had received debris \nremoval assistance in 2 of the previous 25 years. I have personally \nmade an inquiry with the Department of Agriculture relating to this \nrestriction as it affects victims of Hurricane Fran. I am glad to \nreport that earlier this month, the Department of Agriculture has taken \nadministrative action to recognize the extraordinary damage caused by \nHurricane Fran and provide conditional waivers to my State of West \nVirginia, along with the States of Virginia and North Carolina.\n  The announcement by the Department of Agriculture states in part:\n\n       Based on the uncommon severity and extent of damage caused \n     by Hurricane Fran, the provisions prohibiting eligibility of \n     land damaged 3 or more times (including the current disaster) \n     in the last 25 years is waived in counties designated as \n     disaster areas by the President or Secretary.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Again, I thank the Senators from West Virginia and Oregon \nfor making clear the agreement relating to assistance for victims of \nHurricane Fran in my State and other States.\n\n\n                             printing error\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will not take much time of the Senate, \nbecause time is short. There is no doubt that questions will arise with \nregard to this bill. Questions will arise regarding intent. I want to \ntake this time to ensure that a printing error in the Treasury portion \nof the bill does not cause any confusion. The manager's statement \nregarding the Internal Revenue Service Tax Modernization System [TSM] \nRequest For Proposal [RFP] addressed on page H12010 of Saturday's \nRecord uses two dates: July 31, 1997 and July 31, 1999. July 31, 1997 \nis the date.\n  Mr. President there may be other errors, but I have not found them. \nThe Government Printing Office has done an exceptional job in producing \na lengthy and complex document in a very short time.\n\n\n                             fcc relocation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a brief \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Treasury, Postal \nService Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, concerning funding \nfor the proposed relocation of the Federal Communications Commission \n[FCC]. Mr. Chairman, the Senate version of the fiscal year 1997 \nTreasury, Postal appropriations bill contained a provision that would \nallow the Administrator of the General Services Administration [GSA] to \npay a portion of the costs associated with a proposed relocation of the \nFCC. It this correct?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator is correct. At the request of GSA this \nprovision was included in the committee report accompanying the fiscal \nyear 1997 Treasury, Postal appropriations bill. During floor \nconsideration of the bill, this provision was converted to statutory \nlanguage.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understand that this provision has been deleted \nfrom the omnibus bill before us today.\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is correct. Several members have raised objections \nto this provision for a variety of reasons, and as a result, we have \nspecifically not included it in this omnibus bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chairman. I have recently become aware of the \nlarge costs associated with this proposal--more than $40 million in up-\nfront moving costs and an expensive lease rate--and I think the \nCongress should give this issue a much more careful review before it \nproceeds any further. As I understand it, the proposal calls for the \nFCC to nearly double the amount of space it occupies at the very time \nCongress is considering legislation to reduce the size of the agency. \nAm I correct, Mr. Chairman, that by specifically deleting the language \nallowing the GSA Administrator to pay for the relocation of the FCC, \nthat is intended that the GSA Administrator specifically not be \nauthorized to provide any funding for the proposed FCC relocation?\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is correct. The GSA should not use funds \nappropriated to it to facilitate the move. Since the Commerce \nAppropriations Subcommittee denied requested funding for the \nrelocation, the proposed move should not go forward until Congress has \nmore closely examined the proposal. I would like to work with the \ngentleman from Oklahoma and the relevant Senate committees to fully \nunderstand whether the proposed relocations are justified and if so, \nhow we might go about reducing costs associated with the plan. We \nshould take a close look at these issues in the next Congress. Until \nwe've had the time to closely examine these issues, however, I do not \nbelieve the proposed relocation should go forward. Accordingly, we did \nnot include language allowing GSA to fund the proposed move and they \nshould not use any of the resources provided to them for that purpose.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chairman and I look forward to working with \nhim in the next Congress on this issue.\n\n\n                   aircraft maintenance tax colloquy\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleagues' \nattention a new and hidden tax being imposed by the IRS on American air \ncarriers, and those who travel or ship cargo by aircraft. Ignoring \ncongressional intent, as codified in sections 162 and 232 of the \nInternal Revenue Code, the IRS is reversing its policy of accepting the \nlongstanding industry practice of expense deductions of aircraft \ninspection, maintenance, and repair required by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  This IRS change in tax treatment of air carriers constitutes a tax \npenalty on air safety.\n  This new and hidden tax penalty on air safety is no small matter. \nWhen an airline takes delivery of an aircraft, before the FAA will \nissue a certificate of airworthiness allowing that plane to fly, the \ncarrier must provide the FAA with a suitable plan for ongoing \nmaintenance and repair.\n  So here, on one hand, we have one agency of the Federal Government, \nthe FAA, working hand in hand with the industry to ensure and to \nenhance the public safety for air travelers. But at the same time, a \nsecond agency, the IRS, is attempting to impose a tax penalty on the \ncost of ensuring that very safety.\n  Mr. FORD. May I inquire of my colleague from Oklahoma, who has told \nus that the IRS is changing its policy and\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\nthereby imposing a tax penalty on airline safety. How is that possible? \nHow can the IRS put this tax penalty on aircraft safety?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will inform my distinguished colleague from Kentucky \nthat he is exactly correct. Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code \nprovides that the cost of maintenance and repairs to keep property in \nan ordinarily efficient operating condition is deductible in the year \nincurred. Only maintenance which either materially adds to the value or \nsubstantially prolongs the useful life of the property or adapts the \nproperty to a new or different use is required to be capitalized. Under \nthis test, aircraft maintenance and repair costs are deductible because \nsuch maintenance and repair does not materially increase the value or \nextend the useful life of the aircraft.\n  I will answer the distinguished bill manager. Ignoring economic \nreality and logic, the IRS is reversing its policy of accepting the \nlongstanding industry practice of deducting the cost of aircraft \nmaintenance in the year incurred. The IRS's new position that these \nrepairs should be capitalized and depreciated over a period of years \nassumes that the economic life of an asset should be calculated on the \nassumption that no appropriate maintenance--including Government-\nmandated safety maintenance--will be performed.\n  Mr. FORD. I would add to my colleague from Oklahoma's remarks that \nthe IRS position defies common sense. Requiring airlines to capitalize \nthe cost of inspection and repairs in compliance with FAA safety \nregulations that merely maintain the normal operating condition and \nuseful life of the aircraft would be like requiring a taxicab company \nto capitalize the cost of oil changes on its cabs because an oil change \nextends the useful life of the engine.\n  It simply does not make any sense. The U.S. airline industry has the \nbest safety record in the world. As the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Aviation, I know first hand how hard this body and \nother Federal agencies have worked to encourage and help maintain and \nimprove that enviable safety record.\n  It seems to me, that the IRS is working at cross purposes with its \nsister agencies and the Congress.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I agree with my colleague. However, I would not put it \nquite so delicately. I believe that the IRS is clearly overstepping its \nauthority and ignoring clear congressional direction and intent as \nprovided by the Internal Revenue Code. This tax penalty on aircraft \nsafety is not only wrong in substance, the process by which the IRS is \nadopting this new policy is also flawed. In reversing its historic \npractice of accepting the characterization of aircraft maintenance and \nrepair cost as deductible, the IRS is effectively promulgating a major \nregulation. As I understand it, there has been no notice of proposed \nrulemaking and there is at this time no coordinated issue paper. \nInstead, the IRS is challenging taxpayers who can least afford to \nprotect their interest against the IRS in court. In other words, the \nIRS is selectively enforcing this new rule on a case-by-case basis \nhoping to develop a new body of regulation, without affording taxpayers \nof the protections provided by the normal rulemaking process.\n  If the IRS wants to change their policy and the industry practice, \nthe IRS should use the rulemaking process. A change in IRS's policy of \nthis magnitude clearly needs to be addressed through full notice and \ncomment protections provided in the Administrative Procedures Act. The \nIRS's current process denies stakeholders the opportunity to comment \nbefore the tax change is finalized. In addition, I would like to send a \nclear message to the IRS that general application of this reversal of \nlongstanding tax policy on aircraft maintenance costs would be a rule \nfor purposes of the Congressional Review Act. IRS must be prepared to \ndefend both their decision and their decisionmaking process before this \nbody under the new congressional review provisions of chapter 8 of \ntitle 5, United States Code.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Can the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on the Treasury Postal Service tell me why the Thomas \namendment, which passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 59 to 39, is \nnot included in this omnibus appropriations bill? As you know, my \namendment would have prohibited OMB from expending funds to implement \nany policy that permits any Federal agency to provide commercial goods \nand services to other government agencies, unless a cost comparison \ndetermines that government agency performance is more cost effective \nthan the private sector.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The conferees believe existing law, particularly the \nEconomy Act and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, address this \nissue.\n  Mr. THOMAS. However, hearings by the Senate Committee on Governmental \nAffairs and House Committee on Small Business have demonstrated that \nadministration implementation of these statutes have failed to \neliminate Government competition with the private sector and recent OMB \naction has been interpreted as encouraging agencies to market their \nservices to other Federal, State and local government entities. Does \nthe chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee agree with \nthis conclusion?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. My committee held a hearing on \nSeptember 24, 1996, and found questionable use and minimal cost \nanalysis of interagency agreements. I was a cosponsor of the Thomas \namendment and was disappointed to see that it was not included in the \nbill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Is it the subcommittee Chairman's intent that OMB should \npromptly issue new administrative policy and process to clarify and \nremedy this matter so no Federal organization unfairly competes with \nthe private sector, particularly small business?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, that is the subcommittee's intent. As a cosponsor of \nSenator Thomas' bill, S. 1724, the Freedom From Government Competition \nAct, and a supporter of the Thomas amendment, I am deeply concerned \nabout this issue and look forward to OMB revising this policy.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the illegal \nimmigration reform bill as it has emerged from conference.\n  At the outset, I want to applaud the fact that, after considerable \ndebate, this Congress has chosen to separate the issues of illegal and \nlegal immigration. We should not lump legal immigrants, who play by the \nrules, together with illegal immigrants, who break them. Moreover, in \nmy judgment, the best way to preserve our tradition of legal \nimmigration is to address the public's concerns about illegal \nimmigration. That is part of the reason why I support the bill before \nus today.\n  I would also like to applaud the changes recently made to the bill's \nincome requirements for persons who wish to sponsor an immigrant. As \nreported out of conference, section 551 of the bill would have required \nindividuals to earn at least 140 percent of the poverty line to sponsor \na spouse or minor child, and to earn at least 200 percent of the \npoverty line to sponsor any other immigrant--for example, a parent. The \neffect of this provision would have been to block many middle-class \nAmericans from sponsoring their close relatives.\n  Section 551 has been revised, however, to provide that an individual \nwho wishes to sponsor an immigrant must either earn at least 125 \npercent of the poverty line or obtain a cosigner who earns that much. I \nstrongly support this change, as the revised section 551 arguably \nprovides sponsors with more flexibility than does current law.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to outline a number of my concerns with \nthis bill.\n  To begin with, Mr. President, I am concerned about the verification \npilot projects included in this bill. These projects constitute the \nfirst steps toward a National Identification System.\n  This legislation mandates three pilot projects of 4-year duration.\n  Now, as it stands these tentative steps are reversible. We have \nbasically postponed the day of reckoning on this issue for 4 years. But \nthis is an issue that I believe does not warrant field study.\n  Americans should not be subjected to a national identification \nsystem, period. Any such system will put people's jobs, property, and \nrights at risk of bureaucratic incompetence and abuse for no good \nreason. We can solve our problems without such a system, and that is \nwhat we must do to preserve our traditions of individual liberty.\n\n[[Page S11886]]\n\n  In addition, I am concerned about this legislation's provisions on \nfederalized documents.\n  The bill would bar Federal agencies from accepting birth certificates \nand drivers' licenses that do not meet new Federal standards.\n  This will force States to conform to Federal standards in issuing \nthese documents, because States' citizens will want to be able to use \nthem for Federal purposes.\n  It is an intrusion into an area properly subject to State control and \nanother step toward a national identification system. It is unnecessary \nand it should not be undertaken.\n  Mr. President, I also have reservations concerning the bill's \nprovisions on the deportability of criminal aliens. If these provisions \nare adopted, they will significantly weaken many of the important \nreforms this Congress adopted last session in the Anti-terrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act to facilitate deportation of criminal \naliens.\n  As I have made clear throughout consideration of the immigration \nbill, I draw a sharp distinction between immigrants who come to this \ncountry to make better lives for themselves and those who come to break \nour laws and prey upon our citizens.\n  I have made no secret of my strong concerns about the conference \nreport's repeal of important provision this Congress enacted into law \nin the Anti-terrorism Act last spring. Along with my colleague Senator \nD'Amato, I have sent a letter to the immigration conferees outlining \nthese concerns, which I would like briefly to mention here.\n  First the draft conference report unconditionally restores \nimmigration judges' ability to grant so-called hardship or section \n212(c) waivers to large categories of criminals who have committed \nserious felonies. When Congress enacted section 212(c) in 1952 as part \nof the Immigration and Nationality Act, it made clear that it was to \napply only to those cases where extenuating circumstances clearly \nrequire such action.''\n  Unfortunately, unelected and irresponsible immigration judges have \ncompletely and permanently ended deportation proceedings against \nthousands of convicted felons under this provision.\n  The Anti-terrorism Act corrected this outrage by barring individuals \nfrom using section 212(c) if they had been convicted of aggravated \nfelonies, firearms, and narcotics crimes, or repeated serious offenses.\n  But now the conference report would restore these waivers for all \ncriminal aliens other than aggravated felons. Repeat offenders, illegal \nfirearms and narcotics dealers and, most shocking of all, terrorists, \nall would now be able to have deportation proceedings against \nthemselves terminated.\n  And, even in those cases when a waiver is not granted, the request \nitself will delay the deportation process and make it harder to detain \ncriminal aliens pending deportation. That means that more criminal \naliens will be released and will never be found again to be deported.\n  Why has this pernicious invitation to immigration judges to abuse \ntheir power been restored? I have heard no explanation. Yet, if it is \nbecause my colleagues now believe that these judges can be trusted not \nto abuse their discretion recent experience shows otherwise.\n  Even now, with section 212(c) eliminated by the Anti-terrorism Act, \nsome immigration judges are granting the relief for criminal aliens who \nare in exclusion proceedings.\n  This plainly defies the clear meaning of the statute. The Anti-\nterrorism Act applies to aliens who are deportable for having committed \ncertain crimes. It contains no reference to any proceedings in which \nthe immigrant might be engaged, be they exclusion or deportation \nproceedings. The choice of proceedings is irrelevant. It is the \ncommission of proscribed felonies on American soil that dictates the \ncriminal alien's removal.\n  Fortunately, by establishing a unified system for removing aliens who \ndo not comply with our laws, the conference report eliminates the \navailability of this particular misconstruction. But its restoration to \nthe same immigration judges who devised this misconstruction of the \nauthority to grant these waivers to large classes of criminals is \nsimply incomprehensible.\n  Removal of these felons will be made even more difficult under the \nconference report because the bill significantly weakens the Anti-\nterrorism Act's requirements relating to the detention of criminal \naliens. Under that act the Attorney General was required to detain all \ncriminal aliens who have committed certain serious crimes, pending \ndeportation.\n  The conference report would allow the Attorney General to release \nlarge categories of these individuals, on certifying that insufficient \nspace exists to detain them, for 2 full years.\n  Again, the question is why? The Justice Department has not stated in \nany formal communication to Congress that there is currently or will be \nin the near future insufficient detention space to detain these and \nother dangerous individuals. Indeed, the Department not only failed to \nvolunteer that it had any such problem, it made no such statement even \nin response to a letter asking for any concerns the Department might \nhave about the Anti-terrorism Act's criminal aliens provisions. The \nclosest the Department came was to suggest that it was theoretically \npossible that such a shortage might develop at some point.\n  Such hypothetical concerns are no reason at all to grant the Attorney \nGeneral the authority to release thousands of convicted criminals back \ninto the population, to prey on our people and perhaps never be caught \nagain, let alone deported. If the Attorney General needs that authority \nbecause the Immigration and Naturalization Service projects an \nimmediate shortage of detention space, the Department knows how to ask \nfor it. If it did, we could then assess the plausibility of the \nprojection, as well as whether the matter could be better addressed by \nproviding additional detention space instead. We also could ask why no \nrequest for additional space had been forthcoming.\n  The conference report's decision to grant this unilateral release \nauthority without even the justification that the Department, albeit \nlate in the day, has said it needs to have that authority on account of \nan imminent shortage, is frankly incomprehensible to me.\n  As I believe is clear, Mr. President, I have some rather serious \nproblems with this legislation. However, we face a more serious \nproblem, for which this legislation, even with its flaws, is needed.\n  I am speaking, of course, of the problem of illegal immigration. This \nbill contains a number of provisions that I believe are crucial to our \nfight to bring illegal immigration under control.\n  For example, the bill includes the Kyl-Abraham amendment adopted in \ncommittee. This amendment will increase by 1,000 the number of Border \nPatrol agents in each of the next 5 fiscal years (1997-2001).\n  The bill also would sharply increase penalties for alien smuggling \nand document fraud.\n  In addition, the bill includes a revised form of an Abraham amendment \nto impose stiff sanctions on visa-overstayers, who make up fully one-\nhalf of the illegal aliens in this country.\n  I regret that the ``good cause'' exception in my amendment was \nomitted from final bill. But visa-overstayers must be punished like \nanyone else who breaks the rules.\n  Finally, this legislation makes those who sponsor aliens into the \ncountry legally responsible for their support, and allows the \nGovernment to collect reimbursement for any welfare moneys spent.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I am concerned that identification provisions \nin this legislation are leading us on a path away from America's well-\nworn road of personal liberty toward a bureaucratic nightmare. And I am \nworried that this bill will allow too many criminals to stay in this \ncountry.\n  But we are in the midst of a serious conflict. We cannot allow law-\nbreakers into our country. And that is exactly what an illegal \nimmigrant is: someone who willingly and knowingly flouts our laws.\n  This legislation makes needed reforms to our immigration system so \nthat we may deal more efficiently with these lawbreakers. To my mind \nthis is an important step toward a more fair and open immigration \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11872-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11886-S11917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n  Sec. 343, Certification Requirements for Foreign Healthcare Workers\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would appreciate it if Senator Simpson\n\n[[Page S11887]]\n\nwould clarify the intent of a provision in the conference report on \nH.R. 2202, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \nAct of 1996, which is now Division C of H.R. 3610, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, 1997. I am interested in the intent of \nsection 343 with regard to the establishment of a procedure for the \napproval of organizations to prescreen foreign healthcare workers.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is Congress' intent that the Attorney \nGeneral, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, shall establish a procedure for the review and approval of \ncredentialing organizations equivalent to the Commission on Graduates \nof Foreign Nursing Schools for the purpose of prescreening aliens \nseeking to enter the United States for employment as healthcare \nworkers. It is our intent that the Attorney General and the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services will actively review entities that \npetition to perform this prescreening and approve those that qualify.\n\n\n                      homestead, fl's eda project\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a colloquy concerning an economic development project \nof great significance to South Dade County, FL.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to engage the Senator from Florida in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my colleagues will remember that in 1992, \nHurricane Andrew, one of the worst natural disasters in our Nation's \nhistory, struck the city of Homestead and South Dade County, FL with \nterrible flurry. Today, 4 years later, the physical devastation to the \ncommunity can still be seen. The residents of the area continue to \nexperience severe economic hardship due to the destruction of homes and \nbusinesses, the loss of income and tax revenue, and the dislocation of \nresidents. I dare say that there are few places in the country that \ndeserve economic development assistance more than Homestead/South Dade.\n  In recent years, the city of Homestead has brought forward a public/\nprivate partnership project which promises to become a significant \neconomic development engine for the community. The project is a 60,000 \nsquare foot motor sports exhibition and education facility to be \nlocated at the existing South Dade/Homestead Motorsports Complex. This \nproject is expected to attract more than half a million visitors per \nyear, generate considerable tax revenue, and create hundreds of new \njobs.\n  The city of Homestead will shortly approach the Economic Development \nAdministration to request an economic development assistance grant \nwhich will be matched equally by State and private contributions.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this project which I believe will \nbuild upon the economic development success of the Motorsports Complex. \nThis hard-hit community is doing the right thing in putting together \npublic-private partnerships to share the cost burden of such economic \ndevelopment projects. The proposal to EDA for fiscal year 1997 funds \ndeserves favorable consideration, and I am hopeful that the chairman of \nthe Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Subcommittee will lend his \nsupport, as well, to this worthy project.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from Florida \nthat I am well aware of the devastation experienced in Homestead and \nSouth Dade and the work he has done to revitalize the community. The \nneed for further economic development assistance in the area is \nabundantly clear. I would, therefore, be happy to work with the Senator \nin brining the city of Homestead's proposal to the attention of EDA and \ndoing what I can to see that the proposal for funding receives fair \nconsideration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most egregious differences \nbetween the immigration bill passed by the Senate many months ago and \nthe bill now thrust on us for final passage is the permanent and \nnationwide waiver of our environmental laws for border control \nactivities.\n  Like most of the American public, I am fed up with attacks on our \nimportant environmental laws. Failing to gut the Endangered Species Act \nand the National Environmental Policy Act, some Members of Congress \nhave resorted to backdoor stealth attacks on these laws. Now \nRepublicans include a gratuitous attach on our wildlife and ecosystems \nthrough, of all things, an immigration bill.\n  The nationwide scope of the environmental waivers in the immigration \nbill reaches far and beyond the goals of strong immigration control. By \nexempting all road construction, bridge construction, and barrier \nconstruction along the entire U.S. border from the Endangered Species \nAct, the waiver will permanently weaken national and international \nwildlife conservation.\n  Like many provisions in the immigration bill, this provision was \ninserted during the Republican-only House-Senate conference, and now \nthe bill grants a permanent and nationwide waiver of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, the fundamental charter of our environmental \nprotection.\n  Claims that the Endangered Species Act or the National Environmental \nPolicy Act delay or stop the INS from controlling illegal immigration \nare wholly unsubstantiated. These laws should not be waived or exempted \nwithout full congressional consideration, hearings and public debate, \nand need not be waived in these circumstances.\n  Simply put, the ESA requires all Federal agencies to avoid adverse \nimpacts on endangered and threatened species. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service staff are not biology experts. When the INS \nmakes plans to build a road through a remote border area on public \nlands they consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service biologists to \nensure that their plans are ecologically sound. For instance, when INS \nwanted to build a border bridge in Texas, biologists asked them to \nminimize impact on nearby wetlands by lifting the bridge out of the \nflood plain 2 feet. That was all that it took.\n  Consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service is painless--it \nusually costs little in time or money to the INS, but it can mean the \ndifference between recovery and extinction for a border species like \nthe Sonoran Pronghorn antelope or the ocelot, an endangered cat.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has consulted with Federal agencies \nover 195,000 times in the last 16 years. Only 0.05 percent of those \nprojects have been withdrawn or canceled because of the ESA. The ESA is \nflexible enough to accommodate even emergency situations and Fish and \nWildlife biologists can review an INS construction project in a matter \nof hours when necessary.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act, signed by President Nixon in \n1969, requires INS to give taxpayers a chance to review and comment on \nthe environmental impacts of INS projects. Republicans now want to \nshortchange citizen's opportunities to participate in decisionmaking \naffecting their communities. NEPA also requires INS to examine \nreasonable alternatives to a project before investing taxpayer funds.\n  It is also flexible enough to accommodate emergency situations. For \nexample, Bureau of Land Management recently requested an expedited NEPA \nreview to build roads and a helicopter landing pad near the border \narea. It seems that high illegal alien use and high forest fire risk \nrequired quick action. The NEPA review was completed within 24 hours \nand the road construction took place immediately.\n  In a September 16 letter, Janet Reno, Bruce Babbitt, and Katie \nMcGinty stated their unequivocal opposition to these waivers in the \nimmigration bill. They know, as I do, that granting future Attorneys \nGeneral the ability to sidestep important environmental laws will mean \ndisaster for our Nation's environmental integrity.\n  The administration is currently negotiating environmental agreements \nwith Canada and Mexico, and the passage of these waivers could \nundermine the future of these agreements. How can we possibly expect \nMexico to take actions to protect their ecosystems on one side of the \nborder when we so flagrantly disregard the laws protecting our own \nnatural heritage?\n  I object to the immigration bill because it differs so wildly from \nthe bill we passed earlier this year. The stealth environmental waivers \nin this bill are unnecessary, unjustified, and mean-spirited. They will \nharm our children's right to inherit an environmentally-sound nation \nand set a terrible precedent for environmental waivers.\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n\n                               division d\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Small \nBusiness Programs Improvement Act of 1996, which has been incorporated \nas division D of the omnibus appropriations bill. The language of this \nbill comes includes the substitute amendment to H.R. 3719, which I \noffered with the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Small Business, \nSenator Dale Bumpers. H.R. 3719 is a comprehensive bill that proposes \nto change numerous programs at the Small Business Administration, which \nare discussed in this statement. Most of the changes will go into \neffect on October 1, 1996.\n\n\n                 access to capital for small businesses\n\n  Earlier this year, when the Clinton administration and the Small \nBusiness Administration submitted their fiscal year 1997 budget \nrequest, it was revealed that SBA's flagship loan programs had been \nexperiencing considerably higher losses than had previously been \nrevealed to the Congress. In the case of the 7(a) Guaranteed Business \nLoan Program, the credit subsidy rate, which is the calculation by OMB \nthat projects losses from loans that are originated in fiscal year \n1997, was increased from 1.06 percent to 2.68 percent, an increase of \n150 percent. The losses facing 504 Development Company Loan Program are \neven greater, and the credit subsidy rate has increased from 0.57 \npercent to 6.85 percent, an increase of over 1,200 percent.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I was alarmed by the \nsize of these increases, which were so large as to threaten the future \nof both programs. These two programs, however, are critical to tens of \nthousands of small businesses, who each year have come to rely on the \navailability of Government guaranteed financing to assure them adequate \naccess to capital. They provide a very important source of capital to \nstartup small businesses and to established small business seeking to \nexpand to create more jobs. Because of the great importance of these \nprograms to small businesses, the Senate and House Committees on Small \nBusiness chose to make some fundamental changes in the programs in \norder that they can continue through fiscal year 1997.\n\n\n                      504 development loan program\n\n  With a credit subsidy rate of 6.85 percent in the fiscal year 1997 \nbudget request--versus 0.57 percent in fiscal year 1996--Congress would \nneed to appropriate over $220 million to fund fully the 504 loan \nprogram in fiscal year 1997. Although such an increased appropriation \nwould not be possible, committee staff worked on a solution that would \ncombine additional program fees and a modest appropriation. This \nlegislation adds new fees to be paid by the lender, the development \ncompany and the borrower and will support a $2 billion program level in \nfiscal year 1997.\n\n\n                 7(a) guaranteed business loan program\n\n  The legislation before us today includes a section calling for SBA to \nissue a regulation covering the sale of the unguaranteed portion of \n7(a) loans by banks and Small Business Lending Companies [SBLC's]. \nUnder current SBA regulations, only SBLC's are permitted to pool and \nsell the unguaranteed portion of 7(a) loans to outside investors. It is \nthe intent of the bill to expand this authority to banks by directing \nSBA to promulgate new regulations requiring a uniform set of rules \ngoverning this transaction by banks and SBLC's. In addition, SBA is \ndirected to set safety and soundness standards, including appropriate \nreserve requirements, to protect the taxpayers' exposure under this \nprogram.\n  Last year, when the Senate unanimously adopted S. 895, we agreed to \nlower the government's guarantee rate on most 7(a) loans to 75 percent. \nOur intention was to increase SBA lenders' exposure on each loan in \norder to focus the lenders' attention on the quality of their loan \nmaking activities. Although this section the bill will allow SBA \nlenders to reduce their exposure on these loans, it is our belief that \nSBA can craft sufficient safeguards to protect the Government's \nposition while granting the lenders an opportunity to raise more \ncapital which can be loaned to small businesses. When the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business takes up the 3-year reauthorization of SBA \nearly next year, it will be my plan for the committee to study closely \nthe impact of the new SBA regulations that are to be adopted as a \nresult of this bill.\n\n\n                    sba finance program improvements\n\n  This legislation directs SBA to create an ongoing system of \nmanagement information about its 7(a) Business Loan Program. In order \nfor SBA to monitor the performance of this loan portfolio, which is \ngreater than $25 billion, it is essential that SBA collect and \nevaluate, on an ongoing basis, facts about both good and bad loans. \nThis legislation emphasizes the importance of this program and expands \nthe data gathering requirement to include key underwriting experience \non each loan.\n  In addition, the bill directs SBA to contract with a private firm to \nconduct a comprehensive study of the historical performance of the 7(a) \nProgram. Further, it directs that specific attention be paid to the \neconomic model used by OMB to calculate the credit subsidy rate. We \nconcurred with the House Committee on Small Business in the need for \nthis study.\n\n\n                 strengthening 7(a) program performance\n\n  Over the past 18 months, the Senate and House Committees on Small \nBusiness have seen time and again evidence that SBA has failed to \nliquidate failed 7(a) loans in a prompt and effective manner. The \nresult has been greater program losses, which have driven up the credit \nsubsidy rate and caused the need for high borrower and lender fees and \na larger appropriation. On average, it takes SBA 2 years to liquidate a \ndefaulted loan after SBA pays off the guarantee to the bank. On the \nother hand, it takes a commercial bank, on average, 6 months to \nliquidate a loan after it is placed in default.\n  The legislation takes a strong step to make improvements in SBA's \nperformance in this area. SBA is directed to make better use of the \nexpertise of its most experienced lenders who have been designated \n``preferred lenders'' within the 7(a) program. Preferred lenders have \nthe staff and ability to take on a greater share of the burden now \ncarried by SBA and to increase recoveries for the government after a \nloan fails. In addition, the bill directs SBA to begin using its \nlicensed ``certified lenders'' to undertake liquidation efforts when \nthe certified lender is deemed to have the experience and capability to \nundertake liquidation efforts.\n\n\n                        disaster loan servicing\n\n  This legislation directs SBA to undertake a demonstration program to \nhave private sector loans servicing companies contract to service SBA's \ndisaster home loan portfolio. In our analysis of this demonstration \nprogram, we concluded that a large sample of home loans would be \nnecessary to conduct a fair and conclusive demonstration of the ability \nof the private sector to service these loans. Therefore, the bill \ndirects that 30 percent of the disaster home loan portfolio be included \nin the demonstration program. It is our belief that with a sample this \nsize, the private sector servicing companies will have a large enough \npool of loans to create the economies of scale so their performance can \nbe evaluated fairly. It is our expectation that SBA will be able to \nsolicit bids on this contract within 90 days of passage of this bill, \nand the test can be underway during fiscal year 1997.\n\n\n                   small business program extensions\n\n  This legislation would extend the STTR Program for 1 year. This \nprogram allows universities and small businesses that specialize in R \nto combine forces and receive modest R grants. The STTR program was \ncreated in 1992, when the SBIC program was reauthorized and extended \nthrough fiscal year 2000. The purpose of our amendment is to extend the \nSTTR program for 1 year, in order that the Committee on Small Business \ncan take a closer look at the program next year when it takes up the 3 \nyear reauthorization of SBA. It is my understanding the proponents of \nthe STTR Program would like to see the program expanded, and it is my \nplan that the Committee on Small Business will consider this request \nand other program adjustments next year.\n  In addition, the legislation extends the Small Business \nCompetitiveness Demonstration Program for 1 year. It is scheduled to \nterminate on September 30, 1996. The House-passed version of H.R. 3719 \nincluded a 4-year extension. It also included some program\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\nchanges, and the supporters of the program have made additional \nrecommendations to improve the program. There is sufficient support to \nkeep the program alive for an additional year in order that both the \nSenate and House Committees on Small Business can have an opportunity \nto evaluate fully the impact of the program and to consider legislation \nto make a longer term extension with some program adjustments.\n\n\n     improvements to the small business investment company program\n\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed unanimously S. 1784, the Small \nBusiness Investment Company [SBIC] Improvement Act of 1996, which \nproposed numerous changes to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 \ndesigned to improve, strengthen, and expand the availability of \ninvestment capital under SBA's SBIC Program. S. 1784 was considered \nthoroughly by the Senate Committee on Small Business. After the \ncommittee held a series of hearings on the need for improving the SBIC \nProgram, thorough briefings were conducted for the staffs of each \ncommittee member to explain the program changes that were being \nrecommended by committee staff, SBA, and outside organizations such as \nthe National Association of Investment Companies [NAIC] and the \nNational Association of Small Business Investment Companies [NASBIC].\n  Following the input from the above groups and others, I chaired a \npublic hearing on a discussion draft of the bill prepared by the \ncommittee staff. After this hearing, interested parties, including SBA, \nNAIC, and NASBIC, were invited and participated in drafting proposed \nchanges to the legislation for consideration by the committee staff as \nit prepared the final version of S. 1784.\n  After extensive public hearings and open meetings with all interested \nparties, the Senate Committee on Small Business met in a markup \nsession, and recommended S. 1784 to the full Senate by a vote of 18 to \n0.\n\n  Division D of the omnibus appropriations bill includes S. 1784, \nsubstantially in the form in which it passed the Senate. Prior to its \ninclusion in this bill, some inaccurate charges were made about the \nbackground and effect of S. 1784. In fact, officials from NAIC, who had \nparticipated in drafting S. 1784 and whose recommendations were \nincluded in the bill, found fault with the bill when Senator Bumpers \nand I attempted to bring it to the Senate floor as an amendment to H.R. \n3719, the Small Business Programs Improvement Act. Their objections to \nthe bill which they helped draft and which had previously passed the \nSenate unanimously led one Senator to object to Senate consideration of \nS. 3719.\n  S. 1784 was written to place the SBIC Program on a sound, long-term \nfooting. Historically, this program has been plagued by many abuses \nthat have been well chronicled by the press. The purpose of the bill \nwas to strengthen the rules and management of the SBIC Program, while \nallowing the program to substantially to meet the investment needs of \nAmerica's small businesses. With the financial future of many small \nbusinesses depending on passage of this bill, we looked for ways to \nclear up the objections.\n  In an attempt to resolve this stalemate, I agreed to several changes \nin the Senate-passed S. 1784 to make it absolutely clear that \nfinancially sound specialized SBIC's would not be hurt by the terms of \nS. 1784. Still unable to proceed with consideration of H.R. 3719, we \nbegan to hear from SBIC's and special SBIC's about the importance of \npassing this legislation. Their comments revealed the importance of \nadopting the improvements to the SBIC Program that were contained in S. \n1784, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. A. Fred March, \npresident of Ventures Opportunities Corp., a New York-based special \nSBIC, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. President, last week as we approached the end of the 104th \nCongress, I decided to look for another avenue to insure that this \nimportant bill would become law. As part of this effort, I sought the \nsupport of the Senate leadership to incorporate S. 1784 in the omnibus \nappropriations bill. At the same time, Jan Meyers, chair of the House \nCommittee on Small Business, undertook a similar effort in the House of \nRepresentatives, and S. 1784 was included in the omnibus appropriations \nbill which passed the House of Representatives on Saturday, September \n28, 1996.\n  This legislation builds on the improvements on the SBIC Program \ncontained in the law passed by Congress in 1992 by making the following \nchanges to reduce the risk of SBIC defaults and losses to the Federal \nGovernment:\n  First, increases the level of private capital needed to obtain an \nSBIC license from SBA.\n  Second, requires experienced and qualified management for all SBIC's.\n  Third, requires diversification between investors and the management \nteam.\n  In addition, S. 1784 makes these important changes to the Small \nBusiness Investment Act to increase the availability of investment \ncapital to small businesses:\n  First, increases fees paid by SBIC's which reduces the credit subsidy \nrate.\n  Second, eliminates the distinction between SBIC's and SSBIC's, while \ngrandfathering successful SSBIC's into the new program.\n  Third, places a greater emphasis on SBIC investments in smaller \nenterprises or smaller small businesses.\n  In 1958, Congress first approved the Small Business Investment Act \ncreating Small Business Investment Companies, which are private \ninvestment companies licensed by SBA, whose sole activity is to make \ninvestments in small businesses. An SBIC raises private capital which \nis matched by additional funds guaranteed by SBA. The private capital \nand SBA-guaranteed funds are invested by SBIC's in small businesses.\n  SBIC's fill a void that is not addressed by private venture capital \nfirms, most of which are so large they are usually unwilling to make \ninvestments in smaller firms, which generally seek investments in the \nrange of $500,000 to $2.5 million each. Since the beginning of the SBIC \nprogram, nearly $12 billion has been invested in approximately 77,000 \nsmall businesses. Some SBIC's make equity investments in small \nbusinesses, while others make long-term loans, which are frequently \ncoupled with rights to purchase an equity interest in the company--\nsometimes called warrants. The lending-type or debenture SBIC's provide \nlong-term financing that is generally not available from banks or \nprivate venture capital firms.\n\n  Today, there are 185 active regular SBIC's and 89 specialized SBIC's \n[SSBIC's] in the SBIC Program. SSBIC's invest only in minority owned \nand controlled businesses. Together, these SBIC's and SSBIC's have \nraised nearly $4 billion in private capital and have received $1.02 \nbillion in SBA-guaranteed funds.\n  Today's SBIC Program has been shaped in large part by the Small \nBusiness Equity Enhancement Act of 1992. The genesis of this important \nlegislation resulted from the hard work of SBA's Investment Capital \nAdvisory Council, a public-private working group formed in 1991 to \naddress the problems confronting the SBIC Program. The 1992 act \nproduced the first major change in the SBIC Program since its formation \nin 1958. It created the Participating Security Program, which \nincorporates some of the best practices of the private venture capital \nindustry. The 1992 act came about in response to the persistence of my \ngood friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, who as the \nchairman of the Committee on Small Business held a series of hearings \nfocusing attention on the problems under the program. The result of the \nact was to strengthen the SBIC Program and to correct serious \nweaknesses that had been expected by well publicized problems of the \npast.\n  Since the 1992 act became law, more than 30 new participating \nsecurity SBIC's with nearly $50 million in private capital have been \nlicensed by SBA, and 17 new SBIC's with over $200 million of private \ncapital have been licenses as debenture SBIC's.\n  There is a significant difference between the SBIC's licensed before \nthe 1992 act and the SBIC's licensed under the most strict guidelines \nset forth under the 1992 act. While the 1992 act increased the minimum \nprivate capital\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\nthreshold for licensing to $2.5 million for each debenture SBIC and $5 \nmillion for each new participating security SBIC, SBA has imposed even \nmore strict standards in its regulations. Under the SBA rules, \ndebenture SBIC's must have a minimum of $5 million in private capital \nand participating security SBIC's must have $10 million in private \ncapital.\n  Since the 1992 act has created two distinct types of SBIC's, it \nallows for investments to be tailored to meet the needs of small \nbusinesses. For example, when a small business needs a loan and can \nmeet projected interest payments, the traditional lending-type or \ndebenture SBIC's are available to make debt investments. For small \nbusinesses that need non-interest-bearing investment capital, the \nparticipating security SBIC's can offer an equity-type investment which \nanticipates an extended period of time, such as 2 to 3 years, before \nthe small business is expected to being repayment of this investment. \nIn this latter case, interest payments are deferred until the \ninvestments begin to generate a positive return. Under the \nParticipating Security Program, the Federal Government's return is not \nlimited to repayment of principal and interest--it can also share in \nthe profits of the SBIC.\n  During this Congress, I have chaired three hearings investigating the \nsuccess and problems associated with the SBIC Program. Testimony before \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business has been supportive and \npositive. Numerous small business entrepreneurs have testified about \ntheir inability to obtain investment capital from banks and other \ntraditional investment sources, and SBIC's are frequently their only \nsource of investment capital. Last year, Jerry Johnson, the chief \nexecutive office of Williams Brothers Lumber Co. located near Atlanta, \ntestified that not one bank in the Atlanta area would speak with him \nabout asset based lending. After a lengthy search, he and his partner \nturned to Allied Capital Corp., a Washington, D.C.-based SBIC. Within \n60 days of their first contact with Allied Capital Corp., Mr. Johnson \nwas able to conclude his financing arrangement. Being able to clear \nthis financing hurdle with the help of an SBIC, Mr. Johnson's company \nhas grown significantly, adding many new employees and increasing its \ntax base.\n  Often we hear about major success stories like Federal Express and \nthe Callaway Golf Club Co. that received SBIC funding at critical times \nin their early growth stages. It is, however, far more likely that \nbusinesses like the Williams Brothers Lumber Co. will be typical \nbeneficiaries of the SBIC Program. These are Main Street enterprises \nlocated across America who have looked to traditional money sources and \nbeen turned away. The SBIC Program is filling this niche--a large niche \nto say the least--that picks up where banks fear to tread and Wall \nStreet is not interested because the investment size is too small. \nThere are thousands of companies like Williams Brothers Lumber Co. \nacross the country that need investment financing to support growth and \nnew jobs and have nowhere to turn but to the SBIC Program to meet their \ndemand for capital\n  During the past year, the Senate and House Committees on Small \nBusiness have received a great deal of information about the need to \nstrengthen the SBIC Program. In July 1995, Patricia Cloherty, chair of \nSBA's private sector SBIC Reinvention Council, testified on the \ncouncil's recommendation to strengthen and expand the program. In \naddition, last summer the National Association of Investment Companies \nforwarded to the Senate Committee on Small Business a copy of their \nrecommendations to improve the SSBIC program, which was also submitted \nto SBA's SSBIC Advisory Council.\n  The involvement of the private sector in analyzing the performance of \nthe SBIC program and the insight provided by these recommendations are \ncommendable--and very helpful to this committee. In 1995, the SBIC \nReinvention Council recommended that new fees be imposed to lower the \ncredit subsidy rate so that the program can provide a significant \nincrease in leverage to licensed SBIC's. It also recommended certain \nadministrative changes to improve the management and operations of the \nSBIC Program.\n  The National Association of Investment Companies [NAIC], which \nrepresents SSBIC's, also recommended in 1995 that all statutory and \nregulatory distinctions between SBIC's and SSBIC's be eliminated, \nincluding the deletion of all references to social or economic \ndisadvantage from the Small Business Investment Act. NAIC proposed \ncreating a single, combined SBIC Program that would retain an important \nfocus on investments in small business at the smaller end of the \neligible size standards. They recommended sensible improvements to make \nmore investment capital available to more small businesses and proposed \nto remove the current restrictions that prohibit Specialized SBIC's \nfrom investing in companies not owned by socially or economically \ndisadvantaged persons. This legislation includes many of their \nrecommendations.\n\n\n                          new fees for sbic's\n\n  The President's fiscal year 1997 budget request included a \nrecommendation that fees paid by SBIC's be increased to finance a \nsignificant reduction in the credit subsidy rate. The Office of \nManagement and Budget, recognizing the positive effect of some of the \nregulatory changes already implemented by SBA, now is using a lower \nprojected default rate, thereby reducing the credit subsidy rate for \ndebenture and participating security licensees under the SBIC Program.\n  The administration's recommendation to lower the credit subsidy rate \nby increasing fees is similar to one made last year in their amended \nfiscal year 1996 budget request for the 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan \nProgram. Accompanying their request for a fee increase were statements \nby SBA about how well the 7(a) program was performing.\n  What happened following SBA's positive predictions for the 7(a) \nprogram has been alarming. Based in part on SBA's glowing report card \non the 7(a) program, Congress passed legislation to raise fees and \nlower the subsidy rates of the program. The changes became law in \nOctober 1995, which is about the same time SBA and OMB were beginning \nto work on their most recent budget request which raises the 7(a) \ncredit subsidy rate by 150 percent and the cost of the program by $180 \nmillion. This higher cost is the direct result of greater losses from \nloan defaults and lower recoveries from liquidations.\n  The Senate and House Committees on Small Business believe it is \nprudent for Congress to take steps so that we do not allow a repeat of \nthe 7(a) problem with the SBIC Program. Based on the experience of last \nyear, Congress should not approve any decrease in the credit subsidy \nrate through the increase of fees without taking some corresponding \nsteps to strengthen the safety and soundness of the SBIC Program.\n\n\n                         sbic's in liquidation\n\n  In addition, evidence before the Committee on Small Business about \nthe failure of SBA to maximize its recoveries from failed SBIC's is \nalarming. SBA acknowledges there are assets with a value of \napproximately $500 million tied up with SBIC's in liquidation. To make \nthis situation even more alarming, many of these failed SBIC's have \nbeen in liquidation for over 10 years, including one that was \ntransferred into liquidation on January 5, 1967.\n  S. 1784 directs SBA to submit to the Senate and House Committees on \nSmall Business, no later than January 15, 1996, a detailed plan to \nexpedite the orderly liquidation of all licensee assets in liquidation. \nThis plan should include a timetable for liquidating the liquidation \nportfolio of assets owned by SBA.\n  In addition, SBA needs to take a hard look at how it manages failed \nSBIC's that are in receivership. It is not a sufficient explanation for \nSBA to claim it is at the mercy of the court system in winding up the \naffairs of SBIC's in receivership. In each case, the court acts in \nresponse to SBA's petition, has named SBA the receiver, and SBA has \nretained independent contractors to act as principal agents for the \nreceivership. These principal agents are paid hourly and appear to have \nlittle or no incentive to wind up the affairs of an SBIC. In fact, the \nopposite is true, and the real incentive appears to be to drag out the \nreceivership as long as possible. Based on SBA replies to requests for \ninformation from the Committee on Small Business, we have learned that \nthese principal receivers agents bill significant hours each year. In \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\nyear 1995, one principal agent billed over 3,200 hours for one year, \nthe equivalent of over 8 hours per day for 365 days. Other principal \nagents billed over 2,500 hours each for fiscal year 1995.\n  At the time of the committee's inquiry into these billing practices, \nSBA gave no indication that it felt they were unusual. It is clear to \nme that without incentives to complete action on these SBIC's in \nreceivership, the current system used by SBA will allow these abuses to \ncontinue. Although the committee did not reach a consensus on my \nproposal to create an incentive based system to improve recoveries from \nSBIC's in receivership, we will continue to monitor SBA's performance \nclosely in this area.\n  For several months starting late last year, the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business worked on draft legislation to strengthen and enhance \nthe SBIC Program. The small business investment company improvements \nsection of this bill is the result. It incorporates recommendations \nfrom SBA's SBIC Reinvention Council, the National Association of \nInvestment Companies, the National Association of Small Business \nInvestment Companies, and the President's fiscal year 1997 budget \nrequest.\n  Legislation essentially equivalent to the SBIC provisions of this \nbill was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business by a \nunanimous 18 to zero vote and later was passed unanimously by the full \nSenate. It makes substantial progress toward our goal of strengthening \nthe SBIC Program, while allowing the program to expand, providing more \ninvestment capital to small businesses as the cost and risk to the \nGovernment declines. It was only after nearly 18 months of study and \ninvestigation that we were able to produce such a bill. It is sound \nlegislation that improves the safety and soundness of the SBIC Program \nand makes more investment capital available to small businesses. And it \naccomplishes all of these goals while reducing the risk of loss to the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is very important to small businesses \nacross the United States and the millions of employees who work for \nthese small companies. I urge all my colleagues in the Senate to vote \n``yes'' on this landmark bill.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n\n                                  Venture Opportunities Corp.,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 24, 1996.\n       Dear Congressman LaFalce: Recently, I received a copy of a \n     memo that you distributed to the Democratic members of the \n     Small Business Committee urging them to oppose the SBIC plan \n     set forth by Senator Bond. The reason for your opposition is \n     its provision for the elimination of the distinction between \n     SSBICs and SBICs, thereby melding the two programs and \n     effectively converting 301(d) licensees into regular SBICs. \n     As the president of Venture Opportunities Corporation, an \n     SSBIC licensed for over 18 years, I firmly oppose your \n     position and support Senator Bond's call for combining the \n     two programs.\n       For the last several years, all SSBICs have been operating \n     businesses without any clear understanding of the future of \n     the industry. We have been attempting to establish and grow \n     our businesses in spite of the pushing and pulling that has \n     been all too evident in this most recent Congress. One think \n     though, has been made very clear--all the incentives for \n     making investments in minority-owned and controlled \n     enterprises and maintaining our SSBIC licenses have been \n     stripped from us. Subsidized debentures, which were the \n     primary advantage for establishing and operating an SSBIC, \n     were eliminated without any possibility of being reinstated. \n     Leverage has been hard to come by. Regulations and new \n     reporting requirements are excessive and work against any \n     SSBIC trying to expand or raise fresh capital. Why do you \n     think that, in spite of the tax advantages for rolling over \n     investment profits into an SSBIC, not one investor of any \n     size has invested in any of our companies? The answer lies in \n     the fact that there is no true advantage to being an SSBIC \n     and that the existing regulations and uncertain political \n     environmental present clear disadvantages.\n       If SSBICs are not included in the mainstream SBIC program, \n     we will cease to exist as a vehicle to make investments in \n     the minority community anyway. No one will have any incentive \n     to remain active in a dying program which offers no \n     subsidies, little leverage, excessive regulation, and limited \n     deal flow. By including us in the mainstream program, the \n     additional investment opportunities will strengthen our \n     companies without diminishing our commitment to make \n     investments in the ``disadvantaged'' communities for which we \n     were originally licensed.\n       I urge you to please look at the reality of the situation. \n     What you are proposing is the worst of all worlds. I, too, am \n     a Democrat who wants to help minority communities. I put my \n     own money into this business over 18 years ago to set up a \n     profitable investment business while, at the same time, \n     helping ``socially or economically disadvantaged'' \n     individuals create their own businesses. I have been \n     successful. The results of your opposition to the current \n     proposal, however, only serves to lock our company, and our \n     fellow SSBICs, into a dying industry without any incentive to \n     continue to make ``minority investments.'' We have already \n     faced the reality of the loss of our SSBIC advantages. At \n     least allow us the freedom to become regular SBICs while \n     continuing to remain true to ourselves and voluntarily make \n     investments in the minority community.\n       Thank you for your time. I look forward to a satisfactory \n     resolution of this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    A. Fred March,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I was pleased to see that the House of \nRepresentatives incorporated the Small Business Administration \nauthorization bill into the omnibus appropriation bill. This is \nimportant legislation. Before we go to final passage of the \nappropriation bill, I wonder if I could get the distinguished chairman \nof the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, to comment on a proposal \nI have, related to small business development centers.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. I thank the Senator, and I will be brief. Very simply, \nmy proposal would create a 1-year pilot program aimed at linking SBDC's \nwith export assistance centers.\n  Right now, some 35 colleges and universities across the country have \nboth an SBDC and an export assistance center on their campus. Bryant \nCollege in Rhode Island is one such facility. The folks up there have \ndone a super job on behalf of our State's small businesses. But in no \ninstance that I am aware of are two of these important facilities \nconnected to each other. I think a lot of good could come out of taking \nthat step. Therefore, my proposal would permit eligible SBDC's to do \ntwo things: one, hire export professionals to work on-site, and two, \nmake the technological adjustments necessary to establish a computer \nlink with an export assistance center.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator would yield for a question, is it his \nthought that such a proposal would make it easier for small business to \nstart exporting their products overseas?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Most definitely.\n  One of the key services offered by the export assistance centers is \naccess to a system called the International Trade Data Network. The \nITDN works as follows. A small businessperson will come into an export \nassistance center, anxious to learn how to export a particular product. \nAnd by logging on to this system, the individual can find out what \ncountries are interested in that product with a just few simple \nkeystrokes. As I understand it, a small businessperson can even get \ninformation about potential contracts.\n  Unfortunately, under the contract arrangement, it is impossible to \nconnect to that computer network at the SBDC. Instead, the individual \nmust find the closest export assistance center, and develop a \nrelationship with an entirely different staff, in order to learn what \ninternational trade opportunities might be available. The ITDN has \nproven to be a very successful tool for opening foreign trade markets. \nIn my view, therefore, small businesses in Rhode Island and States \nacross the country stand to benefit greatly from better access to it.\n  Now, my preference would have been to offer this proposal as an \namendment to the SBA authorization bill. I understand, however, that \nthe chairman and the members of the committee would like more time to \nmull over the idea before signing on to it. In that case, I wonder if \nthe chairman would be willing to consider including the SBDC proposal \nin next year's bill?\n  Mr. BOND. As my friend from Rhode Island may know, the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee is scheduled to undertake a regular, 3-year \nauthorization of our small business programs early next year. I long \nhave been a strong supporter of efforts to increase American exports, \nparticularly when it comes to small businesses. For this reason, I want \nto assure the Senator that the committee will take a hard look at this \nSBDC proposal as part of our review process. We would welcome his input \nat that time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator for his willingness to examine this \nmatter further, and look forward to working with him on it. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of \nthe chairman of the Small Business Committee with respect to language \nin division D of the omnibus appropriation bill, which incorporates the \nSenate substitute amendment to H.R. 3719 relating to the sale of the \nunguaranteed portion of loans made under the 7(a) program. It is my \nunderstanding that until the Small Business Administration issues a \nnew, final regulation setting forth the terms and conditions under \nwhich the unguaranteed portion of 7(a) loans may be permitted, or until \nMarch 31, 1997, whichever is earlier, lenders currently eligible to \nsecuritize may continue to do so under the existing regulation.\n  Mr. BOND. My colleague from new Jersey is correct. The securitization \nlanguage contained in this legislation in no way preempts the existing \nSBA regulations that currently apply to participants in the 7(a) \nprogram on the sale of the unguaranteed portion of such loans until SBA \nfinalizes a new regulation on this matter or until March 31, 1997, \nwhichever occurs first.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from Missouri and I would like to \ncommend him for crafting another bipartisan small business bill. It is \nmy hope that we will work closely together next year to provide \nguidance from the Small Business Committee to SBA as they are \nformulating their new securitization regulation.\n\n\n                Restoration of the Elwha River Ecosystem\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, section 114 of the Interior portion of \nthis omnibus appropriations bill addresses the Elwha River Ecosystem \nand Fisheries Restoration Act, Public Law 102-495. I would like to \nreflect on some of the legislative history of that section.\n  While section 114 slightly amends the Elwha Act, it also sustains and \nconfirms the Elwha Act itself. The amendment simply provides for one \nnew option in this restoration process: The State of Washington may \npurchase the dams for $2 after the Federal Government has bought them \nfor $29.5 million from the current private owner.\n  Should the State wish to acquire two aging dams, it must enter into \nan agreement with the Secretary of the Interior to discharge all of the \nobligations of the Federal Government, as established in the Elwha Act. \nAlthough it is almost impossible to envision a basis on which the State \nmight choose to purchase these projects, this amendment at least makes \nsuch a decision possible.\n  It is important to reiterate, the State may acquire the dams only if \nit agrees to remove the two dams, restore the fisheries, provide \nnumerous tribal obligations, protect the local water quality, and do \neverything the Federal Government was committed to doing under the \noriginal Elwha Act. I specifically want to stress that the State must \nundertake all of the obligations of the Act, including section 3 (a), \n(c), and (d), as well as sections 4, 7, and 9.\n  In case my colleagues were not aware of the current State \nresponsibilities for fisheries in Washington, the State manages fishery \nresources within State waters. It is required to manage these resources \nin a manner consistent with the Boldt decision regarding tribal treaty \nrights to fishery resources. The obligations under the Elwha Act are \nfar more expansive.\n  I need to clarify a mistake made this weekend. Senator Gorton and my \nstaff agreed Friday to report language that provided: ``None of the \nrequirements of the Elwha Act are changed unless the State elects to \nexercise its option to purchase and remove the projects.'' As a \ncolloquy between Senator Gorton and myself at the end of the bill \nreflects, that is the intent of the managers.\n  This colloquy makes clear an implied intention of the amendment: If \nthe State does not exercise its new option, then the Secretary and the \nUnited States remain fully obligated under this act to acquire the \ndams, remove them, restore the river's ecosystem and fisheries, and \ndeal honorably with the tribes. Until such time as the binding \nagreement provided for in this amendment is offered by the State and \napproved by the Federal Government, the Federal Government must \ncontinue to carry out its responsibilities under the Elwha Act with all \ndue speed.\n  I do not support the approach taken by this amendment. However, \nmy solace lies in my belief that the State would not--and should not--\naccept this option. Restoration of the Elwha ecosystem is a Federal \nresponsibility. It is on Federal land, in one of this nation's most \namazing parks and rainforests, the Olympic National Park. Only the \nFederal Government is responsible, via its trust obligations, to the \nS'Klallam people who have sacrificed so much as others have destroyed \nan historic religious and cultural icon, the abundant salmon runs of \nthe Elwha.\n\n  Despite reservations about this amendment, I am pleased with the true \nappropriations work done in this bill, that is allocation of funds to \nacquire these dams. I strongly support the $4 million appropriated for \nfiscal year 1997. The Congress provided the same amount last year. I \nlook forward to working to ensure the next administration demonstrates \nits commitment to this project with a substantial increase in its \nbudget request for this important fisheries restoration project.\n  The Elwha River and ecosystem are precious to the tribes, \nenvironmentalists, Olympic Peninsula communities, commercial and sport \nfishers, and other people throughout the region and country. This river \nsystem was one of the most productive salmon rearing and spawning \nresources in the Pacific Northwest. Today, those fisheries are \ndevastated. I appreciate the nearly $300,000 allocated in this bill for \nemergency measures to provide some relief for species currently \nimperiled.\n  I am committed to working with Senator Gorton and the next \nAdministration in the 105th Congress to ensure the Elwha ecosystem is \nfully restored as soon as possible.\n\n\n                               Elwha Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, would the senior Senator from Washington \nyield for a question on the bill language amending the Elwha Act \nincluded in the Interior section of the omnibus appropriations bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is it a correct interpretation of the language in \nsection 114, that none of the requirements of the Elwha Act are changed \nif the State of Washington elects not to purchase the projects?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                      appropriations for children\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to address my colleagues \nabout a matter that concerns the American public deeply--the well-being \nof their children.\n  I have come to the floor myself several times these past 2 years to \ntalk about our children's future. Since January of last year, when the \nHouse voted to cut school lunches and other nutrition programs; to this \npast spring, when I reported on my children's forums in Washington \nState; to just a month ago, when the Senate finally voted to require \nhospitals to allow new mothers to spend at least 48 hours in the \nhospital when delivering a baby, I have been a frequent and avid \nspeaker on issues affecting children and families.\n  I have always tried to present children's issues in three basic \ncategories: Their health, their education, and their ability to \ncontribute to society in the long term. In my view, those ideas are \npretty straightforward: every child has a right to good health; every \nchild has a right to an education; and every child has a right to grow \nup in strong, nurturing communities. The cycle is simple: a child who \nis healthy is able to learn; a learned child is able to participate in \nsociety; a society of contributing adults is able to uphold its \nresponsibilities to the children. Again, and again, and again.\n  This has been a very strange 2 years for children's policy. There \nhave been great victories, such as health insurance portability and \nmandatory maternity care. Threats have been turned aside, such as cuts \nin school lunches, jeopardizing Medicaid services for children, and \nelimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. And there have \nbeen defeats--reductions in student loans and direct lending, and a \nradical welfare bill that leaves millions of poor children in limbo.\n  As we near the end of the 104th Congress, I would like to take a \nmoment to explore some of the highs and lows for children, some of the \naccomplishments we have made that will help children, and some of the \nproblems we still face, and which will require our continuing attention \nin the next Congress.\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\n  After much wrangling, the fiscal year 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act \ncontinues our investment in young people's well-being in some important \nareas:\n  In infant health, the Healthy Start Program has made significant \ngains against infant mortality in several high-rate communities around \nthe Nation. In spite of initial attempts to cut it, Healthy Start \nfunding was increased from $75 million to $96 million. Healthy Start \nhas proven itself across partisan lines by creating effective models \nfor other communities. And, like many other children's health programs, \nit is very deserving of an increase.\n  Also, the maternal and child health services block grant was funded \nat $681 million. The block grant supports local communities in their \nefforts to provide many essential health services, including prenatal \ncare, newborn screening, and care for children with disabilities.\n\n  Other health areas, such as funding for the National Institutes for \nHealth, and funding for the Ryan White Act, and for AIDS research, also \nmet at least minimum targets in the bill.\n  Head Start works toward the improvement of the health and education \nof needy youngsters. Arguably, this program has done more for young \nchildren in terms of getting them healthy and ready for school than any \nother. It demands to be retained and expanded. The level of $3.98 \nbillion in this bill will allow the program to keep pace with \ninflation. This is good, but this will be an obvious program to expand \nnext year.\n  In the area of education funding, once Head Start has readied \nchildren for school, we must make sure they stay on equal footing with \ntheir peers. One way to do this is to assure they have access to \neducational technology. If we do not continue to give students access \nto the technology of today, they will not be able to get or hold the \njobs of tomorrow. I am glad the appropriations bill continues our \ninvestments in new education technology and technology challenge \ngrants.\n  We have made other positive efforts this year, such as my legislation \nwhich will put surplus government computers in schools. But these \nefforts will be less effective unless we are also investing in new \ntechnology, including networking capability, new hardware and software, \nand teacher training that schools will need to succeed.\n  The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program also fares better under this \nbill than I had hoped. This program increased by $56 million, which \npays for educational curriculum specifically designed to give students \noptions to the violence and drug use we see young people combat daily \nin today's society. Every school district in the country gets some of \nthis money, because there is no community in which drugs do not present \na threat to the potential of young Americans.\n  Beyond technology, funding the School-to-Work Program is vital. \nSchool-to-Work shows students the connection between what they learn in \nthe classroom and what they must know in the workplace. These programs \nhave been funded at $400 million, which is a $50 million improvement \nover last year's level. There is no better investment we can make for \nthe 75 percent of high school graduates who do not end up with a \ncollege degree.\n  When it comes to education, we too often forget adult students. In \nmost areas of this bill, we were only able to hold the line, and to \nsurvive. But in at least one area that is supported by Members of both \nparties, we were able to provide a much-needed increase for adult basic \neducation--adult literacy. The students here are some of the most \nheroic people in our country.\n  Many adults in this country are unable to read to their own children, \nor are faced with tests in the workplace that mean the difference \nbetween employment and unemployment. It is very difficult for these \nsame adults to go to programs at their local community college, or run \nby a nonprofit organization, and learn to read. It is truly courageous. \nAs they learn, they get better jobs, they provide better help to their \nchildren in school, and they contribute more to our society. This was a \ngreat next step; but especially with the welfare bill taking effect now \nand in the near future, we need to do more.\n\n  In areas of citizenship, one of our best investments is Americorps. \nAmericorps builds on the best traditions of the Civilian Conservation \nCorps, the G.I. bill, and the Peace Corps, by rewarding people for \nworking to improve their communities. It was eliminated in the House \nversion of the VA-HUD bill, so I am glad to see that Americorps \nprograms were returned to their 1996 levels. We should have new \ninvestments here, but at least we are continuing our investment.\n  There are still several areas of this Appropriations Act that do not \nmeet the test of providing at least the minimum basic standards for all \nyoung people in this country.\n  In basic child health, child immunization funding is $20 million \nlower than the level necessary. To underfund such a vital area, when we \nhave seen outbreaks of measles and other diseases in my State and \naround the Nation, is a move I do not understand and find troubling. We \nmust move forward, and expand immunization to deal with the needs we \nknow are out there. The prevention we provide, compared to the cost of \ntreating the diseases we allow, is not only cost effective, but also \nthe right thing to do. Additional appropriations would allow us to fund \nthe infrastructure, education, and registries which would get \nimmunizations to the underserved children who need them most.\n  On education, the huge task before us is in the area of teacher \ntraining. Goals 2000 was increased in this appropriations bill, but \nEisenhower professional development activities were cut this year. If \nour schools succeed in the next century in teaching job and thinking \nskills to students, it will be because of our teachers.\n  Our current teaching corps is aging and many will soon be retiring. \nResearch shows that for one teacher to learn one new skill that she or \nhe can reproduce in the classroom, they need to spend several hours \npracticing that skill under supervision of a master teacher.\n  When I look at the investments we must make to allow young people to \nbe the best possible citizens in our communities, I see that the Senate \nhas again made a mistake. The Summer Youth Employment Program is funded \nequal to 1996 funding, but here is one area where extra investment \ntruly would pay off with results for our communities. Young people are \nalways telling adults that they do not have anything to do, especially \nwhen school is out. Summer Youth Employment helps teach the skills of \nwork and work attitudes that will reduce violence, and improve young \npeople's confidence and self-control. Earlier versions of the bill \nwould have meant 134,000 fewer jobs for young people this summer. When \nwe are all working so hard to keep young people involved and interested \nin productive activities, this cut is absolutely the wrong thing to do.\n  Children and young people deserve their Senator's very best \ndecisionmaking. I would argue that children and young people need our \nattention and best efforts more than any other group of people in our \ncountry. What we have done here in this Appropriations Act, is to \nreject the open assaults on children's programs we saw earlier in this \nCongress. In order to get beyond a survival level, to a place where we \ncan say we are actually investing in the future, we must expand funding \nin preventive areas: in access to preventive health services, in the \nimprovement of teacher training, and in the expansion of productive \nactivities for youth.\n  This Congress has shown that it can muster the foresight and \ncompassion it takes to deal with issues affecting children. This \nCongress has also made some decisions I fear may have disturbing \neffects on countless young people. I have worked hard during this \nCongress, as have others, to do the very best for all of our children. \nLet us build upon this fiscal year 1997 Appropriations Act, so our \nactions will be remembered well by this Nation's children when they are \nold enough to vote.\n\n\n                                 amtrak\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am especially pleased with the \nadditional funding included in this continuing resolution for Amtrak.\n  Funding for Amtrak's capital accounts has followed a very torturous \npath this year. The administration's budget request for fiscal year \n1997 embodied its endorsement of the concept that Amtrak should strive \nfor self-sufficiency--that it should be free of a\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\nFederal operating subsidy within the next 6 years.\n  The administration recognizes that the key to self sufficiency for \nthe railroad is substantially increased investment in its capital \nplant--that a self sufficient Amtrak will require state-of-the-art, \nfirst-class, reliable equipment--clean stations and modern, efficient \nservice.\n  In its budget request for 1997, the administration called for a $232 \nmillion increase in funding for Amtrak's principle capital accounts.\n  Unfortunately, our House colleagues met this challenge with a \ntransportation bill that singled out Amtrak for devastating cuts. The \nHouse-passed transportation appropriations bill slashed Amtrak capital \nfunding by $145 million, more than 42 percent--providing zero for the \nNortheast Corridor Improvement Program--[NECIP].\n  Fortunately, thanks to the help and wisdom of Chairman Hatfield and \nmany of my colleagues, the Senate bill provided Amtrak an overall \nincrease for these crucial capital accounts including the full $200 \nmillion requested by the President for NECIP.\n  While the conference agreement on the regular transportation \nappropriations bill was still a substantial improvement upon the House-\npassed bill, funding for NECIP ended up 42 percent below the \nPresident's request.\n  During conference on the regular fiscal year 1997 transportation \nbill, I stated I would seek additional funding for NECIP in the \ncontinuing resolution. So I was pleased to work with Chairman Hatfield \nto construct a provision for this continuing resolution that added $60 \nmillion to NECIP while simultaneously providing $22.5 million to keep \nseveral routes in operation--routes in various parts of our country \nthat were slated for termination due to Amtrak's current financial \ndifficulties. This funding was completely offset with a series of \nnoncontroversial rescissions.\n  Mr. President, I have said time and time again that the key to \nAmtrak's future is the expeditious completion of the major \ninfrastructure improvements in the Northeast corridor. Amtrak's own \nstudies indicate that all of the increased revenue Amtrak can hope \nto capture in the near term will come from the Northeast corridor.\n\n  I have also long believed that we should have a financially healthy \nand adequately capitalized national railroad that serves as many areas \nas possible. As such, I was pleased to support Members' efforts to \nmaintain service to their States and throughout the country.\n  But as we work to keep the national Amtrak network together and avoid \nroute terminations, it has to be recognized that the key to Amtrak's \nself sufficiency--the key to Amtrak generating enough revenue to \noperate lines throughout the Midwest and the West, is adequate funding \nfor Amtrak's Northeast corridor.\n  This is not just the opinion of a Senator from the Northeast. It is \nwritten clearly across Amtrak's balance sheet. The Northeast corridor \ncarries half of all of Amtrak's riders and generates well over half of \nAmtrak's passenger-related revenues.\n  Indeed, Amtrak's President, Tom Downs, recently testified to the \nSenate Commerce Committee that, were it not for the recent positive \nfinancial performance of the Northeast corridor, the trains that were \nslated for termination in the next few months would have been \nterminated several months ago.\n  As such, I am very pleased that this continuing resolution includes \nour amendment providing the additional $82.5 million for Amtrak, \nincluding the additional $60 million for NECIP. This will bring the \nfinal funding level for NECIP to $175 million. While this is still $25 \nmillion below the administration's request, it is well above last \nyear's level.\n  This funding is essential to assure the development of efficient \nhigh-speed rail service throughout the entire Northeast before the end \nof the century. It will be that kind of service that will produce the \nrevenue to allow Amtrak to avoid service cuts elsewhere in the country.\n  I thank my many allies in this effort. Most notably, I want to thank \nour Chairman, Senator Hatfield, who stood firm throughout his \nnegotiations with the House on this item. Also, Senator Wyden, Senator \nBiden, Senator Roth, Senator Hutchison, Senator Bumpers, Senator Pryor, \nSenator Pell, Senator Shelby, and the majority leader Senator Lott.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address section 330 of the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act, which amends the Rhode Island Claims \nSettlement Act to preclude the Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode \nIsland from conducting gaming on its lands under the authority of the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  Contained in the general provisions of the bill relating to the \nInterior Department appropriations and the narrative which accompanies \nsection 330, is a colloquy that I engaged in with Senators Pell and \nChafee on September 15, 1988.\n  Should the inclusion of this colloquy in the measure be perceived as \nan indication of my support for this provision, I feel that I must set \nthe record straight.\n  I believe that the record should show that at the time of our \ncolloquy, there was an underlying premise upon which our discussion was \nbased, which I have since learned, was erroneous.\n  That underlying premise was that there had been no intervening events \nof legal significance that would warrant any change in the provisions \nof the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act.\n  At the time that the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement was agreed \nto in 1978, the Narragansett people were organized as a State-chartered \ncorporation. Given that status, it is perhaps understandable that the \nsettlement act provided for the extension of State criminal, civil, and \nregulatory laws to the settlement lands.\n  But in 1983, the Narragansett Indian Tribe achieved federally-\nrecognized status, and in 1988, a few days before the September 15, \n1988 colloquy, the tribe's settlement lands were taken into trust by \nthe United States.\n  These two intervening events are important because federally-\nrecognized status generally confers upon tribes exclusive jurisdiction \nover their lands, and when their lands are taken into trust, the \nprotections of Federal law are extended to the lands, and the \ncombination of Federal and tribal law and jurisdiction over the lands \nacts to pre-empt the application of State laws to such lands.\n  Indeed, the legal significance of these intervening events was of \nsuch import, that in 1994, the First Circuit Court of Appeals concluded \nthat the provisions of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act \nwere affected by the two events, and that the State no longer has \nexclusive jurisdiction over the settlement lands. The first circuit \nheld, instead, that the State's jurisdiction was concurrent with that \nof the Narragansett tribe.\n  Let us be clear about what section 330 of the Omnibus Appropriations \nmeasure has as its objective--it will effect a return to the State of \nthe law as it was in 1978, notwithstanding the fact that the tribe is \nnow federally-recognized and would otherwise enjoy the status of other \nfederally-recognized tribes, and notwithstanding the fact that the \ntribe's settlement lands are now held by the United States in trust for \nthe tribe and would otherwise not be subject to the exclusive \njurisdiction of the State of Rhode Island.\n  Some might question why this extraordinary action is being taken--why \nthis provision was so important that the jurisdiction of the \nauthorizing committees was circumvented and this amendment to \nsubstantive law, which by the way, has absolutely nothing to do with \nthe appropriation of funds in fiscal year 1997--was included in this \nspending bill. The answer, as I understand it, is to prevent the tribe \nfrom operating a bingo hall on tribal lands.\n  In my 17 years of service on the Committee on Indian Affairs, in my 8 \nyears of service as the committee's chairman, and for the last 2 years, \nas the committee's vice-chairman, I have, for the most part, been proud \nof the manner in which the United States has dealt with the Indian \nnations on a government-to-government basis.\n  We have attempted to reverse or at a minimum address the effects of \nsome of the darker chapters of our history as a Nation when it comes to \nour treatment of the indigenous people of this land. We have resolved \nto consult with them on any law or policy which will affect their lives \nor their Governments, and indeed, Federal law requires that we do so.\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\n  But today over the strenuous and adamant objections of this tribe, we \nare enacting into law a provision that holds the potential to forever \nchange their lives, without the benefit of hearings, in the absence of \nany record that would serve to justify our action, and without any \nconsultation with the affected tribe.\n  I have advised my colleagues from Rhode Island that I could not \nsupport this provision. I also so advised the President of the United \nStates, the minority leader, and the Members of the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees. And so, Mr. President, it will come as no \nsurprise to my colleagues, when I state my intention, as I do today, to \ncall for hearings early in the next session of the Congress on this \nmatter.\n  And further, I want to put others on notice that as long as I \ncontinue to serve in this body, the action we approve today, will not \nserve as a precedent for similar action affecting other tribes, nor \nwill it define the manner in which we deal with the Indian people.\n  Mr. President, our constitution establishes a distinctively different \nframework for our relations with the Indian tribes, and 200 years of \nFederal law and policy have been constructed on that foundation. We are \na Nation which prides ourselves on our honor and integrity in our \ndealings with all people. We owe no less to this Nation's first \nAmericans.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote for the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill today.\n  I will vote for this bill because the funding levels it provides will \nhelp to meet the day to day needs of working Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  This bill addresses Democratic priorities. Democrats are working for \nhealth security, paycheck security, personal security and national \nsecurity. The American people have made clear that these Democratic \npriorities are theirs as well. So I am pleased that this bill provides \nsupport for programs in each of these areas.\n  Let me speak first about health security. I am pleased that health \nprograms will receive increased funding so that scientists and \nresearchers can continue to search for the cure for diseases like \ncancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health is increased. Funding for breast cancer research, \nAIDS and childhood immunization all receive needed funds to continue \ncritical life saving work.\n  This funding is particularly important for Maryland, both in terms of \nthe number of jobs generated by the NIH and the impact of the research. \nInstitutions such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland fund \ncritical research programs through the NIH. Keeping the funding at \nneeded levels for the NIH will truly save lives and save jobs in \nMaryland.\n  Democrats also value economic security, and know that support for \neducation is a key part of the opportunity structure that will create \njobs now and in the future. I strongly support the education spending \nlevels in this bill. The bill increases education spending over Fiscal \nyear 1996 levels for key programs, including Goals 2000, Safe and Drug \nFree Schools, Title I, the Pell Grant program, and the TRIO Program.\n  For my State of Maryland, this means additional funds for cash-\nstrapped local school districts. Maryland will receive nearly $7 \nmillion for Goals 2000 reforms. These funds will enable local \nschool districts to implement curriculum reform efforts to raise \nacademic standards.\n\n  I am pleased that funding for safe and drug free schools has \nincreased. Maryland will receive over $7 million to help combat crime \nand drugs in schools. Title I is an important program to help \ndisadvantaged students learn basic reading and math skills. Maryland \nwill receive $91 million for title I funding. Pell Grant funding has \nincreased to $2,700 for low-income college students. This means more \nfunds will be available for thousands of Maryland college students.\n  The funding levels for the TRIO program have increased. TRIO provides \ncollege opportunities like Upward Bound to minority students. TRIO \nprovides thousands of minority students in Maryland with access to \nhigher education.\n  In addition to increased education funding levels, the omnibus \nspending bill increases funding for the Department of Labor's job \ntraining program and dislocated worker assistance program. I strongly \nsupport these initiatives, because thousands of Maryland residents will \ncontinue to receive job training assistance and help with job search \nand relocation assistance.\n  Programs that help to provide personal security are also well funded \nby this legislation. These programs help ensure that our communities \nwill be safer and our children will be better protected from drugs and \ncrime.\n  Perhaps most significant is that funding for the COPS program is \npreserved. This program has been one of the great successes in fighting \ncrime. Thanks to this program, over 900 new police officers are \npatrolling the streets in Maryland's cities and towns. I am a strong \nsupporter of this program because it is making a real difference--\nprotecting our communities by putting more cops on the beat. This bill \nalso includes more money to fund the Violence Against Women Act, and \nfunds to fight juvenile crime and keep our kids away from drugs through \ndrug prevention programs.\n  This bill also addresses important national security concerns. It \nfunds the President's antiterrorism initiatives. It is a sad day that \nwe must face the reality that terrorism has come to our communities. \nWe must ensure that we do not experience another Oklahoma City. The \nbest way to fight terrorism is to prevent it. This legislation takes \nconcrete steps to prevent terrorism by upgrading the security of our \npublic buildings, increasing our intelligence capability, and expanding \nthe number of criminal investigators to fight and prevent terrorism.\n\n  So key Democratic priorities are well-funded in this legislation. \nPeople will be safer in their homes and their communities, critical \nhealth research will be supported, and education and training so vital \nto a promising economic future will be provided. These are mainstream \nAmerican values, and I am pleased to see that these values are implicit \nin this legislation.\n  In addition to providing appropriations for the agencies and \nDepartments of the Federal Government for which individual \nappropriations were not approved, this bill also contains a major \nauthorizing program. I refer to the illegal immigration bill. I am \npleased that the negotiations on this portion of the bill have produced \na measure which is tough on those who violate our immigrations laws, \nbut which is not punitive to those who have entered this country \nlegally.\n  The illegal immigration legislation will strengthen our efforts to \nprevent undocumented immigrants from entering our country and obtaining \nemployment. It will increase border patrols, create a voluntary pilot \nprogram for employment verification, and require additional INS \ninvestigators .\n  I had strong reservations about the conference report on this bill \nbecause of provisions which would have denied Federal assistance to \nlegal immigrants. After all, legal immigrants have played by the rules, \nthey pay taxes just like any U.S. citizen, and they contribute to the \neconomy. I am pleased that the concerns I had have been addressed in \nthis final compromise measure.\n  Under this compromise, we now focus on putting a halt to illegal \nimmigration, which was our goal when we passed the Senate version of \nthe bill. It is especially important that the so-called Gallegly \namendment was dropped. Many of us were strongly opposed to this \nprovision which would have denied a public education to illegal \nimmigrant children. Children should not be punished for the errors \nof their parents.\n\n  I am very disappointed that we were not able to include the Senate-\npassed provisions for those seeking political asylum. The United States \nhas always reached out to those fleeing persecution. The Leahy \namendment which the Senate approved would have made sure that people \nseeking asylum were treated fairly. It would have given them the time \nthey needed to present their case, and ensured that no Immigration \nofficial could send them back to their country without a fair hearing. \nIt is disappointing that this good provision was not included in the \nmeasure. I hope we will be able to take care of this problem in the \nnext Congress.\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\n  This omnibus appropriations bill represents the triumph of mainstream \nvalues. It rejects extremism. It addresses the concerns of America's \nfamilies. The funding it provides for programs important to personal \nsecurity, to national security, to economic security, and to health \nsecurity ensure that we keep the promises we have made to help our \nworking families and senior citizens. So I will vote to support this \nbill, and hope my colleagues will join me.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce our success in \npassing the Shelby-Mack regulatory relief bill which is included as \npart of the omnibus appropriations bill. This bill will allow banks to \ndevote additional resources to productive activities, such as making \nloans and extending credit to small businesses and potential \nhomeowners. This hard fought, thoroughly debated legislation \nstreamlines disclosure requirements, eliminates duplicative regulation \nand removes unnecessary filing and record keeping requirements.\n  I have been working diligently on a regulatory relief package for \nmany years. It is only with tireless effort, conviction in market \nprinciples, and the blessing of a Republican Congress have we been able \nto turn the tides of banking legislation and provide significant \nregulatory relief for America's financial sector. In doing so, we have \nstrengthened America's banking system and produced an environment \nconducive to competing in the rapidly changing, global financial \nmarket.\n  While I am convinced this bill will encourage economic growth and \nopportunity, by no means do I believe our job in Congress is complete. \nOver the years, we have witnessed an accumulation of banking laws with \ncomplete disregard to the burden it has placed on financial \ninstitutions and with very little value-added in terms of safety and \nsoundness. I continue to believe that a more thoughtful structure of \nbanking laws accentuating free market principles and jettisoning the \nheavy hand of Government regulation is the only way to ensure American \nfinancial institutions have the ability to complete in the dynamic \nmarketplace of the 21st century. The Shelby-Mack bill is just the first \nderegulation bill a Republican Congress will give the American people. \nNext year I intend to move forward with another bill to increase the \naccess of credit to consumers as well as strengthen the safety and \nsoundness of the U.S. financial system.\n  In particular, the Community Reinvestment Act [CRA] places an \nenormous regulatory burden on banks--especially small banks. The truth \nof the matter is that banking, financial and labor regulations drive up \nthe cost of low and moderate income housing for the very people they \nare intended to help. Indeed, Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey \nhas stated that ``[a]n urban policy that increases the flexibility and \ncreativity allowable under CRA and recognizes the wide variety of \nfinancial services and the enormous diversity of the markets involved \ncould be a powerful tool to those in the business of community \ndevelopment.'' It is my intention to address these regulatory \ninequities in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, as consumers and politicians realize the benefits of \nthe efforts of the 104th Congress, it is my sincere hope that \nlegislators will understand the value of independent thinking and the \neconomic freedom we seek to bestow upon every American in the United \nStates.\n\n\nasset conservation, lender liability, and deposit insurance protection \n                              act of 1996\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would also like to pose a question to the \nchairman of the Senate Banking Committee to clarify the intent of the \nAsset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection \nAct of 1996 with respect to EPA'S authority to issue rules defining the \nscope of Superfund liability.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would be pleased to take part in such a colloquy.\n  Mr. SMITH. As you know, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit rules that CERCLA does not authorize EPA \nto issue binding rules that define the scope of liability under \nSuperfund. Kelley v. EPA, 15 F.3d 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1994), 25 F.3d 1088 \n(D.C. Cir. 1994). Title V of this bill gives EPA limited and specific \nrulemaking authority on two narrow issues. The first one is the \nrecognition of additional fiduciary capacities under new section \n107(n)(5)(a)(i)(XI) of CERCLA. The second one is the involuntary \nacquisition of property by the United States Government under 40 CFR \nsection 300.1105.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH. It is my understanding that in granting EPA the authority \nto issue rules on these two narrow issues, title V does not in any way \ndisturb the central holding in the Kelley case, namely that absent a \nspecific delegation, that CERCLA, today, or as amended by this act, \ndoes not authorize EPA to issue rules defining the scope of CERCLA \nliability. I would like to confirm that my interpretation is the \ncorrect one, in order to avoid possible confusion and uncertainty in \nthe future.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH. Finally, it is also my understanding that title V does not \nseek to confer upon EPA the authority to issue rules on any Superfund \nliability issues other than those actually specified in this bill. I \nwould like to confirm this important point so that the actions of the \nCongress in adopting this legislation are not misinterpreted in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Again the Senator is correct. EPA is given authority \nonly to address the two specific issues covered by title V. No other \nrulemaking authority is conferred or affected by this legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, under the \nterms of the Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit \nInsurance Protection Act of 1996, the liability of a fiduciary cannot \nexceed the assets held in its fiduciary capacity.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And, would the chairman further agree, in determining the \nfiduciary's liability, the language is meant to apply to the value of \nthe assets after any improvement due to any cleanup activity which may \nbe undertaken? In fact, Mr. Chairman, it is the intent of this entire \nprovision to create incentives for cleanup and the productive reuse of \ncontaminated properties.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss language that has \nbeen included in the continuing resolution regarding clarifications to \nthe liability of lending institutions under Superfund. During the past \nyear, I have been working closely with Senator John Chafee, the \nchairman of the Environment Committee, to enact comprehensive \nlegislation to reform the Superfund program. The bill we introduced, S. \n1285, the Accelerated Cleanup and Environmental Restoration Act of \n1996, includes language to address the issue of lender liability. A \nversion of our lender liability language is contained in the continuing \nresolution that we will be voting on today.\n  Unfortunately, S. 1285 will not make it into law before we adjourn. \nDespite months of daily negotiations with Senator Max Baucus, the \nranking member of the Environment Committee, Senator Frank Lautenberg, \nthe ranking member of the Superfund Subcommittee, as well as \nrepresentatives of the Clinton administration, we were unable to obtain \nbipartisan agreement on this legislation. This is unfortunate, because \nI fervently believe that the Superfund program is badly in need of \nreform.\n  During the 104th Congress, Senator Chafee and I actively opposed \nefforts to carve out various liability concerns, deciding instead that \nissues such as lender liability should be included in a comprehensive \nreform package. Nonetheless, after discussing this issue personally \nwith Senator Alphonse D'Amato, the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nboth Senator Chafee and I agreed that we would have our respective \nstaff work together to include the provision contained in the \ncontinuing resolution. So, while I am saddened that we could not enact \ncomprehensive Superfund reform legislation, I am pleased that we are \nable to address the problem of lender liability this year.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to discuss why this language is so \nimportant. As many of my colleagues may\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\nknow, liability under Superfund is strict, retroactive, joint and \nsevere. As Superfund has been interpreted by the courts, banks that \nmerely take possession of Superfund contaminated property by \nforeclosure, risk the possibility that they themselves could be held \nliable for any cleanup that may be required. Thus, a lender who had no \ndirect involvement at the site could be on the hook for cleanup costs \nfar exceeding the original value of the underlying property.\n  Because of the specter of potential Superfund liability, financial \ncredit that is needed for redevelopment or cleanup is not extended. The \nresults of the current liability provisions are all too evident. \nHomeowners cannot refinance homes, brownfields sit uselessly in our \ncities, and companies do not take part in voluntary cleanups for want \nof funds.\n  The language that Senator D'Amato and I have included in the \ncontinuing resolution moves to correct this situation by clarifying \nwhen a lender is liable for environmental contamination. Lenders will \nnot be liable unless they take an active role in management of the \nsite. This change will significantly reduce lender concerns about \nmaking loans at these sites and will significantly increase the amount \nof redevelopment funding available in our Nation's inner-city \nbrownfield areas. This development is vitally important to restore the \nlarge number of brownfields to productive use, to allow homeowners \naccess to funds to refinance their homes, and companies to continue \nvoluntary cleanups. The liability provisions in this bill will go a \nlong way toward making these things possible.\n  I do want to clarify one issue; the language we are adopting today is \nnot a liability carve out. Indeed, Superfund as originally passed, did \nnot intend to hold lending institutions liable for this type of \nbusiness activity. Unfortunately, a series of conflicting court \ndecisions over the authority of the EPA to issue rules clarifying \nlender liability has left this issue unsettled. Thus, the language we \nare adopting today merely clarifies a liability outcome that was \nalready intended by Congress.\n  The issue of brownfield redevelopment is a matter that has been long \nspearheaded by Republicans, most notably John Chafee, and by making \nthis one very logical change, we will be able to spur reinvestment by \nprivate financial markets in the blighted parts of our country.\n  As I alluded to earlier, although this issue is clearly within the \njurisdiction of the Subcommittee of Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk \nAssessment, I was pleased to work with Senator D'Amato to include this \nenlightened provision in the continuing resolution. I believe this is a \npositive change to Superfund, and I thank Senator D'Amato for working \nwith me on this issue of mutual concern.\n\n\n                    paying-up at the united nations\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, one aspect of the continuing resolution \nwhich troubles me deeply is the level of funding for assessed U.S. \ncontributions to the United Nations and other international \norganizations of which the United States is a member. The \nadministration's adjusted request for this account was $1.002 billion. \nThe bill provides $892 million. This level is $110 million less than \nthe request. It does not provide funds to pay any of our arrearages, \nand because it is insufficient to cover our assessments, the result \nwill be further U.S. indebtedness, not only to the United Nations but \nalso to some of its specialized agencies.\n  I know that many on the other side of the aisle, and perhaps some on \nthis side as well, believe that the only way we can force the United \nNations to make the administrative and management reforms we all seek \nis to withhold some or all of our contributions. I think they \nmisunderstand the nature of the United Nations, and the U.N. \nenvironment, and also the degree to which our contributions provide \nleverage.\n  Certainly the United States is the last remaining superpower and the \nlargest single contributor to the United Nations. But we are not the \nonly power in the United Nations, and we cannot simply impose our \ndemands on the organization. The United Nations is an organization \ncomprised of 185 members. Many of the administrative and financial \nreforms that we hope to achieve must be voted on by the General \nAssembly. In order for us to succeed in that body, we must convince a \nmajority of States that the proposed reform make sense, and do not \nhinder their own interests. For example, our effort to reduce the \npercentage of U.S. contributions to the United Nations will impact on \nthe contributions made by other States, no doubt in the end requiring \nthem to pay more. Certainly there are states that today can afford to \npick up a greater share of the U.N.'s operating expenses. But we cannot \nforce them to do so. We have to convince a majority of them, \nparticularly the other major powers such as our European allies and \nJapan that changes in the assessment levels will, in the end, \nstrengthen the United Nations as an institution, and thus be in the \ninterest of all states.\n  Our ability to build support for reforms at the United Nations has \nbeen eroded by Congress' refusal to provide the necessary funds for the \nUnited States to pay its dues to the United Nations. Initially, the \nthreat of withholding contributions may have been effective. It isn't \nanymore. This tactic has simply made the United States into a deadbeat \ndebtor. As of this month the United States owes a total of $1.7 billion \nto the United Nations--$414 million for the regular U.N. budget, $771 \nmillion for peacekeeping and $542 million for the specialized agencies. \nOur failure to pay has subjected us to sharp criticism, particularly \nfrom our key European allies who also contribute a fair share of the \nU.N. budget, and it has decreased, not increased, our leverage, \nparticularly to promote reforms desired by the Congress.\n  The United Nations is very much an unruly debating society. Every \nmember has a voice and a vote. Consensus is the primary method of \ndecision-making. Certainly the positions of the United States carry \ngreat weight but our demands and needs, even with our veto, are not the \nonly defining factor.\n  If we are serious about reforming the United Nations, we need to be \nserious about fulfilling our financial obligations to that institution. \nI hope that next year Congress and the administration will have a \nmeeting of the minds on this issue. There must be agreement on a set of \nreforms that can be achieved over a reasonable time period and a \nformula for payment that will enable the United States to become \ncurrent on its financial obligations. This kind of plan would make it \nclear to other U.N. members that the United States is serious, not only \nabout reform but also about paying its dues. In my view, this is \nimperative if the United States is going to lead a successful reform \neffort at the United Nations.\n\n\n                     national institute of justice\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman in a \nbrief colloquy to acknowledge the committee's support for initiatives \nunder the National Institute of Justice [NIJ] account. In particular, I \nwould like to address the NIJ's efforts to undertake a national study \non correctional health care.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to accommodate the gentleman from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman. Mr. President, let me first \nacknowledge the chairman and the committee for their diligent efforts \nto produce a fiscal year 1997 Commerce, State, Justice, and Judiciary \nappropriations bill.\n  Within the bill the committee has included language under the NIJ \naccount that provides funding for a study on the potential health risks \nof soon-to-be-released inmates. This language is quite important to our \nNation's criminal justice system and to nonprofit organizations devoted \nto assisting States with correctional health-care programs. For \nexample, in my home State of Michigan, the National Commission on \nCorrectional Health Care has been working with health and correctional \nofficials to stem escalating costs and other problems associated with \ncorrectional health care. In light of the potential health risk \nassociated with the nearly 11 million persons released each year from \njails, prisons, and other correctional facilities, the National \nCommission is committed to assisting correctional and public health \nofficials nationwide with correctional health-care concerns.\n  In addition to efforts at NIJ, I am also aware that the Centers for \nDisease Control believes an initiative along\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\nthese lines would be beneficial to its efforts to suppress the spread \nof infectious and highly communicable diseases within correctional \nsettings. As we look to advance efforts to provide pertinent data \nrelevant to the correctional system, we should encourage efforts like \nthat of the National Commission, which effectively contributes to the \ndevelopment of information relevant to correctional and public health \nofficials.\n  Mr. GREGG. My colleague from Michigan makes a strong case in support \nof this initiative and the work of the National Commission. I, too, \nappreciate the importance of NIJ programs and of nonprofit \norganizations that provide a better understanding of correctional \nhealth care.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his sensitivity \nto correctional health care issues.\n\n\n                     law enforcement support center\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would ask if the Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, would join me in a colloquy regarding a \nprovision included in the Senate report for the appropriations bill \nfunding the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, \nand Related Agencies.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would be pleased to join in a colloquy \nwith the senior Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. President, the \nappropriations bill reported from the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary included within the immigration \nexaminations fees account $3,325,000 for the Law Enforcement Support \nCenter in Vermont. It is my understanding that the $567,550,000 \nprovided in the omnibus appropriations conference report for \nimmigration examinations fees includes the $3.325 million for the Law \nEnforcement Center. Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree with my \ninterpretation.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Vermont is correct. The funding provided \nfor immigration examinations fees does include $3.325 million to fund \nthe Law Enforcement Support Center in Vermont.\n\n\n       federal law enforcement dependents assistance act of 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to bring to Chairman Gregg's \nattention the passage of S. 2101, the Federal Law Enforcement \nDependents Assistance Act of 1996, which I introduced with 10 \nRepublican and Democrat cosponsors. S. 2101 authorizes, for the first \ntime, educational and job training assistance for the spouses and \nchildren of Federal law enforcement officers killed or totally disabled \nin the line of duty. These benefits will be subject to the availability \nof appropriations and will be distributed to eligible dependents based \non an application to be devised by the Attorney General.\n  This legislation passed the Senate on September 20 by unanimous \nconsent and passed the House of Representatives on September 26, which \nwas too late to be taken into account by the Appropriations Committee \nin the fiscal year 1997 bill we are considering today. I would ask the \nSenator from New Hampshire for his thoughts on funding for this \nvaluable program.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania has raised an \nimportant issue. The Federal Government has a responsibility for \nhelping the families of Federal law enforcement officers who are lost \nor disabled in the line of duty. Educational and job training \nassistance is one appropriate response and deserves the support of the \nCongress. I would encourage the administration to consider \nreprogramming funds to support this effort.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished chairman of \nthe Committee on Small Business would like to comment on the Senate \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 3719, the Small Business Programs \nImprovement Act of 1996. Am I correct in my understanding that this \nlegislation is included in the omnibus appropriations bill that will be \nconsidered by the Senate today, and that it contains important \nprovisions designed to preserve and strengthen several SBA finance \nprograms that benefit small businesses throughout the country.\n  Mr. BOND. The distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee is \ncorrect. Today the Senate will have an opportunity to pass a bipartisan \nbill that makes many improvements to the Small Business Act and the \nSmall Business Investment Act and assures continued availability of \ncapital and financing to small businesses through SBA's 7(a), 504 and \nSBIC programs. I thank the Senator for his longstanding and consistent \nsupport of small businesses, and for his understanding of their special \nneeds in the financing area. This legislation includes the provision \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee and I jointly developed to \nenhance the availability of SBIC leverage. I commend the Senator for \nhis creativity and his support for new ways to improve small business \naccess to capital.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am pleased that this very important new provision is \nincluded in this legislation. I believe it is appropriate for the \nFederal Home Loan Bank system to assist small businesses, by making \nadditional leverage investments in SBIC's, as an element in fulfilling \nthe Federal Home Loan Banks' community and economic development \nmission.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the \nrecord a short statement describing this new statutory provision and \nexpressing the joint views of the Banking Committee and the Small \nBusiness Committee on this matter.\n\n\n   banking committee and small business committee joint explanatory \n                               statement\n\n  The small business investment company improvements provisions \nincluded in the omnibus appropriations legislation contains a \nconforming amendment to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act that preserves \nand strengthens existing law specifying that stock, obligations or \nother securities of certain small business investment companies are \nauthorized investments for Federal Home Loan Banks. The current Federal \nHome Loan Bank Act provision refers only to small business investment \ncompanies formed pursuant to section 301(d) of the Small Business \nInvestment Act.\n  This legislation amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to make clear \nthat Federal Home Loan Banks are permitted, subject to any regulations, \nrestrictions and limitations that may be prescribed by the Federal \nHousing Finance Board, to invest in stock, obligations or other \nsecurities of any small business investment company licensed and \noperating under the supervision of the Small Business Administration. \nThis authority exists independently of whether the SBIC is owned by or \naffiliated with a banking organization. This amendment is intended to \nencourage Federal Home Loan Banks, on a prudent and financially sound \nbasis, to play a part in satisfying the needs of small businesses for \nthe kind of venture capital for business start-up or expansion that is \nmade available by small business investment companies.\n  A Federal Home Loan Bank's loans to or investments in an SBIC will \nnot be counted as private capital of the SBIC within the meaning of \nSection 103(9) of the Small Business Investment Act. The structure of \nthe Small Business Investment Act contemplates that an SBIC, rather \nthan raising its original private capital from governmental or quasi-\ngovernmental sources, should demonstrate an ability to raise a \nsignificant amount of capital from private sources that demand a \nmarket-based financial return. Once an SBIC has raised this private \ncapital and has become licensed by SBA, however, Federal Home Loan \nBanks would be furthering the legitimate objective of economic and \ncommunity development through promoting small business investment and \ngrowth.\n  In order to be attractive to SBICs that will, in most cases, be \nmaking long term portfolio investments, Federal Home Loan Bank \ninvestments to provide SBIC leverage should be made on a long term \nbasis as well. Federal Home Loan Banks now routinely make long term \nadvances to members in the normal course of business. However, under \nsome circumstances a Federal Home Loan Bank may wish to sell or \nliquidate an SBIC investment prior to its stated maturity or prior to \nthe date by which the Federal Home Loan Bank expects to receive a \ncomplete return on its investment. Because the Federal Home Loan Bank \nAct does not require that an investment in an SBIC be acquired directly \nfrom the SBIC, a Federal Home Loan Bank would be permitted to acquire \nand dispose of SBIC\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\ninvestments in secondary transactions, including transactions with \nother Federal Home Loan Banks. In addition, a Federal Home Loan Bank, \nfor purposes of liquidity, diversification or otherwise, may want to \nstructure its investments in SBIC's through a trustee relationship or \nother special purpose intermediary. This structure is permissible under \nthe Federal Home Loan Bank Act as long as the Federal Home Loan Bank's \nbeneficial ownership interest in the SBIC investment is sufficiently \ndocumented and the trustee or special purpose intermediary holds only \nstock, obligations or other securities of an SBIC or other authorized \nFederal Home Loan Bank investments.\n  The Small Business Investment Act prescribes limits on the amount of \nSBA leverage made available to an SBIC. These statutory limits on SBA \nleverage are designed in part of achieve a fair distribution of SBA \nleverage among all SBICs in a situation where there may be more \nrequests for leverage than SBA has authorization or appropriations to \nsatisfy. A Federal Home Loan Bank should not invest in a single SBIC an \namount in excess of any aggregate limits or percentages established by \nthe Bank or by the Federal Housing Finance Board, but the statutory \nmaximum on SBA leverage set forth in the Small Business Investment Act \ndoes not apply to Federal Home Loan Banks.\n\n  In establishing the terms and conditions on which SBIC loans or \ninvestment will be made, Federal Home Loan Banks may want to take into \naccount both the terms and conditions on which SBA now makes leverage \navailable to its SBIC licensees, as well as the expected risk-adjusted \nreturn and other terms on which Federal Home Loan Banks structure their \nadvances to members. Some SBIC's receive ``participating security'' \nleverage from SBA, structured as an equity instrument rather than debt \nof the SBIC. Other SBICs obtain traditional debt leverage from SBA \nthrough the issuance of debentures. The language of the Federal Home \nLoan Bank Act gives Federal Home Loans Banks the discretion to provide \nleverage to an SBIC on terms similar to the equity or debt securities \nSBIC's now issue to obtain leverage through SBA, or on any other terms \napproved by the banks and the Federal Housing Finance Board.\n  SBA's participating security leverage offers some advantages for \nSBIC's planning to make equity oriented portfolio investments that are \nnot expected to generate sufficient early stage cash flows to satisfy \nregular interest payment requirements. Leverage structured as equity \nalso makes its easier for SBIC's to attract private capital from \ncertain institutional investors that would not invest private capital \nin an SBIC planning to obtain debt leverage. If a Federal Home Loan \nBank provides equity leverage to an SBIC, the investment could be \nstructured as a preferred investment or otherwise senior in priority \nover the private equity capital of the SBIC.\n  If a Federal Home Loan Bank investment in an SBIC is structured as \ndebt, the Federal Home Loan Bank could obtain a first priority security \ninterest or an unsecured senior position acceptable to the bank with \nregard to SBIC portfolio investments made with the proceeds of the \nFederal Home Loan Bank leverage. If the SBIC has SBA leverage \noutstanding or subsequently obtains SBA leverage, the SBIC's issuance \nof the Federal Home Loan Bank debt would be subject to the Small \nBusiness Investment Act's provisions dealing with third party debt of \nan SBIC. Section 303(c) of the Small Business Investment Act, as \namended by this legislation, requires that SBA not permit an SBIC \nhaving outstanding SBA leverage to incur third party debt that would \ncreate or contribute to an unreasonable risk of default or loss to the \nFederal Government, and directs SBA to permit SBICs to incur such debt \nonly on terms and subject to such conditions as may be established by \nSBA. In furtherance of the public policy objectives of encouraging the \ndevelopment of an additional source of reduced-cost leverage and to \nattract additional participation in the SBIC program that will increase \nthe amount of venture capital available for small businesses, SBA \nshould implement Section 303(c) in a manner that does not limit the \nability of Federal Home Loan Banks to provide leverage to SBICs.\n  Because Section 303(c) applies only to an SBIC having outstanding SBA \nleverage, SBA need not review or approve, and should not establish any \nconditions with regard to, a Federal Home Loan Bank investment in an \nSBIC with no outstanding SBA leverage. For an SBIC with outstanding SBA \nleverage, SBA should allow the SBIC to obtain additional debt or equity \nleverage from a Federal Home Loan Bank as long as the Federal Home Loan \nBank investment does not give the Federal Home Loan Bank a priority \nclaim on any assets of the SBIC attributable to or acquired with the \nproceeds of SBA leverage. Similarly, the existence of any outstanding \nFederal Home Loan Bank leverage should not cause SBA to decline a \nsubsequent SBIC application for SBA leverage, as long as the terms of \nthe outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank leverage do not give the Federal \nHome Loan Bank a priority claim on SBIC assets attributable to or made \nwith the proceeds of any SBA leverage.\n\n\n                          thrift tax provision\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Finance, it \nis my responsibility to make sure that tax-related measures are \nreviewed and evaluated by the Committee on Finance. Like other \ncommittees, the Committee on Finance takes very seriously its \njurisdictional responsibilities. The House Committee on Ways and Means \nsimilarly exercises its jurisdictional responsibilities on tax-related \nmeasures in the House of Representatives.\n  Historically, the Committees on Finance and Ways and Means have \nopposed the inclusion of tax-related measures in appropriation bills. \nHowever, because of the unusual circumstances surrounding this \nappropriations bill, Mr. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Committee \non Ways and Means, requested that the Committee on Appropriations \ninclude a tax-related measure in the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I concur with Mr. Archer's request. But my colleagues \nshould be aware that this is a unique situation. The tax-related \nmeasure will expedite consideration of important banking legislation \nthat is also contained in the bill. The tax-related measure does not \nchange the Internal Revenue Code. It merely clarifies the current-law \ntreatment of special assessments that many thrifts will pay in \naccordance with the banking legislation. The staffs of the Committees \non Finance and Ways and Means worked together to develop the tax-\nrelated measure.\n  Since the tax-related measure was initiated by the Committees on \nFinance and Ways and Means, it should be understood that its inclusion \nin the appropriations bill does not establish a precedent for the \nCommittee on Appropriations to initiate or include tax-related measures \nin future appropriations legislation. Mr. Archer made a similar \nstatement in his letter to the House Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Archer's letter to \nthe House Committee on Appropriations be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    U.S. House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Livingston,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding possible inclusion of \n     the so-called ``BIF-SAIF'' provisions in the upcoming omnibus \n     appropriations bill. Specifically, I understand that the BIF-\n     SAIF package will include the imposition of a special \n     assessment to capitalize the Savings Association Investment \n     Fund (SAIF).\n       As you may know, the Committee on Banking has been in \n     consultation with the Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Administration to determine whether this special assessment \n     would be deductible for tax purposes. Representatives of the \n     Treasury Department have informed us that they believe that \n     the special assessment would be deductible under current law. \n     We share that view.\n       Nonetheless, I have suggested a statutory clarification on \n     this matter for the BIF-SAIF package. This language does not \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code and merely reiterates the \n     understanding shared by this Committee and the Administration \n     on the appropriate tax treatment of the special assessment \n     under current law.\n       Historically, the Committee on Ways and Means has opposed \n     inclusion of tax-related measures in appropriation bills. We \n     have\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\n     also been circumspect in sending to the Senate potential \n     revenue bills which may become vehicles for extraneous \n     legislation. I know that you share my views on these matters.\n       However, in order to expedite consideration of the BIF-SAIF \n     package, I have agreed to the inclusion of this clarifying \n     language in the omnibus appropriations bill. This is being \n     done only with the understanding that the omnibus \n     appropriations bill will be considered as a conference report \n     which will not be subject to further amendment in the Senate, \n     that no additional revenue-related matters will be included \n     in the final conference report, and that the language to be \n     included has been prepared by the staff of the Committee on \n     Ways and Means, which is substantially similar to that \n     included in H.R. 2494, reported by the Committee on Ways and \n     Means earlier this Congress.\n       This is also being done with the understanding that this \n     Committee will be treated without prejudice as to its \n     jurisdictional prerogatives on such or similar provisions in \n     the future, and it should not be considered as precedent for \n     consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means in the future.\n       Finally, I would ask that a copy of this letter be placed \n     in the Record during consideration of the bill on the Floor. \n     Thank you for your cooperation regarding this matter. With \n     warm personal regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bill Archer,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n\n                child pornography prevention act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise with my friend Chairman Hatch to \ncommend the inclusion of the Hatch-Biden child pornography bill in the \nomnibus continuing resolution. This bill will strengthen our ability to \ntrack down and crack down on child pornographers.\n  Those who produce and traffic in child pornography--who exploit the \nmost vulnerable and innocent among us--are, by my lights, among the \nworst of the worst. They cause a harm that is unspeakable and a damage \nthat is often irreparable.\n  Child pornography is not an art form and it is not a type of \nexpression that we must tolerate even though we find it intolerable. To \nthe contrary: We have an obligation--a moral obligation, in my mind--to \nprotect our children from this type of abuse--which steals their \ninnocence and shatters their dreams.\n  I consider myself an unapologetic champion of the first amendment. \nYet I believe that child pornography deserves no, and I mean no, first \namendment protection.\n  Over the years, the computer has become an increasingly powerful \nweapon of the child pornographer and today, technology is making it \neven easier for child pornographers to make and sell their wares.\n  What we're seeing now is this: Pornographers are taking pictures of \nchildren and morphing them, with the help of computer technology, to \nmake it look as if the children are engaging in sexual conduct.\n  That means that it's not necessary, these days, to actually molest \nchildren in order to produce pornography that exploits and degrades \nthem. All that's necessary is an inexpensive computer, some software, \nand a photograph of the little boy or girl down the street.\n  We must move right here and now to put this new generation of child \npornographers behind bars.\n  But we must also be mindful that we live under a constitution which \nincludes a robust Commitment to free and open speech and which \nnecessarily tolerates what is sometimes called the speech we love to \nhate.\n  As a threshold matter, any statute that we write must pass the first \namendment's test. Otherwise, it will sit on our books, unconstitutional \nand unenforceable, doing not one child one bit of good.\n  I am concerned that a provision in this bill which criminalizes the \ndepiction of something that appears to be a minor engaging in sexually \nexplicit conduct will not pass constitutional muster.\n  This proposal would cover purely imaginary drawings, as well as \ndepictions of adults who appear to be minors engaged in sexually \nexplicit conduct, like a documentary that deals with child sexual \nabuse, featuring a 19-year actress who looks like a very young girl.\n  Don't get me wrong: like many Americans, I would like for a lot of \nthe stuff that's out there today, even it it's just a figment of \nsomeone's warped imagination, involving no actual children at all, to \nbe banished from the face of the Earth right now and forever.\n  But I am not king. And it is our Constitution that still reigns \nsupreme and whose first amendment principles will not, in my opinion, \ncountenance this sort of broad and open-ended prohibition.\n  The constitutional analysis begins with the famous 1982 case of New \nYork versus Ferber, in which the Supreme Court first recognized the \nchild pornography exception to the first amendment. In the case, the \nCourt pointed to a number of compelling reasons to justify a total and \noutright ban of this sort of material:\n  It causes psychological and physical harm to children used as \nsubjects;\n  It creates a permanent record of sexual abuse;\n  It fuels the child pornography trade; and\n  Its artistic and social value is limited, to say the least.\n  At the heart of the analysis, and why the Court justified such a \ncategorical and complete restriction on speech, is a very \nstraightforward idea: Children who are used in the production of child \npornography are victims of abuse, plain and simple. And the \npornographers, also plainly and simply, are child abusers.\n  In the cases following Ferber, strict restrictions on child \npornography are predicated on the same rationale: The creation of the \npornography hurts the children who are its subjects.\n  That's why I am concerned that the appears to be standard, which does \nnot in any way involve an actual child in the creation of child \npornography, will not survive the inevitable constitutional challenge \nto this legislation.\n  My view is shared, among others, by Harvard professor Frederick \nSchauer, who was the commissioner of the now famous Meese Commission on \npornography.\n  In testimony before our committee, Professor Schauer expressed the \nopinion that the appears to be standard in the bill would most probably \nfail the Ferber test and would therefore become a failed weapon in our \ncrusade against pornography.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment to Senator Hatch's proposal, \nwhich would make it a crime to create a visual depiction that makes it \nlook like an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit \nconduct, whether or not the child ever actually engaged in the conduct.\n  Here's what this would mean: If a pornographer uses an image, a face \nor other identifying feature of an actual child, and, via computer \nmorphing or any other means, makes it look like the child is engaging \nin sex, that will be a crime.\n  Unlike images that are completely conjured up in someone's \nimagination, or which employ adults who look like children, these kinds \nof images do cause real harm to real children:\n  Although the child may not have actually engaged in the sexual \nconduct, the image creates an apparent record of such conduct. In my \nbook, that's abuse and that's harm, period.\n  These kinds of morphed images can be used to blackmail a child into \nengaging in sexual activity, by intimidating him, or by threatening to \nshow the pictures to others if he doesn't comply.\n  Also, as the experts tell us, child pornography has a very long life \nas it often passes among many, many hands, thus victimizing a child \nwho's in the picture time and again.\n  The definition of identifiable minor in this bill makes it clear that \nproof of the minor's identity is not required for the prosecution to \nmake its case, only that the child is capable of being identified as an \nactual person. It also does not matter whether the person depicted is a \nminor at the time the depiction is created, or whether the depiction is \nmade from a childhood image of a person who is now an adult.\n  I believe that my proposal is consistent with the Ferber standard \nwith its bottom line focus on the well-being of actual children.\n  Do not get me wrong: I am wholly sympathetic and supportive of \nSenator Hatch's view that even imaginary depictions that do not involve \nactual children can, indeed, cause harm. This kind of stuff can be used \nby pedophiles to entice other children into sexual activity.\n  But the point is this: The act of enticement, of course, is itself a \nseparate\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\ncrime and I think we all agree that we should throw the book at anyone \nwho would do such an unthinkable and despicable thing.\n  But the Supreme Court has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to \nthe production of the pornography itself and the constitutional line \nstops with the involvement of real children. And again, it is only a \nconstitutional law, one that will be upheld and enforced, that will \nserve to protect our children.\n  In order to more gracefully bring together my proposal and Senator \nHatch's, this substitute merges our two approaches into one new section \nto be added to the criminal code. And though I have agreed to this \nstylish accommodation of our two ideas, let there be no mistake:\n  We clearly intend that if any portion of the bill's definition of \nchild pornography, such as the ``appears to be'' standard, is struck \ndown as unconstitutional, the remaining provision, the prohibition on \nmaterial involving an identifiable minor, will stand on its own, \ncompletely severable.\n  Our intention here is made crystal clear in the substitute bill's new \nseverability clause.\n  I'd like to say a brief word about another aspect of this bill. It \nincludes a number of penalties, many of which are properly tough and \nsevere. And though I believe that we should give child pornographers no \nquarter, I do not think the creation of new mandatory minimums is smart \nsentencing policy.\n  One of the main problems with mandatory minimums is that they treat \ndifferent types of offenders the same, which means that the really bad \nguys get the same punishment as the less blame worthy. For example, \nunder the proposal added to this bill by Senator Grassley:\n  A person who puts out an ad seeking to buy soft core child \npornography is going to get the same 10-year mandatory minimum sentence \nas the guy who actually employs or entices an 11 year old to make hard \ncore, violent porn. By the same token, that person who advertises to \nbuy child porn will get the same 10-year mandatory minimum as the \nparent who markets his child for child pornography.\n  Make no mistake about it: All these guys should get a tough sentence. \nBut they shouldn't get the same sentence. The same sentence may be too \ntough for the less culpable, and not tough enough for the most \nculpable. That's not smart sentencing policy.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist has noted:\n\n       One of the best arguments against any more mandatory \n     minimums, and perhaps against some of those that we already \n     have, is that they frustrate the careful calibration of \n     sentences, from one end of the spectrum to the other.\n\n  These reservations notwithstanding, I believe that we must get on \nwith the very important business at hand which is to stem the tide of \nthis new generation of child phonography. We have no time to waste, and \nI am pleased that this bill will soon become law.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n\n\n        objecting to the summary exclusion and asylum provisions\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I find myself here again on the Senate floor faced with a \nconference report that contains provisions that the Senate and this \nSenator never had a fair opportunity to consider and that will do grave \ndamage to the United States' place in the world as a refuge for the \noppressed and as a champion of human rights.\n  I say ``again'' because I first came to the Senate on the issue of \nasylum and summary exclusion last April 17 to oppose similar provisions \nin another conference report. I offered a motion to recommit that \nconference report on S. 735 in order to strike those sections added to \nthat bill in the dark of night modifying our asylum processes, \nestablishing summary exclusion and precluding judicial review. I \nobjected then to those sections of that bill that had not been \npreviously considered by the Senate and that had nothing to do with \npreventing terrorism, but were snuck into that conference report to \nalter general immigration law. I failed in that attempt to recommit the \nantiterrorism conference report by a mere 7 votes.\n  I knew from the beginning that my motion to recommit has little \nchance of success because Members were intent on passing an \nantiterrorism bill in connection with the anniversary of the Oklahoma \nCity bombing. Several Senators came up to me and said that they would \nhave an easier time voting with me on the immigration bill and \nencouraged me to fix the problem when the immigration bill was \nconsidered in the Senate.\n  When we considered the Senate immigration bill in May, I continued my \nefforts. With Senators DeWine, Kerry and Hatfield I cosponsored an \namendment to the asylum and summary exclusion provisions of that bill. \nWith the support of a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators \nKennedy, Chafee, Simon, Jeffors and Hatch, we prevailed. On May 1, \n1996, the Senate approved our amendment 51 to 49 and it replaced the \nsummary exclusion provisions that had been in the immigration bill.\n  The bill that the Senate passed last May did not undermine our asylum \nprocesses or require summary exclusion where it was not necessary or \nappropriate. In the only vote by either body on these issues the Senate \nstood with those fleeing oppression and upheld our tradition as a haven \nfor the oppressed and for those seeking religious and political \nfreedom.\n  We have now come full circle. We in the Senate again find ourselves \nconfronted by a time deadline and an unamendable bill. I am aware of \nwhere we are on the legislative calendar and can see other Members \nlooking at their watches as they struggle to conclude this Congress and \nreturn home to campaign for reelection. I suspect that most Members \nhave not even had a chance in the waning days of this Congress to \nexamine the immigration bill conference report, let alone begin to \nexplore what it will mean to those who will be denied refuge from \noppression in other parts of the world under its provisions. There is \nno time, no real opportunity to educate ourselves or focus attention on \nthis important matter. The majority simply rolls it out as part of \n``must-pass'' legislation at the end of the session and it cannot be \nstopped.\n  I know that this legislation will pass and I expect that President \nClinton will sign it--despite concern that these provisions may well \nviolate our treaty obligations and undercut our world leadership on \nthis issue. I recall that last February President Clinton wrote to \nCongressman Berman and noted his concern that ``we not sacrifice our \nproud tradition of refugee protection and support for the principles of \nthe Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.'' The President \nwrote: ``This critically important Treaty, which responded to the \ndisplacement that followed the Second World War, has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support in the Congress. Moreover, our efforts to urge other \ngovernments to comply with its provisions has been a major element of \nour diplomacy on international humanitarian issues.''\n  Specifically on the matter of summary exclusion, the President wrote \nthat he favored ``carefully structured stand-by authority for expedited \nexclusion.'' That is what I would provide, but the approach that the \nconference report rejects.\n  With regard to the overall proposals for summary exclusion that the \nHouse was pressing, the President wrote that they were ``too broad and \nwould also result in considerable diversion of INS resources.'' He \nnoted that: ``These provisions seem particularly unnecessary in view of \nthe successful asylum reforms we have already initiated.'' I agree.\n  I look forward to working with President Clinton when we return next \nJanuary to correct the excesses of this bill and to right the balance \nthat is needed if we are to honor our commitment to our tradition and \nthose in troubled areas of the world who look to America for refuge.\n  We did not have an opportunity to craft sensible summary exclusion \nand asylum provisions and this measure does not bear the Senate's stamp \nof approval. All Democratic conferees were barred from even offering \nmotions or amendments. I was prepared to offer an amendment to correct \nthe excesses of this conference report and to reaffirm the human rights \nof those who look to this great country for refuge, but there is no \nreal opportunity today to urge those changes to this legislation. Just\n\n[[Page S11902]]\n\nas its provisions will result in the summary exclusion of some with \nvalid asylum claims and its truncated procedures will certainly result \nin the United States returning refugees to countries where their lives \nand freedoms are in danger, so, too, the circumstances in which the \nSenate considers this matter have summarily excluded this Senator from \nparticipation in the House-Senate conference on this bill and precluded \nany opportunity for amendment or modification of these provisions.\n  Let me share with you the stories of some of those who have recently \nsucceeded in gaining asylum in this country who would most likely have \nbeen denied our refuge had the bill and its procedures governed.\n  One of the best recent examples of someone who could have lost his \nlife had the bill been the law of the land is now a constituent of mine \nin Vermont. His name is Moses Cirillo. Moses is from the Sudan and is a \nChristian. He had served as a translator for Christian missionaries, \ndistributed Catholic literature and worked with aid groups in the \nsouthern part of Sudan. Those are the activities that placed him and \nhis family in danger. He escaped to Ethiopia and then to the United \nStates on a false passport. He lost his wife and son and brother before \nfleeing.\n  When he got to this country, this land of freedom and opportunity, \nMoses Cirillo could not get the INS or an immigration judge to believe \nhim or understand the circumstances that brought him here. Fortunately \nfor Moses, the Vermont Refugee Assistance came to his aid and pursued \nhis cause. This summer, after 3 years in detention, Moses Cirillo was \ngranted asylum. The INS agents at the border and an immigration judge \nhad ruled against him. It was only when his case was reviewed by the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals that he finally prevailed. Had we not had \nthe procedural safeguards that will be eliminated by this conference \nreport, there can be little question that Moses Cirillo would not be \nfree and living in Vermont today.\n  Just a few days ago the Senate passed Senate Concurrent Resolution \n71, a ressolution condemning human rights abuses and denials of \nreligious liberty to Christians around the world. In that resolution we \nrecognized that religious minorities continue to be oppressed and \npersecuted around the world. We termed religious persecution ``an \naffront to the international moral community and to all people of \nconscience.'' We commented on persecution of Christians in such \ncountries as Sudan--like Moses Cirillo--in Cuba, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, \nChina, Pakistan, North Korea, Egypt, Laos, Vietnam, and countries that \nwere formerly part of the Soviet Union. We termed religious liberty a \nuniversal right.\n  We noted ``the United States of America since its founding has been a \nharbor of refuge and freedom to worship for believers from John \nWinthrop to Roger Williams to William Penn, and a haven for the \noppressed.'' We referred to Pope John Paul II's call against regimes \nthat ``practice discrimination against Jews, Christians, and other \nreligious groups.'' We proclaimed our ``commitment to human rights \naround the world'' and our international leadership on behalf of \npersecuted religious minorities.''\n  We concluded less than 2 weeks ago, on September 17, that the Senate \nunequivocally condemns egregious human rights abuses and denials of \nreligious liberty to Christians around the world and recognized Sunday, \nSeptember 29, as a day of prayer recognizing the plight of persecuted \nChristians worldwide.\n  It makes little sense merely to condemn religious persecution if we \nturn around and enact procedures that will shut out the oppressed and \nsummarily exclude refugees from religious persecution. It rings hollow \nto recall our history of freedom of religion and our station as a haven \nfor the oppressed when we are poised and prepared to abandon that proud \ntradition.\n  While the Senate of the United States finds it easy to condemn \nreligious persecution in Sudan, INS agents and an immigration judge \ninitially denied Moses Cirillo asylum claim. It was only the \nextraordinary efforts of human rights advocates in Vermont and their \npersistent pursuit of justice through the procedural safeguards in our \nasylum process that allowed him to prevail. If this bill had been the \nlaw, those protections would not have been available. I will continue \nto work to ensure that before too long we will choose to act consistent \nwith the recognition that religious persecution still plagues so much \nof the world.\n  Another recent case is that of Fauziya Kasinga. I first brought this \nyoung woman's case to the attention of the Senate back in April. Two \ndays before, a reporter named Celia Dugger had told Ms. Kasinga's story \non the front page of The New York Times. She had sought for 2 years to \nfind sanctuary in the country only to be detained, tear-gassed, beaten, \nisolated and abused.\n  She, too, came to the United States with false documents. In her case \nshe obtained a false British passport in order to escape mutilation in \nTogo and traveled from Germany to New York. On June 13, the Board of \nImmigration Appeals granted her application for asylum from female \ngenital mutilation in Togo. After 2 years in detention, in a case that \nwas initially opposed by INS and rejected by an immigration judge, she \nfinally was freed and granted asylum.\n  Her case established new law. For when the INS was called upon to \nfile a brief with the Board of Immigration Appeals it took the position \nfor the first time that fear of female genital mutilation should \npresent a sufficient cause to seek asylum in the United States. Hers \nwas a precedent setting case. Does anyone doubt that she would have \nbeen returned to Togo if the summary exclusion provision of the bill \nhad been the law? Does anyone honestly think that the immigration \nagents with whom she came in contact at the border or the immigration \njudge who denied her claim would have established such a precedent as a \ncase of first impression and rescued her?\n  It is ironic that in this immigration bill we require that aliens \nfrom certain countries be advised prior to or at entry into the United \nStates of the severe harm caused by female genital mutilation and we \ncreate a criminal statute against female genital mutilation on children \nin the United States. Unfortunately, neither of those measures will \nhelp the young women who are being subjected to this practice in other \nparts of the world.\n  In addition, this bill would amend our statutory definition of \nrefugee to include persons forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo \ninvoluntary sterilization or who are persecuted for refusing such \nprocedures. It will do no good to amend these definitions if we do not \nhave fair procedures and a real opportunity for refugees to establish \nthe circumstances from which they flee to America. Summary exclusion is \nwholly incompatible with these expansions of the grounds for asylum.\n  I am glad to see that the bill excludes Cuban refugees from the harsh \nprovisions of the new exclusionary asylum procedures. I believe that \nthis exception should be the rule. Indeed, this exception shows that \nthe majority does not trust the procedures that they are imposing on \nrefugees from all other countries in the world.\n  Let us examine briefly the Cuban exception and how it might or might \nnot apply. First, we should notice that it only applies to those who \nare wealthy enough, lucky enough, or skilled enough to arrive by \naircraft at a port of entry. Thus, not all who escape from Cuba would \nbe covered by this narrowly drafted special exception.\n  Further, let us consider how the exception might or might not work in \na real-life situation. Not so long ago Fidel Castro's own daughter came \nto the United States using a disguise and a phony Spanish passport to \nseek asylum. Under the provisions of the bill, she might well have been \nturned away at the border after a summary interview if the INS agent \nwho confronted her did not believe that she was Cuban or Castro's \ndaughter. Would that INS officer or the immigration judge reviewing the \nsummary decision within 24 hours think that this disguised person with \nfalse documentation had established a ``significant possibility'' that \nshe was Castro's daughter? Think about what would most likely have \nhappened.\n  Next, I ask you to consider the case of Alan Baban. Mr. Baban is one \nof the many Kurds who was jailed and tortured in Iraq. He succeeded in \nbribing a\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\njailor and escaping. He went into hiding for 3 years and ultimately \nescaped to this country without documents.\n  In spite of the notorious persecution of Kurds by the Iraqis and the \nscarring Mr. Baban carries with him for life, the INS agents who \nconfronted Mr. Baban at the airport did not believe him and determined \nthat he did not have a credible claim of persecution. Having come to \nthe United States for freedom from oppression, Mr. Baban was \nimprisoned, again--this time by U.S. authorities.\n  A year later he was denied political asylum when the interpreter he \nwas assigned at a hearing did not speak or understand his Kurdish \ndialect. As a result, the immigration judge before whom he appeared did \nnot believe that Mr. Baban was Kurdish.\n  It took 16 months in detention before Alan Baban was finally granted \nasylum on appeal. That appeal will be eliminated by the procedures \nmandated by the bill.\n  Consider the case of Ana X. whom I met last April when she came \nforward to share her story. Two-years ago she fled Peru. She had been \nhorribly treated and threatened by rebel guerillas from the Shining \nPath there. She came to this country without proper documents and \ngained asylum only after a full and fair opportunity to convince an \nimmigration judge at a hearing that she would suffer persecution if she \nwas returned to Peru.\n  When she tried to share her history with us earlier this year, she \ncould not finish her second sentence before she broke down in tears, \noverwhelmed by the memories of what she had suffered. I cannot imagine \nthis victim of oppression being able to talk about her suffering to a \nstrange authority figure immediately upon her arrival in the United \nStates. Fortunately, she had a chance to obtain the help of volunteers \nand was able to present her case to an immigration judge at a hearing.\n  Finally, consider the case of Nikolai S. from a former Soviet \nrepublic and a social scientist. He had been beaten by government \nagents because he is Jewish. He came to the United States in 1994 to \nconduct research and he found it hard to bring himself even to apply \nfor asylum. Once he felt that he was ready and had assembled supporting \nevidence of the dangerousness of anti-Semitism in his homeland, he \napplied. Had the arbitrary 1-year filing deadline of the bill been in \nplace, his application would have been rejected as too late.\n  Human rights organizations like the Lawyers Committee have documented \na number of cases of people who were ultimately granted political \nasylum by immigration judges after the INS denied their release from \ndetention for not meeting a ``credible fear'' standard and numerous \ninstances where it took an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n  I note the efforts of the Representative of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees, who has been supportive of our efforts to \nhave credible fear judged by the accepted international standard.\n  I have heard from many House Members, Republicans and Democrats, who \nfeel very strongly about these provisions. Some have sent Dear \nColleague letters urging that others join us ``in protecting human \nrights around the world.''\n  In particular, I have heard from Representatives Christopher Smith, \nTom Lantos, Ben Gilman, Rick Boucher, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Matthew \nMartinez, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, George Miller, David McIntosh, Henry \nWaxman, Steve Chabot, Eni Faleomavaega, Thomas Davis, Robert \nTorricelli, Mark Souder, Ed Pastor, Jon Fox, Cynthia McKinney, Matt \nSalmon, Eliot Engel, Robert Menendez, and our former colleague Ham \nFish.\n  I also remain deeply concerned that the bill would deny the Federal \ncourts their historic role in overseeing the implementation of our \nimmigration laws and review of individual administrative decisions. \nThis bill will not allow judicial review whether a person was actually \nexcludable and will create unjustified exceptions to rulemaking \nprocedural protections under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  This bill signals a fundamental change in the roles of our coordinate \nbranches of Government and a dangerous precedent. Judicial review has \noften been a source of accountability for the executive branch. The \nbill eliminates that oversight and weakens protection that serves to \nmake sure that the Executive is following the law. Over 90 law \nprofessors had written to us on this point on July 29. Their wise \ncounsel is being ignored at our peril.\n  The summary exclusion and asylum provisions of the bill remain among \nits most extreme and unnecessarily harsh provisions. At the eleventh \nhour, after the House approved the conference report, there have been \nattempts to meet to create a better bill, but those truncated talks \nhave done nothing to improve the asylum and summary exclusion \nprovisions on which the congressional Republicans remain insistent.\n  Let me briefly outline adjustments that could have been made to \npreserve our asylum system while continuing to reform our processes as \nneeded. The bill takes several giant steps backward from the bipartisan \nSenate effort in May to preserve our asylum process. We were successful \nin the only vote taken on the matter of summary exclusion and asylum in \neither House. I feel strongly that the Leahy-DeWine approach is a much \nmore fair and balanced approach than that taken in the bill. We are now \nbeing forced to consider a bill that would have the effect of summarily \nexcluding refugees from around the world who seek to come to America \nfor freedom from oppression.\n  Within the past 2 weeks the Washington Times, the New York Times and \nthe Washington Post have each published strong editorials condemning \nthe asylum provisions of the Republican conference report. The \nWashington Times concluded: ``As lawmakers weigh these issues, they \nought to keep in mind the following question: How would I feel about \nthese rules if it were I who was applying for asylum?\"\n  In the interest of bipartisan compromise I was prepared to offer a \nmotion and an amendment to preserve the essence of our asylum system \nwhile adding additional requirements for expedited consideration of \nclaims for asylum. It is that motion and amendment that Chairman Smith \nof the House and Chairman Hatch of the Senate ruled out of order at the \nmeeting of House and Senate conferees on September 17.\n  The Leahy amendment would allow summary exclusion procedures if they \nare needed in an extraordinary migration situation, as designated by \nthe Attorney General, rather than require their use at all times. This \nis what the administration requested, in contrast to the universal use \nof summary exclusion that the extremist measures in the bill will \nrequire. The Department of Justice has indicated that, except for a \nfuture migration emergency, they can handle asylum claims without \nresort to summary exclusion and the amendment, like the Senate \nimmigration bill, would have provided such standby authority.\n  The Leahy amendment would incorporate an international recognized \nstandard for screening asylum claims rather than forcing refugees back \ninto the hands of their oppressors. It would require asylum seekers to \nshow that their claims were not manifestly unfounded in order to \nreceive a full hearing and examination of their circumstances. That is \nthe standard that the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees and \nthe international community strongly favors and the standard consistent \nwithout treaty commitments.\n  The Leahy amendment would preserve limited and narrow habeas corpus \nreview to provide an opportunity to correct erroneous administrative \naction, which may in many cases by a matter of life or death. The bill \nseeks to choke off judicial review at every turn. We do not need less \naccountable government action and unfettered discretion being exercised \nby overburdened immigration agents to the detriment of refugees fleeing \noppression. The New York Times wrote that this is one of the principal \nreasons it believes this ``a dangerous immigration bill.'' It observed \nthat Republicans as well as Democrats ought to be alarmed by the \nprospect of unrestricted executive power without judicial review and \naccountability.\n  The Leahy amendment would treat refugees more fairly during the \ninitial interview and tried to eliminate artificial barriers to screen \nout what may be valid asylum claims. By acting summarily before the \nrefugee has a sense that it is okay to speak of the persecution and \nfear from which he or she is\n\n[[Page S11904]]\n\nseeking refuge, the bill will screen out the unwary, the unschooled, \nand the uncertain who will be reluctant to talk about the persecution \nthat compelled them to seek refuge and freedom in America.\n  The Leahy amendment would only impose a limitations period on asylum \nclaims that are raised for the first time defensively to ward off \ndeportation rather than impose an arbitrary 1-year limit on all asylum \nclaims. If the use of asylum claims defensively to ward off deportation \nis the problem, let us deal with that problem and not penalize refugees \nwith valid asylum claims who were too traumatized or fearful to come \nforward until they had gotten settled in this new land.\n  We need not gut our asylum law by allowing low-level bureaucrats to \nmake life-and-death decisions through summary exclusion at the border. \nOur country has a proud tradition of protecting victims of persecution \nand serving as a beacon of hope and freedom. We need not and should not \nforsake it. This compromise Leahy amendment would give real refugees a \nfair opportunity to present their circumstances and seek asylum.\n  We do not have to turn our backs on America's traditional role as a \nrefuge from oppression and resort to summary exclusion processes that \nthe Washington Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times agreed \nare unwise and unnecessary.\n  I was pleased last week to appear with Bishop Murry from the National \nConference of Catholic Bishops and Martin Kraar of the Council of \nJewish Federations. They along with the American Bar Association and \nmany others appreciate what this rewrite of our asylum laws by the bill \nwould mean.\n  I want to recognize all those who have come forward to work with us \nto try to preserve the asylum process. Support has come from a wide \nvariety of sources: The Committee to Preserve Asylum, UNITE, the \nAmerican Jewish Committee, the National Asian Pacific American Legal \nConsortium, the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, the U.S. Catholic \nConference, the American Bar Association, the American Friends Service \nCommittee, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Asian Law \nCaucus, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the Lutheran Immigration and \nRefugee Service, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nthe Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal \nChurch, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the \nUnited Church Board for World Ministries, the ACLU, the National Asian \nPacific American Legal Consortium, Amnesty International USA and the \nWomen's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. I look forward to \ncontinuing our efforts and ultimately prevailing on these fundamental \nissues.\n  The bill fails to take into account the unfortunate but all too real \ncircumstances that exist in repressive regimes around the world. \nRefugees flee by all sorts of means, including using false documents \nand escaping through third countries en route to the United States. The \nbill would punish asylum seekers who are afraid to apply to their \ngovernment for proper travel documents and identification papers.\n  Raoul Wallenberg received international recognition for rescuing tens \nof thousands from Nazi persecution by issuing Swedish identity papers \nand arranging transport to Sweden. Oskar Schindler saved many lives by \nsecuring false documents and identities. As many as 10,000 Jews fled \nthe Holocaust through Asia with the noble assistance of Chiune \nSugihara, a Japanese diplomat who disobeyed his government and issued \nthem visas. Do we really mean to disadvantage the claims of those who, \nlike the beneficiaries of the courageous work of Oskar Schindler, Raoul \nWallenberg and Chiune Sugihara during World War II, needed false travel \ndocuments? I hope not.\n  I am confident that consideration of asylum claims can take false \ndocuments into account without making them a barrier to full review. \nThe asylum provisions in the bill would place undue burdens on \nunsophisticated refugees who are truly in need of sanctuary but may not \nbe able to explain their situation to an overworked asylum officer. Had \nsimilar provisions been in place during World War II, those saved by \nRaoul Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler and Chiune Sugihara could have been \nsummarily excluded because they used false documents to escape the \nHolocaust.\n  Refugees seeking asylum in the United States come to us for \nprotection. Let us not turn them back. Let us not abandon America's \nvital place in the world as a leader for human rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my statement there be printed \nin the Record letters from the UNHRC Lawyers Committee for Human Rights \nand law professors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Branch \n           Office for the United States of America,\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 1996.\n     Re Asylum and summary exclusion provisions of the immigration \n         bill (proposed conference report H2202).\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman Hatch: I am writing to you regarding the \n     draft Conference Report referenced above. In our previous \n     letter to you, we expressed our concerns regarding the \n     summary exclusion provisions of the prior House bill. \n     Although the Senate version included Senator Leahy's \n     amendment revising the Senate summary exclusion provision to \n     comport with international standards for adjudicating refugee \n     claims, we note that the proposed Conference Report does not \n     include these changes. Our Office continues to urge the \n     adoption of the Senate version of summary exclusion and \n     remains concerned that the proposed ``expedited removal'' \n     provisions in the proposed Conference Report and several \n     other provisions, if enacted, would almost certainly result \n     in the US returning refugees to countries where their lives \n     or freedom would be threatened.\n       The following provisions of the proposed Conference Report, \n     outlined in greater detail below, are of particular concern \n     to our Office:\n       1. Expedited Removal (Section 302); (a) Examination at Port \n     of Entry; (b) ``Credible Fear'' Standard; (c) Detention; (d) \n     Administrative Review; and (e) Access to Counsel.\n       2. Numerical Limitation on Asylum Grants (Section 601).\n       3. Exceptions to Ability to Apply for Asylum (Section 604): \n     (a) Asylum Filing Deadlines; and (b) Safe Third Country.\n       4. Bars to Asylum and Withholding of Deportation for \n     Persons Convicted of Aggravated Felonies (Section 241(b) and \n     604).\n       5. Asylum Filing and Employment Authorization Fees (Section \n     604).\n       6. No Automatic Stay of Deportation pending Judicial Review \n     (Section 306).\n       1. Expedited Removal (Section 302)--This section allows the \n     expedited removal, without further hearing or review, of \n     certain ``applicants for admission.'' An ``applicant for \n     admission'' is defined as anyone in the US who entered \n     illegally or a person seeking entry. Section 302(b) would \n     permit an immigration officer to issue a final order of \n     removal for such applicants, if s/he determines that such \n     applicants have false documents or no documents, if; (1) They \n     cannot prove they have been in the US for the prior two-year \n     period of (2) they are arriving in the US and fail to \n     indicate an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of \n     persecution.\n       At a port of entry, those who indicate that they are \n     asylum-seekers but who are unable to establish a ``credible \n     fear'' of persecution to an asylum officer shall be similarly \n     removed. ``Credible fear'' of persecution is defined to mean \n     that ``there is a significant possibility, taking into \n     account the credibility of the statements made by the alien \n     in support of the alien's claim and such other facts as are \n     known to the officer, that the alien could establish \n     eligibility for asylum.'' Review of the credible fear \n     determination will be conducted by an immigration judge and \n     is to be concluded if possible within 24 hours and no later \n     than 7 days after the removal order. Prior to the credible \n     fear interview, asylum-seekers may consult a person or \n     persons of their choice, but any consultation must be at no \n     expense to the Government and must not ``unreasonably delay \n     the proceedings.''\n       UNHCR is concerned that this process fails to incorporate \n     international standards for refugee status determination. We \n     stress that the summary nature of the proceedings in the \n     proposed Conference Report is reflected in the lack of \n     appellate rights, and that, therefore, it is all the more \n     important that the initial examination and interview process \n     not be ``summary.'' We note our concerns below:\n       a. Examination at Port of Entry--``Screening'' of arrivals \n     in the US must be conducted with procedural safeguards in \n     place to ensure that refugees are not excluded. Section 302 \n     fails to provide these safeguards. Special risks for refugees \n     are inherent in the expedited process as proposed by this \n     section, in which there is no review of an order to exclude. \n     All persons seeking entry must be given guidance as to the \n     procedure, orally and in writing, in a language they can \n     understand, before an initial examination so that they are \n     aware of the consequences of failing to come forward with \n     their asylum claim at that time. Although this section \n     provides\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\n     that information shall be given concerning an asylum \n     interview, it fails to provide for guidance at this critical \n     point. Given the dual role of the immigration officers \n     conducting the initial examinations (border enforcement and \n     selection of those who merit a credible fear determination), \n     they should have a list of questions designed to identify \n     asylum-seekers, as well as training in interviewing skills. \n     There must be meaningful review of all ``expedited removal'' \n     orders, given the consequences of a mistaken decision.\n       b. ``Credible Fear'' Standard--UNHCR urges you and members \n     of the Committee to reject any provision that requires \n     asylum-seekers, before they are allowed the opportunity to \n     present their claims for asylum to an immigration judge, to \n     establish a ``credible fear'' of persecution, as defined \n     above. Such a requirement creates a new, heightened standard \n     which increases the likelihood that a refugee will be \n     returned to a country where his/her life or freedom would be \n     threatened, especially given the fact that review is \n     expedited, applicants are detained during this process, and \n     there is limited access to legal representation. UNHCR \n     recommends that asylum-seekers who establish that their \n     claims are not ``manifestly unfounded'' be accorded the \n     opportunity to present their asylum claims in a hearing \n     before an immigration judge. This provision comports with the \n     international standard for expeditious refugee status \n     determinations as set forth in UNHCR Executive Committee \n     Conclusion No. 30 (1983).\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     *Footnotes to appear at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Moreover, certain types of claimants, e.g., torture or \n     trauma victims and those with gender-related claims, will \n     have difficulty stating their claims, much less establishing \n     ``credible fear.'' Some at-risk groups, such as unaccompanied \n     minors, should not be subjected to summary procedures at all. \n     Others, with novel or complex claims, such as persons fleeing \n     situations of international or internal armed conflict, or \n     torture survivors who should be protected by the Convention \n     against Torture, should be provided with a full exclusion \n     hearing. These claimants are at great risk of being returned \n     to persecution if they must meet the heightened standard \n     created by the expedited removal provisions.\n       c. Detention--This provision also mandates that an \n     applicant who has been determined to have a credible fear of \n     persecution remain in detention for further consideration of \n     the application for asylum. In the view of the hardship that \n     it involves, as noted in UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion \n     No. 44, detention should normally be avoided, particularly \n     when the elements on which the asylum claim is based have \n     been determined. Asylum-seekers who have met this heightened \n     standard should be released pending further consideration of \n     their claims.\n       d. Administrative Review--In the proposed Conference \n     Report, the provision for review of a negative ``credible \n     fear'' determination and expedited removal order requires \n     that the immigration judge conduct the review ``as \n     expeditiously as possible,'' and recommends it be concluded \n     within 24 hours. Moreover, this review may be conducted \n     telephonically or by video, inadequate methods when \n     credibility is at issue. Minimum procedural guidelines for \n     refugee status determinations, as set forth in UNHCR \n     Executive Committee Conclusion No. 8 (1977) specify that an \n     applicant should be given a reasonable time to appeal for a \n     formal reconsideration of the decision. These procedures do \n     not comport with the guidelines noted above.\n       e. Access to Counsel--The Proposed Conference Report \n     permits an asylum-seeker to consult with a person of his or \n     her choosing, at no cost to the Government and as long as \n     such consultation does not ``unreasonably'' delay the \n     proceedings. These limitations to consultation in the context \n     of an expedited removal process should be consistent with \n     guidelines that asylum-seekers be given the necessary \n     facilities for submitting their claims to the authorities, \n     including meaningful access to counsel and to the services of \n     a competent interpreter and the opportunity to contact a \n     representative of UNHCR. These factors, set forth in UNHCR \n     Executive Committee Conclusion No. 8 (1977), should be taken \n     into consideration in assessing whether a delay is \n     ``unreasonable.''\n       2. Numerical Limitation on Asylum Grants (Section 601)--\n     This section, which expands the definition of refugee to \n     include persons who have been subjected to or who have a \n     well-founded fear of coercive population control methods, \n     limits to 1000 per year the number of individuals who may be \n     admitted to the US as refugees or granted asylum under this \n     expanded definition. By placing a numerical limitation on \n     this category of asylum-seekers, the Attorney General may \n     return an individual to a country where his or her life or \n     freedom would be threatened merely because the numerical \n     limit has been reached. Such an action would place the US in \n     violation of its obligations under the 1967 Protocol.\n       3. Exceptions to Ability to Apply for Asylum (Section \n     604)--This section creates certain bars to the application \n     for asylum. Moreover, there is no judicial review of a \n     decision to bar an application under the following \n     provisions.\n       a. Asylum Filing Deadlines--A time limit for filing an \n     application has been included, which, if not met, bars \n     individuals from seeking asylum. Individuals may not apply \n     unless they demonstrate by clear an convincing evidence that \n     the application has been filed within one year after the date \n     of the person's arrival in the US, unless they demonstrate to \n     the satisfaction of the Attorney General either (a) the \n     existence of changed country conditions which materially \n     affect the person's eligibility for asylum or (b) \n     extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing \n     within one year.\n       UNHCR recommends that these deadlines be deleted. Failure \n     to submit an asylum request within a certain time limit \n     should not lead to an asylum request being excluded from \n     consideration, as outlined in UNHCR Executive Committee \n     Conclusion No. 15 (1979). The United States is obliged to \n     protect refugees from return to danger regardless of whether \n     a filing deadline has been met. There are a number of \n     legitimate reasons why asylum-seekers would not be aware of \n     or able to comply with a deadline for submitting \n     applications, such as lack of information about the asylum \n     process, preoccupation with meeting basic survival needs, \n     inability to communicate in English, and insufficient \n     resources for obtaining counsel.\n       b. Safe Third Country--Individuals may not apply for asylum \n     or may have their asylee status terminated if the Attorney \n     General determines that they may be removed, pursuant to a \n     bilateral or multilateral agreement, to a country (other than \n     their country of nationality (or last habitual residence if \n     no nationality)) in which their lives or freedom would not be \n     threatened on account of one of the five grounds and where \n     they would have access to a full and fair procedure for \n     determining a claim to asylum or equivalent temporary \n     protection, unless the Attorney General finds that it is \n     in the public interest for the person to receive asylum in \n     the U.S. UNHCR recommends that these provisions be deleted \n     or modified in light of international guidelines, the \n     wider context of global responsibilities for refugee \n     protection, and principles of international \n     responsibility-sharing. Moreover, these provisions appear \n     to authorize the denial of the right to apply for asylum \n     to certain nationalities or groups. These provisions also \n     authorize the sending of an asylum-seeker or asylee to a \n     country in which she might suffer forms of persecution not \n     rising to the level of a threat to life or freedom. While \n     no universally accepted definition of ``persecution'' has \n     been adopted by the international community, it is widely \n     accepted that other serious violations of human rights, in \n     addition to threats to life or freedom, constitute \n     persecution when linked to race, religion, nationality, \n     membership of a particular social group or political \n     opinion. Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for \n     Determining Refugee Status (Geneva 1988) (hereinafter \n     Handbook) at para. 51.\n       4. Asylum and Withholding of Deportation for Persons \n     Convicted of Aggravated Felonies (Sections 241(b), 604)--\n     Section 241(b) bars the removal of refugees to countries \n     where their lives or freedom would be threatened and codifies \n     the exceptions to this bar, most of which are exceptions \n     currently found in INS regulations. This section codifies the \n     provision that refugees who have been convicted of an \n     ``aggravated felony (or felonies)'' for which the sentence to \n     imprisonment is at least five years shall be considered to \n     have committed a particularly serious crime and will not be \n     protected from removal.\n       Section 604 broadens the definition of ``aggravated \n     felony'' to include a much greater number of crimes than \n     previously were in this category. It would include, for \n     example, certain crimes for which a term of imprisonment \n     imposed is one year (previously this was five years). It also \n     codifies current regulations that bar a grant of asylum to \n     individuals who have been convicted of a particularly serious \n     crime and provide that a conviction of an aggravated felony \n     shall be considered to be a conviction of a particularly \n     serious crime. This section also allows the Attorney General \n     to designate by regulation offenses that will be considered \n     to be particularly serious crimes or serious non-political \n     crimes, permitting further expansion of the categories of \n     crimes that would bar a grant of asylum.\n       These sections, therefore, bar individuals from the \n     protection of non-refoulement\\2\\ if they have been convicted \n     of an ``aggravated felony'' for which the sentence imposed is \n     at least five years, and bar individuals with a well-founded \n     fear of persecution from the protection of asylum regardless \n     of the sentence imposed. Article 33 of the 1951 Convention \n     relating to the Status of Refugees, binding on the US through \n     its incorporation into the 1967 Protocol, requires that \n     before returning a person fearing a threat to life or freedom \n     in his or her country of origin, the country concerned must \n     make a case-by-case determination whether the person has been \n     convicted of a particularly serious crime and constitutes a \n     danger to the community.\n       Under current law, the recently enacted Antiterrorism and \n     Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), the Attorney General, in \n     her discretion, may grant withholding of deportation to \n     ensure compliance with the 1967 Protocol. It appears that \n     this provision may no longer be in effect if the proposed \n     Conference Report becomes law. It is our opinion that the \n     waiver in AEDPA should still be available and that it permits \n     the Attorney General to conduct case-by-case determinations \n     in the cases of individuals who have been convicted of an \n     ``aggravated felony'' to determine whether the crime is a \n     particularly serious crime and whether the individual is The \n     ``particularly serious crime'' exclusion ground should only \n     be invoked in\n\n[[Page S11906]]\n\n     ``extreme cases'' and only after a balancing test has been \n     applied, weighing the degree of persecution feared against \n     the seriousness of the offense committed. These principles \n     are set forth in our Handbook at paras. 154 and 156. The need \n     for a balancing test is even more urgent in light of the \n     proposed provisions expanding the definition of ``aggravated \n     felony'' to include many crimes for which the sentence \n     imposed is one year, and giving the Attorney General the \n     power to designate other offenses as ``aggravated felonies.''\n       5. Asylum Filing and Employment Authorization Fees (Section \n     604)--This section permits the Attorney General to impose a \n     fee for applications for asylum and employment authorization. \n     UNHCR is concerned that any fee imposed for filing an asylum \n     application may have the unintended effect of discouraging \n     refugees from realizing their fundamental right to seek and \n     enjoy asylum. UNHCR's Executive Committee in Conclusion No. 5 \n     (1977) ``appealed to Governments to follow, or to continue to \n     follow, liberal practices in granting permanent or at least \n     temporary asylum to refugee. . .'' UNHCR is particularly \n     concerned about the precedent that the imposition of a fee \n     will set for the international community.\n       Likewise, UNHCR is concerned about the imposition of a fee \n     for employment authorization, UNHCR Executive Committee \n     Conclusion No. 22 (1981) states that asylum-seekers ``should \n     receive all necessary assistance and be provided with the \n     basic necessities of life, including food, shelter, and basic \n     sanitary and health facilities.'' Under current law, asylum-\n     seekers are not eligible for employment authorization unless \n     their claim has been pending for over 180 days. UNHCR urges \n     that a fee not be imposed, especially in light of the fact \n     that asylum-seekers are not eligible for benefits which \n     satisfy the basic necessities of life.\n       6. Stay of Deportation Pending Judicial Review (Section \n     306)--This section eliminates the automatic stay of \n     deportation to individuals, including asylum seekers, who \n     have been issued an order of removal by an immigration judge \n     and appeal this decision to a federal appeals court. UNHCR \n     urges the US to preserve the automatic stay of deportation \n     for asylum-seekers in order to ensure compliance with minimum \n     procedural safeguards. UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion \n     No. 8(1977) provides that asylum applicants ``should . . . be \n     permitted to remain in the country while an appeal. . .to the \n     courts is pending.\n       Your consideration of UNHCR's views is greatly appreciated. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may provide \n     additional information or assistance to you, your Committee \n     members or other members of Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Anne Willem Bijleveld,\n                                                   Representative.\n\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The UNHCR Executive Committee is a group of \n     representatives from 50 countries, including the United \n     States, that provides policy and guidance to UNHCR in the \n     exercise of its refugee protection mandate.\n     \\2\\ The principle of non-refoulement, incorporated into U.S. \n     law in the withholding of deportation statute, Section 243(h) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act, is set forth in \n     Article 33(1) of the Convention, as follows: ``No Contracting \n     State shall expel or return (`refouler') a refugee in any \n     manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his \n     life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, \n     religion, nationality, membership of a particular social \n     group or political opinion.'' Article 33(1) of the \n     Convention.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Lawyers Committee\n\n\n                                             for Human Rights,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to urge you to vote against \n     H.R. 2202, the pending immigration bill, which we understand \n     will soon come before you for a vote. The bill is \n     fundamentally flawed in that it seeks to restrict the rights \n     of refugees in the context of efforts designed to control \n     illegal immigration. H.R. 2202 contains extreme measures that \n     will severely impair the internationally-recognized right of \n     refugees to seek and enjoy asylum. If the bill is passed, it \n     will transform U.S. law from a system designed to protect \n     victims of persecution to a system designed to punish them.\n       H.R. 2202 contains numerous provisions that would threaten \n     the lives of refugees. Some of these provisions were examined \n     and rejected by the Senate; others were never even \n     considered. In particular, H.R. 2202 would: 1) summarily \n     exclude, without meaningful access to counsel or review, \n     asylum-seekers who arrive in the United States without proper \n     travel documents; and 2) apply a strict deadline on the \n     filing of all asylum applications. In our extensive \n     experience representing asylum-seekers, we have seen first \n     hand the many barriers--language, fear for family members, \n     post-traumatic stress disorder--a refugee must overcome in \n     order to apply for and gain safe haven. Blanket summary \n     exclusion and strict time deadlines for filing asylum \n     applications are hurdles that many of the most deserving \n     refugees simply will not be able to cross. Enacting H.R. 2202 \n     will, without question, result in victims of torture, rape \n     and other extreme forms of persecution being denied \n     protection. This violates not only our international treaty \n     obligations, but our commitment as a nation to protect the \n     rights of the persecuted. We urge you to do all you can to \n     prevent it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Elisa Massimino.\n     Michael Posner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I, like many Americans, am deeply \n     concerned about the proposed restrictions on political asylum \n     contained in the immigration bill now before Congress. Of \n     particular concern to me are two provisions: a filing \n     deadline on asylum applications and summary exclusion \n     procedures.\n       As a member of the Board of Directors of the Lawyers \n     Committee for Human Rights, I have had the unique opportunity \n     to meet and speak with clients of the Committee's pro bono \n     Asylum Representation Program. Asylum seekers are people who \n     must flee from danger in their homelands to safer, more \n     politically stable countries. They are men, women and \n     children, doctors, journalists, students and others from all \n     walks of life who are persecuted in their homelands for \n     religious or political beliefs, ethnicity or race. Some flee \n     to Europe, South America, or Asia; others to the United \n     States. The right of a refugee to seek protection from \n     persecution was incorporated into U.S. law in the Refugee Act \n     of 1980 and is guaranteed under the U.N. Convention Relating \n     to the Status of Refugees. Last year, the U.S. granted asylum \n     to fewer than 8,000 individuals, representing less than one \n     percent of asylum seekers worldwide.\n       In the following pages, you will hear the personal stories \n     of six asylum seekers and you will see how the proposed \n     restrictions would have irrevocably and tragically changed \n     the course of their lives. These asylees came to the Lawyers \n     Committee, where they were represented before the INS by \n     volunteer attorneys. The staff and volunteers of the \n     Committee know the obstacles asylum seekers face--the trauma \n     experienced by torture victims, the concern for the safety of \n     family members back home, the disorientation of a new culture \n     and a new language. The Committee also has analyzed hundreds \n     of asylum cases to study the potential effects of the \n     proposed restrictions. Both their findings and experience \n     clearly show that, if enacted, a strict filing deadline and \n     summary exclusion procedures will force genuine refugees back \n     to their homelands to face persecution, torture and perhaps \n     death.\n       The United States has long been a symbol of freedom, \n     opportunity and hope for refugees fleeing Nazi Germany, war-\n     torn Rwanda, and other ravaged states. Let us defend this \n     legacy and preserve a refugee's right to seek protection and \n     safety. The proposed restrictions would not only violate our \n     international treaty obligations but would betray our \n     nation's commitment to respect basic human rights.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sigourney Weaver.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    July 29, 1996.\n       Dear Conferee: We, the undersigned professors of law, are \n     writing to express our concerns about provisions in the \n     pending immigration legislation that would eliminate or \n     severely curtail judicial review. Efficiency in the \n     enforcement of our nation's laws is important, but this goal \n     is not well served by enacting legislation that has \n     potentially serious constitutional problems.\n       Proposals are now pending in Congress that would radically \n     reduce and, in some cases, eliminate the most fundamental \n     safeguard of judicial review in individual cases and judicial \n     oversight over the deportation process as a whole. These \n     proposals, like the recently enacted antiterrorism law, are \n     exceptional in their scope and threaten basic principles upon \n     which our legal system is founded.\n       The House-passed immigration bill, like the antiterrorism \n     law which, unless repealed in the pending immigration \n     legislation, bars judicial review of deportation orders based \n     on certain nonterrorism grounds, establishes a summary \n     exclusion provision where an immigration officer would have \n     final unreviewable authority to exclude and deport \n     international travelers and asylum seekers, and strips the \n     federal courts of jurisdiction to review any individual claim \n     or class action challenges arising from these procedures. \n     Additionally, the House-passed bill provides that ``no court \n     shall have jurisdiction'' to review certain waiver decisions \n     of the Attorney General, and limits injunctive relief with \n     regard to certain provisions ``regardless of the nature (of \n     the action or claim or of the identity of the parties \n     bringing the action.)'' The Senate-passed immigration bill \n     denies judicial review of Attorney General denials of \n     discretionary relief and orders of deportation based on \n     criminal convictions.\n       These proposals grant agency authority to take \n     constitutionally questionable action and raise issues of \n     constitutional dimensions wholly apart from the immigration \n     context and the rights of immigrants. The most basic \n     safeguards of due process are threatened, along with the \n     elimination of a meaningful role for the judiciary to perform \n     its historic function of reviewing the implementation and \n     execution of law. The proposals also implicate the separation \n     of powers structure of our government by undermining the \n     judicial roles to protect due process and safeguard \n     individual rights and to review the actions of\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\n     the Executive Branch. Congress cannot exercise its power in a \n     way that deprives any person of life, liberty or property \n     without due process of law.\n       Moreover, we believe that these legislative proposals are \n     not premised on any study or empirical data demonstrating a \n     need to eliminate a process that affords full and fair \n     hearings with administrative and judicial review. The federal \n     judiciary plays an essential role in this scheme, \n     interpreting the laws and ensuring that the executive branch \n     complies with them. The process of judicial review helps \n     insure that administrative officers implement the laws in a \n     manner consistent with the intent of Congress.\n       We believe the proposals in the legislation are of dubious \n     constitutionality and imprudent as a matter of public policy. \n     Congress should take this opportunity to correct the defects \n     in the antiterrorism law and preserve our constitutional \n     traditions\n           Sincerely,\n       (Institutional affiliations are shown for purposes of \n     identification only)\n         Anna Williams Shavers, University of Nebraska College of \n           Law; Bruce Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and \n           Political Science, Yale Law School; Harry H. \n           Wellington, Dean, New York Law School; Susan Sturm, \n           University of Pennsylvania Law School; Stephen H. \n           Legomsky, Washington University Law School; Howard \n           Lesnick, University of Pennsylvania Law School; Charles \n           H.

Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I take the \ntime of the Senate today to discuss an issue involving the \ntelecommunication industry. The Federal Communications Commission--the \nfunding of which we are now discussing--has gone far beyond \ncongressional intent in an important area that was dealt with in the \ntelecommunications law.\n  The goal of telecommunications reform legislation, in my view, was to \npromote competition within and among the various telecommunications-\nrelated industries, for example, local and long distance telephone \nproviders, cable television, wireless and satellite companies. It is \nnot possible to achieve that reform if federal and state governments \nrestrict competition by creating excessive regulation.\n  While I agree that the State and Federal governments should retain \nsome authority to protect consumers and the public interest, it is \nimperative that we remove as much other governmental regulation of the \ntelecommunication industry as possible. Too much regulation will only \nhinder industry growth, and deny consumers and businesses the new \nservices and products that telecommunication reform will provide. I \nbelieve less government regulation was the intent of Congress. In his \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, former Attorney \nGeneral William P. Barr said ``the real danger to competition is that \nexcessive, onerous regulation will prevent incumbent local exchange \ncarriers from competing on a level playing field with new entrants. The \nFederal Communications Commission's recent rules purporting to \nimplement the Telecommunications Act of 1996 highlight this danger.''\n  Mr. President, I have been informed of several problems with the \nFCC's new rulings. I wish to highlight a few. For example, to encourage \nnew entrants into the local phone markets while the companies build \ntheir own networks, I believe that Congress wanted incumbent telephone \ncompanies to resell its services at wholesale rates to any new \ncompanies wishing to buy the services. Even though I had concerns at \nthe time, I believed that Congress' intent was to encourage more \ncompetition within the local markets without penalizing those companies \nwho have already spent large amounts of capital building a network. \nInstead, the FCC, an entity whose members are not elected by the \npublic, has taken the liberty of dictating what happens in the local \ntelephone markets. The FCC's new rules will allow resellers to bypass \nthe wholesale rate defined by Congress and pay significantly lower \nprices for network parts that are already in place.\n  If the FCC's new regulations are implemented, new entrants will be \nable to resell existing network components as a consumer service in the \nlocal market. The problem with that is that the new competitors will \nhave little or no incentive to build their own networks. Existing \ncompanies will have no incentive to invest in network enhancements if \ntheir research and development can be used--without proper \ncompensation--by any new entrant. As Mr. Barr said during the hearing \non mergers and competition in the telecommunications industry, ``under \nthe\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\nFCC's system, it makes no sense for any competitor to develop its own \nnetwork. Instead of real competition that spurs investment, creates \njobs, and improves services, the end result of the FCC's rules will be \na scheme of contrived `Potemkin competition' in which so-called \ncompetitors merely rebrand services purchased below-cost from a \nseverely handicapped incumbent LEC and create the false appearance of \ncompetition.''\n  Another example of the FCC's overreach is the manner in which it has \ndetermined prices for certain telecommunication services. Congress \nrecognized that a one-size-fits-all price system is not conducive to \nall States. The environment in North Dakota is drastically different \nfrom New York. Therefore, Congress assigned State public utility \ncommissions the task of determining reasonable rates for \ninterconnection and unbundled elements. The law requires that the rates \nbe cost-based and nondiscriminatory. It also allowed for the rates to \ninclude a reasonable profit. Instead, the FCC has mandated a cost \nsystem for States to follow when setting unbundled network element \nprices. The Commission also set default prices for certain network \nelements. I have been informed that, in many instances, these prices \nare far below cost and could place existing telephone companies at a \ndisadvantage. Additionally, the rules will place less value on networks \nthat have been built while eliminating any incentive for existing \ncompanies to expand existing networks.\n  Clearly, as the 668 pages and 3,276 footnotes of the FCC's First \nReport and Order demonstrates, the Commission has gone far beyond the \nintent of Congress. I would ask that the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee to make note of the FCC's failure to abide \nby Congress' plan for telecommunications reform. I thank them for the \nopportunity to express my concerns.\n\n\n                         defense appropriations\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I will support the Defense \nappropriations bill included in the omnibus appropriations bill that is \nbefore us today. I am pleased that our colleagues negotiating these \nissues with the administration, stood their ground on providing \nadditional funding for defense.\n  While this bill and other appropriations bills provide approximately \n$10.8 billion above the President's budget request for defense, this is \nactually $8 billion less for defense, in real terms, than last year's \nlevel of funding. Does any Senator believe that we will use our \nmilitary forces less in fiscal year 1997 than we did this year? I think \nnot.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the administration began negotiations \non the final spending levels, insisting on a substantial transfer of \nfunds of $4 to $5 billion, from defense to nondefense discretionary \naccounts.\n  It is clear that this administration relies a great deal on our \nmilitary services. It appears more likely every day that our \ncommitments in Bosnia will not end in December as we were told. We \nalready know that the cost of our commitment there has greatly exceeded \nthe administration's original estimate of $2 billion and now exceeds \n$3.3 billion. We do not know what additional commitments might be laid \non our military forces in the Persian Gulf--or as a result of the \nlatest crisis between Israel and the Palestinians. We also do not know \nwhen or where our forces might be committed next, but I am confident \nthat the uptempo for our servicemen and women will not decrease.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the majority leader and other \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives who negotiated \nthese agreements. Like all negotiated outcomes and compromises, no one \ngets everything they want. I do believe however that the additional \nfunds provided by the Congress for defense, included in this bill, are \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, this bill will allow us to provide our servicemen and \nwomen with more modern equipment, alleviating the administration's \nnegative funding trend for modernization; to improve quality of life \nfor our servicemen and women, who frequently find themselves deployed \naway from their families for extended periods; and to increase funding \nfor the readiness of our forces that has become increasingly strained \nto cover the higher uptempo and increasing costs of ongoing operations. \nThis bill recognizes that we must maintain a strong force capable of \ndeploying anywhere in the world at any time.\n  Mr. President, this bill will provide funding for much needed pay \nraises for our uniformed personnel. It provides funding for anti-\nterrorism measures to facilitate the protection of our service \npersonnel. It funds shortfalls in the defense health care program as \nwell as many other important programs.\n  I am pleased that President Clinton is no longer trying to reduce \ndefense spending and recognizes the need for additional defense funding \nover his initial request. I commend my colleagues who negotiated this \nDefense appropriations bill. I support this bill and urge my colleagues \nto vote for this important piece of legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           NTIA-TIIAP PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the omnibus \nappropriations bill includes $21.5 million to fund the \nTelecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program \n[TIIAP] under the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration [NTIA]. TIIAP is an important part of the ongoing effort \nto ensure that every American has access to advanced telecommunications \nservices.\n  Unfortunately, many communities do not have access to advanced \ntelecommunications services. This lack of access is pronounced in rural \nand innercity areas. House appropriators made the wise decision to fund \nTIIAP at $21.5 million. However, for the second year in a row, the \nSenate chose to cut TIIAP funding. The chairman's mark included zero \nfunding for this important program. It was only after my insistence, \nand the cooperation of Senator Stevens at full committee, that $4 \nmillion was included for TIIAP. At that time, I made it clear to the \nfull Appropriations Committee that I would offer an amendment on the \nSenate floor, as I did for fiscal year 1996, to fully fund TIIAP. After \nnegotiating with Senate appropriators and sending a letter of support \nfor TIIAP, along with 13 other Senators to Senator Lott , TIIAP funding \nwas restored to $21.5 million in the omnibus appropriations package.\n  Access to the information superhighway is crucial for economic \ndevelopment and delivery of education, health care, and social \nservices. We can ensure that every citizen has this access, whether \nthey live in rural areas like many residents of my home State of \nNebraska or metropolitan centers like New York or Washington DC, by \nsupporting programs like TIIAP. Competing in the world job market no \nlonger simply means working harder than our competitors abroad. Our \nstudents and workers must have access to and a strong working knowledge \nof the advanced telecommunications services that increasingly drive the \nworld economy. Similarly, if we want to continue to provide the best \nhealth care in the world, Americans must have access to telemedicine \nfacilities that allow them to work with health care specialists across \nthe country. The importance of TIIAP to developing a strong information \ninfrastructure should not be underestimated. I believe the Senate took \na great step forward today in the battle to ensure that every American \nhas access to advanced telecommunications services.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, while I support H.R. 4278, the omnibus \nappropriations bill, I am strongly opposed to the inclusion in this \nbill of the fiscal year 1997 Department of Defense Appropriations \nConference Report. I am opposed to the Defense appropriations \nconference agreement because it provides some $9.5 billion more to the \nPentagon than it asked for or needs. At a time when we are trying to \nbalance the Government's budget and when the cold war is over, we \nsimply cannot justify this excessive spending to the American taxpayer.\n  As a former Navy pilot, I know all too well the need for a strong \nnational defense and and the need to make sure our service personnel \nare properly trained, equipped, and compensated. But like the fiscal \nyear 1996 DOD appropriations bill which provided the Pentagon $7 \nbillion more than it asked for or needed, the fiscal year 1997 \nconference agreement contains excessive\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\nand wasteful spending. It asks American taxpayers to spend five times \nmore on the military that the military budgets of all our likely \nadversaries combined. The $9.5 billion add on alone is three times the \ndefense budgets of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, or Syria.\n  To look at it in terms of my State of Iowa, this add on of $9.5 \nbillion is more than twice the budget for the entire State of Iowa. \nIowans could fund their K-12 education system, some 500,000 pupuls in \nabout 380 school districts, for over 3 years.\n  It's time for some fairness. It's time for some common sense. And \nfairness tells us that the Pentagon shouldn't be exempt from our \nefforts to balance the budget. Commonsense dictates that we can't \nafford $9.5 billion in add ons over what the Pentagon and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff say we need to maintain a strong national defense. I \nopposed the fiscla year 1997 DOD appropriations bill when it was \nconsidered by the Senate and I did not sign the conference agreement. I \nfeel strongly that it should not be approved as a part of this omnibus \nbill.\n  I will vote for this bill despite my strong opposition to the \ninclusion of the DOD measure because it contains significant \nimprovements in support for education and other critical needs of our \nNation. This House and Senate had proposed significant cuts to \neducation and training. And when I tried to offer an amendment on the \nfloor to restore these cuts, the majority objected. So I was very \npleased to work again in conference on a bipartisan basis with Senator \nSpecter and others to provide the support necessary to make college \nmore affordable for middle class Americans through increases in Pell \nGrants, Perkins loans, direct lending and college work study. We were \nalso able to increase the number of children who will be able to \nparticipate in Head Start and get special assistance with reading and \nmath skills through chapter 1. And we were able to restore unwise cuts \nto the President's requests for critical job training initiatives.\n  We must have a well-educated and well-trained work force if we are \ngoing to increase the incomes and quality of life for our working \nfamilies. So these changes, while hard fought, are a real victory for \nworking families and our future.\n  I am also very pleased, Mr. President, that this bill contains strong \nmeasures to combat the growing problem of illegal immigration in my \nState of Iowa and around the Nation. This bill contains a provision I \noffered in the Senate that will guarantee Iowa and other States a \nminimum of 10 INS agents to enforce immigration laws. This will go a \nlong way to cracking down on this growing problem.\n\n\n                       electronic combat testing\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, for some time now I have been following the \nDepartment of Defense's plans relative to electronic combat testing. \nLast year, I engaged in a colloquy with the good Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, to clarify the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee's \nintention in their request that DOD provide Congress with an electronic \ncombat master plan. At that time, I believe we made it perfectly clear \nthat the master plan should provide optimum asset utilization.\n  Given this background, I am sure you can understand my surprise and \ndismay earlier this year when a report came back to the Congress which \ndid not contain so much as one dollar sign. Again, I say there was \nabsolutely no reference to any cost analysis supporting the \nDepartment's recommendations in their master plan.\n  Since DOD was apparently unwilling or unable to provide any \njustification for their recommendations, I asked the GAO to review \nDOD's electronic combat testing and their master plan.\n  After learning of the preliminary results of a now nearly complete \nGAO investigation, I understand why DOD failed to include in their \nmaster plan any justification for their recommendations.\n  Simply put, there does not appear to be any mission or cost \njustification to support DOD's recommendations. Indeed, preliminary \nreports from the GAO investigation indicate that the master plan would \nresult in substantially increased costs, while providing diminished \ncapabilities.\n  Given this background, I am sure you can understand my concern over \none of the recommendations in this master plan to move test and \nevaluation activities from Eglin, AFC, located in northwest Florida. \nThis feeling is exacerbated by the fact that nearly 2 years before the \nissuance of this master plan, the Base Closure and Realignment \nCommission [BRAC] recognized previous DOD findings which ranked Eglin, \nAFB as highest military value of all the DOD electronic combat [EC] \nranges. Accordingly, the BRAC provided that selected EC capabilities at \nEglin, AFB be sustained ``to support Air Force Special Operations \nCommand (AFSOC), the USAF Air Warfare Center, and Air Force Material \nCommand Armaments/Weapons Test and Evaluation activities. . .''\n  Unfortunately, it appears DOD's electronic combat master plan \ndemonstrates that the Air Force, with the tacit endorsement of the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense, fully intends to dismiss the \ndirection of the BRAC.\n  To address concerns about DOD's actions on this matter, the Congress \nhas provided funding in the fiscal year 1997 Defense appropriations \nbill to insure that Eglin, AFB range capabilities are adequate to \ncomply with the BRAC intent to sustain selected EC capabilities to meet \npresent and future requirements of AFSOC testing and training, AWC \nelectronic combat testing, and AFMC testing and evaluation.\n  I ask the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, his intentions with respect to the funding provided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As my good friend from Florida has already stated, we \nhave been following this issue for some time now. I share his \ndisappointment over the failure of DOD to provide a useful report by \nwhich the Congress can evaluate their recommendations.\n  I look forward to reviewing the GAO's findings on this matter. I am \nconfident that these issues will be discussed during future Defense \nsubcommittee hearings with DOD officials.\n  In the interim, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has provided \nfunding to insure the Eglin range can maintain and improve its EC \ncapability, including instrumentation, consistent with the BRAC \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Alaska for his \ninterest in this matter.\n  I would like to elaborate further on what I have been informed is the \nminimum capability required to meet the needs of the users identified \nby the BRAC. It is my understanding that this should include fully \ninstrumented, fully capable threat systems/simulators for the SADS-IIR, \nSADS-III, SADS-IVR, SADS-V, SADS-VIR, SADS-VIIIR, SADS-XI, SADS-XII, \nWEST-XR, WEST-XI, and flycatcher threats. Additional technique \ngenerators, target signature generators, environment generators, on-\nsite data processing, and site support facilities are required at Eglin \nrange sites in order to optimize the development of mission data \nrequired to support current and future worldwide operations of U.S. \nforces.\n  Moreover, I am told that much of the instrumentation and support \nfacilities identified herein exist today and are designed to provide \nthe flexibility needed for characterizing future threat systems as they \nare identified and become available. I have been informed that upgrades \nto these capabilities are the most cost-efficient approach to \naddressing future requirements and consistent with the BRAC decision.\n  The funding provided by the Congress allows for the maintenance and \nimprovement of those systems most critical for electronic combat \ntraining. I appreciate the support of the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee in providing this funding and look forward \nto continuing to work with him on this matter in the coming year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the continuing resolution is a massive \npiece of legislation. I want to comment on some of the provisions in \nthis bill that may not be big-ticket items but are of particular \nsignificance in addressing the crime problems facing our Nation and \nensuring that our citizens are able to obtain FBI records to which they \nare entitled under our public access laws.\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n\n            fbi processing of foia and privacy act requests\n\n  The legislation appropriates $3,327,000 to the FBI to address \nbacklogs in the processing of requests for agency records under the \nFreedom of Information Act [FOIA] and Privacy Act. By letter, dated \nJuly 8, 1996, to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \nState, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, Senator Specter and I urged \nthis amount be appropriated. While the FOIA requires that agencies \nrespond to requests for agency records within 10 business days, most \nagencies do not meet this legal requirement, resulting in huge backlogs \nof FOIA requests. The FBI's backlog is among the largest. On May 31, \n1996, the FBI had a backlog of 15,259 requests, with some requests \ndating back to 1992. Long delays in access--particularly delays of \nalmost 4 years--really means no access at all for many requesters.\n  A cornerstone of our democracy is the people's right to know about \nthe actions of their Government. The FOIA represents Congress' \nimplementation of this basic principle. The FOIA sets out the \nprocedures by which people may request information from the Federal \nGovernment. Federal agencies must provide the information in a timely \nmanner, unless it falls within enumerated exemptions from the FOIA.\n  The funds earmarked for FOIA and Privacy Act request processing \nrepresents an important effort to address this huge backlog. In \naddition, the electronic FOIA amendments, which I sponsored with \nSenators Brown and Kerry, provides a number of steps to make the \nprocess of requesting agency records easier and faster. These \nElectronic FOIA amendments unanimously passed the Congress on September \n18. Even as the size of the Federal Government shrinks, we must keep it \nresponsive to the people.\n\n\n          fbi computer investigations threat assessment center\n\n  This legislation appropriates to the FBI $5,013,000 and 17 agents to \nestablish a Computer Investigations Threat Assessment Center [CITAC] at \nFBI headquarters to identify, investigate, and counter illegal \nintrusion into Government computer networks. This is an important \ndevelopment.\n  As our Federal agencies increasingly depend on computers to perform \ntheir mission, the risk of computer crime has become a more significant \nthreat to our public safety and national security. For example, the \nDepartment of Defense relies on computers to deploy, feed, supply, and \ncommunicate with troops. Yet, the GAO recently reported that 250,000 \ncomputer attacks were occurring each year at DOD. We know that in 1994, \na computer hacker based in the United Kingdom was able to break into \nthe Rome Laboratory at Griffess Air Force base in New York. Just last \nweek, computer hackers forced the CIA to take down an agency Web site \nbecause obscenities and unauthorized text and photograph changes had \nbeen made to the site and unauthorized links had been established \nbetween the CIA Web site and other sites.\n\n  Undoubtedly, the increased reliance by Government agencies on \ncomputer systems and networks presents special vulnerabilities to \ncomputer hackers and spies. I have long been concerned about this \nvulnerability. That is why I worked with the Department of Justice, and \nmy colleagues, Senators Kyl and Grassley, on the National Information \nInfrastructure Protection Act, which passed the Senate unanimously, as \nS. 982, on September 18 and also passed the House of Representatives, \nas part of H.R. 3723, on September 18. This bill will increase \nprotection for computers, both Government and private, and the \ninformation on those computers, from the growing threat of computer \ncrime.\n  This establishment of CITAC will bring vital focus and attention on \nhow to prevent computer crime and, when it does occur, how to find the \nperpetrators. The work of the FBI at CITAC, though focused on \nGovernment computer networks, will also have important applications for \nthe private sector.\n\n\n                             CALEA FUNDING\n\n  The conference agreement provides $60,000,000 to be deposited into a \nnewly established telecommunications carrier compliance fund to fund \nthe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA]. I was \nthe author of CALEA, sometimes called the digital telephony law, in the \nSenate and applauded its passage as a necessary step to protect our \npublic safety and national security. This law is also intended to bring \nmuch-needed sunshine and public scrutiny to the process of how wiretaps \nare conducted.\n  CALEA authorized $500,000,000 to pay for any necessary retrofitting \nof existing systems to come into compliance with law enforcement \ncapability and capacity requirements to maintain its ability to \nimplement court-ordered wiretaps. I am glad that funds are finally \nbeing appropriated for this new law.\n  I had serious concerns with the House proposed implementation plan, \nwhich was set out as a condition for funding in both the House passed \nCJS appropriations bill, and House terrorism legislation. The modified \nimplementation plan in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for \n1997 makes sense to ensure accountability on the part of the FBI.\n  For example, CALEA already requires that the Attorney General publish \ncertain information in the Federal Register for public comment, \nincluding information about law enforcement's capacity needs and cost \ncontrol regulations. The conditions in the omnibus appropriations \nlegislation would require that this information be provided on a \ncountry-by-county basis.\n\n  We should fund the digtigal telephone law. At the same time, the \nconditions in the modified plan for use of the appropriated funds will \nhelp ensure that the FBI complies fully with the letter and spirit of \ndisclosure that is a hallmark of that legislation.\n\n\n                     Law Enforcement Support Center\n\n  I am delighted that Congress recognizes the contribution that is \nbeing made to immigration law enforcement by the Law Enforcement \nSupport Center [LESC] in South Burlington, VT. This is among the most \nsignificant capacities being developed to assist Federal, State, and \nlocal law enforcement deal more effectively with criminal aliens. \nImproving the identification and expediting the decoration of criminal \naliens responsible for violent crimes are goals on which there is \nuniversal agreement.\n  The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorized \nthe Law Enforcement Support Center. Last year, I had a colloquy on the \nSenate floor with the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee chairman \nclarifying that the Senate-passed appropriations bill allowed the LESC \nto continue to receive its authorized funding.\n  This is only online national database available to identify criminal \naliens. It is a valuable and essential asset for improving our national \nimmigration enforcement effort. The LESC provides local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement agencies with 24-hour access to data on \ncriminal aliens. By assisting in the identification of these aliens, \nthe LESC allows law enforcement agencies to expedite deportation \nproceedings against them.\n  In its first year of operation, the LESC identified over 10,000 \ncriminal aliens as aggravated felons. After starting up with a link to \nlaw enforcement agencies in one county in Arizona, the LESC expanded \nits coverage to that entire State. The LESC is expected to be online \nwith California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, \nTexas and Washington, as well as Arizona this year.\n  The Law Enforcement Support Center deserves our full support. The \nOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for 1997 increases the support \nby adopting the increased authorization that Senator Hutchison and I \noffered to the Senate immigration bill when it was considered last May. \nBy increasing to $5 million a year the authorization of the LESC we \ndemonstrate our commitment to effective assistance to State and local \nlaw enforcement.\n\n\n                 carryover funds for COPS more program\n\n  The conference agreement includes $1,400,000,000 for the Community \nOriented Policing Services [COPS] and $20,000,000 for the Police Corps \nProgram. This funding is to be used to maintain the commitment to hire \n100,000 new police officers. This is a commitment the Congress and the \nPresident made in the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, and I am pleased \nthat we are keeping our promise. Importantly, funds available for prior \nyear carryover may be used for innovative community policing programs, \nso\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nlong as reprogramming requirements are satisfied. This ensures that our \nState and local law enforcement have the flexibility they need to spend \nthis money they are granted when and how they need to, within the broad \nparameters set by Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the Interior section of this bill, there \nis a provision dealing with Alaska subsistence. In the official papers, \nthe word ``prepare'' is left in the language, contrary to the agreement \nreached with the administration early Saturday. I would like to clarify \nwith the subcommittee chairman that this technical error is not \nintended to be a precedent for future years.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree.\n\n\n        LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill that is before the Senate today \nprovides $71.087 billion in discretionary budget authority for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nrelated agencies for fiscal year 1997. Mandatory spending totals $219.5 \nbillion, an increase of $19 billion over the fiscal 1996 levels.\n  The conference agreement provides substantial increases in education \nprograms--$3.5 billion over last year. Medical research is increased by \nmore than $820 million, and workplace safety programs by almost $79 \nmillion over the 1996 appropriated levels.\n  While I support the funding levels for programs within my \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction, as I stated on Saturday, I am concerned \nwith the process which produced this omnibus appropriations bill. I am \nconcerned because the procedure undercut the traditional appropriations \nprocess. The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill never \neven came to the Senate floor because it was anticipated that it would \nbe very contentious and that many diverse amendments would be offered. \nLast year's bill was not finished until April 25, but on that bill \nSenate Harkin and I came forward with a bipartisan amendment to add \n$2.7 billion so that we could have adequate funding for Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education. We demonstrated that the \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking member can work together in a \nharmonious manner and really get the job done. But this year on the \nSenate floor, we have seen biding wars to gain political advantage by \nadding funding and legislation to appropriations bills. This led us to \na position where we have had to go to this single omnibus bill, and \nwhere we had to negotiate with the White House to produce a bill the \nPresident would agree to before the end of the fiscal year today.\n\n  As I have said, I am proud of the work, the bipartisan, work done on \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services portion of this bill. I want to \nthank the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, for his hard \nwork and help in bringing this bill through the committee and through \nthe negotiations with the House and the administration.\n  The important programs funded within this subcommittee's jurisdiction \nprovide resources to improve the public health and strengthen \nbiomedical research, assure a quality education for America's children, \nand job training activities to keep this Nation's work force \ncompetitive with world markets. I'd like to take the time and mention \nseveral important accomplishments of this bill.\n\n\n                          biomedical research\n\n  For the National Institutes of Health, the bill before us contains \nnearly $12.747 billion, an increase of $820 million, or 6.9 percent, \nabove the fiscal year 1996 level. These funds will be critical in \ncatalyzing scientific discoveries that will lead to new treatments and \ncures, that in turn will reduce materially the cost of health care. Few \nactivities of Government provide greater promise for improving the \nquality, and reducing the costs, of health care for all Americans than \nour investment in medical research.\n\n\n                substance abuse education and prevention\n\n  Substance abuse prevention and treatment programs are increased by \n$207 million over 1996. The bill includes $1.310 billion for the \nsubstance abuse block grant which provides funds to States for \nsubstance abuse prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Recognizing \nthat drug prevention education needs to start when children are young, \nto teach children the skills they need to resist drug use, the bill \nalso provides a $90 million increase for the Safe and Drug Free Schools \nand Communities Program.\n\n\n                                  aids\n\n  This bill contains over $3 billion for research, education, \nprevention, and services to confront the AIDS epidemic, including a \nnearly $239 million increase for Ryan White. The bill provides $217 \nmillion for AIDS drug assistance programs to assist states in providing \nthe new generation of protease inhibitor drugs to persons with HIV.\n\n\n                             healthy start\n\n  Low birth weight is the leading cause of infant mortality. Infants \nwho have been exposed to drugs, alcohol or tobacco in the mother's womb \nare at-risk for prematurity and low birth weight. I became directly \ninvolved in Healthy Start after visiting hospitals in Pittsburgh and \nPhiladelphia and seeing one-pound babies, whose chances for survival \nwere very slim. For Healthy Start, the bill provides $96 million, $20 \nmillion more than the President requested, to continue the campaign to \ncut infant mortality rates in half and to give low birth weight babies \na better chance at survival.\n\n\n                             women's health\n\n  The committee continues to place a very high priority on women's \nhealth. The bill before the Senate contains an increase of $15 million \nfor breast and cervical cancer screening, these increases will: expand \nresearch on the breast cancer gene, accelerate the development of new \ndiagnostic tests, and speed research on new, more effective methods of \nprevention, detection, and treatment. Funding for the Office of Women's \nHealth has also been raised to $12.5 million to continue the National \nAction Plan on Breast Cancer and to provide health care professionals \nwith a broad range of women's health related information.\n\n\n                         violence against women\n\n  The bill contains $123 million for programs authorized under the \nViolent Crime Reduction Act. The bill before the Senate contains the \nfull amount authorized for these programs, including $60 million for \nbattered women's shelters, $35 million for rape prevention programs, $8 \nmillion for runaway youth and $12.8 million for community schools.\n  Domestic violence, especially violence against women, has become a \nproblem of epidemic proportions. The Department of Justice reports that \neach year women are the victims of more than 4.5 million violent \ncrimes, including an estimated 500,000 rapes or other sexual assaults.\n  But crime statistics do not tell the whole story.\n  I have visited women's shelters in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, where I \nsaw, first hand, the kind of physical and emotional suffering so many \nwomen are enduring.\n\n\n                               head start\n\n  Head Start receives an increase of $412 million for a total of almost \n$4 billion.\n\n\n                               education\n\n  The future promise of any nation is dependent on the capabilities of \nits youth and increased funding for education is an investment in the \nfuture. This bill provides an increase of $3.513 billion over fiscal \nyear 1996 education program levels. This is the highest level of \nsupport in our Nation's history. The bill funds title I at $7.7 \nbillion, $470 million over last year and increases by $141 million \nfunding for the Goals 2000 Program. Education for the handicapped is \nincreased by $791 million over last year and vocational and adult \neducation is increased by $146 million. The maximum Pell grant is \nincreased by $230 to $2,700 per student. The bill increases the TRIO \nProgram by $37 million and Education, Research, Statistics and \nImprovement programs are increased by $248 million.\n\n\n                              job training\n\n  In this Nation, Mr. President, we know all too well that high \nunemployment wastes valuable human talent and potential, and ultimately \nweakens our economy. The bill before us today provides $4.7 billion for \njob training programs, including a $60 million increase for Job Corps. \nThese funds will help improve job skills and readjustment services for \ndisadvantaged youth and adults.\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\n                             school to work\n\n  The committee recommends $400 million for school to work programs \nwithin the Department of Labor and Education. These important programs \nwill help ease the transition from school to work for those students \nwho do not plan to attend 4-year institutions.\n\n\n                            workplace safety\n\n  The bill increases workplace safety programs by $79 million over the \n1996 levels. While progress has been made in this area, there is still \nfar too many work-related injuries and illnesses. The funds provided \nwill continue the programs that inspect business and industry, weed out \noccupational hazards and protect workers pensions.\n\n\n                   nutrition programs for the elderly\n\n  For the congregate and home delivered meals program, the bill \nprovides $469 million, or nearly $19 million above the request. In some \nareas of the country, there are long waiting lists for home-delivered \nmeals. The resources provided by this bill will go a long way to ensure \nthat the most vulnerable segment of the elderly population receive \nproper nutrition.\n\n\n                                 liheap\n\n  The bill provides $1 billion for Low Income Heating Assistance for \nthis winter and $1 billion in advance for next winter. This is a key \nprogram for low income families in Pennsylvania and other cold weather \nStates in the Northwest. Funding supports grants to States to deliver \ncritical assistance to low income households to help meet higher energy \ncosts.\n\n\n                                closing\n\n  There are many other notable accomplishments, but for the sake of \ntime, I mentioned just some of the highlights, so that the Nation may \ngrasp the scope and importance of this bill.\n  I have voted against the omnibus appropriations bill as a protest to \nthe procedures which I discussed at some length in floor statements \ntoday and last Saturday, September 28, 1996.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Harkin and \nhis staff and the other Senators on the subcommittee for their \ncooperation in a very tough budget year.\n\n\n           funding for the institute for international sport\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as we approve the omnibus spending bill \nwhich includes appropriations for the Department of Education, it is \nimportant to mention that the Appropriations Subcommittee for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education intends \n$800,000 from the fund for the improvement of education intends \n$800,000 from the fund for the Improvement of Education to be used for \nscholar athlete games. The committee report to accompany the \nappropriations bill says ``Within the funds provided, the committee has \nincluded $800,000 to award grants to nonprofit organizations for the \ncost of conducting scholar-athlete games.'' This small sum is to \nsupport the scholar-athlete games held by such groups as the Institute \nfor International Sport at the University of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. That is correct. In 1994, Senator Chafee and I were able to \ninclude a similarly modest sum in the fund for the improvement of \neducation for the Rhode Island Scholar Athlete Games. These games--\nwhich brought together young people in our State of varied backgrounds \nto participate in educational and cultural competitions and \ndemonstrations, as well as in athletic competitions--were an enormous \nsuccess. This year, the funds will be used for the second World-Scholar \nAthlete Games which will bring together young people from around the \nworld.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would just like to emphasize that this is the second \nWorld Scholar Athlete Games that have been held by the Institute of \nInternational Sport at URI. The first games were held in 1993, the \nInstitute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island \nconducted the World Scholar Athlete Games with 1,600 students from 108 \ncountries and all 50 States participating. Through these games \nfriendships were formed and understanding was developed between boys \nand girls who would otherwise never have crossed paths. I believe, and \nI am certain that Senator Pell agrees, that through this form of \ninteraction bridges between diverse populations are built.\n  Mr. PELL. I would say to my colleague, yes, that is exactly correct. \nThis sort of enterprise, which has been developed by Dan Doyle at URI, \nis a way to build bridges between nations, just as the Rhode Island \nGames were meant to build bridges between neighborhoods and towns.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The second World Scholar Athlete Games will be held \nduring the summer of 1997. Through a partnership between the ``Sister \nCities International'' and the Institute for International Sport along \nwith others, 2,200 students from 125 countries are expected to \nparticipate.\n\n\n                      parents as teachers program\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Chairman Specter for increasing funds for the Parents as Teachers \n[PAT] Program in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, \nand related agencies appropriations bill. The key to success for our \nchildren's education is to begin early in life through well-rounded \nearly childhood education programs that benefit not only the child, but \nthe parent as well. I firmly believe that we must give parents the \ntools they need to fulfill their responsibility to develop their \nchildren's character, personality and ability to learn as well as to \nprovide for their material needs if we are ever to see our social ills \ndiminish.\n  Title IV of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act requires at least 50 \npercent of funds awarded to each grantee to be used to establish, \nexpand, or operate Parents as Teachers Program or Home Instruction \nPrograms for Preschool Youngsters [HIPPY]. This will enhance three of \nthe four purposes of the legislation as stated in section 401(a):\n  The purpose of this title is--\n  First, to increase parents' knowledge of and confidence in child-\nrearing activities, such as teaching and nurturing their young \nchildren;\n  Second, to strengthen partnerships between parents and professionals \nin meeting the educational needs of children aged birth through five \nand the working relationship between home and school;\n  Third, to enhance the developmental progress of children assisted \nunder this title; and\n  Fourth, to fund at least one parental information and resource center \nin each State before September 30, 1998.\n  The purposes clearly focus on parents of young children, and this \nappropriation will carry these purposes forward by awarding funds to \nStates who commit to spend at least half of their grant on Parents as \nTeachers or HIPPY, early childhood parent education programs which have \nbeen proven effective.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nraising the importance of the Parents as Teachers Program. The purpose \nof the Parents as Teachers Program is to improve parenting skills and \nstrengthen the partnership between parents and professionals in meeting \nthe education needs of their school-age children, including those aged \nbirth through five. It is my understanding that Federal education funds \nare authorized for grantees who make a commitment to spend at least 50 \npercent of their funds on implementing the Parents as Teachers Program \nor Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters. These are \neffective parent education programs that promote learning and child \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and appreciate all \nof his good work on this bill. As members of the Senate Labor, Health \nand Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, we want to ensure, from the start, that children are \nready to learn, physically and emotionally. Parents as Teachers has a \nproven track record of increasing a child's intellectual and social \nskills that are essential when a child enters school, and involving \nparents in creating a healthy and safe environment for their children. \nThis program strengthens the foundation for children's educational \nsuccess and healthy development, and I urge my colleagues to continue \nto support the Parents as Teachers Program.\n\n\n                   efforts to combat hemochromatosis\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to engage the chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services, \nSenator Specter, in a colloquy regarding hemochromatosis.\n\n[[Page S11913]]\n\n  Hemochromatosis, or Iron Overload Disease, is an illness in which too \nmuch iron is stored in the blood. It leads to massive organ failure if \nit is not caught early, but this tragic outcome may be averted by \nregularly giving blood. Already, the Centers for Disease Control has \nbeen working to establish guidelines for physicians on diagnosing this \ndisease and on its simple treatment, but the effort has just begun. In \nlight of the seriousness of the disease and the promise of advancements \nin its treatment, I hope the Centers for Disease Control will use some \nof the increased funds in this bill to expand its clinical screening \neffort and to provide physician education.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from South \nCarolina to spread the word on this serious matter. We have been \ncareful to provide an appropriate increase for the Center for Chronic \nand Environmental Disease Prevention, and this is an appropriate use of \nthese funds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n   section 2601 within title III, the economic growth and regulatory \n                        paperwork reduction act\n\n  Mr. MACK. Because my good friend from Utah is our resident expert on \nstored value products, and in fact is responsible for the much needed \nstudy on these products, as well as a 9 month delay in Federal Reserve \nBoard rulemaking on these products in this bill, I wanted to ask him a \nquestion about his intent with respect to these two provisions. Was it \never your intent to interfere with the Federal Reserve Board's proposed \nrevisions to Regulation E with respect to electronic communication of \nRegulation E required disclosures, and the Fed's revised rules \nregarding error resolution for new accounts?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Florida for the useful question. \nThe electric stored value products study should in no way delay or \notherwise affect the Federal Reserve Board's further consideration of \nthese other proposed Regulation E revision, or any other revisions to \nRegulation E not involving electronic stored value products.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I engage the chairman in a colloquy regarding the \ncommittee's funding of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct? As the chairman knows, the authorization for that status expires \nSeptember 30, 1996. And the current statutory language has been the \nsubject of considerable criticism.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of these difficulties.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Senator Biden and I introduced S. 1952 in this \nCongress, a bipartisan bill to reauthorize JJDPA. This bill would make \nthe most sweeping changes in the JJDPA since its original enactment in \n1974. The Judiciary Committee reported the bill favorably to the full \nSenate in August, but the full Senate was not able to take up the bill \nbefore adjournment. What is the chairman's view of this legislation?\n  Mr. GREGG . I commend the Senator fROM Tennessee and the Senator from \nDelaware for introducing thoughtful legislation to update Federal \nGovernment's law regarding juvenile crime. Much of the current statute \nfunds programs that may or may not be effective. And it imposes severe \nburdens on States and localities, especially under the regulations that \nhave been promulgated.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the chairman. I would also point out that the \nnature of juvenile crime has changed so much since the original \nenactment of JJDPA in 1974.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The legislation that Senator Thompson and I introduced and \npassed through the Judiciary Committee includes some important reforms \nwhich have bipartisan support. We have worked together on the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Youth Violence to update the statute. I am \ndisappointed that we were not able to pass reauthorization legislation \nthis year. I look forward to trying again next year. I would ask the \nchairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee if \nhe is concerned that if reauthorization legislation is not passed next \nyear, whether that will make it more difficult for the subcommittee to \nfund the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would say to the Senator that the committee will \nobviously make appropriations in a way that reflects any changes in the \nauthorizing legislation. But given the bipartisan view that the JJDPA \nmust be extensively changed, and the likelihood that the Congress will \nchange the authorizing language next year, it is unlikely that the \nprogram will be funded in its current form for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n               secton 115 of the interior appropriaitons\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, would the senior Senator from Washington \nyield for a question on the bill language amending the Elwha Act \nincluded in the Interior section of the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is it a correct interpretation of the language in \nsection 114, that none of the requirements of the Elwha Act are changed \nif the State of Washington elects not to purchase the projects?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                          recreation user fees\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express a concern about the \nrecreation fee demonstration program for America's national parks and \nwilderness areas. These fees were authorized in last year's continuing \nresolution, and I see that there are additional provisions included in \nthe 1997 Senate Interior appropriations bill. Do I understand correctly \nthat the subcommittee chairman supports expanding this program to more \nof this Nation's parks and refuges?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan is correct.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to assure the chairman that I am \nnot opposed to the concept of user fees for national parks and \nwilderness areas. In this period of increased fiscal awareness, such an \napproach may help the Forest Service and Park Service maintain these \nimportant national treasures. I think it is important, however, that we \nclarify who will have to pay these recreation fees.\n  As a case in point, the Sylvania Wilderness in Michigan's Upper \nPeninsula has been chosen as one of the recreation fee demonstration \nsites, and the Forest Service is presently taking comments on this \nproposed action. Located on the edge of the Sylvania Wilderness is a \nbeautiful body of water known as Crooked Lake.\n  When you look at a map of the area, you will note that approximately \nthree-fourths of Crooked Lake's shoreline is within the Sylvania \nWilderness. The remaining one-fourth, however, is privately held by \nabout a dozen riparian owners, some of whom have lived on the lake for \nover 50 years. These owners have been good stewards of the land. As it \nstands now, if the Sylvania does institute a recreation fee, there is \nno guarantee that these people will be exempted from having to pay for \ntheir day-to-day activities.\n  It seems to me that, if these owners and their day-use guests wish to \nuse the lake for recreational activities such as swimming or fishing or \nboating, they should be exempted from paying the user fee. After all, \nthese people lived on the lake and did all these things before the \nSylvania was even designated a wilderness area. How can we justify \nsuddenly imposing a tax on their use of the lake? If one of these \nfamilies hosts a family reunion, for example, should they have to pay a \nrecreation fee for each of the children who might wish to swim or wade \nor boat in the lake? And how can a small, family owned resort that has \noperated on this lake for decades justify having to charge each of its \ncustomers and additional $5 or $10 per person per visit? We need to \nassure these residents, their guests and day-use guests that they will \nnot have to purchase a permit to continue their way of life.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, does the Senator from Michigan believe \nthese resident should pay a user fee when participating in other \nactivities within the Sylvania Wilderness such as hiking and camping?\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would inform the subcommittee chairman \nthat, if the residents wish to use\n\n[[Page S11914]]\n\nthe Sylvania for activities such as camping, hiking, or picnicking, \npaying the same fee as all other visitors sounds reasonable. That is \nclearly a different circumstance, and it seems logical that visiting \nother areas of the Sylvania would require purchasing the same permit as \nall other visitors.\n  Now in fairness Mr. President, I do not know if the Forest Service \nhad any intention of charging the Crooked Lake residents if the \nrecreation fee were instituted. In fact, in conversations about this \nmatter, Sylvania's Forest Service personnel indicated to me that \nexempting riparian owners, guests, and day-use guests from fees for \nusing the lake seemed sensible and fair. I believe that there must be a \ncommitment from the Forest Service and National Park Service to work to \naccommodate the distinctive interests of people living in and around \nthis Nation's parks and refuge areas. I would ask the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman and ranking member if they believe that cases \nsuch as Crooked Lake's riparian owners merit such consideration.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan raises a good \npoint. There may be unique circumstances that should be taken into \nconsideration as these recreation fee demonstration projects are \nproposed and established. It is my expectation that, in instances such \nas this, the administrative agency work with the congressional \ndelegation to resolve disputes to the benefit and understanding of all \nparties.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would agree with the distinguished \nchairman.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman and the ranking member for their consideration \nand all their hard work in support of this Nation's parks, national \nforests, and wildlife refugees. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n             maine acadian culture preservation commission\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to join the Senator from Maine in a \ncolloquy.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, during the 101st Congress, the Congress and \nthe President enacted Public Law 101-543, the Maine Acadian Culture \nPreservation Act. The purposes of the act were to recognize the \nimportant contributions made to American history and culture by the \nAcadians in Maine, to assist State and local governments, as well as \nprivate and public entities, in the identification, preservation, and \ninterpretation of Acadian culture and history, and to assist in the \nidentification and preservation of sites and objects associated with \nAcadian culture.\n  Although the Acadians in Maine represent one of America's oldest and \nmost interesting cultural groups, the mission of the act has still not \nbeen fulfilled, and more work has to be done. I understand that, in the \ncurrent fiscal year, the National Park Service has provided $72,000 \nfrom the Operation of the National Park System account to fund \nactivities related to the act, including technical assistance to the \nMaine Acadian Culture Preservation Commission created by the act. I \nfurther understand that the administration's budget request $72,000 for \nactivities related to Maine Acadian cultural preservation in fiscal \nyear 1997. Is it the chairman's understanding that the National Park \nService intends to use funds from the Operation of the National Park \nSystem account in this bill for these purposes in the next fiscal year?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, the National Park Service's budget does request \nfunding in fiscal year 1997, under the Operation of the National Park \nSystem account, to preserve and interpret Maine Acadian culture, \nconsistent with the authority provided by Congress in the Maine Acadian \nCulture Preservation Act. The omnibus appropriations bill includes \n$66.8 million above the fiscal year 1996 appropriations level for the \noperation of the National Park System account.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the chairman for that clarification.\n\n\n                         u.s. geological survey\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to raise an issue with the chairman of \nsignificance to taxpayers in Utah and across the Nation: the extent to \nwhich the Federal Government is performing functions that, in a free-\nmarket economy such as ours, are better left to the private sector. \nSpecifically, it has been brought to my attention that the U.S. \nGeological Survey [USGS] is competing with private sector companies \nwhen it offers water resources-related engineering, scientific and \ntechnical services--services that are readily available in the private \nsector--to non-Federal entities at far below market rates. Not \nsurprisingly, the non-Federal entities involved often agree to contract \nwith the USGS, to the great detriment of private sector firms in this \nfield. This practice, some have termed it ``predatory competition,'' \nalso appears to involve the USGS in activities far beyond its stated \nmission.\n  Mr. President, according to its informative home page on the World \nWide Web, the mission of the USGS is ``to provide geologic, topographic \nand hydrologic information that contributes to the wise management of \nthe Nation's natural resources and promotes the health, safety, and \nwell-being of the people.''\n  May I ask the chairman if he would agree to investigate this issue in \nthe hearing process next year to determine if this is a problem that \nshould be addressed?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Utah raises a valid point. Our efforts \nin this area to downsize the Federal Government, including the USGS, \nare intended to reduce the burden on taxpayers by retaining only \nessential research capabilities that for sound policy reasons should \nnot, or cannot, be performed by the private sector.\n  I would be happy to explore this issue further as we undertake budget \nhearings in the next fiscal year.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman for his views and look forward to \nworking with him in this important matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I engage the distinguished chairman \nof the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy? A few years \nago, I sponsored an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill \nregarding the eligibility for Alaska Native villages for the BIA road \nfunding program. This amendment was necessitated by an internal ruling \neliminating Alaska Native villages which populations had fallen below \n50 percent Alaska Native.\n  The Alaska Native villages are unique in the country because of the \nspecial nature of the land settlement under the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act. Unlike lower 48 Indian reservations, these villages \nreceived title to their land in fee simple; the Federal Government does \nnot own the land in trust as with reservations in all other States. \nHowever, since the land is privately owned, Congress protected it from \ntaxation and levy by Federal, State and local government while it is \nundeveloped. This has protected this land from being involuntarily \nconveyed out of Alaska Native corporation ownership because of \ninability to pay taxes, but it has also dramatically reduced the tax \nbase in villages which also have municipal governments providing \nmunicipal services.\n  Because of this situation, normal property tax and other municipal \nlevies on land in the villages are not permitted unless the land is \nspecifically developed. The vast majority of this land is not developed \nand is protected from municipal taxation. That is why I sponsored an \namendment to change the BIA road funding rule in Alaska requiring 50 \npercent Alaska Native population for village eligibility. This \namendment was passed twice in the subcommittee, and once by the Senate. \nUltimately, an agreement was worked out with BIA to change this \nqualification standard administratively.\n  Mr. President, I am relating this history because I have been \nrecently contacted by the same village municipality which brought the \nBIA funding issue to my attention. This time a similar rule has been \nadopted and is being enforced for village sanitation, water, sewer, \nwastewater, and solid waste grants by the Indian Health Service. This \nis the same issue again.\n  The exact same arguments and fact patterns apply. The IHS is the \nprincipal grant agency for village water, sewer, wastewater and solid \nwaste for Alaska Native villages. Now it is either changing the rule or \nbeginning to enforce a rule which until now has not\n\n[[Page S11915]]\n\nbeen enforced. Either way, this is unfair for Craig, which is \ncompletely surrounded by Native village corporation land from two \nvillages, Shaan Seet Corp. and Haida Corp. In many ways, Craig is more \nheavily impacted than most municipalities because these two villages \nare so close together that their land selections are adjacent to each \nother.\n  What I ask here, Mr. President, is that the same policy adopted by \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for BIA roads apply for IHS \nvillage sanitation funding. The issues are the same; the result should \nbe the same. Can I get the assurance of the chairman of the \nsubcommittee that he agrees with this position? It is a direct match up \nwith the BIA issue with which this subcommittee has already dealt.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree that there are certain circumstances in which it \nis appropriate for the Indian Health Service to provide sanitation \nfacilities funding for Indian homes in non-Indian communities and for \nAlaska Native villages. I understand that the Indian Health Service \nwill soon issue an internal guidance document that addresses this \nissue, and this policy will be consistent with the terms of the \nconference report on the fiscal year 1995 Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act. (House Report 103-740). I strongly urge the IHS to \nissue this guidance document, and to be sensitive to the unique needs \nof Alaska Native villages, which differ from lower 48 non-Indian \ncommunities because of the land settlement under ANCSA.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee \nfor his support.\n\n\n                       lame deer health facility\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to commend the committee for funding the \nreplacement facility at Lame Deer, MT. The Lame Deer health care \nfacility was totally destroyed by fire last May. In these times of \nfiscal constraint, we were fortunate to be able to fund this much \nneeded replacement facility.\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify how the $13,500,000 cost was \ncalculated. In order to hold down costs, the Indian Health Service was \nable to use an existing design that can be used as the basis for \nconstruction of the replacement facility. Without this design and \nwithout the IHS undertaking the construction of this project, more than \n$2 million in additional funds would have been required.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. The cost for the replacement was \nbased upon the IHS using the existing design and doing the construction \nthemselves. Because of the urgent nature of this request and because \nthe tribe has no other health care resources within close proximity, \nthe committee responded to the dire need for a health facility at Lame \nDeer. We expect the IHS to move as expeditiously as possible to \ncomplete this much needed health facility. I strongly urge the tribe \nand the IHS to work within the funding limitations for this project.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the chairman of the Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee yield for question?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be delighted to yield to the Senator from Montana, \nSenator Burns.\n  Mr. BURNS. As the Chairman knows, I have been pursuing for a number \nof years funding for the Indians Into Psychology program. This program \nhelps train Native Americans in the field of clinical psychology and \nhas a service requirement that those who receive this training must \nwork on the reservations. As the chairman knows, mental illness \nproblems among native Americans are pervasive and devastating, and \nthere is great need for native Americans trained in the field of \npsychology to work on the reservations.\n  The chairman included $500,000 for this program, or a $300,000 \nincrease over last year's levels in the Senate bill as reported by the \ncommittee. This is a modest increase for a very important program and \nwould permit a second program site to be established. I understand that \nthe full $300,000 increase has been eliminated by the conference \naction. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, the Senator is correct. We were forced to eliminate \nthis funding without prejudice because of a very constrained spending \nceiling for the subcommittee.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand that the chairman concurs with me that this \nis an important program. Would the chairman join me and urge the \nDepartment and the Indian Health Service in identifying a reprogramming \nof funds to provide some level of increase for this program in order to \npermit the initiation of a second program site to be awarded \ncompetitively?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. It is my hope that the Department \nand the Indian Health Service will identify a source of funds to \nprovide an increase for this program early in the new fiscal year, \nfiscal year 1997 so that a second program site can be awarded \ncompetitively.\n\n\n       energy saving performance contracting in federal agencies\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nAlabama, the distinguished chairman of the Treasury, Postal Service, \nand General Government Subcommittee in a colloquy relating to saving \nenergy in Federal facilities.\n  In light of falling appropriations for undertaking energy efficiency \nprojects at Federal facilities, is it the opinion of the committee that \nFederal agencies should be utilizing private sector financing \nmechanisms such as energy saving performance contracting [ESPC] utility \nsponsored energy conservation measures [ECM] to achieve their \nlegislatively mandated targets for energy reduction?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, the committee supports the increased use of ESPC and \nECM to reduce energy use by Federal agencies to save taxpayer dollars \nand reduce environmental pollution.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It has been nearly 4 years since Federal agencies were \nauthorized to undertake ESPC and ECM at Federal facilities. In the \nmeantime, very few of these agreements have come to pass. I believe \nthat this is due to both institutional resistance and inertia. Mr. \nChairman, I have worked very hard during this year and last to provide \nsome legislatively directed incentive for agencies to more aggressively \nundertake these energy-saving methods, and have met with significant \nresistance.\n  Mr. President, I believe it's time we stop looking on idly, hoping \nthat one day agencies will rise to this challenge. I would like to ask \nthat the six agencies which use the most energy enter into a specific \nnumber of ESPC or ECM contracts during fiscal year 1997. The numbers \nthemselves represent a reasonable expectation for response, but ones \nwhich will result in a significant step forward for the use of ESPC and \nECM inside the Federal Government. They are: Department of Defense, 10 \ncontracts; General Services Administration, U.S. Postal Service, and \nDepartment of Energy, 8 contracts each; Department of Transportation \nand the Veterans Administration, 5 contracts each.\n  If we are to move this forward we should also ask that the agencies \nissue a short report to us within 90 days of enactment, as well as \nquarterly through the year to detail their progress in meeting these \ntargets.\n  Mr. SHELBY. The committee shares your sentiment that Federal agencies \nshould get moving toward greater use of ESPC and ECM. And they will now \nbe on notice that this is a desire of the committee and that we will be \nmonitoring their progress.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman. By taking these short steps, we \nwill gain some success in demonstrating the effectiveness of these \noutside financing mechanisms, while identifying legitimate \ninstitutional barriers with the intention of addressing those in the \nfuture and expanding use of ESPC and ECM to other Federal agencies.\n\n\n  emergency rehabilitation of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife \n                                 Refuge\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of \nthe Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief discussion of the \nuse of the emergency firefighting funding that is being provided to the \nDepartment of the Interior agencies.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to discuss this emergency funding with \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the administration has submitted a \nproposal to the Congress for additional funding of $50 million for the \nBureau of Land Management within the Department of the Interior to \nrespond to the severe fire season we've had this year.\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\nSubsequent to that request, the administration identified an additional \n$26.7 million in damages incurred by several Department of the Interior \nagencies, including the Fish and Wildlife Service. This request \nincludes $600,000 for the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in \nNew Mexico.\n  This past June, a wildfire consumed 4,100 acres of the Bosque del \nApache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico. It was the worst fire in \nthe 57-year history of the refuge.\n  The upland desert habitat in the burned area will recover naturally, \nbut 2,176 acres of native cottonwood/willow riparian forest habitat \nalong the Rio Grande River will not recover without management action. \nThe Fish and Wildlife Service needs the requested $600,000 in fiscal \nyear 1997 to make significant progress on these rehabilitation needs. \nThese funds are to be used for cottonwood forest rehabilitation.\n  This is a critical time because this riparian area harbors the \nhighest density and diversity of wildlife in the refuge. Without \nimmediate action, this area will revert to exotic salt cedar \nvegetation, which thrives in disturbed habitats and is fire tolerant. \nSince 1987, refuge personnel have been actively engaged in riparian \nrestoration efforts, successfully controlling over 1,000 acres of \nexotic salt cedar vegetation and reestablishing over 650 acres of \nnative cottonwood and willow habitat.\n  I would ask the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee if the \n$600,000 requested for cottonwood forest rehabilitation at the Bosque \ndel Apache National Wildlife Refuge is included in the final omnibus \nbill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, the omnibus bill includes the $600,000 requested for \nthe cottonwood forest rehabilitation work at the Bosque del Apache \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished chairman for his assistance \nin this matter. I will urge the Department to carry through with this \ninitiative which is so critical to saving the native habitat at the \nBosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico.\n\n\n                     montezuma creek health clinic\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter \nthat, while it may appear small, is of great importance to the Utah \nNavajo population of San Juan County in the southeastern part of Utah. \nThe matter involves the Montezuma Creek Health Clinic in Montezuma \nCreek, UT.\n  Over the past several years, my colleague Senator Hatch and I have \nworked with the Indian Health Service [IHS], the State of Utah, the \nlocal Utah Chapter of the Navajo Nation, the county of San Juan, and \nthe Navajo Nation in an effort to improve the delivery of health care \nservices in San Juan County.\n  In this region, which includes the Navajo Reservation in northern \nArizona and New Mexico, there are six IHS hospitals and 18 outpatient \nfacilities. Unfortunately, none of these facilities are located in \nUtah. In fact, the only IHS facility in the entire State of Utah is an \noutpatient facility located at Fort Duchesne nearly 350 miles from \nMontezuma Creek.\n  The need for the Montezuma Creek Clinic is clearly justifiable. It is \nthe population center for the eastern portion of the Utah Navajos. \nApproximately 6,000 Navajos live in this area; and, unfortunately, \ntheir health care needs are greatly underserved.\n  Although the building housing the Montezuma Creek Clinic is currently \nfunctional, it is, nevertheless, in poor condition. The facility has \nundergone repairs and currently is in the process of having its roof \nreplaced. Within the near future, the facility will eventually have to \nbe replaced in order to continue to provide care to an average of 65 \npatients per day.\n  The patchwork of repairs will no longer be a viable option.\n  Accordingly, it is our desire that, at the very least, $35,000 be \nprovided for a preliminary land study, and engineering and \narchitectural design for a new facility to replace the existing old \nstructure.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would yield, I want to thank my colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Bennett, for his remarks.\n  The clinic at Montezuma Creek, UT is absolutely essential in overall \ncontext of health care in this remote part of Utah and in this region \nof the country.\n  In fact, with the recent closing last month of Monument Valley \nHospital in San Juan County, the clinic is in even greater need by the \ncommunity especially now that there are fewer health providers in this \nlarge area.\n  Over the past several years, I have worked with the Indian Health \nService in efforts to improve health care services in this part of \nUtah. And, I must say that, compared to other States, the availability \nof IHS facilities and services for Utah Navajos in southeastern Utah is \nextremely deficient.\n  Senator Bennett and I want to correct this disparity.\n  That is why we need to act now.\n  I recognize that the IHS budget is limited. In that regard, I want to \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee as \nwell as on the Indian Affairs and Finance Committees in efforts to \nimprove the delivery of health care for Native Americans throughout the \ncountry.\n  One should go to some of these communities to see, first hand, the \npoverty and poor health conditions many native Americans tolerate. \nNative Americans suffer the highest rates of diabetes, tuberculosis, \nand fetal alcohol syndrome of any segment of the U.S. population in \nlarge part because they do not have access to adequate medical \ntreatment.\n  The $35,000 we are seeking is not a large amount of money. But, this \namount would be a significant commitment to the Navajo people of \nsouthern Utah and northern Arizona. It is a commitment I strongly \nbelieve we should fulfill.\n  Mr. GORTON. If Senator Bennett will yield further, I am aware of \nSenator Hatch's and Senator Bennett's interest and concern over the \nclinic at Montezuma Creek and their efforts ultimately to replace that \nfacility. I want to assure the Senators from Utah that I will work with \nthem to ensure that the health care needs of Utah's Navajos are met.\n  Should the Indian Health Service submit a request to reprogram a \nsmall amount of funds for a preliminary planning study of a satellite \nfacility at Montezuma Creek, I would consider carefully such a request. \nI emphasize, however, that such a request must be consistent with the \nHealth Care Facilities Priority System. Current funding constraints \nsimply do not allow for activities beyond the scope of the priority \nlist.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator for his consideration. It is my hope \nand strong desire that we can begin a more comprehensive effort by the \nIHS, the Navajo Nation and the State of Utah to improve the delivery of \nhealth care in this part of Utah.\n  I would also like to say that I believe the IHS is making a good \nfaith effort at improving the health care of native Americans in Utah. \nI appreciate the work and spirit of cooperation I have sensed over the \npast year from the IHS. I look forward to working with the IHS as well \nas with all parties at improving the health care for Utah Navajos.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I also want to thank the Senator from Washington for his \nconsideration. I would urge the IHS to work closely with the local \nNavajo Chapter as well as with San Juan County, the State of Utah, the \nUtah Navajo Trust Fund, and the Navajo Nation in this endeavor. Senator \nHatch and I strongly encourage all parties to work together, and to \nmaximize any federal dollars made available through this request with \nmatching funds.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his assistance on this matter.\n\n\n               doe/fossil energy cooperative r program\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Conrad and I wish to engage the \nchairman and ranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nin a colloquy regarding the Cooperative Research and Development \nProgram funded in the Department of Energy's fossil energy \nappropriation account.\n  In its action on the fiscal year 1997 Interior bill, H.R. 3662, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee recommended $6.2 million for the \nCooperative Research and Development Program. These funds are shared by \nthe University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center \n[UNDEERC] and the Western Research Institute [WRI] in Wyoming. The \nUNDEERC program is a leader in low-rank coal research in the United \nStates, and has cooperated on efforts\n\n[[Page S11917]]\n\nto use abundant low-rank coal through advanced clean coal technologies. \nAs the ranking member of the subcommittee is aware, UNDEERC has worked \nclosely with the expertise found at the Morgantown Energy Technology \nCenter [METC].\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct; UNDEERC and METC have worked \nclosely together in support of strategic fossil energy research \nobjectives. The partnership at UNDEERC, which involves cooperators from \nthe Federal Government, industry, and academia, serves as a model for \njointly sponsored research programs. The non-Federal partners in this \neffort contribute significant cost-sharing to conduct the programs at \nUNDEERC.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me add to what the Senator from West \nVirginia said. Of UNDEERC's funding for the jointly sponsored research \nprogram, 61 percent came from private sources in 1995. When individual \nbusinesses are willing to contribute real dollars to this effort, that \ndemonstrates strong private sector support for the work of the center \nand its significantly enhances the Federal investment. Since UNDEERC \nwas defederalized in 1983, the center has developed more than 400 \nprivate and public sector clients, some of whom have 20 or more \nindividual contracts. In 1995 alone, UNDEERC developed 175 contracts \nwith clients in 34 States and 8 foreign countries.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the chairman \nand ranking member of the subcommittee about the funding level for this \nprogram as recommended in the omnibus continuing resolution.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would respond to the Senator from North Dakota that the \nrecommendations for the fossil energy appropriation account contained \nin this legislation assume a funding level of $5.1 million for the \nCooperative Research and Development Program. While this is a decrease \nof $1.1 million from the funding level recommended in the Senate \nversion of the fiscal year 1997 Interior bill, it is an increase of \n$1.1 million above the amount recommended for this program in the \nHouse-passed fiscal year 1997 Interior bill. While the Senate sought to \nprotect the full amount recommended by the Appropriations Committee for \nthis program, it was not possible to retain the total increase included \nin the Senate bill because of the change in the subcommittee's \nallocation for purposes of reaching closure on the fiscal year 1997 \nInterior bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the chairman is absolutely correct. The net \nresult of the Interior bill portion included in this continuing \nresolution is that the subcommittee's allocation was essentially cut in \nhalf from the amount of resources available when the bill was marked up \nin the Senate. Thus, a number of programs which were increased in the \nSenate bill were not able to sustain the full amount of the proposed \nincrease in the final resolution. The chairman sought to protect as \nmany of these increases as possible.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Conrad and I would ask of the chairman and \nranking member if it would be possible to consider a reprogramming or \nsupplemental request from the Department of Energy that would restore \nthe final recommendation for the Cooperative Research and Development \nProgram to the fiscal year 1996 level, which is the same amount as was \nincluded in the Senate bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, if the Department of Energy were to submit \na reprogramming or supplemental request, the committee would give it \nevery consideration as expeditiously as possible. Under the committee's \nreprogramming guidelines, the Department has the flexibility to move up \nto $500,000, or 10 percent, without prior approval of the Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say to my good friends, the senators from North Dakota, \nthat I will do everything I can to ensure that any effort to increase \nthe funding for the fossil energy cooperative research and development \nprogram is considered promptly by the subcommittee. The chairman and I \nhave an excellent relationship in reviewing matters under the \njurisdiction of the subcommittee, and I am sure that he would seek to \nbe helpful if at all possible. I would inquire of the chairman if he \nwould agree that the Department of Energy should, at a minimum, review \nits unobligated balances now that fiscal year 1996 has drawn to a \nclose, and see if there are any funds that could possibly be considered \nfor a reprogramming without affecting adversely the conduct of other \nongoing activities in the fossil energy appropriation account.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia makes an \nexcellent suggestion. While I appreciate the desire of the Senators \nfrom North Dakota to see additional funding provided for this program, \nI am also sensitive to the many other competing demands within the \nFossil Energy Program. Overall, this appropriations account is funded \n$52.3 million below last year's level, and some programs are being \nterminated or slowed down to comply with the subcommittee's constrained \nallocation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member. I \nlook forward to working with them to see what actions might be possible \nto keep this exceptional Cooperative Research and Development Program \nat UNDEERC functioning without major disruptions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would also like to express my appreciation to the \nchairman and ranking member for working with us to see what can be done \nto secure full funding for this outstanding cooperative research \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11886-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11917-S11922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FLOWERING TREE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to debate fiscal \nyear 1997 funding levels for the Department of Health and Human \nServices [HHS], I would like to take a moment to discuss my concerns \nregarding a pending decision of the Department of Health and Human \nServices that would affect an important program in South Dakota. This \ndecision deserves the Senate's attention.\n  The program affected is called Flowering Tree. It is a nationally \nrecognized alcoholism treatment program that has been operating on the \nPine Ridge Indian Reservation in my home State of South Dakota. This \nalcohol treatment program was backed by a 5-year Federal grant. It is \nonly one of four substance abuse treatment programs nationally that \nallows Native American women to continue caring for their children \nwhile they receive treatment. The Flowering Tree program at Pine Ridge \nserves the second largest Indian reservation in the United States. On a \nreservation with 87 percent unemployment, widespread poverty and \nsubstance abuse, Flowering Tree has been a vital component of the Pine \nRidge community.\n  In spite of Flowering Tree's success in combating generational \nalcohol abuse, it was brought to my attention that HHS intends to pull \nfederal funding from Flowering Tree, which would force the program to \nclose its doors. The program is funded through the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA]. The loss of Federal \nsupport for the Flowering Tree program would be very harmful to those \nparticipating in it. Flowering Tree keeps families together and helps \nto build a better future for both mothers and their children by \ntreating alcohol abuse. The program is working. If Flowering Tree is \nforced to close, many of the children assisted by the facility could \nlose their families and be referred for adoption, foster care or group \nhomes. To say this would be unfortunate is a gross understatement. The \nbreakup of families, combined with the loss of a program that offers a \nreal way out of substance addiction, would be a devastating double-\npunch for the mothers currently participating or waiting to participate \nin the program.\n  I am troubled by the Department of Health and Human Services plan to \nterminate assistance to Flowering Tree. The pending decision apparently \nis based on anticipated fiscal year 1997 funding levels. The Senate \nsoon will consider a bill that would significantly increase funding for \nsubstance abuse treatment programs. Flowering Tree's funding request \nfor fiscal year 1997 is only $688,913. I have written a letter to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, urging her to \nreverse the Department's decision. Last week, I received an initial \nresponse from David Mactas, Director of the Center for Substance Abuse \nTreatment. Mr. Mactas explained the rationale for the Department's \ndecision to terminate funding for Flowering Tree.\n\n[[Page S11918]]\n\nHowever, this week, my staff learned from staff at HHS that the \ndecision to terminate funding was put on hold, pending the outcome of \nthe bill that could fund this program.\n  Mr. President, I see on the floor my colleague from Pennsylvania, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education, Senator Specter. I know my \nfriend is working hard on the fiscal year 1997 spending bill that funds \nsubstance abuse programs. I hope my colleague had the opportunity to \nhear my earlier comments and I would yield to him for any comments he \nmay wish to make.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend, the Senator from South Dakota, for \nyielding. The Senator raises some understandable concerns regarding the \nfuture of the Flowering Tree Program on the Pine Ridge Indian \nReservation. I agree with the statement of my colleague from South \nDakota that the bill would provide sufficient funds for the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration's budget.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania agree the \nAppropriations Committee's proposed funding level should provide HHS \nwith the funding necessary to continue supporting Flowering Tree?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes. I believe this funding level should be adequate to \nprovide support for Flowering Tree's request for FY 1997. In fact, the \nAppropriations Committee has provided sufficient funds to continue all \n13 residential women and children grants that were proposed to be \ndiscontinued by HHS at the end of the current fiscal year. The \ncommittee expects these projects to be fully funded in FY 1997. The \nSenator from South Dakota has made a very compelling case for Flowering \nTree and I hope this information is helpful to my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I want to thank my dear friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania for all his hard work and dedication on the Appropriations \nCommittee. I appreciate very much the information he has provided. I \nalso commend the Senator for his work to ensure adequate funding levels \nfor substance abuse programs. I am pleased Congress intends to provide \nthe funding necessary for Flowering Tree to continue fighting \nalcoholism and securing a brighter future for mothers and their \nchildren. Given this information, I hope Secretary Shalala and her \ndepartment will do the right thing and continue to support the \nFlowering Tree program in Pine Ridge, SD.\n\n\n                                joblinks\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I understand that the omnibus \nappropriations bill includes report language instructing the Labor \nDepartment to follow the recommendations for demonstration projects \ncontained in Senate Report No. 104-368. The Senate report instructs the \nDepartment of Labor to give full and fair consideration to the Joblinks \nEmployment Transportation Center.\n  This Joblinks Center is an important initiative because it will help \nStates to meet the work requirements of welfare reform by coordinating \njob referral and creation activities with available transportation \nresources. This will include development of a data base and technical \nmaterials, and onsite technical assistance. Second, the center will \nconduct demonstrations in 10 States--of which at least 4 are \npredominately rural--on coordination of transportation and job referral \nand creation programs. Third, to take advantage of the employment \nopportunities available in transportation, the Joblinks Center will \ncreate a training institute to train and certify skills in driving, \ndispatching, and operating transit systems. This make it possible for \nindividuals to leave welfare and become employees in the Nation's \ntransit industry or in a related field.\n  My colleague, Senator Harkin, and I developed this initiative \nbecause, in many rural areas like in South Dakota and Iowa as well as \nin inner-city neighborhoods, unemployed and low-income people are \nstranded. Transportation is the vital link that connects people to jobs \nand can help them gain independence. Yet, in many communities, \ntransportation assistance has not kept pace with shifting population \npatterns, changing communities and employment opportunities. In many \ninstances, people simply cannot get to jobs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the tough work requirements of the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act make it \nimperative that economically disadvantaged people have better access to \nemployment opportunities. Among the improvements that must be made in \neasing the transition from welfare to work is in transportation. We \nmust find ways to better coordinate our transportation systems with our \nefforts to train and employ individuals on public assistance.\n  As I travel around my State, the two largest barriers to work that I \nrepeatedly hear about are child care and transportation. The Joblinks \nCenter will help States and localities improve transportation systems \nfor people who want to become and remain self-sufficient.\n  This is a very important initiative. We hope that the Labor \nDepartment will promptly get to work on funding this important \nactivity. If people cannot get to jobs, they cannot work.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader and my colleague, the ranking member of the Labor, HHS, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, for bringing this initiative to \nthe Appropriations Committee. I agree that we need to do more to assist \nlow-income individuals to get to work. I think that this is an \nimportant project that may aid inner cities as well as rural areas, \nwhich are very important to me given the large number of rural areas in \nPennsylvania. I agree with my colleagues that the Labor Department \nshould give every consideration possible to this proposal.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, my colleague from \nPennsylvania. I appreciate his efforts to work with us on this \ninitiative. If welfare reform is truly to occur, then we need to enable \nmore single parents to work. I know that's not easy, particularly for \nparents with young children. But, I believe that enhancing \ntransportation assistance may be one key to enabling these parents to \nmake it on their own.\n\n\n        chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome [cfids]\n\n  Mr. HARKINS. Would the distinguished senator from Pennsylvania engage \nin a colloquy to clarify certain congressional intent regarding chronic \nfatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, also known as CFIDS?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I would.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The first matter pertains to a name change for the \nillness now referred to as chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction \nsyndrome, [CFIDS], or chronic fatigue syndrome [CFS]. There is a \nconsensus in the CFIDS community that the name chronic fatigue and \nimmune dysfunction syndrome does not adequately describe the complex \nnature of the illness. Is it the committee's intent to agree with \nlanguage contained in the House Labor, HHS report to the appropriations \nbill calling upon the Secretary of Health and Human Service to convene \na committee for the purpose of examining this issue and to report back \nwithin 6 months of this bill's enactment with recommendations for a new \nscientific name or eponym that more appropriately describes the \nillness?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, it is the intention of the committee to concur with \nthe House report language concerning a name change.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President. The Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention recently convened a panel of experts on CFIDS for the \npurpose of reviewing CDC's current CFIDS program and the direction for \nfuture research. The review panel, made up of experts in infectious \ndiseases, internal medicine and epidemiology, met over the course of 2 \ndays and issued a report containing specific recommendations to the \nDirector of the National Center for Infectious Diseases [NCID] and \nother Center staff. My understanding is that those recommendations have \nbeen well received by the NCID staff. Would the committee express its \nsupport for the review panel's recommendations, which include: First, \nestablishment of a repository for brain tissue obtained from well-\ncharacterized CFS patients--upon death--for use in etiology studies; \nsecond, proceeding with planned etiology studies utilizing cutting-edge \ntechnology, including representational difference analysis [RDA]; and \nthird, augmenting existing staff in the Division of Viral and \nRickettsial Diseases with\n\n[[Page S11919]]\n\nan FTE with the demonstrated expertise in neuroendrocrinology and \nneuropsychology to guide case control studies of defects in the HPA \naxis?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The recent review by a panel of experts of the Centers \nfor Disease Control's past work and future direction in CFIDS was a \nsignificant step forward in the Federal response to CFIDS. The \ncommittee applauds that initiative and urges the CDC to carry out the \nrecommendations expeditiously.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President, for your support of these \nimportant CFIDS provisions.\n\n\n                        section 2241 in title ii\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, section 2241 in title II of H.R. 4278, the \nomnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997 that is before us \ntoday, contains a technical drafting error that could have an \nunintended detrimental effect on foreign banks. Inadvertently, section \n2241 as currently drafted may delete the Comptroller of Currency's \ncurrent authority in 12 U.S.C. 72 to waive the citizenship requirements \nfor directors of national banks if a bank is a foreign bank affiliate. \nUnder current law that has been in effect since the International \nBanking Act of 1978 was enacted, the Comptroller has had the authority \nto waive the citizenship requirement for up to a minority of national \nbank directors if the bank is a subsidiary or affiliate of a foreign \nbank. Section 2241 could be read to inadvertently repeal that \nlongstanding authority. Section 2241 was intended to expand the \nComptroller's authority to waive requirements for national bank \ndirectors and was not intended to repeal existing authority to waive \ncitizenship requirements. I hope legislation correcting this error will \nbe introduced and passed in the next Congress but, in the mean time, \nthe OCC should treat the citizenship waiver authority as continuing in \neffect and should not do anything that would require foreign bank \nsubsidiaries or affiliates to restructure their boards.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct. \nSection 2241 was not in anyway intended to repeal or change the \nComptroller's existing authority to grant waivers to foreign bank \naffiliates under 12 U.S.C. 72. I join with my colleague in stating that \nit is the intent of this body that the OCC should treat any change to \nits current exemption authority as a drafting error and should not take \nany action to implement the change. I will work with my colleague in \nthe 105th Congress to correct the drafting error made by section 2241.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I too, would like to join with my \ncolleagues in support of a technical amendment to section 2241 after we \nreconvene. I agree that any change that section 2241 would make to \nforeign bank operations in the United States is unintentional and is in \nerror. I think that my colleagues are correct to instruct the OCC that \nthis change is an error and should not be implemented.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, title II of the omnibus appropriations \nbill is comprised of several bills that the Senate Banking Committee \nconsidered and reported this Congress. Title II contains critical \nlegislation to stabilize the deposit insurance funds, commonly referred \nto as BIF/SAIF. Title II also contains language based on our \ncommittee's lender liability, regulatory relief and fair credit \nreporting legislation.\n  Our actions today will ensure that the taxpayer will not pay one \nadditional dollar for cleaning up the savings and loan crises. The \npackage we are considering today represents a significant achievement. \nThis time Congress will take the responsible action and resolve a \npending problem before another S crisis erupts.\n  Mr. President, Congress needs to take action now to resolve the \ndifficulties facing the Savings Association Insurance Fund [SAIF]. The \nthrift industry has recovered from the dire financial straits it faced \nin the late 1980's. However, the SAIF, which insures thrift deposits, \nis in extremely weak financial condition. Currently, the SAIF holds \nonly half the capital it is required to hold under statute. The Bank \nInsurance Fund [BIF] was fully capitalized in 1995, permitting bank \ninsurance premiums to drop to near zero. SAIF members continue to pay \nsignificantly higher rates which means that thrifts will continue to \ntry and move deposits out of SAIF. The possible shrinkage of SAIF also \nraises the probability of a default on the $800 million in Financing \nCorporation [FICO] bond interest that thrifts now pay.\n  The BIF/SAIF proposal requires institutions with SAIF deposits to pay \na one-time special assessment to full capitalize the SAIF. This special \nassessment will ensure that thrifts pay their fair share of the costs \nand will raise $4.1 billion in collections. Beginning January 1, 1997, \nall FDIC-insured institutions will pay the $800 million annual interest \npayments due on FICO bonds. Spreading the FICO burden will eliminate \nthe incentive for SAIF deposits incentive to leave the fund. By \nremoving the incentive to shift from SAIF to BIF, SAIF will be a more \nstable fund. Bank regulators will also have the authority to prevent \nSAIF deposits from being shifted in the BIF for purposes of evading \nSAIF assessments. However, Congress does not intend that regulators \ninappropriately use this authority to prevent institutions from \naccurately communicating with either existing or potential customers \nregarding the products and services offered by their institutions.\n\n  In the long term, the BIF/SAIF provisions would merge the BIF and the \nSAIF to protect the smaller, less diversified SAIF fund with the \nbroader membership of the BIF. The merger will be dependent on \nsubsequent Congressional action to address the complex issues \nsurrounding the future of the thrift charter. I am hopeful that the \nnext Congress will diligently work to resolve these issues.\n  Mr. President, by accepting these banking provisions, this Congress \ncan also act to lower the cost of regulation to financial institutions \nand their consumers. The committee-reported regulatory relief \nprovisions go a long way in relieving banks of some of the bureaucratic \nredtape that increases operating costs for banks and other lenders. \nRegulatory micromanagement is significant because higher costs for \nlenders drive up the price of financial products, and ultimately drive \nup the cost for consumers. The mountain of regulatory redtape that \nconfronts banks is the cumulative result of years of legislation. Laws \nwere passed to achieve any of a number of legitimate private policy \nconcerns. Nevertheless, many of these laws are regulatory overkill. \nMany of the laws that are amended or repealed by this title do not help \nto accomplish an intended goal. Other provisions are being amended or \nrepealed because they impose compliance costs that outweigh the \ndiscernible benefit. As a result, banks and other financial \ninstitutions are overburdened with regulatory mandates that bear no \nreasonable relationship to safety and soundness, consumer protection or \nprotection of the deposit insurance funds.\n  Title II eliminates many arcane regulatory burdens that just don't \nmake sense. For example, our language eliminates branch application \nrequirements for ATM's. These applications are time consuming for banks \nto prepare and for the regulators to approve. Our language also \neliminates the 90 day prior-notice requirement for moving a branch \nwithin the same neighborhood. Title II also removes the 7 percent \ngrowth cap on nonbank banks. These provisions will allow banks and \nother lenders to operate more efficiently and cheaply. They will help \nto defer the costs that banks will incur as part of the BIF/SAIF \npackage.\n  Title II also contains fair credit reporting reform language. These \nprovisions will ensure that mistakes in credit reports will be \ncorrected quickly and properly. Consumer credit reports play an \nessential role in the consumer finance markets. These reports allow \nlenders to make informed credit-granting decisions quickly and cheaply. \nHowever, if credit reports are inaccurate, both the consumer and lender \nlose; the consumer loses an opportunity to obtain needed financing, and \nthe lender loses potential business. The provisions of title II will \nhelp make sure that credit reports are accurate, and that any \ndiscovered inaccuracies are corrected as soon as practicable.\n  The provisions of title II will also promote greater privacy for the \ninformation in credit reports by assuring that credit report \ninformation is not distributed wily-nilly, but rather, only to persons \nwith narrowly defined legitimate purposes for using the information. \nThis law will provide significant new privacy protections for \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S11920]]\n\nWhile access to credit information is necessary for a number of \nlegitimate business reasons, and credit reporting allows consumers to \nobtain prompt credit at low cost, the privacy of consumer credit \ninformation must be jealously guarded. Title II will help promote this \nimportant privacy goal.\n  Title II also includes the Asset Conservation, Lender Liability and \nDeposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996. This legislation is based on \nS. 394, a bill that I introduced at the beginning of this Congress. The \nlender liability provisions contained in title II represent the results \nof extensive negotiations among the administration, the lending \nindustry and the interested committees of both Houses. These \nenvironmental liability provisions will ensure greater access to credit \nfor small business and for environmental cleanup efforts; they will \nhelp fuel economic growth without endangering the environment. It is a \nclear demonstration of what can be accomplished, on a bipartisan basis, \nwhen the administration and the Congress work together to craft \ncommonsense solutions to real problems. I would particularly like to \nthank Senators Chafee and Smith, the chairman of the Environment \nCommittee and its Superfund Subcommittee, respectively, for their \ncooperation and assistance with this legislation--they were both \ninstrumental in resolving this major public policy issue.\n\n  The environmental title clarifies the liability of both secured \nparties and fiduciaries under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or Superfund. Court decisions \nhave eviscerated the so-called secured lender exemption contained in \nthe original Superfund law and created uncertainty as to the liability \nof lenders for cleanup costs. As a result, lenders have been less \nwilling to make loans to small businesses and farms in order to avoid \nthe risk of unlimited liability under CERCLA. Lenders do not make loans \nto certain types of business because they fear potential liability for \nenvironmental damage if they try to protect themselves against default \nthrough the foreclosure process. Court decisions also have raised the \nprospect of fiduciaries being held personally liable for environmental \nproblems on properties held in trust, even when the fiduciary did not \ncreate, or contribute to, the problem. Title II clarifies and confirms \nthe original secured creditor exemption. For lenders and fiduciaries, \nthis bill does not remove liability; it simply establishes bright lines \ntests for liability. These tests should promote greater understanding \namong all lenders of the ``do's and don'ts'' of environmental \nliability. As a result of this greater understanding, lenders should \nbecome constructively involved in environmental cleanups.\n  This legislation provides the certainty needed by all parties--\nlenders, fiduciaries, guarantors, insurers, university foundations, \npension administrators as well as a host of borrowers. Federal agencies \nsuch as the FDIC also stand in the position of lenders as well as \nreceivers of property and will benefit from the certainty provided by \nthis legislation. For the most part, this legislation codifies the \nterms of rules of the Environmental Protection Agency on Superfund and \non the Solid Waste Disposal Act's underground storage tank provisions.\n  Some sections of the bill merit particular attention.\n  The new section 101(20)(G)(iv) defines the term ``lender'' by \nproviding examples of institutions or activities that qualify an \ninstitution as a lender. This laundry list is joined together by the \nword and between items (VII) and (VIII). Readers of this provision \nshould not be misled or interpret the use of and as establishing an 8-\nstep test--a person may qualify as a lender if it meets any of the \nrequirements provided in (G) (I) through (VII), not all of these \nrequirements. This is just common sense; otherwise, it would be \nimpossible for any institution to qualify as a lender. For instance, \nnone of the Government-sponsored enterprises described in subparagraph \n(VI), can also qualify as an insured depository institution under \nsubparagraph (I) or as an insured credit union under subparagraph \n(II)--it just is not possible under current Federal banking law. These \nprovisions should be read as separate tests for qualifying as a lender, \nand this drafting error should be addressed as soon as possible.\n  This legislation includes a new CERCLA section 107(n)(3). This new \nsection is intended to make clear that the standard for liability under \nCERCLA for fiduciaries for their negligent acts is the common-law \nstandard for negligence when acting in a fiduciary capacity. The new \nsection 107(n)(4) clarifies that if a fiduciary stays within the \nspecified safe harbors, the fiduciary will not face personal liability; \nrather, the underlying trust or estate would be liable under the \ngeneral CERCLA liability rules contained in section 107(a).\n  The definition of fiduciaries, in the new section 107(n)(5) which \nrefers to indenture agreements, participations in debt securities and \nlike activities, is intended to describe the kinds of activities \ncontemplated by the Trust Indenture Act. Trust indentures facilitate \ncorporate borrowings and are similar to mortgages because they provide \nsecurity for repayment of investors. The trustee protects the interest \nof security holders who have purchased bonds issued by an obligor \ndeveloping a project. As with other trustees, indentured trustees face \nless choice than lenders on whether or not to take possession of the \nproperty, as such duties may be required in connection with fulfilling \nthe trustee's fiduciary obligations to the security holders. Because \nsuch trust indentures do not arise under the same common law rules as \ntraditional trusts, the language in the new section 107(n)(5)(A)(X) of \nCERCLA simply assures that these trusts receive the same guidance as \nprovided for other types of trusts.\n\n  The language in the new section 107(n)(8)(B) of CERCLA (regarding \nclaims against nonemployee agents or independent contractors retained \nby fiduciaries) refers to such parties engaged in property management \nor hazardous waste disposal and does not infer that actions should be \navailable against lawyers, accountants and other parties who are \nretained by a fiduciary but without responsibility for decisionmaking \non hazardous materials.\n  The language referring to a lender as one who holds indicia of \nownership should not be interpreted to mean that a lender who gives up \nindicia of ownership, either by transferring a security interest to a \nthird party or by relinquishing the interest, loses the protection of \nthe exemption. Under section 101(20)(F)(ii), if a security holder gives \nup their interest and is subsequently joined as a party in a suit, the \nformer security interest holder will enjoy the same protection enjoyed \nwhile holding the security interest.\n  New section 101(20)(G)(I) is intended to clarify that the defined \nterm extension of credit includes the making or renewal of any loan, \nthe granting of a line of credit or extending credit in any manner, \nsuch as an advance by means of an overdraft or the issuance of a \nstandby letter of credit, in addition to the two specifically listed \ntypes of lease financing transactions.\n  This legislation makes the same lender and fiduciary provisions that \napply under Superfund law applicable to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, \nand the underground storage tank provisions of that act. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency should move expeditiously to provide \nguidance consistent with the statutory language for fiduciaries, who \nare not currently addressed in section 9003(h)(9) or in the current EPA \nunderground storage tank rule.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will encourage environmental \ncleanups by the private sector, and help to put farm land and urban \nproperties back to full use. Lenders will have clear guidance as to the \npotential environmental liability they face, and, hopefully, small \nbusinesses will be able to obtain credit more easily. Fiduciaries \nreceiving property will be able to operate with greater certainty in \nundertaking their duties.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all of my colleagues on the Senate \nBanking Committee for their hard work on the legislation incorporated \nin title II. This title contains a significant portion of the \ncommittee's agenda for this year. The committee has worked diligently \nto consider and pass a challenging legislative agenda this Congress. \nThis agenda included Securities litigation reform, BIF/SAIF \nlegislation, Regulatory relief, Fair Credit Reporting Reform, \nEnvironmental Lender Liability and Securities Regulatory Reform.\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\n  The Committee has worked effectively, on a bipartisan basis, and I \ncommend the entire membership of the committee. I would like to thank \nthe ranking member, Senator Sarbanes for his cooperation. I would also \nlike to thank Senators Shelby and Mack for their stewardship of \nregulatory reform, and Senators Bond and Bryan for their leadership on \nFair Credit.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support these banking measures \nwhich will strengthen our Nation's financial system and protect our \ntaxpayers.\n\n\n                         regulatory accounting\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I support the regulatory accounting \nprovision that Senator Stevens added as section 645 of the Treasury-\nPostal Appropriations bill, H.R. 3756. I am pleased that this provision \nwas added to the omnibus appropriations bill. This provision requires \nthe Office of Management and Budget to provide Congress with a report \nincluding estimates of the total annual costs and benefits of Federal \nregulatory programs; impacts of Federal rules on the private sector, \nState and local government, and the Federal Government; a more detailed \nanalysis of the costs and benefits of rules costing $100 million or \nmore, and recommendations to make regulatory programs more cost-\neffective. I am pleased that this amendment employs the term ``rule'' \nwhich is defined in section 551 of title V, United States Code. This \nwill insure that this report is, indeed, a comprehensive analysis of \nthe costs and benefits of regulation in the broadest sense, including \nlegislative rules, interpretative rules, guidance documents, and the \nlike. In addition, under the amendment, OMB must provide the public \nnotice and an opportunity to comment on the draft report--its \nsubstance, methodologies, and recommendations. In the final report, OMB \nmust summarize the public comments.\n  I share Senator Stevens' view that the public has the right to know \nthe costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs. Congress also \nmust have this information to improve agency performance. The total \nannual cost of Federal regulatory programs is estimated at $677 billion \nthis year. These costs are passed on to the public, and the tab exceeds \n$6000 for the average American household. While we have made progress \nin our struggle to balance the budget for tax-and-spend programs, we \nare just breaking ground for imposing accountability on the regulatory \nprocess. It is long overdue. That is why I sponsored regulatory reform \nlegislation that included regulatory accounting last year.\n  The regulatory accounting report should be a useful tool for \nCongress. Subsection 645(a)(1) requires OMB to estimate the total \nannual costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs. A report from \nthe U.S. Business Administration, ``The Changing Burden of \nRegulation,'' estimates that these costs will be about $688 billion \nnext year. Those total annual costs (and the benefits) encompass \nimpacts felt both from upcoming rules, as well as older rules that will \ncontinue to impose costs and benefits this coming fiscal year. OMB \nshould quantify costs and benefits to the extent feasible, and provide \nthe most plausible estimate. Benefits (and costs) that cannot be \nquantified should be described in qualitative terms.\n  To generate this information, OMB should draw upon the wealth of \nstudies and reports already done, including the work of Tom Hopkins and \nBob Hahn Where there are gaps, OMB must supplement existing \ninformation. To conserve its resources, OMB should issue guidelines to \nthe agencies to gather the needed information, as OMB does for the \nfiscal budget process. Where detailed information on the costs and \nbenefits of individual programs can be produced, it should be presented \nto Congress. The public comment period should help OMB generate \ninformation and make most plausible estimates of costs and benefits.\n  By September 1997, OMB must provide Congress with a credible and \nreliable accounting statement on the regulatory process. This report \nshould demonstrate the costs and benefits of various regulatory \nprograms. It should highlight those programs or program elements that \nare inefficient, and it should provide recommendations to reform them.\n  In conclusion, I would like to point out that this effort to enact a \nregulatory accounting requirement is not a partisan one. Originally, \nthe provision was part of S. 291, a comprehensive regulatory reform \nbill that was reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nyear when I was chairman by a unanimous 15-to-0 vote. This effort is, \nnot withstanding repeated misstatements, not designed to roll back \nprogress achieved through regulation but is rather intended to assess \nwhere we are and allow us to achieve more good for society at less \ncost. It is time we found out how efficiently we are achieving our \nlegislative goals through regulation.\n\n\n                           mark van de water\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as we debate this omnibus appropriations \nbill, I want to acknowledge the staff that have worked so hard drafting \nthese appropriations bills. They have been working night and day on \nthis compromise bill. In particular, I would like to note Senator \nHatfield's deputy staff director for the Appropriations Committee, Mark \nVan de Water.\n  Many pundits said that this omnibus fiscal year 1997 bill was not \npossible. They said that the Federal Government would have to operate \non a 6-month continuing resolution that uses spending formulas. But, \nbehind the scenes, Senator Hatfield and his staff worked long and hard \nto develop a basis for compromise. And, for the last few weeks, we all \nworked around the clock to conclude the negotiations that made this \nbill possible. The success of this process and the reality of this bill \nare due, in no small part, to the efforts of our Appropriations \nCommittee's deputy staff director, Mark Van de Water.\n  Mark is a graduate of St. Lawrence University in New York where he \nstudied political science and economics. He has worked on the Hill \nsince 1986. From 1991 through 1994, he served on the committee staff as \nthe minority clerk for the District of Columbia appropriations bill. I \ncame to know him as the man who handled Senator Hatfield's interests in \nour Commerce, Justice and State appropriations bill. Specifically, he \nensured that Oregon's interests were protected in such diverse areas as \nsalmon restoration, NOAA's oceanic research, and Federal law \nenforcement. In January 1995, Mark became our committee's deputy staff \ndirector and J. Keith Kennedy's right hand man.\n  Since January 1995, we have been able to count on Mark as a force of \nmoderation and decency on the Committee. He continued to operate in his \nstraight-forward, bipartisan fashion even in the winter and spring of \n1995, when our Appropriations Committee did not. In September 1995, he \nworked with my staff to develop compromises and a Hatfield/Hollings \namendment that allowed the Commerce, Justice, and State bill to move \nforward and kept the bill from being recommitted to the Committee. Mark \ncontinued to watch out for programs that were of special interest to \nChairman Hatfield, like aid to the poor through the Legal Services \nCorporation and research of the Pacific Ocean through the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  Too often we overlook the career professionals who make this \ninstitution and this appropriations process work. In Mark Van de Water \nthis institution is lucky to have an individual who carries out his job \nwith the same professionalism and conscientiousness that typifies our \nchairman, Mark O. Hatfield. I, for one, would like to acknowledge and \nthank him for his contributions to the Appropriations Committee and the \nSenate.\n\n\n                        Section 318--Log Exports\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about a \nprovision of this bill which is very troublesome to me. I am talking \nabout Section 318 of this bill which deals with Forest Service \nadministration of log exports.\n  I view it as unfortunate and unfair to my constituents that the \nprohibitions in Section 318 appear once again in bill language, as they \ndo in the current year appropriations bill. I did not object to the \nprovision the first time, but its re-appearance in the fiscal year 1997 \nbill does raise serious concerns. I know the chairman is aware of these \nconcerns.\n  Section 318 is the cause of a great deal of controversy within the \nforest products industry because it prevents\n\n[[Page S11922]]\n\nimplementation of the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief \nAct of 1990.\n  Under the law, a review of sourcing areas relative to the export of \nlogs is required after individual sourcing areas have been in place for \n5 years. Sourcing areas are geographically defined areas within which \ncompanies which export their own private logs are permitted to also \npurchase Federal timber. Sourcing areas are required to be \n``economically and geographically separated'' from those areas which \nproduce export logs. The purpose is to prevent so-called \n``substitution''--the illegal replacement of exported private logs with \nlogs from Federal lands.\n  The Forest Service had begun the 5-year review, but the prohibition \nin the 1996 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation bill stopped it \ncold. Section 318 delays it further, at least through fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. President, it is my impression is that there is a fairly broad \nbelief in the industry that the current sourcing area boundaries are \nillogical in many respects. Neither can they be properly monitored to \nprevent substitution. Sharply reduced Federal timber supply has \ndramatically changed historic market patterns and log flow. Companies \ndesperate for logs to keep their mills operating are buying logs in \ndistant locations and hauling them hundreds and hundreds of miles.\n  It may well be the case that sourcing areas are already obsolete. \nUnder the circumstances of today's log market, it is difficult to \nimagine how log export zones can be kept ``economically and \ngeographically separated,'' to quote the law, from sourcing areas.\n  One way to find out is to permit the Forest Service to reopen public \ncomment and proceed with a review of sourcing areas as the law \nrequires. That is what should happen. However, it will not, because of \nSection 318.\n  So, I intend to take some jurisdiction on this issue in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and open the record myself through \nhearings and testimony in the next Congress. The current state of \naffairs begs for change, and those changes must not be indefinitely \ndelayed.\n  I regret that I differ with my colleague from Washington, Senator \nGorton, on this matter. But I know I can count on him to cooperate in \nreaching an equitable solution. He has already indicated he wishes to \naccomplish the same.\n  This concludes my remarks regarding Section 318.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11917-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11922-S11936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments of \n1995 goes to the heart of the safety and security of the citizens of \nthe United States. Each of us relies on the police officers and fire \nfighters in our community to protect our families, and to keep us safe.\n  This provision allows State and local public safety agencies to set \nmandatory retirement and maximum hiring ages for their police and fire \nfighters--the same authority the Federal Government already has with \nrespect to Federal police officers and firefighters.\n  If police officers and firefighters cannot adequately perform their \nduties, people die and people get hurt--and the officers themselves are \nendangered. As one fire fighter put it,\n  ``Firefighters and police officers must work as a team. We depend on \nthe other members of our crew to have the strength and savvy to save \nour life if the need arises. If we are unable to do our job, people \ndie.''\n  This provision provides a necessary, narrow and appropriate exemption \nfrom the Age Discrimination in Employment Act for State and local \npublic safety officers--necessary and appropriate because numerous \nmedical studies have found that age directly affects an individual's \nability to perform the duties of a public safety officer.\n  Reflexes, sight and other physical capabilities decline with age, \nwhile the risk of sudden incapacitation--heart attacks and strokes for \nexample--increases six-fold between ages 40 and 60. Although \nfirefighters over 50 comprise only one-seventh of the total number of \nfirefighters, they account for one-third of all firefighter deaths.\n\n  The Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments of 1995 gives State \nand local governments the same right to set mandatory retirement ages \nfor their police and firefighters as the Federal Government.\n  I want to emphasize this point. We in Congress already made the \ndecision to allow mandatory retirement ages for Federal public safety \nofficers. This amendment simply extends that same right to State and \nlocal governments.\n  And, this provision merely allows State and local governments to set \nmandatory retirement and maximum hiring ages if they so choose--it is \nnot a mandate.\n  The Federal Government has deemed mandatory retirement ages necessary \nto provide for the safety and security of the Federal firefighters and \npolice officers and the citizens they protect--State and local \ngovernments should be able to make that same decision.\n  The Federal police officers, agents, and firefighters covered by \nmandatory retirement ages, include: the U.S. Park Police; the Federal \nBureau of Investigation; the Department of Justice law enforcement \npersonnel; the District of Columbia firefighters; the U.S. Forest \nService firefighters; the Central Intelligence Agency; and Federal \nfirefighters.\n  The Capitol Police--the men and women who protect the Members of \nCongress--have a mandatory retirement age.\n  All too often in the past, Congress has treated itself differently \nthan other Americans. With the passage of the Congressional \nAccountability Act, this Congress made it clear that it is committed to \nending disparate treatment. Every Senator who voted for the \nCongressional Accountability Act should vote for this bill.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration recently extended it's mandatory \nretirement age of 60 to all pilots that fly 10 or more passengers to \nincrease safety on commuter planes.\n  These pilots take twice yearly physicals, they have a copilot at \ntheir side ready to take the controls if anything happens, and still \nthey must retire at age 60. After age 60, the risk of incapacitation \nbecomes too great--too many lives are at risk in the air. These same \nlives are at risk on the ground if our police and firefighters are \nunable to do their job--and all too often, our police and firefighters \ndon't have a copilot waiting to assist in an arrest or a burning \nbuilding.\n  As a general rule, the Age Discrimination Act prohibits employers \nfrom discriminating against workers solely on the basis of age, and \ngenerally prohibits the use of mandatory retirement and minimum hiring \nages.\n  Police officers and firefighters and all public employees were exempt \nfrom the Age Discrimination in Employment Act until a 1983 court ruling \nplaced public employees under the act. State and local governments were \nthen required to either prove in court that mandatory retirement and \nminimum hiring ages for police and firefighters were bona fide \noccupational qualifications [BFOQ's] reasonably necessary for the \nnormal operation of the business or else eliminate them.\n\n  Although this approach sounds reasonable, courts in some \njurisdictions ruled limits permissible, while identical limits were \nheld impermissible in other jurisdictions. For example, the Missouri \nHighway Patrol's minimum hiring age of 32 was upheld while Los Angeles \nCounty sheriff's minimum hiring age of 35 was not. East Providence's \nmandatory retirement age of 60 for police officers was upheld while \nPennsylvania's mandatory retirement age of 60 was struck down.\n  As a result, no State or local government could be sure of the \nlegality of its hiring or retirement policies. They could, However, be \nsure of having to spend scarce financial resources to defend their \npolicies, regardless of the outcome of their suits.\n  A suggested alternative to mandatory retirement ages is testing that \nscreens out those individuals who may still retain their strength at \nthe age of 60 or 70. The 1986 Amendment to the Age Discrimination Act \nauthorized State and local governments to set minimum hiring ages and \nmandatory retirement ages until December 31, 1993. It also ordered the \nEEOC and the Department of Labor to conduct a study to determine: \nwhether physical and mental fitness tests can accurately assess the \nability of police and fire fighters to perform the requirements of \ntheir jobs; which particular types of\n\n[[Page S11923]]\n\ntests are most effective; and what specific standards such tests should \nsatisfy.\n  Finally, the 1986 amendment directed the EEOC to promulgate \nguidelines on the administration and use of physical and mental fitness \ntests for police and firefighters.\n  While the Penn State researchers who conducted the study concluded \nthat age was a poor predictor of job performance--because they could \nnot find an exact age at which people are unable to perform their \nduties--they failed to evaluate which particular physical and mental \nfitness tests are most effective to evaluate public safety officers and \nwhich specific standards such tests should satisfy.\n  Despite the very clear mandate in the 1986 amendment, neither the \nEEOC nor its researchers were able to comply with that mandate. There \nwere no guidelines developed to assist State and local governments in \nthe design, administration, and use of tests, as Congress directed. As \na result, State and local governments now find themselves without a \npublic safety exemption from the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, \nand also without any guidance as how to test their employees.\n  The provision included in this bill authorizes the National \nInstitutes of Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] to conduct a study \nof fitness tests for police and firefighters, to begin when sufficient \nfunds are appropriated, that produces useful information for public \nsafety agencies working to protect citizens and the officers and \nfirefighters.\n  The provision also includes an exception to the exemption whereby \nNIOSH will identify valid job performance tests and public safety \nagencies utilizing mandatory retiement ages will provide public safety \nofficers who have reached retirement age with an annual opportunity to \ndemonstrate their fitness using the NIOSH tests.\n  I firmly believe that Congress must avoid exempting whole classes of \nemployees from the protection of civil rights laws unless it is \nabsolutely necessary. But this is not a civil rights issue. This is not \na new exemption.\n\n  The Federal Government already exempts public safety officers from \nADEA. State and local fire and police agencies should have the same \nexemption so that they too can protect and promote the safety of the \npublic and of the officers.\n  As many of you in this body know, I come from a law enforcement \nbackground. My father was a police officer. My uncle was a police \nofficer. My brother still is a police officer. It is the police \nofficers and firefighters themselves that have asked for this \namendment.\n  Rank and file public safety officers have besieged my offices with \ncalls and letters and visits in support of the amendment. As Terry \nGainer, director of the Illinois State Police, testified before the \nLabor Committee hearing on this legislation.\n  ``The demands of public safety necessitate a high degree of physical \nfitness and mental acuity. What we see today are offenders who are \nincreasingly younger and more violent; police manpower shortages \ntranslate into less backup * * * terrorist acts such as we saw in \nOklahoma City or at the world trade center require * * * arduous duty. \nIt is the quality of police and fire response . . . that is at issue.''\n  I strongly believe that we in Congress must do everything we can to \nensure that our rank and file officers have everything they need to do \ntheir jobs.\n  This provision has the support of the: Fire Department Safety \nOfficers Association; Fraternal Order of Police; International \nAssociation of Fire-Fighters; International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice; International Brotherhood of Police Officers; International \nSociety of Fire Service Instructors; International Union of Police \nAssociations, AFL-CIO; National Association of Police Organizations; \nNational Sheriffs Association; National Troopers Coalition; American \nFederation of State, County and Municipal Employees; National Public \nEmployer Labor Relations Association; New York State Association of \nChiefs of Police; and city of Chicago Department of Police.\n\n  This provision is also supported by the: National League of Cities; \nNational Association of Counties; National Conference of State \nLegislatures; and U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  Let me conclude by clarifying what this amendment is and is not \nabout.\n  This provision is not about inequity. This provision is about equity \nfor State and local governments--giving them the same ability to set \nmandatory retirement and maximum hiring ages that the Federal \nGovernment enjoys.\n  This provision is not about discrimination. This provision is about \npublic safety--providing the people of this country with the most \ncapable protection and assistance possible.\n  And this provision is not about mandates. This provision is about \nState and local control--letting local and state governments decide how \nbest to protect their citizens.\n  On behalf of the police officers and firefighters of this country, on \nbehalf of their families, and on behalf of the millions of citizens who \nrely on local police officers and firefighters every day, I thank my \ncolleagues for for including the Age Discrimination in Employment \nAmendments of 1995 in this legislation.\n\n\n                          Illegal Immigration\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 2202, legislation to combat the problem of illegal \nimmigration. As you know, this measure has been included in the omnibus \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1997.\n  The conference report is an important step forward in our Nation's \nfight against illegal immigration to this country. As a member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and a conferee to the negotiations with the \nHouse, I am pleased to have been part of the hard work, commitment and \nbipartisanship that yielded this good, balanced bill, of which we can \nall be proud. My friends, Ted Kennedy and Alan Simpson, deserve much of \nthe credit.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service [INS] and other law enforcement officials with \nnew resources to prevent aliens from entering or staying in the country \nillegally: 1,000 new border patrol agents for each of the next 5 years, \nadditional INS investigators to combat alien smugglers and visa \noverstayers, and enhanced civil penalties for illegal entry, to name \njust a few.\n  The conference report also gives the INS and businesses tools to keep \nAmerican jobs and paychecks out of the hands of illegal aliens--tools \nto prevent illegal aliens from securing employment that rightfully \nbelongs to American citizens or legal immigrants who have played by the \nrules and respect the law. Specifically, this legislation provides for \nthree pilot programs to move us toward a workable employer verification \nsystem and a framework for the creation of more fraud resistant \ndocuments. The original Senate approach, which included more privacy \nand antidiscrimination protections, was preferable to the one adopted \nby the conference; however, the pilot projects in this bill still \ndeserve a try. We desperately need a more effective verification \nsystem, Mr. President.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the conference report includes my \namendment on mail-order brides. This amendment launches a study of \ninternational matchmaking companies, heretofore unregulated and \noperating in the shadows. These companies may be exploiting people in \ndesperate situations. The study is not aimed at the men and women who \nuse these businesses for legitimate companionship. Instead, it is a \nvery positive and important step toward gathering the information we \nneed so that we can determine the extent to which these companies \ncontribute to the very troubling problems of domestic violence against \nimmigrant women and immigration marriage fraud.\n  To be sure, there are provisions in this bill which I do not support. \nThe triple fence mandate has Congress micromanaging the INS and \nunnecessarily waiving important environmental laws. And I regret very \nmuch that the Senate positions on summary exclusion and asylum reform \ndid not prevail in the final compromise bill. Lastly, we could have \ndone more to protect the integrity of the workplace, both by enhancing \nthe Department of Labor's ability to enforce employer sanctions and by \nrejecting the Senate-passed ``intent standard'' which may jeopardize \nthe rights of American citizens and legal immigrants.\n  Despite these flaws, this bipartisan legislation deserves our \nsupport. The\n\n[[Page S11924]]\n\nUnited States is a product of an immigration tradition marked by \ngenerosity, compassion and commitment to hard work. In adopting these \nimportant changes, we are protecting that tradition by fighting the \ndeeds of those who wish to exploit it.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                   Commerce Department Appropriations\n\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, because of the scope and magnitude of \nthe negotiations over the omnibus appropriations bill, the attention \nthat I believe should be paid to the future of technology research and \ndevelopment has not exactly been head-line news. Fortunately, the \nresults are good news. By and large, critical investments in a series \nof relevant programs are being made through this bill. Once again, we \nhave dodged the budgetary and philosophical bullets that have been \naimed for months at programs that I see as critical to America's \ncompetitiveness, economic growth, and character.\n  The Commerce Department is the only Federal agency that is primarily \nconcerned with advancing our Nation's civilian technological \ncompetitiveness. And the Commerce Department has worked hard--under the \nfantastic leadership of the late Ron Brown and now Mickey Kantor--to \nestablish partnerships between Government and industry for our national \ninterest.\n  This administration and the Commerce Department have been at the \nforefront, establishing and nurturing a web of programs that strengthen \nthe Nation's competitiveness. These programs, taken together, represent \na comprehensive, multi-pronged and efficient effort to prepare the \nNation for the 21st century.\n  I congratulate President Clinton, Vice-President Gore, and the \nvarious Senators, with special mention to Senator Hollings, for their \nsteadfast determination to obtain the resources now in this \nappropriations bill to continue investing in technology R that \nour country is the nation with the cutting-edge jobs, industries, and \nskills in demand.\n  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership [MEP] is doing yeoman's work \nthroughout the states, working at the grass roots, helping small- and \nmedium-sized businesses use technologies to improve their efficiency \nand profitability. The MEP brings tremendous expertise to businesses, \nhelping them to improve production on the shop floor, apply modern \nmanagement methods, and raise environmental quality while decreasing \ncosts.\n  And the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] is doing for technology \nwhat the government did for our highway system in the fifties and \nsixties. President Eisenhower recognized that national security and \neconomic needs demanded that the Federal Government invest in a \nnational highway system--no one could reasonably expect industry to \nbuild such a system alone. And today, that system is an indispensable \npart of our Nation's infrastructure. Well, the ATP is doing the same--\nhelping industry build new technologies critical to the growth of \nour economy--technologies that industry would not likely develop, or \ndevelop as rapidly, without a partnership between government and \nindustry.\n\n  The ATP, which was created with bipartisan support, is a highly \ncompetitive, cost-shared, industry-led partnership program that is \nfostering new technology and creating jobs. Approximately 46 percent of \nall awards go to small businesses or joint ventures led by small \nbusinesses. More than 100 different universities are involved in about \n150 ATP projects.\n  The Commerce Department also has performed a critical role in paving \nanother highway--the information superhighway. Commerce has provided \nleadership in advancing the national information infrastructure [NII] \nand is working hard to help hospitals, schools, libraries, and local \ngovernments access and use the wonders of this new fantastic resource.\n  The Commerce National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration [NTIA] Technology and Information Infrastructure \nApplications Program [TIIAP] is a highly competitive, merit-based grant \nprogram that provides seed money for innovative, practical information \ntechnology projects throughout the United States. Examples include \nconnecting schools to the vast resources of the Internet, improving \nhealth care communications for elderly patients in their homes, and \nextending emergency telephone service in rural areas.\n  And the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] is \ndoing the work that the Nation's Founders found so essential to our \nNation's trade and economy that they included the responsibility in the \nConstitution--caring for our Nation's system of weights and measures. \nNIST laboratories perform world-class work in a way that the Nation's \nFounders could never have imagined.\n  For example, the use of fiber optics in telecommunications would not \nhave occurred as rapidly without NIST's efforts. NIST's work in \nmeasures and standards has literally made it possible for fiber optic \ncables to be connected with each other with simplicity and ease--\nleading to a world connected by fiber.\n  The Commerce programs are providing States such as mine, West \nVirginia, great benefit, enabling us to do things we otherwise could \nnot do. The West Virginia Partnership for Industrial Modernization \n[PIM] in Huntington was established in 1995 as a partnership of the \nState of West Virginia Development Office, the Marshall University \nResearch Corporation/Robert C. Byrd Institute and the West Virginia \nUniversity Extension Service and NIST. The center serves smaller \nmanufacturers throughout the State. WV PIM just received a NIST/EPA \ncost-shared award to help smaller manufacturers reduce or eliminate \npollution sources in their operations.\n\n  The Advanced Technology Program is working hard to tackle a problem \nthat has plagued our health care system--the cost of paperwork. The \nCharleston Area Medical Center and the Statewide Health Information \nNetwork of Charleston, WV, are participating in two ATP joint ventures \nto improve the technologies and methods used to handle medical \ninformation. These projects are partnerships of industry, clinical \nfacilities, universities and national laboratories, working to \nestablish the capabilities necessary to transform fragmented health \ncare data into integrated, community-wide computerized information \nresources. These projects have enormous potential for reducing health \ncare costs and improving health care service delivery for every \nAmerican.\n  The Commerce Technology and Information Infrastructure Applications \nProgram [TIIAP] is particularly important to my home state of West \nVirginia, a heavily rural state. A TIIAP grant to the state library \nsystem will give citizens of West Virginia access to information around \nthe globe. And Project InfoMine will expand the existing statewide \ninformation network to 50 unconnected remote libraries in the outer \nreaches of rural West Virginia. Project InfoMine will enable unemployed \nminers to find off-site work information or retraining opportunities. \nExpectant mothers will be able to find health, diet, and childcare \ninformation.\n  Commerce NIST laboratories have provided assistance to West Virginia \nbusinesses, by providing weights and measures services that would not \notherwise be available or affordable. NIST helped West Virginia \nbusinesses certify their laboratories to national accreditation \nstandards and assisted manufacturers by providing NIST calibration and \nstandard reference services.\n\n\n                 Restoration of the President's Request\n\n  Fortunately, we have achieved funding for the Advanced Technology \nProgram at the level of $225 million, although short of the Presidents \nrequest of $365 million. Restrictions regarding new competitions have \nalso been removed. And the TIIAP program is funded at $21.5 million, \nshort of the request of $59 million. These programs remain at a viable, \nalthough not fully supported level.\n  Unfortunately, we did not realize the same success with the request \nto fund construction of the NIST Advanced Technology Laboratory, which \nis critical to the modernization of the NIST measurement activities. It \nremains unfunded.\n  We will need to return to this important debate next session.\n  Mr. President, America is a nation of competitors and innovators. We \ndo our best when faced with competition. Well, we are facing increasing \ninternational competition. This is the time for the Federal Government \nto crank\n\n[[Page S11925]]\n\nup our engine of economic competitiveness, to build partnerships with \nindustry, universities and the States.\n  West Virginia is doing its part to prepare for the 21st century, by \nhelping manufacturers compete, and wiring our schools and libraries to \nthe information superhighway. We need the Federal Government to \nmaintain its part, to provide national leadership in science and \ntechnology, and to boost our ability to compete.\n  I ask this Congress to continue the progress, to maintain Commerce's \ntechnology programs, and to help achieve the progress that will be \nneeded to ensure a prosperous future for all Americans in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nimmigration provisions that are now included in the continuing \nresolution.\n  It should come as no surprise that it took nearly 5 months after the \nSenate passed this bill for the House and Senate conferees to finally \nbe appointed. It should not surprise us that our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle initially drafted this conference report \namongst themselves, and refused to allow a single democratic amendment \nto be offered during the conference committee. Some changes were made \nwhen the conference report was merged with the omnibus continuing \nresolution, but the basic provisions were developed in a very partisan \nprocess.\n  And finally, it should come as no surprise that the Senate is \nconsidering this legislation in the middle of the campaign season. \nRather than offering any surprises, the circumstances surrounding us is \na clear confirmation that this legislation is less about combating \nillegal immigration than it is about trying to score political points.\n  Let me begin by observing that there is clearly no demonstrable \nsupport in this Congress, nor in this country, for reducing levels of \nlegal immigration.\n  Such reductions were stripped from the House bill and omitted from \nthe Senate bill. I have said repeatedly that there is some abuse of our \nlegal immigration system and we should take appropriate steps to repair \nthis process.\n  But it is clear that a large majority of this body and the other \nhouse believes in continuing our longstanding national policy of \nallowing families to reunite, of continuing to allow foreign skilled \nworkers to be sponsored by businesses, universities and research \nfacilities, and ensuring that the United States continues to be a safe \nhaven for those fleeing persecution from around the world.\n  Mr. President, for anyone who has witnessed the evolution of this \nlegislation, from its inception last spring to the conference report \nlanguage included in the continuing resolution that is before us today, \nit is obvious that the commitment of those of us opposing this \nconference report to combating illegal immigration is just as strong as \nthose who are supporting this legislation.\n  As virtually every expert on this issue agrees, combating illegal \nimmigration must be a two-pronged strategy. The first part of that \nstrategy is border enforcement, particularly along the southwestern \nborder where tens of thousands of illegal immigrants cross into the \nUnited States each year.\n  I have supported President Clinton's increases in the U.S. border \npatrol and I support the further increases contained in this \nlegislation.\n\n  But a comprehensive strategy must also account for those illegal \nimmigrants who enter the United States legally, usually on a student or \na tourist visa, and then remain here unlawfully. This, we know, \nrepresents up to one-half--one-half Mr. President--of our illegal \nimmigration problem.\n  So how do you address this problem, known as the visa overstayer \nproblem. Some of my colleagues advocate installing a worker \nverification system, where employers would have to verify the \neligibility status of each worker they hire with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I have long opposed this approach for a variety of reasons. I think \nit will be a costly burden for our Nation's employers. I think it will \nlead to an inordinate amount of mistakes resulting in too many law-\nabiding Americans being denied job opportunities for the wrong reasons. \nI have concerns that the privacy protections for these workers are \ninadequate.\n  And that is why the worker verification proposal in this conference \nreport causes me serious concern.\n  It has been pointed out that the verification pilot programs in this \nbill are purely voluntary. Voluntary for whom, Mr. President? It is \nvoluntary for the employers, sure. But not the employees.\n  Workers do not get a choice of whether or not their name is fed into \nsome Federal Government computer to verify whether or not they are \neligible to work in the United States.\n  Interestingly, both in the Judiciary Committee and here on the Senate \nfloor, concern was expressed that these verification proposals could \nlead to some sort of national identification document. The sponsors of \nthis bill scoffed at such a notion. They said there was nothing in this \nbill that would create such a document nor require Americans to carry \none.\n  Well, let's just take a look at the final agreement. The legislation \nbefore us requires that one of the worker verification pilot programs, \nwhich must involve millions of United States citizens in at least 5 \nStates, include the use of (quote) ``machine readable documents.''\n  Now keep in mind that this conference report already imposes a \nmassive Federal mandate on the States by requiring them to only issue \nbirth certificates and driver's licenses that conform to Federal \nstandards.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. Under this legislation, the State \nof Wisconsin will have to issue drivers licenses based on guidelines \nset forth by the Department of Transportation.\n  If the DOT tells Wisconsin to add a costly new security feature to \ntheir licenses, Wisconsin will have to comply. It does not matter how \nmuch it costs. It does not matter what sort of burden that places on \nthe State agency. And it certainly does not matter if the State of \nWisconsin concludes that such a security feature will cost far more \nthan any benefit it will derive.\n\n  I see that the conference report has added language that the Federal \nGovernment shall make grants available to the States to help pay for \nthis new mandate. I am sure that is of little comfort to the states. It \nis clear that considering our fiscal constraint right now, the chances \nof these grants actually being made available through the \nappropriations process is an uphill battle to say the least.\n  And that is why this provision continues to draw strong opposition \nfrom the National Conference of State Legislatures and the National \nAssociation of Counties. So clearly all the talk we have heard over the \nlast 2 years about taking power out of the hands of Washington \nbureaucrats and placing it back in the hands of the States and local \ngovernments was little more than political grandstanding.\n  Those were empty words, Mr. President, pure and simple.\n  The federalization of these documents was a part of the Senate-passed \nimmigration bill. But now we have this new twist, that one of the \nverification programs is to utilize (quote) ``machine-readable \ndocuments.''\n  That means that in those States that are included in this pilot \nprogram, the applicable State agency will also be responsible for \nensuring that their drivers licenses or other such documents are \nembroidered with a machine-readable social security number.\n  Mr. President, these verification and birth certificate provisions \nalone are enough to oppose this legislation. But there are a number of \nother provisions that were jammed into this conference report that make \nlittle if any sense.\n  Let's look at the triple fence we are now going to build between \nMexico and Southern California. This is to be a 14-mile-long fence with \nthree separate tiers to make it as difficult and painful as possible \nfor intruders to navigate. The conference report authorizes $12 million \nfor the initial construction of this wall.\n  But according to INS, the fence and roads in between the three tiers \nwill likely have a final price tag of between $80 and $100 million by \nthe time construction is completed.\n  One hundred million dollars, Mr. President, for a 14-mile-long fence. \nThat works out to be $4,100 a yard, Mr. President; $4,100 for one yard \nof fence and road. I'd like to know who's getting that Government \ncontract.\n  But it gets worse. During Senate consideration of this legislation, \nlanguage\n\n[[Page S11926]]\n\nwas added to the bill that made sure that INS had some input as to \nwhere these barriers were erected.\n\n  That language has magically disappeared. Instead, the bill provides \nfor the construction of the 14-mile long triple fence, (quote) \n``starting at the pacific ocean and extending eastward''.\n  It doesn't matter if INS believes the fence would be more effective a \nhalf-mile away from the ocean. Of course, if I am an illegal immigrant \nand see a huge wall starting at the ocean and extending eastward, I \nmight just throw a life preserver on and swim around it. I'm sure this \ntriple fence will follow in the footsteps of the other great physical \nbarriers, such as the Berlin Wall and the great Maginot Line.\n  Mr. President, when this bill left the U.S. Senate last April, there \nwas one provision that I thought would make a marked difference in \nterms of focusing in on the 50 percent of illegal immigrants who come \nhere by legal means, the so-called visa overstayers.\n  It was a provision authored by myself and the junior Senator from \nMichigan Senator Abraham. The Abraham-Feingold language, for the first \ntime ever, imposed tough new penalties on those who come here on a \nlegal visa and remain in the United States long after the visa has \nexpired.\n  It required the Attorney General to implement an automated system of \ntracking the arrival and departure of nonimmigrant aliens, permitting \nfor the first time computer identification of nonimmigrants who \noverstay their visas. And finally, it authorized over 300 new \ninvestigators each year for 3 years dedicated solely to the purpose of \nidentifying these visa overstayers.\n  That bipartisan proposal represented the sort of sensible targeted \napproach to combating illegal immigration that could be supported by \nSenators of all partisan and ideological persuasions. Our strategy for \ncombating illegal immigration should not be about building walls, or \ncreating a national worker verification system, or placing a brigade of \nmarines on the southwestern border, or telling an immigrant family that \nthey cannot bring a parent, a child or a spouse into this country.\n  It should be about identifying who is and who is not playing by the \nrules, and sending a strong message that there are severe penalties \nthat will be enforced against those who choose to break our laws.\n  Unfortunately, a change was made to the Abraham-Feingold language in \nthe conference report that I believe greatly undermines the \neffectiveness of this provision.\n  The Senator from Michigan and I very carefully crafted our language \nto provide a broad-based exception from these penalties for any \nindividual who could demonstrate good cause for remaining in the United \nStates without authorization. Why were we so careful to include this \nexception, Mr. President? Quite simply, there are many good reasons why \nan individual might not leave the United States immediately after their \nvisa expires.\n\n  Perhaps they have become ill. Perhaps a family member has become ill. \nMaybe they need a short extension to raise the money to leave the \ncountry. There are a variety of reasons, some legitimate, some not. But \nour language would have put the burden on the nonimmigrant to \ndemonstrate good cause to the INS. Instead, this conference report \nwipes out that important exception, and essentially only provides an \nexception to a nonimmigrant who has remained in the United States \nbecause they have a claim for readjustment of status pending at INS.\n  That Mr. President, is troublesome,\n  And I have serious concerns that this will result in countless \nnonimmigrants being subject to harsh penalties for no fault of their \nown. That is yet another example of sound policy being thrown to the \nwayside for no apparent legitimate reason.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to address the asylum provisions in \nthis legislation that the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has so \neloquently shown to be very troublesome.\n  America has a proud history of representing a safe haven for those \nwho believe in democracy and who have been tormented for embracing \nparticular political and religious viewpoints. It should continue to do \nso.\n  We have had, no doubt, serious problems and abuses with our asylum \nsystem. In the past, too many nonmeritorious claims have been filed, \nand the result has been a massive backlog of pending claims that has \nprevented or delayed more legitimate claims from being processed.\n  I do not believe, however, that sort of abuse is adequate \njustification to place countless obstacles in front of those who have \nlegitimate asylum claims. Moreover, before we consider passing any \nheavy-handed reforms, we should remember that the Clinton \nadministration has made tremendous progress in reforming the asylum \nsystem in just the past year or so.\n  As a result of these new reforms, in the past year alone, new asylum \nclaims have been cut in half and INS has more then doubled their \nproductivity in terms of processing new claims. Mr. President, these \npromising reforms are in their infancy and we should be very careful \nnot to mandate any new restrictions that will impede the progress INS \nis now making and prevent legitimate claims from being considered in as \nexpedited fashion as possible.\n  The summary exclusion provisions in this legislation are \nunnecessarily harsh and make little sense. This provision states that \nif you are living in a country where you are being persecuted, if the \nregime you are living under is oppressive, and you are forced to \nfalsify your papers in order to gain safe passage to the United \nStates--this legislation says that you are unwelcome in the United \nStates. It literally shuts the door on thousands of asylum seekers who \nfind themselves in this position.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not understand what the authors of this language \ncould possibly be thinking. Often we hear the well-publicized cases of \npersons seeking asylum in this country, whether it is Fidel Castro's \ndaughter or members of the Cuban national baseball team.\n  But most people who are seeking asylum aren't relatives of \ncelebrities, or famous national athletes. Often, they are working \npeople, who are being imprisoned and often tortured for their religious \nor political views. How can we expect these people to walk into a \ngovernment agency in their home country and obtain the necessary \npaperwork to leave that country? We can't Mr. President, and that is \nwhy I am afraid that this provision will have disastrous consequences \nfor a great many individuals seeking political asylum in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, the conference report before us has \nturned into little more than an incoherent and unjustifiable attack \nagainst immigrants and refugees. There are 100 senators in this body \nwho are genuinely committed to reducing illegal immigration and \npunishing those who choose to break our laws.\n  Unfortunately, I think it is clear that what some of our colleagues \ncould not do directly in terms of reducing legal immigration is being \naccomplished indirectly. You can do it by cracking down on legal \nimmigrants who use welfare. You can do it by cracking down on \npersecuted individuals seeking asylum. You can do it in a host of ways, \nand I am afraid that is exactly what this conference report has \naccomplished.\n  Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I wish to engage my esteemed colleague \nChairman D'Amato in a brief colloquy to clarify two items pertaining to \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act [FCRA] amendments contained in the H.R. \n4278, the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. First, the \nHouse of Representatives in negotiations over the weekend deleted a \nSenate-approved measure which would have codified the permissibility of \ndirect marketing under the FCRA. The deletion leaves the law silent on \nthis issue, retaining the status quo. The House action does not reflect \nany congressional intent regarding the extent to which direct marketing \nis permissible under FCRA.\n  The second item relates to a requirement imposed under section 609 of \nthe FCRA for personnel being accessible to consumers. The requirement \nthat personnel be available under normal business hours is not intended \nin any manner to interfere with the use of automated menu telephone \nsystems which provide the consumers with a range of options. The \nstandard is satisfied as long as the system provides a consumer the \noption to speak to a live operator at some point in the audio menu.\n  Does the chairman confirm these understandings?\n\n[[Page S11927]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, Senator Bryan. I agree with your assessment on \nthese points.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my \ndisappointment that the banking provisions contained in H.R. 4278, the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill, do not contain common-sense requirements \nthat bank employees who sell insurance be subject to the same State \nlicensing requirements as insurance agents.\n  There are many parts of the banking section with which I am pleased, \nparticularly the final resolution of the financial crisis that was \nlooming over both the Savings Association Insurance Fund [SAIF] and the \nBank Insurance Fund [BIF]. However, while the House and Senate leaders \nwent to great lengths to include regulatory relief legislation that \nbenefits the banks, they failed to include any similar relief for tens \nof thousands of independent insurance agents across the country.\n  In many respects, the story of most independent insurance agents is \nthe story of the American dream. In cities, towns and villages \nthroughout the Nation, these men and women are the small business \npeople who provide the foundation for local economic success. In \naddition to providing economic opportunity in their community, \nindependent agents are often the same people who lead the local Rotary \nClub or Lions Club, who chair the P.T.A. or who spend their weekends \ncoaching little league.\n  But these people are under great strain from a competitive \nenvironment that is increasingly favoring the banks over the agents. \nThe banks' advantage is growing because recent court rulings have given \ngreat powers to the bank regulators to allow banks to sell insurance \nproducts. Let me be perfectly clear: I do not take issue with the way \nin which the regulators have been performing their duties. The problem \nstems from the fact that the regulators mandate requires them to make \ndecisions based solely upon the impact those decisions will have on the \nbanking industry. No regulator could--even if it wanted to--take into \naccount how their rulings would impact on tens of thousands of hard-\nworking independent insurance agents.\n  That is why I was so disappointed that this common-sense provision \nrequiring State licensing was not included in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill.\n  In point of fact, Mr. President, this licensing provision was taken \nalmost verbatim from the interim guidelines on insurance sales issued \nby the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the main regulator of \nnational banks.\n  A consumer who is purchasing an insurance product should have the \nconfidence to know that the person selling the insurance has the same \neducation requirements, passed the same tests, is subject to the same \nrules of conduct--whether that individual sells insurance at a bank or \nat an independent agency. Yet for some inexplicable reason, this very \nmodest, pro-consumer amendment was vehemently resisted by powerful \nforces within the banking industry.\n  Mr. President, this is not an issue that will simply go away. \nAlthough there was not an appropriate opportunity to offer this \namendment to the Omnibus Appropriations bill, neither I, nor many of my \ncolleagues, will stand idly by and watch thousands of hard-working men \nand women lose their jobs because of a regulatory scheme that cannot, \nby statute, take their well-being into account. I can assure my \ncolleagues, as well as those representing the financial industries, \nthat when the next Congress considers legislation dealing with bank \npowers and financial restructuring, I will be a forceful advocate on \nbehalf of the legitimate concerns of America's independent insurance \nagents.\n\n\n             high intensity drug trafficking areas program\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to address my friend from Alabama \nregarding the issue of funding for new High Intensify Drug Trafficking \nAreas (HIDTAs) in the Omnibus Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. \nI seek a clarification of the report language that accompanies the \nTreasury-Postal title of this bill, which earmarks specified amounts \nfor new HIDTAs, including $3,000,000 for a newly designated HIDTA in \nthe State of Colorado. I inquire as to whether my colleague from \nAlabama is aware that the HIDTA application originally submitted by the \nState of Colorado has been updated to include the States of Wyoming and \nUtah in a Rocky Mountain HIDTA?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would say to my friend that at the time this bill was \ndrafted and I was not aware of that development.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I would ask my friend from Alabama if he feels the \nexisting report language could preclude those funds currently earmarked \nfor the State of Colorado from being applied to all Members of the \nRocky Mountain HIDTA.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would tell my friend that I have encouraged the Drug \nCzar to work in terms of regional cooperation rather than focusing on \nindividual States, and I am pleased to learn that the Rocky Mountain \nStates are pursuing such an association. To that end, I would agree \nwith the Senator from Wyoming that this money should go to meeting the \nupdated application's program objectives.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I would further inquire if it is still possible for the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy to consider using some of their \ndiscretionary funds to provide additional funding for the Rocky \nMountain HIDTA?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes. Although the bill sets out minimum amounts to be \ntransferred to state and local entities for drug control activities, I \nwould certainly encourage the Director to transfer additional funds \nwhere needed for appropriate state and regional efforts.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my friend for his courtesy, and for his many \nhours of tireless work on this bill.\n\n\n        Commerce, State and Justice FY 1997 Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Department of \nCommerce technology programs that I believe were underfunded in the \noriginal Senate appropriations bill for Commerce State Justice as \nreported by committee, and are better funded in this Continuing \nResolution. The programs that I am referring to are important to the \nfuture of the U.S. economy--to our economic security, global \ncompetitiveness and high-skilled jobs. Without these types of \ntechnology programs in place, I am concerned that America could lose \nthe technological innovation race as it confronts our international \ncompetitors. These technology programs help America compete in the \nglobal marketplace and are helping to make our economy stronger. The \nirony is that by cutting technology programs we would be cutting \nprograms that are already making our economy stronger. I am concerned \nthat the cuts originally proposed in the Commerce Appropriations bill \nwould have helped lead to an undermining of the foundation that links \nour support of scientific research to technologies which have the \npotential to continue to keep America at the forefront of global \nleadership. I am very pleased that many of these cuts have been \ncorrected in the Continuing Resolution.\n  The Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill as reported by \nSenate Committee provided inadequate funding to Commerce technology \nprograms. If it had been left unchanged, this bill could have led to \nthe unraveling of investments the Senate has long supported to advance \nour nation's civilian technological competitiveness. The late Secretary \nRon Brown and other Administration leaders worked diligently with the \nranking member on this Subcommittee, Senator Hollings, and others in \nCongress, to develop Federal programs that link up with the private \nsector to foster new ideas that may underpin the next generation of \nproducts. These provide some of the small number of information \nchannels that assure that the ideas generated in our world class \nresearch institutions evolve in the marketplace. I commend the Commerce \nDepartment's hard work and foresight in recognizing that America has \nentered a new era, an era where economic battles are fought as fiercely \nas military actions. The Commerce technology programs that were \ninitiated with bipartisan support arm us with the best equipment and \nstrategies we have to surmount our international competitors' efforts.\n  Our technology edge in the marketplace for the past half century has \ntranslated directly into high tech jobs for our workplace, new markets \nfor American business, improvements in our balance of trade, and from \nthis economic success, revenues for our treasury. The original Senate \nbill proposed\n\n[[Page S11928]]\n\nto deplete resources from one of the basic long-term building blocks of \nour economic growth: applied research and development.\n  Our global competitors must be chuckling at our muddled vision. Japan \nhas announced plans to double its R spending by the year 2000; it \nwill surpass the United States in nondefense R in total dollars \nspent; it is already passing us in R expenditures as a share of GDP. \nThis is an historic reversal. Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, China, South \nKorea and India are also aggressively promoting R investment. Our \nlead in R has been our historic competitive advantage. While our \ncompetitors are increasing their R investments, both public and \nprivate R investment is being cut in the U.S. If these global trends \nin R spending continue, America will rue the day it lost its R lead \nand therefore its technology lead. The leading ecocomic studies show \nthat technology innovation has contributed to half or more of our \neconomic growth for the past half century. By allowing our R lead to \nerode, we are jeopardizing our future economic growth.\n  The technology programs at Commerce are not a large part of our total \nR investment. Why should we be particularly concerned about them? A \nnumber of the Commerce programs are the connectors, the infrastructure, \nbetween the basic research establishment and the evolution of \ntechnologies into practical use. They are highly efficient investments, \nleveraging Federal dollars with matching private investment to ensure \nrisk sharing and therefore prudent investment and improved liklihood of \ninvestment results. The cuts in the original Senate version of this \nappropriations bill took aim at the new and evolving infrastructure of \ntechnology development, which is why they were so serious.\n  The Technology Administration at the Department of Commerce houses \nmany of the critical components of technology development and we need \nto ensure that its key functions are maintained. The technology \nprograms I am particularly concerned about are the Advanced Technology \nProgram (ATP), the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP), the \ncompletion of the Advanced Technology Laboratory construction and \nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) \nTechnology and Information Infrastructure Grants Program (TIIAP). In \ntotal, these programs ARE the tools I mentioned earlier that make up \nthe comprehensive and efficient effort to retain our technology \nleadership.\n  I will focus my attention on two programs that were hit hard by the \noriginal Senate Appropriations bill: ATP and the NIST Advanced \nTechnology Laboratory construction. I will also note problems in \ncutting the NTIA grant program.\n  I am pleased that the original Senate bill did recognize the \nimportance of the Manufacturing Extension Program by providing it \nsubstantial funding, as does the Continuing Resolution, providing $95 \nmillion for FY 1997. The MEP program is in the process of reaching \nsmall and mid-sized businesses in nearly every state with new advanced \ntechnology options.\n\n\n                      Advanced Technology Program\n\n  ATP was enacted during the Bush administration to address technical \nchallenges facing U.S. industry. This program adeptly addresses the \ndevelopment of high-risk, long-term technologies by top-notch firms, \nincluding small-to-medium sized companies, in a way that respects the \nmarketplace and avoids inappropriate government intrusion. In an \nindependent study, Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International \n(SEMI), an association comprised of 1,400 small companies that \nmanufacture materials and equipment for semiconductor manufacturers, \nfound that 100 per cent of the companies who participated in the ATP \nProgram rated it very favorably. Likewise, nearly two-thirds of the \nmodest sampling of ATP-award companies surveyed by the Industrial \nResearch Institute, an association of over 260 research companies who \naccount for 80 per cent of industrially-performed R, rated ATP with \nvery high marks. The various reviews of ATP show that it has \neffectively acted as a catalyst to develop new technologies and to \nfoster ongoing joint ventures within industrial R\n\n  In my view, we should continue to support this program and we should \nrestore the President's fiscal year 1997 request of $345M. The original \nSenate bill proposed funding for the Advanced Technology Program at a \nlevel of only $60 million, slashing $285 million from the President's \nrequest. This bill provided inadequate funding to support current \ncommitments and included language prohibiting new awards. Clearly, the \nATP cuts in this bill would have severely handicapped and ultimately \nannihilated the ATP program. The Senate bill also disregarded the \nbipartisan agreement reached last year to stop the train wreck and to \nmaintain funding for ATP. I am very pleased that the final Continuing \nResolution restores significant authority to the ATP program, funding \nit at $225 million, including funding for new ATP awards as well as to \ncontinue existing awards. This is a major improvement and I thank the \nPresident's Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, and his staff; Senator \nHollings and Scott Gudes and Pat Windham of his staff; Appropriations \nChairman Hatfield, and the others involved who were able to negotiate \nthis change. It's not full funding, and this is an investment program \nthat should be expanding, but it is an important step back on track.\n  The restrictions in the original bill that would have prohibited \nfunding for awards to be made resulting from the ATP competition \nannounced in May 1996, have been removed in the Continuing Resolution. \nI note that ATP has some carryover funds set aside for this purpose \nand, as noted, there is additional funding for new proposals in the \nfinal CR funding level. If this restrictive language had not been \nremoved and we had cancelled the 1996 ATP competition, we would have \nhad to face many justifiably upset entrepreneurs and medium-sized \nbusinesses who have invested major resources in forming consortia and \nin preparing grant proposals. The worst losers would have been the \npublic which would miss out on some very promising technologies. I am \nvery pleased we did not have to face that problem.\n\n\n            NIST Advanced Technology Laboratory Construction\n\n  U.S. industry's ability to produce high quality products ranging from \nsemiconductor to CAT scanners depends on the accuracy of primary \nmeasurements conducted at NIST. Universities and industries depend on \nnew NIST measurement methods to overcome experimental obstacles with \nregards to the study of a plethora of scientific research such as \nmaterials science, advanced manufacturing, enzyme structures, to name a \nfew. NIST's laboratories in Gaithersburg are now 30 years old and must \nbe updated to improve and automate controls for temperature, dust \nlevels, vibrations, and humidity. The factors are critical to accurate \nmeasurement required for precision national measurement standards. \nStandard-setting, which reaches across a vast range of affected \nindustries, and is conducted in close cooperation with those \nindustries, is clearly an appropriate governmental role, and has been \nso for over a century. Extremely precise standard-setting is crucial \nfor industrial efficiencies and advances in a host of interdependent \nindustries.\n\n  The administration requested $105 million for the construction of the \nNIST Advanced Technology Laboratory [ATL], which has been undergoing \nfive years of extensive planning, research, design, and review. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee eliminated funding for building the \nurgently needed NIST ATL. Unfortunately, the Continuing Resolution did \nnot correct this problem. I am concerned that unless this action is \ncorrected next year, and this project moved ahead, there will be severe \nconsequences for the future ability of NIST's laboratories to serve \nU.S. industry and science, halting in mid-stream a multi-year project \nthat has garnered strong bipartisan and industrial support. If we allow \nthis construction delay to prevail, the American taxpayer will \nultimately pay a higher dollar, on the order of tens of millions of \ndollars, due to contract termination or suspension costs, costs for \nrestarting the expert team, and inflation. These improvements cannot be \ndelayed much longer and the price of delay is on the taxpayer.\n\n\n                              NTIA GRANTS\n\n  I also note that the original Senate bill cut all funding for the \nCommerce\n\n[[Page S11929]]\n\nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration's [NTIA] \nTechnology and Information Infrastructure Grants Program [TIIAP]. These \nprograms serve an important purpose in connecting public schools, \nlibraries and hospitals to state of the art telecommunication services \nand the Internet, through a highly competitive, cost-shared grant \nprogram. TIIAP programs demand high community involvement to be \nsuccessful. The President's request of $59 million would have funded \napproximately 200 innovative telecommunication application projects and \nwould leverage additional matching funds of over $100 million. To state \nit simply, an education system with out connections to the new \ninformation infrastructure is not a modern education system, and given \nthe demands of a competitive global economy, we must make these \nconnections. To end the NTIA grants would have been a serious error. I \nam pleased that the Continuing Resolution revisited this issue and \nrestored $21.5 millon for this program.\n  To conclude, now is not the time to drop out of the global R race \nand shift toward a path of technology bankruptcy. I was concerned that \nthe cuts in key technology programs originally proposed in the Senate \nAppropriations bill moved in this direction. I am very pleased that the \nContinuing Resolution corrected some of the worst problems in the \nSenate bill. Sen. Hollings, who has long been an able leader in the \nSenate on technology issues, I know strongly shares these concerns. \nAgain, I appreciate his efforts and the efforts of the administration \nand of Chairman Hatfield in negotiating the improvements in this \nContinuing Resolution. Had the corrections not been made, I would have \nbeen concerned that the original bill could have started a process of \nthrowing away tools that are key to building a better future and \nstronger economy for our country.\n\n\n  APPROPRIATIONS FOR DESALINATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR FISCAL \n                          YEARS 1997 AND 1998\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I wish to express my disappointment that \nthe omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997 does not include \nfunding for research and development in the area of converting salt \nwater to fresh water.\n  Although, with the assistance of the Senator from Nevada Mr. [Reid], \nwe did make a breakthrough in this Congress by passing legislation that \nauthorizes funding for research and development into desalination, we \nfailed to appropriate funds for this important research.\n  The United States was the world leader in desalination research \nduring the 1960's, but Federal Government support was eliminated during \nthe 1970's. It is vital that the United States again take the lead in \ndesalination research and technology.\n  We are in a situation where, depending on whose estimates you \nbelieve, in the next 45 to 60 years we will double the world's \npopulation. Our water supply, however, is constant. Clearly, we are \nheaded toward major problems. The reality is the cost of fresh water is \ngradually going up, the cost of desalinating water is gradually coming \ndown, but there is a gap that remains. That gap is going to hurt us \nunless we move in the area of research.\n  Converting salt water to fresh water is currently inexpensive enough \nfor drinking purposes. Almost 90 percent of the water used in the \nworld, however, is for industrial and agricultural purposes. Producing \nenough fresh water from saline water to grow crops and supply factories \nwith water in arid parts of the world remains far too expensive.\n  In a report on desalination authorizing legislation, the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works expressed the significance of \ndesalination research and development, stating, ``The United States \nshould renew its commitment to developing this key technology and once \nagain move the United States to the forefront of desalination \ntechnology and development.''\n  Mr. President, the ability to efficiently convert salt water to fresh \nwater is vital to the future of our country. It is vital to the future \nof civilization. For this reason, I am pleased that the Senator from \nNevada will be taking the lead in assuring that funding for \ndesalination research and development is included in any supplemental \nappropriations for fiscal year 1997, and in specific appropriations for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nIllinois for his leadership on this important issue.\n  I recognize the need for research and development and public \ninvestment in desalination technology. I am pleased to see that \nauthorizing legislation was passed in this Congress for desalination \nresearch, and it was a pleasure to work with the Senator from Illinois \nas a cosponsor of his legislation. I will work to ensure that funds for \ndesalination research and development are appropriated in the 105th \nCongress, through both supplemental appropriations for fiscal year \n1997, and in appropriations for fiscal year 1998.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate is \nprepared to act on and approve the pending omnibus appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1997. I would like to commend the leaders of the \nAppropriations Committee, as well as the majority and minority leaders \nand the White House for their diligence in negotiating this compromise \nappropriations legislation. I am delighted that we have been able to \nput aside our differences and are prepared to pass a bill before the \nstart of the next fiscal year.\n  This compromise stands in stark contrast to the acrimony and bitter \npartisanship that dominated the fiscal year 1996 budget and \nappropriations debate. I know that every one of my colleagues remembers \nthe numerous continuing resolutions--many of them crafted by the \nCongress specifically to draw a Presidential veto--and the multiple \nshutdowns that closed parts of the Government for 27 days last year.\n  We have come a long way since last year's debate. We have come an \nespecially long way in the area of education. The first budget \ndocuments considered by the 104th Congress contained unprecedented, \nextreme, and harmful cuts to education and job training programs.\n  The first budget and appropriations bills considered by this Congress \nproposed an $18 billion reduction in the Pell Grant Program, and a 40-\npercent reduction in the value of individual Pell grants. This Congress \nsuggested $10.6 billion in student loan cuts, a tax on colleges and \nuniversities who participate in the student loan programs, and an \ninterest-rate increase for parents who take out certain loans to help \ntheir children through college. This Congress tried to completely \neliminate the successful and popular direct loan program, and the 6-\nmonth grace period before students must begin to repay loans after \ngraduation.\n  Fortunately, none of these proposals became law. They would have \nincreased the cost of higher education for nearly all of the millions \nof American students who are enrolled in colleges and universities with \nthe help of financial assistance. This backtracking on the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to providing access to higher education would \nhave come at exactly the time the cost of higher education was soaring \nto new heights. According to a study released by the General Accounting \nOffice last month, the cost of public, 4-year colleges and universities \nhas increased 234 percent over the last 15 years--nearly three times as \nmuch median household income.\n  Mr. President, we have come a long way for higher education since \nthose early proposals. Instead of slashing the program and cutting the \nsize of individual Pell grants, the bill before us today increases \nfunding for the program by $1.3 billion, and raises the size of \nindividual awards to $2,700. This bill increases funding for work-study \nprograms by $213 million, providing about 960,000 jobs for low- and \nmiddle-income college students. This bill fully funds the direct loan \nprogram, allowing colleges and universities that choose to do so, to \nenroll in the program at will.\n  The first budget and appropriations bills considered by this Congress \nwould have denied Head Start to 350,000 preschool children, cut 2 \nmillion children off of title I reading and math support, and cut back \nprograms to keep schools safe and drug free for 39 million students. \nThis Congress suggested that it would be appropriate to zero out Goals \n2000, eliminate the National and Community Service Program, and \neliminate summer jobs for millions of American students.\n  Fortunately, none of these proposals became law either--and for the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\ntime since the start of the 104th Congress, the Senate is about to \napprove a measure that increases funding for Head Start, fully funds \nthe title I program and fully funds Goals 2000. For the first time in 2 \nyears, this Congress is poised to make progress toward improving the \nquality of, and expanding access to, educational opportunities for all \nAmericans.\n  I am especially pleased with the increase in funding for education \ntechnology. This bill increases funding for education technology by \nnearly 400 percent over last year, to a record-high $305 million. These \nfunds will help States leverage additional funding to wire schools, \nconnect them to the Internet, train teachers, and provide all of our \nchildren with a 21st century education.\n  We have indeed come a long way, and the legislation before us today \nrepresents a dramatic improvement over proposals initially considered \nby this Congress. There is still much work to be done.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, decades of neglect of the \nfacilities themselves has resulted in $112 billion worth of needed \nrepair, maintenance, and construction, just to bring them up to good, \noverall condition. This price tag does not include the cost of wiring \nour schools for computers and other information technology that our \nchildren must learn in order to remain competitive in the 21st century.\n  The $112 billion price tag does not include the cost of expanding \nfacilities to meet the needs of climbing enrollment. The Department of \nEducation reports that this year's enrollment is the highest ever, and \nthe number of children enrolling in school will continue to climb for \nthe next decade. Next year, I will introduce legislation that will help \nschool districts leverage funds to repair, upgrade, and modernize their \nfacilities so our schools may serve our children in the 21st century.\n  I also intend to examine the increasing unaffordability of college \nnext year when Congress reauthorizes many of the higher education \nprograms. At precisely the time when college is more important to \nopportunity than ever before, we cannot afford to price an increasing \nnumber of middle-class Americans out of a higher education.\n  Mr. President, the 104th Congress has not been friendly to education. \nBill after bill has proposed slashing education funding and limiting \nopportunity for millions of American students. I am very pleased that \nfor the first time the legislation before us today takes a different \ntact, expanding educational opportunities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the 105th Congress to \ncontinue to improve the quality of education for all Americans.\n\n\n                         Privatizing Connie Lee\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of my \nlegislation, included in the continuing resolution, to privatize the \nCollege Construction Loan Insurance Association, better known as Connie \nLee.\n  For 10 years now, I have focused a great deal of attention and effort \non Connie Lee legislation. I was there at its birth in 1986 as the \nauthor of the legislation creating Connie Lee, which passed as a part \nof the Higher Education Act amendments. And, today, as this legislation \nprivatizing Connie Lee passes, I feel like a parent watching a child \ngraduate from college to head out on her own.\n  Connie Lee was created with a vital and focused mission--to assist \ncolleges in the repair, modernization and construction of their \nfacilities. Like many institutions, colleges and universities need \nmulti year financing to keep up with their construction and renovation \nneeds. For institutions with strong financial backing and large \nendowments, issuing bonds and securing capital has not been a major \nproblem. Institutions that are less secure and have a lower bond \nrating, however, face major obstacles in obtaining the necessary \nfinancing.\n  It was clear to us in 1986 that we, as a nation, have a major stake \nin assuring that our higher education institutions sit on a strong \nfoundation--both literally and figuratively. Connie Lee was created to \naddress this need and, since its incorporation in 1987, it has provided \nincreased access to the bond markets for more than 100 needy \ninstitutions through bond insurance. Connie Lee has insured bond issues \ntotaling over $2.5 billion and has assisted institutions such as the \nUniversity of Denver, the University of Massachusetts Medical School, \ncommunity colleges, and numerous other institutions in nearly every \nState.\n  With its significant record, Connie Lee has clearly proven its \nmaturity and strength. Since its founding, Connie Lee has maintained \nits triple-A financial rating, and a recent Standard and Poor's report \nconfirmed its strong financial position. The initial Federal investment \nof $19 million has clearly worked to form a strong and vibrant company, \nready to sever its ties and fully privatize.\n  The privatization language included in this bill is quite \nstraightforward and very similar to the administration's privatization \nbill, which I introduced last June. It repeals the section of the \nHigher Education Act that authorized the creation of Connie Lee and \ngoverns its activities. In addition, it requires that the Secretary of \nthe Treasury sell the Federal Government's 15-percent share in Connie \nLee within the next few months.\n  Mr. President, as simple as it sounds, this legislation is the \nproduct of a great deal of work. I would first like to thank my \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, who has been an incredible \npartner in this effort. I would also like to acknowledge the assistance \nof the Departments of Treasury and Education, the staff of Connie Lee, \nand those in the private sector, who with their broad experience \nprovided invaluable assistance in putting this bill together.\n  In an era when we hear so much about bad government, Connie Lee is an \nexcellent example of how government can and does work well. With a \nmodest Federal investment, Connie Lee has grown to be a dynamo in \nhelping colleges repair their aging facility just as we had hoped in \n1986. Connie Lee will continue this work, but no longer needs our \nventure capital. With this legislation, the Federal Government will \nsell its shares and recoup a good cash return on its original \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, this is good legislation and I look forward to its \npassage as part of the larger continuing resolution.\n\n\n                              Section 208\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the omnibus appropriations bill contains \na provision in the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations area that \nneeds clarification. Section 208 prevents the administration and \ncouncils from using funds to implement any individual fishing quota \n[IFQ] programs until fees are expressly authorized for such programs \nunder the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This fee \nauthority recently passed both the House and Senate and will soon be \nsigned into law by the President, but there is some confusion about the \nimplication of this appropriations provision on a particular IFQ \nprogram designed to regulate bycatch.\n  Section 118 of the Sustainable Fisheries Act amends section 313 of \nthe Magnuson Act to provide authority for the North Pacific Fishery \nManagement Council to establish a Vessel Bycatch Accountability [VBA] \nprogram under section 313(g)(2). As Senator Stevens made clear during \ndebate on the Sustainable Fisheries Act, the authority to collect a fee \nunder section 304(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Magnuson Act for actual costs \ndirectly related to the management and enforcement of IFQ programs \napplies as well to any VBA program created under section 313(g)(2). \nTherefore, the express authorization of fees for a VBA program is \ncontained within the express authorization of IFQ fees in section \n304(d)(2)(A)(i), except that, as Senator Stevens mentioned during the \ndebate, the fees in the VBA fishery should not exceed one percent of \nthe annual ex-vessel value of the target fish in the fishery.\n  It is therefore clear that once the Sustainable Fisheries Act has \nbeen enacted, section 208 will no longer apply to the VBA program I \nhave described. It will in no way prevent the Council from developing \nand the Secretary from approving and implementing a VBA program, \nconsistent with the requirements of section 313(g)(2) and other \nprovisions of the Magnuson Act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur with the Senator from Washington. The express \nauthorization of fees in the Magnuson\n\n[[Page S11931]]\n\nAct to pay for the costs of administering plans, amendments and \nregulations that include IFQ programs results in the repeal of section \n208. Because the VBA program that Senator Murray has described fits \nwithin the definition of an IFQ, upon enactment of the Sustainable \nFisheries Act, the moratorium in section 208 will no longer be \napplicable to the VBA program.\n  As I mentioned in my discussion with Senator Murray about section \n208, the Sustainable Fisheries Act's express authorization of fees to \npay for the costs of administering plans, amendments and regulations \nthat create IFQ programs results in a repeal of section 208. Once the \nPresident signs the Sustainable Fisheries Act, section 208 will be \ncompletely repealed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the chairman for \nreporting out a bill that provides funding for many important programs, \nwhile at the same time moving toward our goal of balancing the budget. \nOf particular interest to me, this bill funds the activities of the \nFederal Communications Commission which is currently undertaking the \nimportant task of implementing the historic Telecommunications Act of \n1996.\n  Mr. President, I would like to raise a concern that many of us have \nrelating to the FCC's implementation of the act, and I would therefore \nask the indulgence of the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \nto allow me to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the \nauthorizing committee, the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the chairman. In addition to advocating a \nregulatory framework that encourages and promotes competition in the \ntelecommunications industry, I have been particularly concerned that \nsmall and entrepreneurial firms are allowed to compete on a level \nplaying field in all industry sectors in the United States and global \neconomies. Indeed, with passage of the Telecommunications Act, Congress \nsought to provide opportunities for small businesses to participate in \nthe telecommunications industry while also moving the entire industry \ntoward a more competitive framework overall. Section 257 of the Act \ndirects the FCC to ``identify and eliminate * * * market entry barriers \nfor entrepreneurs and other small businesses in the provision and \nownership of telecommunications services. * * *''\n  Mr. President, this is very clear and precise language and should \nleave no question as to the intent of Congress on matters relating to \nsmall businesses. Nevertheless, it has come to my attention that the \nFCC, in two recent rulemaking decisions relating to new satellite \nservices, has adopted stringent financial standards, the practical \neffect of which is to erect market entry barriers to telecommunications \nownership by entrepreneurs, small businesses and similar entities.\n  Under the Commission's strict financial standard, applicants are \nrequired to demonstrate financial qualifications either on the basis of \na corporate balance sheet or alternatively, on the basis of fully \nnegotiated, irrevocable funding commitments from outside sources. This \nstandard unfairly favors large corporations who may submit a balance \nsheet as part of their licensing application, regardless of whether the \nfunds reflected on paper are actually committed to the project and even \nthough the corporate giant, like its smaller competitors, will likely \nturn to external financiers and investors to ultimately fund its \nsystem. In fact, the award of all satellite licenses in one of the \nproceedings I refer to have gone to large corporations. In contrast, \napplications from small entrepreneurial companies have been deferred \nbecause they have been held to the stricter test requiring proof that \nfunds have been irrevocably committed by others on behalf of their \nentire project. This is a very high hurdle to clear.\n  Although numerous small businesses, as well as the Small Business \nAdministration and a number of U.S. Senators and Congressmen, have \nraised concerns about these strict financial standards with the FCC, we \nhave received no adequate response from the FCC, nor has the Commission \nmodified its policy in this area.\n  To the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee I ask: Was it \nthe intent of Congress with passage of the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 to encourage the FCC to ease the regulatory framework and \nencourage competition in the telecommunications industry? And, further, \nwas it the intent of Congress that regulations that act as market entry \nbarriers to small and entrepreneurial businesses be identified and \neliminated as soon as possible?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senator is correct. The primary thrust of the \nhistoric act was to ensure increased competition in the \ntelecommunications industry by scaling back regulations and allowing \nfree market forces to operate in this area. The Senator is also correct \nin noting that section 257 of the act specifically directs the \nCommission to identify and dismantle impediments to small business \nownership and provision of telecommunications services.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Any may I then ask: Is \nit true that section 257 of the Telecommunications Act, which ensures \nthat small businesses are not unfairly disadvantaged by Federal \nregulations, was supported by both parties?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senator is correct. This provision, which \noriginated in the other body, was agreed to on a bipartisan basis. \nSection 257 directs the Commission to develop meaningful opportunities \nfor small businesses to participate in the ownership and provision of \ntelecommunications services. This language applies to all Commission \nactivities in the area of telecommunications. It does not make \nexception for activities such as the application of financial \nqualification standards.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I have one final question for the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee for purposes of clarifying that the intent of \nCongress with the Telecommunications Act is to ensure that the \nmarketplace, not the U.S. Government or a regulatory body, decides who \nthe winners and losers in this industry will be. In the case of the \nstrict financial standard imposed by the FCC for satellite system \napplicants, it seems to me that rather than making a judgment on what \nthe FCC may feel is a company's financial ability to compete, perhaps \nthe FCC should focus more on technical considerations for licenses, \nleaving the ultimate success or failure of an applicant to the \nmarketplace where it appropriately belongs. Will the chairman continue \nto work with me and others to ensure that the FCC implements the law \naccording to our intent, particularly as this relates to small and \nentrepreneurial ventures and financial standards applicable to these \nimportant participants?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I can assure my colleagues that the Commerce Committee \nwill closely follow actions taken by the Commission in areas such as \nsatellite licensing to ensure that the intent of Congress is carried \nout. Congress must ensure that the FCC's actions are complementary, not \ncontrary, to the forces of the free market and open competition.\n  Mr. SHELBY: I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for all \nthe work he has undertaken to ensure the American people have access to \nservices which are developed in a free and open marketplace, and I \nthank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for permitting our \ndiscussion of this most important and timely issue.\n\n\n               whitefish point lighthouse land conveyance\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to address the inadvertent \nomission of important report language relating to the transfer of the \nlighthouse at Whitefish Point, MI, from the Coast Guard Authorization \nAct of 1996.\n  Built in 1849, the lighthouse at Whitefish Point was Lake Superior's \nfirst lighthouse. As I am sure my colleague from Michigan, and anyone \nelse familiar with the perils of maritime transport on Lake Superior \nwill tell you, in its 15 decades of operation the lighthouse has \nundoubtedly saved hundreds of lives.\n  In response to the present need to justify budgets, the U.S. Coast \nGuard, working to meet its numerous national priorities, decided to \npermit the transfer of ownership to responsible parties. Several \norganizations stepped forward, and this legislation makes possible the \ntransfer of this historical site to three interested parties: the Great \nLakes Shipwreck Historical Society, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nand the Michigan Audubon Society.\n  Disagreements arose between the interested parties over the ability \nto construct or expand facilities at the site.\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\nAs a conferee to the Coast Guard reauthorization, I developed a \nclarifying clause to be included in the conference report to accompany \nthe bill to try and put this dispute to rest. This language represented \nan agreement between Representative Stupak and myself, and it struck a \nreasonable compromise between the concerned parties. Regrettably, this \nlanguage was not included in the final report as we had come to expect. \nThe aforementioned clause was as follows: ``Nothing in this section is \nto be interpreted as exempting development of the land conveyed under \nthis section from applicable Federal, State or Local laws.''\n  Mr. President, this is a matter that is important to many people in \nthe State of Michigan. It troubles me this language did not make it \ninto the conference report.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret that the language requested by \nthe Senator from Michigan was not included in the report language. I \nwish to assure Senator Abraham and Senator Levin that this was due to \nan administrative oversight. It was the Senate's intent that this \nlanguage be included in the conference report, and to my knowledge, \nthere was no objection in the House.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman and the ranking member for their consideration and all their \nhard work. Their help will ensure that transfer of this property takes \nplace smoothly and it will allow the concerned organizations to focus \ntheir attention and resources toward preserving this rich historical \nsite.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I also wish to thank the Senator from \nAlaska for his willingness to address this matter. And, I appreciate my \ncolleague from Michigan's efforts to move these transfers and to \nclarify the intent of Congress regarding the Whitefish Point transfer. \nThere are important historical preservation and environmental \nprotection issues that must be carefully considered regarding this \nsensitive property and any development that occurs there.\n\n\n                         pesticide data program\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin, the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies, \nMr. Bumpers, the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Mr. Bond, and \nother Senators in a discussion relating to the Pesticide Data Program.\n  It is my understanding that the new pesticide legislation requires \nmore complete and thorough pesticide residue data collection. Because \nof the sequence of passage of the Agriculture Appropriations Act and \nthe Food Quality Protection Act, the Pesticide Data Program, essential \nto collecting pesticide residue data, had been left without funding. \nWould the Senator from Iowa agree with this assessment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Vermont is correct. The Pesticide Data \nProgram, which has been carried out by the Department of Agriculture \nsince 1991, has a proven record of collecting data that is critical to \nthe proper functioning of our pesticide and food safety laws--from the \nperspectives of both consumers and agricultural producers. It should be \nnoted that this program involves contractual agreements with the States \nthat are separate from the existing cooperative agreements for \npesticide enforcement and educational programs between EPA and the \nStates.\n  The program is specifically designed to collect reliable data \nregarding pesticide residues on food as those foods are consumed. This \ndata benefits consumers--and particularly infants and children--because \nregulatory decisions can be based on more accurate assessments of the \nrisks associated with pesticide residues in foods. The data is likewise \nbeneficial to agricultural producers. Using reliable residue data, and \nmore accurate assessments of risk associated with the use of products, \nmay allow some pesticides to remain in use that would otherwise have to \nbe withdrawn, since without the data EPA would have to assume a higher \ntheoretical level of risk from use of a pesticide than is really the \ncase.\n  The Pesticide Data Program has taken on even more importance with \nenactment of the landmark Food Quality Protection Act, which mandates \ncollection of the type of data collected in the Pesticide Data Program \nand depends upon accurate pesticide residue data to work as Congress \nintended. A critical problem arose, though, since no money had been \nappropriated for the Pesticide Data Program in the previously enacted \nagriculture appropriations measure for fiscal 1997.\n  Fortunately, the lack of funding has been taken care of in this \ncontinuing resolution, but I am concerned about the implications of \nproviding the money to EPA rather than to USDA, which has extensive \nexperience and a solid record of success in carrying out the Pesticide \nData Program.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to explain the \nevents that have led to this program being transferred to the VA/HUD \nSubcommittee. This program was previously funded by the Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies and administered \nby the Agricultural Marketing Service through contractual agreements to \nseveral States for residue testing and information collection in the \nfield. Although the Senate bill for fiscal year 1997 USDA spending \ncontained this funding, it was dropped in conference at the insistence \nof the House. It was the sense of the House conferees that since the \nprogram was largely designed to assist the Environmental Protection \nAgency in the reregistration of pesticides, the program would be more \nappropriately funded through EPA.\n  Following passage of the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, Congress enacted \nthe Food Quality Protection Act. The Food Quality Protection Act \nmodified the tolerance-setting process and made the availability of \nactual pesticide residue information more critical than before. During \nnegotiations on the continuing resolution, the question was again \nraised as to the appropriate agency to implement this program. In an \nagreement reached with the House and Senate leadership, and the \nadministration, it was decided to fund this program through the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency for fiscal year 1997.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Can the Senator from Missouri explain what effect this \nchange will have on the collection of residue data?\n  Mr. BOND. This change should have little effect on the collection of \nresidue data. As the Senator from Arkansas explained, the collection of \npesticide residue data is achieved through contractual agreements with \na number of States. This process will continue. The only difference \nwill be that the funding for fiscal year 1997 will flow through the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency rather than the Agricultural Marketing \nService. This 1-year approach will allow a more timely distribution of \nfunds to the States than would otherwise occur if they first had to be \ntransferred to USDA.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I notice the statement of managers also contends that \nwhile the program will be managed by the Environmental Protection \nAgency during the initial stages of implementing the Food Quality \nProtection Act, that future funding should be provided by a more \nappropriate Federal agency. I might point out that section 301(c) of \nthe Food Quality Protection Act mandates that the Secretary of \nAgriculture ensure the residue data collection activities are carried \nout in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nDepartment of health and Human Services. Would it be the understanding \nof the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Missouri that \ncoordination should continue between the Environmental Protection \nAgency and the Agricultural Marketing Service to determine how best to \nmanage this program in the future in light of the recent passage of the \nFood Quality Protection Act?\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. While the Statement of Managers does indicate that \ntransfers to other Federal agencies should not occur in fiscal year \n1997, I agree with the Senator from Missouri that this was in order to \ndistribute funds more efficiently to the participant States. The Food \nQuality Protection Act has only been signed into law a few weeks and we \ndo not yet fully know the extent to which it will enhance the need for \nthe information provided by the Pesticide Data Program.\n  I certainly expect the Department of Agriculture to explain fully its \nviews of how best to proceed with this program in hearings before our \nsubcommittee\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\nnext spring. With the expectation that Congress will determine the \ncollection of this information is imperative due to the changes in the \npesticide registration laws, I would hope that the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Agricultural Marketing Service continue to \ncoordinate efforts and work together. I would further expect that \nfiscal year 1997 funds not be restricted in such a way as to make this \ncoordination difficult. If, as suggested in the Statement of Managers, \nthere is a more appropriate Federal agency than the Environmental \nProtection Agency to implement this program, that Federal agency should \nbe allowed to work with the Environmental Protection Agency and leave \nthe final decision for fiscal year 1998 to the Appropriations \nCommittees of the House and Senate.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the views of the Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                       GUN FREE SCHOOL ZONES ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today we enact the Gun Free School Zones \nAct, a measure designed to undo the damage done by Supreme Court's \ndecision in United States versus Lopez. In that 1995 decision, the \nSupreme Court by a slim 5 to 4 margin struck down an earlier version of \nthis legislation, holding that it exceeded Congress' commerce clause \npower in the Constitution.\n  Today we address the Supreme Court's concerns. We do not defy them. \nYet we do not let their easily addressable concerns stop us from doing \nwhat is right--doing everything we can to stop the violence in our \nschools. The Gun-Free School Zones Act is a commonsense, bipartisan, \nconstitutional approach to combating violence in our schools. It bars \nbringing a gun within 1,000 feet of a school, with a few commonsense \nexceptions. We also now require in this new version that in each \nprosecution the Government prove that the gun ``moved in or * * * \notherwise affected interstate commerce.'' This is the only change \nbetween the prior law and this new law.\n  We enact this measure under our commerce clause authority. We have \nheld hearings on it, and we have heard from prosecutors, law \nprofessors, teachers, and policemen. They all tell us that interstate \ncommerce is what is causing the problem of gun violence in schools. The \nproblem of school violence is a national one that begs for national \nattention. Anyone who argues that the problem is an exclusively \nintrastate problem is not looking at the evidence. Interstate commerce \nis creating this problem.\n  Sometimes these guns get into children's hands through the efforts of \nnationwide gangs. One 14-year-old Madison, WI gang member told the \nWisconsin State Journal that the older leaders of his gang brought \ncarloads of guns from Chicago to the younger gang members. The Boston \npolice recently discovered that all of the handguns being bought by \ngang members in one neighborhood came from Mississippi. The young man \nwho was running guns up to Boston was arrested and shootings in the \nneighborhood dropped more than 60 percent, from 91 to 20. And in New \nYork, Federal agents traced 4,000 guns seized there to a single store \nin Alabama.\n\n  The unchecked proliferation of guns and their delivery into the hands \nof school-aged children is national in scope. The raw materials for \nguns are mined in one State, are turned into guns in another State, and \nare put into a child's hands in another State. The gangs that arm these \nchildren and encourage them to bring guns to school operate across \nState lines.\n  These guns have infiltrated our school system and created a national \ncrisis. A Lou Harris survey this year found that one in eight youths--\ntwo in five in high-crime neighborhoods--reported having carried a gun \nfor protection. One in nine said they had stayed away from school \nbecause of fear of violence. That number jumped to one in three in high \ncrime neighborhoods.\n  The effects of guns in schools stretches across this Nation. Schools \nand districts with particularly bad gun problems sink deeper and deeper \ninto despair. They have difficulty procuring Federal aid or grants from \nnational foundations. People will not move from out-of-state to that \nschool area because they do not want their children in dangerous \nschools. Businesses will not relocate or establish themselves in areas \nwith dangerous school zones.\n  Finally, and perhaps most tragically, the children in those schools \nare prevented from learning their ABC's. All they learn is to live in \nterror. Children from Maine to Wisconsin to Alabama to Oregon go to \nschool in fear--fear that they may be shot, that their school day will \nconsist of nothing but dodging from one perilously dangerous situation \nto another. These children cannot learn and the educational system \ncannot teach. Our national economy is crippled.\n\n  The Federal Government has a role to play in combating this national \nproblem. We must put the full weight and investigative abilities of the \nFederal Government behind the drive to keep guns out of school. No \nState should be forced to stand alone in confronting this problem.\n  Although many States have their own laws, we need a Federal law for \ntwo reasons: first, many of these State laws are inadequate; and \nsecond, a Federal law will serve as a critical support and backup \nsystem for state law enforcement officials.\n  But before dealing with these reasons, I want to point out that the \nmeasure we pass today will not hamper, preempt, or harm the enforcement \nof those laws in any way whatsoever.\n  Although State laws can help address this national problem, not every \nState has a law. And not every State law is adequately drafted to do \nthe job. Moreover, in many of these States, people do not serve any \ntime for violating the law. In Federal cases, they do. With a Federal \nlaw, we can fill in loopholes and put violators behind bars for up to 5 \nyears. In short, the Gun-Free School Zones Act gives prosecutors the \nflexibility to bring violators to justice under either State or Federal \nstatutes, whichever is appropriate--or tougher.\n  Some States do not have laws which deal with guns in schoolyards. In \naddition, of the forty-plus States that have laws, almost half of them \nsimply make it a misdemeanor to bring a gun into school. Unfortunately, \nthat has almost no effect on a juvenile who knows that a juvenile \nmisdemeanor record is virtually meaningless. A stiff Federal penalty \nmeans a lot more.\n  Some of the States also have weak laws. Take, for example, Alabama. \nAlabama requires that the person charged have brought the gun to school \nwith intent to do bodily harm. So you can bring a gun to school, \ndisrupt and frighten all of the students but still get off because you \ndid not intend to actually shoot anyone. That is unacceptable. \nAlabama's statute also only applies to guns on public school grounds. \nPrivate schools are uncovered, so anyone can walk into a parochial or \nprivate school with a gun and without a fear of prosecution.\n  And there is still another reason why a Federal law is needed. We \nneed Federal and State cooperation to deal with this problem. The \nStates need our help. Sometimes they are overwhelmed and need backup. \nOther times, they want to use stiffer Federal penalties. This Gun-Free \nSchool Zones Act will not preempt a single state law. And after decades \nof dealing with complimentary Federal-State laws, good State and \nFederal prosecutors know how to coordinate their efforts--and Federal \nprosecutors know to step aside when the State has a stiffer law. Just \nask Bob Wortham, the former Texas U.S. attorney nominated by Senator \nGramm. Mr. Wortham prosecuted more people under the Gun-Free School \nZones Act than anyone else. And he did it while getting rave reviews \nfrom State police, prosecutors, and teachers. This act is a modest but \nuseful measure that surely cannot threaten our State governments.\n  You will not hear State officials complaining about meddling Federal \nofficials. Instead, State officials welcome Federal assistance in this \narea. The Gun-Free School Zones Act assures a Federal-State joint \nventure.\n  Mr. President, our measure is clearly constitutional. The original \nGun-Free School Zones Act was struck down in United States versus \nLopez. But in drafting this proposal, we consulted with the Justice \nDepartment and a variety of legal experts who carefully scrutinized \nthis bill and concluded it would easily pass the Lopez test.\n  In fact, the very provision that has been inserted into the bill to \nmake it constitutional was suggested by a section in the Chief \nJustice's opinion in Lopez. In a portion of that opinion, the\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\nChief Justice noted that if the law ``contain[ed] * * * [a] \njurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case \ninquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate \ncommerce,'' then the law would probably be constitutional.\n  By requiring an explicit connection with or effect on interstate \ncommerce, as our new law will require, Congress will be clearly \nregulating interstate commerce pursuant to its constitutional commerce \nclause power. There are many known instances of gangs traveling to \nother States to equip themselves with guns which they then bring into \nschools. That is what this bill seeks to regulate: the travel of guns \nthrough interstate commerce to our schoolhouse steps.\n  This measure does not, as a few opponents have argued, pave the way \nto Federal regulation of State education. Education is first and last \nthe business of the State governments, and so it will remain. This law \ndoes not get the Federal Government in the business of regulating \nschools. It simply keeps the Government in the business of controlling \nthe interstate commerce in guns. Since this bill rests on the Federal \nGovernment's power to regulate interstate gun commerce, it cannot be \nused to justify Federal regulation of State education.\n  It does not make much sense to treat a modest and sensible proposal \nas a major threat to the Federal-State balance. Our Founding Fathers \nwere concerned with common sense, not with alarmist predictions about \nthe fate of Federal-State relations.\n  Mr. President, no one claims that our legislation is a panacea. No \none claims that the violence will go away if we pass it, just as the \nviolence did not go away when the original law was passed. But a \nFederal law can help. The Federal Government can step in and assist \nState prosecutors when they do not have the resources they need. The \nFederal Government can take on particularly bad offenders who will \nreceive stiffer penalties in a Federal prosecution. Today, we have \nlived up to our obligation to help.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not want to delay the vote very much \nbecause I know there are a number of commitments involved. I am \nprepared to use some leader time to wrap up if the former chairman and \nthe ranking member would like to go first.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have about 3 minutes. I wish to take just \na few minutes to commend the work of several key people. I commend the \nHouse Democratic leader, Mr. Gephardt, who played a very important role \nin the negotiations that took place during last week. He led the House \nand Senate Democrats in that historic budget agreement in 1990, and \nproved himself to be very knowledgeable and capable in matters of the \nFederal budget and, again, confirmed my judgment of his capabilities.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the Speaker of \nthe House, Mr. Gingrich. Congressman Gingrich is one of the most \ninteresting personalities that has appeared on the political stage in \nthe last quarter century, and his participation in the negotiating \nprocess was key to the success of this agreement.\n  On the Senate side, the tireless work of our two leaders is also to \nbe commended. For the Democrats, Senator Daschle has proved to be a \nvery effective minority leader. As a former leader, I know well the \ndifficult tasks he faces in leading the Senate Democrats, but he has \nbeen diligent in his efforts to protect Senators' interests while at \nthe same time trying to reach consensus as the Senate seeks to complete \nits work.\n  The Republican leader, Senator Lott, since assuming his \nresponsibilities upon the departure of Senator Dole, has carried out \nhis responsibilities very capably.\n  He has worked well with the minority leader and Senators on both \nsides of the aisle in moving the Senate's business, and particularly in \nrelation to the resolution just agreed to, he was deeply involved and \nmost helpful in reaching this agreement. Several thorny issues were \npresented to the Senate majority leader and to the other leaders for \ntheir final resolution. And they comported themselves admirably and \nwell.\n  I commend all of the staff who were involved in this very difficult \nnegotiations on this omnibus appropriation bill. For the majority \nleader, David Hoppe, and for the minority leader, Larry Stein, were \ninvolved at every stage of the process and helped resolve many \ndifficult issues as they arose. I also commend the full committee staff \nof the Appropriations Committee for their tireless efforts and \ndedicated work: Keith Kennedy, Mark Van de Water, and Dona Pate for the \nmajority and Jim English, Terry Sauvain, Dick D'Amato, and Mary Dewald \nfor the minority, as well as my chief of staff Barbara Videnieks. Most \nespecially, Mr. President, I congratulate and thank the professional \nstaff on both sides of the aisle of each subcommittee, without whom we \nwould not have been able to have reached this agreement as successfully \nand effectively as we have. As I have said many times in the past, the \nstaff of the Senate Appropriations Committee is one of the finest staff \non Capitol Hill, and they have proved themselves so to be, once again, \nthroughout this entire session and, in particular, during the last \nweek.\n  Last, Mr. President, I note with regret that this is the last \nappropriation bill to be managed by the very able and distinguished \nSenator from Oregon, my colleague and friend, Senator Hatfield. He is a \nmost remarkable public servant, and a man of great integrity and \nindependence, who has always striven throughout his public career to do \nwhat is right for the people of the State of Oregon and the Nation, \nrather than what may be politically popular at any given point in time. \nI compliment Mark Hatfield on an outstanding Senate career and, \nparticularly, for his outstanding service on the Appropriations \nCommittee and for the extraordinary manner in which he has led that \ncommittee during his 8 years as its chairman.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I, too, want to take just a few moments to \nthank a few people who worked to achieve this final product.\n  It is unlike any appropriations bill I ever saw. It may not be \nperfect, but this one is large. It has been involved in a long process.\n  I think the result is good, and we are going to get our work done. \nThere is not going to be the threat of having to go with the extra \ncontinuing resolutions, dragging it out, and the threats of potential \nGovernment shutdowns or any of that sort of thing. We got the work \ndone. That is a very important feature.\n  I want to say that it could not have happened without the \nextraordinary leadership, the calmness, the demeanor, and the knowledge \nof the chairman of the committee, Senator Mark Hatfield. This is, \nobviously, the last appropriations bill he will handle in his career. I \nhave said this about him before, but I think it is certainly true here \ntonight. He has certainly fought the good fight, he has finished the \nrace with this monumental achievement here, and he has kept the faith \nwith himself, his constituents, and with the Senate. I thank you very \nmuch for the great work that you have done on this bill and some other \nbills, Mr. Chairman.\n  Also, to the ranking member, Senator Byrd. I have found that he has \nalways unfailingly been available, cooperative, and helpful in this and \nall matters. He is in many ways the conscience of the Senate. He \nreminds us of things we need to do and the way we should act, and he \nknows so much about what is in this bill, as in every bill. We \nappreciate the very fine cooperation from the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  And to the very fine staff--Keith Kennedy, Jim English. It just \nwouldn't have been possible without all the many long hours that they \nhave put in. They have to be exhausted. I don't know how many nights \nthey went without much sleep, or any sleep. I know that sort of thing \nhas happened before, but I have never seen it to the degree that I have \nthis time up close. They did great work, and we thank you very much for \nthat work.\n  I just have to mention the subcommittee chairman and ranking member \nwho worked so hard. They have had to make compromises, and they are not \nvery happy with some of it. But the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, and State, Senator Judd Gregg, and the\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\nranking member, Senator Fritz Hollings, and the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Defense, Ted Stevens, did a great job.\n  This is one of the best parts of this whole effort, in my opinion. \nThe defense bill provides what is needed for the defense of our \ncountry. Ted Stevens really stayed with it, and, also, of course, his \npartner in managing this legislation, the Senator from Hawaii, Senator \nInouye.\n  Senator Mitch McConnell on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee had \ntwo of the thorniest issues of all to work out. Yet, we came to an \nagreement with regard to the funding and with regard to the language \nconcerning the Mexico City issue. Without Senator McConnell's efforts \nand without the long hours, it would not have happened; and the ranking \nmember there, Senator Pat Leahy.\n  The Interior Committee, Senator Slade Gorton and the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia had a very important part in getting that \npackage together. There was a lot of language that was controversial \nthere.\n  Senator Specter and Senator Harkin on the very large subcommittee \nportion--Labor, Health and Human Services.\n  And, finally, the Treasury-Postal Service, Senator Shelby and Senator \nKerrey. Senator Shelby was there with us at about 1 a.m. on Saturday \nmorning because there were some unresolved issues.\n  There are many members of my own staff that I would like to have \ntheir names put in the Record because of the long hours that they put \ninto working with different sections of this bill: My chief of staff, \nDavid Hoppe, and Alison Carroll, my deputy chief of staff, who is here \nwith me today. Also, Bill Gribbin, Susan Connell, Mike Solon, Susan \nIrby, Randy Scheunemann, Rolf Lundberg, and Kyle McSlarrow.\n  I emphasize this point: We came to an agreement. We have a very large \nbill to keep the Government operating. We did add $6.5 billion more \nthan what had come out of committees, but it was paid for.\n  We had some very important additions that were put in because of \ndisasters, particularly the effort that we made to provide assistance \nin the Western States and for the damage from Hurricane Fran. We added \n$350 million to amounts already appropriated, guaranteeing at least \n$500 million would be available for relief of victims of Hurricane \nFran. That is thanks to Senator Helms, because he knew what the people \nof North Carolina needed and what would be necessary to repair the \ndamage from that tremendous storm.\n  When you go through the places where additions were made, many of \nthem are the right things to do to stand up for what should be done for \nthis country.\n  For the National Institutes of Health, we provided a total of $12.7 \nbillion, which is over the President's request.\n  A variety of education programs, including Head Start and the Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools program had increases.\n  Title I is now at $7.7 billion.\n  We added additional funding for college education, for loans and for \ngrants.\n  We added additional funding to the Justice Department to implement \nthe Violence Against Women Act and programs to fight crime.\n  When you go through this list, there are many, many programs where \nthe additions will serve the American people well. It is the right \nthing to do. I am pleased to be able to support this legislation.\n  I think it has the right mood about it, the right tone about it, and \nit has been bipartisan. It will, I think, serve us well as we go into \nthe session next year.\n  Mr. President, I am inclined to look upon this legislation, H.R. \n4278, the omnibus consolidated appropriations bill, like an expected \nfather who is suddenly presented with quadruplets. It is an awful lot \nto take at one time.\n  And yet, the more familiar you become with the enormous package, the \nmore there is to like.\n  First and most important, we accomplished what the American people \nwanted us to do: We avoided a fiscal crisis that would have led to a \ngovernment shutdown at midnight tonight.\n  For the record, I have to note that it would have been far preferable \nif we had passed the various appropriation bills one by one, instead of \nin this huge and unwieldy package. But what was not to be.\n  We all know what happened to many of those bills here in the Senate, \nand why I had to take them down, and why it was pointless for me to \neven bring up some of them. All that we can leave to the historians of \nthe Congress.\n  What is now before us is a bipartisan package, worked out in long--\nvery long--face-to-face deliberations between the Republican leadership \nof the House and Senate and senior administration officials.\n  If I attempted to individually name all those who played crucial \nroles in its development, I might be mistaken for a Senator \nfilibustering the FAA bill. So I will note particularly Chairman Mark \nHatfield's diligent pursuit of an acceptable outcome, knowing that he \nwill share the credit with the other members of his committee who \nworked, sometimes through the night, to get this work done and well \ndone.\n  Enormous as this legislation is--it spends some $600 billion, \nincluding $6.5 billion more than congressional Republicans had \noriginally planned to spend--it is deficit neutral. It is paid for. We \nrefused to add to the Nation's debt.\n  Working within that understanding, we managed to devote almost $1 \nbillion to the fight against terrorism. We came up with $8.8 billion to \ncombat drug abuse and the drug traffic. We allotted $650 million for \nfire emergencies in our western States.\n  And because of the relentless efforts of Senator Helms, we added $350 \nmillion to amounts already appropriated, guaranteeing that at least \n$500 million will be available for relief of victims of hurricane Fran. \nThanks to Senator Helms, the people of North Carolina will have to \nresources to rebuild from the storm, especially in the hard-hit city of \nRaleigh.\n  For the National Institutes of Health, we provided a total of $12.7 \nbillion--almost $400 million over the President's request.\n  A variety of education programs also fared well in this legislation. \nThe Headstart program is now up to almost $4 billion. The Safe and \nDrug-Free Schools program is at $556 million. Title 1, our basic \nprogram of aid to schools with large numbers of poor children, now \nstands at $7.7 billion.\n  Student aid at the college level has dramatically increased by $3.3 \nbillion to a total, in both grants and loans, of $41.6 billion. The \nannual Pell Grant will have its largest one-year increase ever, to a \nmaximum of $2,700.\n  This is more than just a spending bill, however. It is an important \nanticrime bill. That is why we directed resources to the Department of \nJustice, with special attention to implementing the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Mr. President, the American people did not want us to adjourn for the \nyear without tackling the problem of illegal immigration. This bill is \nour tough answer to that demand.\n  It tightens border enforcement by doubling the border patrol and \nauthorizing a triple fence barrier along our southern border. It cracks \ndown on alien smuggling. It will speed up the exclusion and deportation \nof illegal aliens, and it funds 2,700 detention cells. By the way, \nthat's 2,000 more than the President wanted.\n  This bill includes our entire Defense appropriation, the foundation \nof our national security effort. And it includes funding for the \ninternational activities which are essential for the continuance of \nwhat we have won at such great cost: peace through strength.\n  It is not a perfect bill. But in all my years in the House and \nSenate, I have never yet seen a perfect appropriation bill. It is, \nhowever, a good bill, thoughtfully constructed and prudently funded. It \nis a necessary bill, which the American people expect us to pass \nwithout delay.\n  With pride in what we have accomplished, and with relief in what we \nhave avoided, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3610.\n  The report will be stated.\n  The clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3610) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 28, 1996.)\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to discuss \nthe conference agreement for the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. This is a very good agreement, one that I believe all Members \nshould support.\n  The conference agreement provides $243.9 billion, an increase of $9.3 \nbillion from the amount requested, and $500 million more than \nappropriated last year. The amount is nearly $1 billion less than \nprovided by the Senate. While the total bill is lower than that passed \nby the Senate, the conference agreement protects the priorities of the \nSenate.\n  I believe as my colleagues review the bill they will see that the \nconferees, under the leadership of Senator Stevens, forged a compromise \nwhich fulfills our constitutional requirement to provide for the common \ndefense.\n  This bill in many ways improves the administration's budget request. \nFirst, the bill increases funding for operations and maintenance by \n$700 million to protect readiness. This includes: $600 million for \nfacilities renovation and repair; $150 million for ship depot \nmaintenance, to fund 95 percent of the Navy's identified \nrequirement; $148 million for identified contingency costs for overseas \noperations, such as Bosnia; and $165 million for the President's \ncounterdrug initiatives.\n\n  Second, the bill adds $590 million to fully fund health care costs \nidentified by the surgeons general and DOD health affairs. This will \nallow our men and women in uniform access to the health care that they \ndeserve.\n  Third, it recommends $137.5 million for breast cancer research, $45 \nmillion for prostate cancer research, and $15 million for AIDS \nresearch.\n  Fourth, the bill has fully provided for the pay and allowances of our \nmilitary personnel, including a 3-percent pay raise and a 4 percent \nincrease in quarters allowances.\n  Clearly, these few examples demonstrate that the conferees have \nresponded to the needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  The bill also provides $43.8 billion for procurement of equipment, an \nincrease of $5.6 billion above the request. This increase will provide \nfor many of the high priority needs identified by our commanders in the \nfield.\n  The administration identified several issues in the House bill that \nit opposes. The conferees have responded to nearly all of its concerns, \nrejecting restrictive legislative provisions, and funding \nadministration priorities.\n  Chairman Stevens and the managers on the part of the House have done \na masterful job in keeping this bill clean. It safeguards our national \ndefense, the priorities of the Senate, and rejects controversial \nriders.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this is a very good bill. I am strongly in \nfavor of its recommendations and I sincerely believe it should have the \nbipartisan support of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I signed the conference report--with reservation. I \nwant my colleagues to understand that I have no reservations regarding \nthe agreement on defense matters.\n  I do have reservations on the process by which several extraneous \nmatters have been added to the DOD conference report. I understand that \nthis was done in the interest of time. However, I must say that I do \nnot think it is appropriate for entire appropriation bills--which have \nnever been brought before the Senate--to be incorporated into a \nconference report.\n  I intend to vote for this measure because of the many worthy programs \nfunded.

Mr. President, I am glad we have that vote behind us. I \nknow Senators are very interested in how we will proceed and what will \nbe the next subject we will take up.\n  Before I get to a unanimous consent request, I would like to inform \nall Senators, I know a lot are interested in what is happening with \nregard to the parks bill. We are still working on that. As most of you \nknow, the House did pass a different parks bill from the omnibus bill \nthat had been pending here. The conference report on the omnibus parks \nbill had been pending here, I guess, for 3 or 4 days. They moved \nanother bill with a fewer number of parks in it, I think somewhere \naround 104 park projects, and then they added some heritage trails, 9 \nor 10 of those. So we have a bill pending here.\n  Still, some very important parks were not included in that list that \ncame back from the House. Some of those are in Colorado, which is \nreally hard to understand why they were not left in, some in Alaska, \nbut several that really have a lot of support.\n  We have been working with the Senator from California and the Senator \nfrom Alaska to see if we can find a way to come to agreement of how we \ncan get that legislation passed and address the concerns that are still \nout there.\n  That effort is still underway. We are working with the \nadministration. Senator Murkowski has been talking with White House \nofficials in the last couple of hours. That effort is still underway. \nWe don't know how we are going to be able to get it done or when. We \nare still working on it. As soon as we can get an agreement, we will \nmake that announcement. I hope it can be done in\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\nsuch a way that a recorded vote is not necessary, but we are not to \nthat point yet.\n\n  The business at hand is the FAA reauthorization bill. We cannot leave \nwithout getting that reauthorization done.\n  On Saturday, I had a unanimous consent request that we were prepared \nto propound, which we thought was going to be accepted, that the Senate \nturn to the consideration of the conference report to accompany the FAA \nreauthorization bill and that we would have a cloture vote on Monday, \ntoday, at 5 o'clock.\n  Because of the desire to notify the Members that we would not have \nfurther recorded votes on Saturday, I made that announcement so \neverybody would know, and that made it possible for this cloture effort \nto be blocked, in effect. The indications were that, ``Well, we're \ngoing to have a scorched Earth effort and we might require all kinds of \nprocedural votes,'' and we couldn't get to forcing this to a head after \nthat particular move over the weekend.\n  So we are finding ourselves where we are now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11936-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n\n                           Motion to Proceed\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3539, the \n     F.A.A. bill:\n\n         Larry Pressler, Fritz Hollings, John McCain, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, John Ashcroft, Ted Stevens, Slade Gorton, \n           Bill Frist, Trent Lott, Fred Thompson, Al Simpson, \n           Craig Thomas, Conrad Burns, Frank H. Murkowski, Olympia \n           Snowe, Wendell Ford.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to read or present a \nstatement as to what I am doing so everybody will understand exactly \nwhat is going on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order. Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there is broad bipartisan support for this \nlegislation in its present form. So the purpose of this action just \ntaken is to produce a cloture vote with respect to the FAA conference \nreport.\n  Since Senator Kennedy and others have blocked consideration of that \nconference report and are insisting on the report being read by the \nclerk, this cloture vote is only on the motion to proceed to the \nconference report. As all Senators know, the motion to proceed to a \nconference report is not debatable. Therefore, under the Senate rules, \na cloture vote to limit debate is not necessary.\n  However, this vote, if invoked, would represent to the Senate that \nthe votes are, in fact, there to adopt the conference report, and I \nbelieve it would be an overwhelming vote, probably well over 65, maybe \n70 votes. I hope that the objectors will see their way clear to allow \nthis vote to occur yet tonight.\n  That was one important point I wanted to make so that everybody would \nbe on notice we could have a vote tonight, and if the prerequisite 60 \nvotes are obtained, they realize this bill is going to go forward, the \nSenate intends to adopt the conference report immediately following the \ncloture vote or after a brief period of debate.\n  So I urge all colleagues to consider this request, and I will be \nvisiting with the Democratic leader, who has been working with me \ntrying to find a way to move this legislation through to conclusion.\n  I remind our colleagues that if we did change it, even, and send it \nback to the House, there is no guarantee that it would get through the \nHouse. In fact, I have been led to believe the House will not accept it \nif there is a change, putting us basically in the same position we are \nin.\n  What we need to do is to pass this legislation in the form that it \npresently exists, and it is my intent to move it forward one way or the \nother until we can get an agreement as to how we can come to a \nconclusion, where there is an overwhelming majority, a supermajority of \nthe Senate who wants to do this.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the majority \nleader. For those of us who have observed that there was an inclusion \nin the FAA legislation that was targeted to one special interest, one \nspecial company that would have affected their labor relations, and \nadded, and has virtually nothing to do with the FAA--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is not a debatable motion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor. Mr. \nPresident, I believe I have the floor. I asked for recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to a conference report \nis not a debatable motion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I asked for recognition. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe it is not debatable, but I rise \njust to say we have not been able to work out anything. The opponents \nof this legislation are insisting on going forward with procedural \nvotes, and I think maybe that is the best way to go. So if the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts wants to make a motion now on a procedural vote \nwhich goes to the substance of the issue, we should go ahead and have \nthat vote, and it could be followed by other votes.\n\n\n                Motion to Postpone the Motion to Proceed\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a motion to postpone to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] moves to \n     postpone the motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     conference report to accompany H.R. 3539 to October 3, \n     1996.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I voted, reluctantly, for the continuing \nresolution. Clearly, we had to pass this measure because, without it, \nvital government functions would have shut down and hard-won \ninvestments in education and other Democratic priorities would not be \nmade.\n  We are here, on the last day of the fiscal year, passing a massive \nomnibus bill, because the majority party has failed to do its work. \nInstead of moving through the normal appropriations process, with the \nopportunity to consider individual bills and amendments, we were forced \nto vote, up or down, on a bill put together in only the last few days.\n  I object to this process because it does not allow the consideration \nof the resolution's specific provisions that ought to be debated \nseparately and out in the open. I have a particular interest in one of \nthose provisions, Mr. President, because it affects my constituents in \nwestern Kentucky. I am referring to the bill's earmark of $3 million to \ncreate a national wildlife refuge in the Kentucky Counties of Marshall, \nGraves, and McCracken.\n  Earlier this month, I announced my intention to offer an amendment to \nthe Interior appropriations bill that would have redirected this $3 \nmillion to another wilderness area that is sorely underfunded, the Land \nBetween the Lakes. In the interest of keeping the government open, I \naid not offer that amendment today, but I would like to take a moment \nand explain what is at issue for the people of western Kentucky.\n  We have been told, Mr. President, that the provision in the \ncontinuing resolution is needed because Kentucky is the only state \nwithout a national wildlife refuge. This is simply not the case. In \nfact, large parts of two Federal wildlife refuges--the Ohio River \nIslands and the Reelfoot National Wildlife Refuges--lie within \nKentucky. Together, they total about 2,200 acres. In addition to these \nareas, there are numerous state-run wildlife refuges and wilderness \nareas in Kentucky. So when supporters of the refuge tell us that \nKentucky is the only state without a refuge, they're not telling us the \nwhole story.\n  When we pass this continuing resolution, Mr. President, we will be \nappropriating $3 million for the refuge. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService tells me that it'll cost another $17 million to actually create \nthe refuge. Supporters of the refuge will be back next year, and the \nyear after that, looking for more money.\n  Meanwhile, the Land Between the Lakes, a 170,000 acre preserve \nlocated just 15 miles away from the proposed refuge, continues to go \nbegging. Due to budget cuts over the last several years, the main \nnorth-south roadway through the Land Between the Lakes has fallen into \ndisrepair; the Brandon Springs Resident Center, which serves \nunderprivileged and disabled children from around the nation, has been \nforced to put needed repairs on hold; and the Youth Station, which \nprovided environmental education for children, including my own \ngrandchildren has closed its doors.\n  Mr. President, we will probably hear that the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority [TVA] got everything it asked for regarding the Land Between \nthe Lakes. Don't be mislead. Last year, the TVA put together an options \nplan for how to commercialize the preserve and replace the federal \nmoney it receives. Now, the plan to commercialize was soundly rejected \nby Kentuckians. However, the plan points out that, simply to keep the \nLand Between the Lakes running would require $11.5 million annually. \nReducing basic services to include only basic camping, limited lake \naccess and the like would cost $6.5 million. And how much was \nappropriated for the Land Between the Lakes this year? Only $6 million! \nAnd out of that $6 million is a $900,000 bill for security that used to \nbe paid for by the TVA. Clearly, funding for the Land Between the Lakes \nis far from adequate. And without federal support, the Land Between the \nLakes will be forced to go commercial. I will not stand by and let that \nhappen.\n  What is likewise galling to me, Mr. President, is that the people who \nlive in and around the area of the proposed refuge don't support it. \nThe head of the Marshall County Soil and Water Conservation District \ntold me that ``our opposition to making a federal wildlife refuge of \nthe East Fork of Clark's River stems from the overwhelming opposition \nof landowners and tenants in the proposed area.'' This statement is \nborne out by the letters and phone calls I have received and by \narticles in local papers like the Paducah ``Sun'' and the Murray \n``Ledger-Times.'' A constituent from Benton told me that ``farmers and \nothers affected by the proposed refuge should be consulted. We have not \nbeen contacted.''\n  It is possible that sometime today, supporters of the refuge will \nagain bring out a list of 57 groups that support the refuge. As I have \nsaid before, I am sure each one is a fine organization. But not one is \nfrom the affected counties and the closest one is a hundred miles away \nfrom where the proposed refuge would be located.\n  Now, I want to be clear: I am not opposed to the creation of another \nnational wildlife refuge in Kentucky. But I am opposed to creating a \nwildlife refuge that endangers the funding for the Land Between the \nLakes and doesn't have the support of the Kentuckians who will be \naffected by its creation. A constituent from nearby Crittenden County \ntold me that ``it's hard to believe that LBL would continue to be \nproperly funded with the addition of a $20 million refuge.'' He's \nright. We should, in the words of Marshall County's judge-executive, \n``take care of what we've got before we open'' a new nature preserve.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, by including this $3 million earmark in \nthe continuing resolution, we aren't taking care of what we've got. We \nare taking on another obligation at a time when we are hard-pressed to \nmeet existing responsibilities. I hope that next year, the Senate will \nbe able to consider all thirteen appropriations bills in the normal \nprocess so that these matters can be discussed out in the open. The \npeople of western Kentucky deserve a chance for their voices to be \nheard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11937-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11938-S11940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FEDERAL AVIATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 3539, The Federal Aviation \n     Administration Reauthorization bill.\n       Trent Lott, Don Nickles, Strom Thurmond, Jon Kyl, Judd \n     Gregg, Slade Gorton, Paul D.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \non cloture at 10 a.m. on Thursday, October 3, that there be 1 hour for \ndebate to be equally divided between the two leaders prior to the \ncloture vote, a mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived; I further \nask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, October 1, there be 3 hours of \ndebate, equally divided between the two leaders, on the conference \nreport and 3 hours equally divided in the same fashion on Wednesday, \nOctober 2, both days for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank all who have been involved in \nworking out this agreement. I think it is in the best interest of the \nSenate. It is a fair way to deal with this important legislation that \ninvolves airport infrastructure and safety. This way, we will have \nample time to have debate on Tuesday and Wednesday. We will get a vote \non cloture on Thursday, and then we will be able to work toward a final \nvote, also on Thursday. So I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the leader will yield, I want to commend all Senators \nfor this action and thank the leader for his determination, and the \nDemocratic leader also for being patient and finding a way to bring \nthis matter to a close.\n  Under the circumstances--and I have discussed this with the \nParliamentarian--this means that we will vote before the week is out on \nthe FAA bill. For that reason, I do withdraw all the objections that I \nfiled to the matters pending. We have been waiting for some action to \nindicate we will vote on this bill this week.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can, I will outline the closing script \nso all will be familiar with it.\n  When the Senate completes it business today, it will stand in \nadjournment until the hour of 9:30 a.m., October 1, and there will then \nbe a period for the transaction of morning business not to extend \nbeyond the hour of 12:30, with Senators permitted to speak therein for \nnot more than 5 minutes each.\n  We will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 for the weekly party caucuses to \nmeet. We will have the time agreed to, 90 minutes on each side, and the \nsame will occur on Wednesday. We will go to votes on Thursday.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, I announce to our \ncolleagues, just so there is no confusion, the Democratic caucus will \nnot be meeting. It will just be the Republican caucus.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just before I yield the floor, I would like to make it \nofficial that we will have no further votes tonight. There could be \nvotes on other issues tomorrow or the next day. We are still working \nvery actively on the parks legislation. Perhaps there could be a vote \non that on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n  Other than that, we don't anticipate any other votes. We need to make \nsure the Members are aware that there is that one possibility, at \nleast.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will look forward to further debate on \nthis measure on tomorrow and Wednesday, prior to a vote on Thursday. \nBut I just want to reiterate for the record what I stated and what I \nthink represents the feeling of all those that are opposed to this \nspecial provision in the legislation.\n  We were quite prepared to move toward an amendment on the continuing \nresolution, to offer the FAA bill without this amendment and go into a \n10-minute time limitation. I am convinced it would have passed. So I \nhope we are not going to hear a lot of statements on the floor that \nthose that now are opposed to this particular proposal are not in favor \nof the FAA conference report. We very clearly were. We have indicated--\nthose of us on our side--to our minority leader that we were prepared \nto offer an amendment and to move that amendment on the shortest \npossible time. And we would have concluded both the continuing \nresolution and this measure here and, hopefully, might have even \nfinished up the parks legislation, so the Senate would have been out \ntonight.\n  The burden for the delay is not on those of us who have spotted this \nspecial interest legislation. It is on those who want to continue it in \nthe legislation. That is why there is going to be continued debate on \nWednesday and Thursday on the substance of that particular legislation. \nI look forward to that matter. I think it is extremely important that \nwe understand the record completely, since we were not given an \nopportunity earlier in the evening during the various parliamentary \nsituations, to understand that all of us who are opposed to this \nspecial interest legislation are committed toward the FAA conference \nreport and were prepared to take action for that during the course of \nthe afternoon, or even tomorrow or the next day, if it goes on through \nwithout that special provision.\n  The burden lies on those who want to retain that measure. I am going \nto reject, and I do reject the suggestion that somehow those that want \nto continue that special provision in here are more concerned about \nsafety in the airports than those of us who are not. That legislation \ncould pass tonight if they want to strike that provision. We could move \ntoward an implementation on it.\n  So I hope we will have an opportunity to debate the real merits of \nthe legislation. I look forward to that. During the measure, we will \npoint out what happened on the 1995 conference between the House and \nthe Senate, when the Senate report now reveals that it was the Senate \nconferees that advanced the position to eliminate this language. We \nheard a great deal earlier in the day about where did this idea come \nfrom. Well, we find out, in reading the report now, that it was \nadvanced by our Senate conferees, and the final report was signed by \nthe Senate conferees for the elimination of\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\nthat proposal. That is where it originated. But we will have more of an \nopportunity to go through what we are really talking about.\n  What we are talking about are workers and workers' rights. We are \ntalking about those workers who were effective in terms of winning \nlocal elections by more than 60 percent of the vote in 1991 and the \ncontinued effort to frustrate workers who have played by the rules, \nfollowed the law, and now are having a legislative end-run over their \nlegitimate interests and being added in the last hour.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this issue is not going to go away. We will have a \nchance to call the roll on Thursday. But before that, we will be able \nto make the case in terms of workers' rights and what is happening to \nthose families, by this action, and circumventing litigation which is \nnow currently pending, where those of us who have followed that believe \nthat those workers' rights will be sustained. Nonetheless, we are faced \nwith circumventing their very, very legitimate rights and issues, and I \njust feel that we will have a good opportunity to get through that on \ntomorrow and the next day.\n  So I look forward to that debate. I thank the leadership for working \nout at least this process, which will give some opportunity to focus on \nthe substance of this particular measure and won't get lost or be \nburied under parliamentary maneuvers, which effectively have, today at \nleast, eliminated the chance to have a full expression and discussion \nand debate on this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank both leaders--both \nthe Democratic leader as well as Senator Lott--for working out this \narrangement with the assistance of many, including the Senator from \nKentucky, Senator Ford, as well as others who have made this agreement \npossible.\n  I must say we have come a very long way in the last few hours when we \nwere faced with what is clearly a filibuster. There is no doubt about \nit. We were not allowed to enter into time agreements. We were not \nallowed to move forward. There were quorum calls entered into. The \nRecord is clear as to what was transpiring here.\n  The fact is that people all over America who are concerned about \nairline safety, who are concerned about projects that are under way \nthat need additional funding, new projects needing funding, nearly 9 \nbillion dollars' worth--said enough, enough, enough. Move forward with \nthis. We have enough problems with airline safety. We need the \nprovisions that are in this bill to make the airlines safer and the \npeople who use the airlines safe.\n  It is clear what was going on before. The Senator from Massachusetts \nclearly wanted to block this conference report from being enacted by \nthe U.S. Senate unless that provision that he found objectionable be \nremoved, even though safety would have been clearly in some jeopardy as \nwell as further funding.\n  I do not mean to take on the Senator from Massachusetts on this \nissue. But I do think it is important to clarify the record. It is also \nimportant, Mr. President, to clarify the record as to what happened in \nconference. It was an open conference. It was not a closed conference. \nThe conferees from both sides were there--both Republican and Democrat. \nThere were open and honest exchanges that were held. The amendment that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts finds so onerous, Mr. President, was \nproposed by one of the Democrat conferees from his side of the aisle--\nnot from this side of the aisle. It was voted in favor of by both of \nthe Democrat Senators from that side of the aisle who supported it.\n  So it was unanimous in the Senate. No objection was raised by any \nconferee.\n  I understand that the Senator from Massachusetts is a strong advocate \nof labor, and he has clearly his mission and his philosophy. I respect \nthat even though I may not agree with him. But to portray this as some \nsort of behind-the-scenes, backdoor attempt by those on this side of \nthe aisle to do something in the way of subterfuge simply flies in the \nface of what actually happened.\n  I want to repeat, the amendment was proposed by a conferee from that \nside of the aisle--not this side. It was voted on unanimously by all \nSenate conferees. Because, Mr. President, it is clear--was clear to the \nconferees and is clear now--that this was a mistake in legislation that \nneeded to be repaired. That was the view of all of the conferees and \nall of us who have been involved in this issue for a very, very long \nperiod of time.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to go through--we will have time \ntomorrow and the next day; the hour is late--all of the vitally needed \nsecurity measures that are part of this bill. I mean, they are vital. \nWe adopted many of those that were recommended by the Vice President's \ncommission because we felt we couldn't wait until next year. Some of \nthese things have to be enacted as soon as possible. We are talking \nabout a grave threat to the very lives of men and women who fly on \nairlines.\n  If we had done what was taking place in a parliamentary fashion as \nshort a time ago as a few minutes ago while the bill was demanded to be \nread, then clearly we wouldn't have been able to move forward.\n  I am not going to go through the nearly $9 billion worth of projects \nthat are vitally needed. I will not talk about all of those in the \nState of Massachusetts, or, frankly, those in the State of Iowa.\n  When I asked that further reading of the bill be suspended, the \nSenator from Iowa on three different occasions objected--objected. He \nmust have objected to the $1.8 million that is going to be made \navailable for Des Moines International, and the $1.4 million for Cedar \nRapids Municipal for the sake of a cause that has to do with organized \nlabor--organized labor, which is in an unprecedented fashion pouring \nmoney in to defeat Republicans in the upcoming election. I understand \nwhy the Senator from Iowa would do that. I understand why the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts would do it.\n  But I beg the Senator from Massachusetts, please, please don't \nportray what has just transpired as anything but what it was--an \nattempt to block passage of the conference on the part of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the declared, avowed intention of the majority \nleader to finish this bill for the good of the United States of America \nand get a final vote on the conference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for \na question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield so we can call up a clean bill \nthat is at the desk right now and pass it tonight without that \nprovision so that we can attend to all of those provisions that the \nSenator from Arizona mentions? We can call that right up tonight and \npass it. Why don't we go ahead and do that? Or is the Senator from \nArizona so strongly committed to this antiworker provision that he \nwould deny those safety provisions from being adopted in the Senate and \nfrom being adopted tonight?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator finished?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts--I \nam sure he was here on the floor when we entered into a unanimous-\nconsent agreement, the unanimous-consent agreement which could have \nbeen objected to in just the last few minutes by the Senator from \nMassachusetts if he had chosen to, if he had wanted to get a clean \nbill. I suggest that he could have objected, and then said, let us have \na clean bill. Instead, the Senator from Massachusetts sat silent while \nthe unanimous-consent agreement was propounded. While the Senator from \nIowa was--and who probably wants to ask another question about how he \nis beholding to organized labor, as well as the Senator from \nMassachusetts is, to the point where they would block passage of a \nconference bill that has to do with airline safety and the funding of \nnearly $9 billion worth of projects for the American people.\n  I would be glad to respond to any question the Senator from Iowa has.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I just ask the \nquestion. Will the Senator then sit silent while I propound a \nunanimous-consent request to bring up the bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to. My colleagues may object, however, \nbecause they know we just entered into a\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\nunanimous consent agreement which, if the Senator from Iowa or the \nSenator from Massachusetts wanted differently, they could have objected \nto.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The point is we did bring up a clean bill, and, \nobviously, there is an objection on that side.\n  Mr. COATS. Would the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, for a question.\n  Mr. COATS. I say to the Senator from Arizona, we have just been put \nthrough about 5 hours worth of procedural gimmickry by the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Iowa when the House has already \nadjourned, when the Nation's business in this Congress has been \nfinished. Because the Senator from Massachusetts, as some, apparently, \ngift to organized labor, is not happy with one of the small provisions \nin a bill that provides airport safety and critical airport funding \nsays, ``I don't care what the rest of the Senate thinks, I do not care \nwhat the House of Representatives thinks,'' 435 people have finished \ntheir business in the House of Representatives and gone back home to \ntheir districts, and 100 Senators would like to complete their \nbusiness--we thought we had at 6 o'clock, when a motion to table was \noverwhelmingly supported against the provision offered by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Do you remember what that vote was? That is my question. What was the \nvote on the motion to table?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Ninety-seven to two, I believe.\n  Mr. COATS. Ninety-seven to two. So clearly both Republicans and \nDemocrats, with the exception of the two Senators --maybe there were \nthree; I guess the Senator from Wisconsin was involved in this also--\nsaid, ``No; we are going to hold onto the last procedural gimmick that \nwe can possibly hold onto,'' and make the entire U.S. Senate not only \nstay in business until 11 o'clock this evening but come back tomorrow \nto debate only this issue, come back Wednesday to debate only this \nissue, come back Thursday so that we can have a procedural vote finally \nto force the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Wisconsin to give up and yield to the overwhelming will of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Is that the understanding of the Senator from Arizona of what is \ngoing on here?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is my understanding.\n  Also, as you know, the House did vote on this very issue. There was a \nmajority vote in the other body that approved of this legislation with \nthe provision that the Senator from Massachusetts found objectionable.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Iowa \nhave left the floor. So I will refrain from belaboring them further \nbecause I think it would be unfair to do so.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Texas as for a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to ask the Senator from Arizona, besides \nthe fact that we are going to have to come back and debate this for 2 \nmore days, if there isn't another point; that is, what happens \ntomorrow? Tomorrow is October 1.\n  I wonder how many States have airports with runways being built that \nmight have to stop that construction. I wonder if there are air traffic \ncontrol systems that are being improved that will not have the money \ntomorrow because we did not vote on this bill. I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Arizona knows there are some real issues that are going to be \ndetermined because there is not funding tomorrow for airport safety and \nterrorism and other very important airport issues that we have been \ntalking about, as the Senator from Arizona knows, for months and months \nand months here trying to make sure that we fight terrorism, that we \nallow Americans to fly in safety and tomorrow, October 1, is the first \nday of the fiscal year.\n  I just wondered if the Senator from Arizona would like to discuss \nwhat we are going to miss tomorrow and the next day while we play games \non the Senate floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for raising that question \nbecause I think it is a very good one. We are talking about Tuesday, \nWednesday, and a final vote on Thursday. We are talking about 3 days \nhere. I intend to find out, between now and when we commence debate \nagain tomorrow, how many projects, indeed, will have to be terminated \nfor 3 days, how many projects will not be able to be started because \nfor some reason we are dragging out the inevitable.\n  We all know there will be an overwhelming vote, probably end up with \na voice vote once we vote cloture, I would imagine. And also as \nimportant is that we need to move forward as quickly as possible on \nthese antiterrorism measures. In all due respect, I remember being \nbelabored and beaten up because I did not support an increase in the \nminimum wage, that somehow I was cruel and inhumane to working men and \nwomen in America.\n  That is an allegation that may be true or not, depending on your \nphilosophy, but I do not see how you can be concerned about the safety \nof people who are flying in the airlines if you are going to delay for \nno good reason the antiterrorism measures that we need to get to work \non immediately. I fear and so do other people--certainly the Vice \nPresident's commission, certainly the task force that the Senator from \nTexas was a key and important member of in recommending the \nantiterrorism measures which are included in this bill--that there \nshould be delay in moving forward with them as quickly as possible.\n  Look, again, I feel rather badly because the Senator from \nMassachusetts is not in the Chamber, nor is the Senator from Iowa, to \nrespond. So I want to be very careful, and perhaps we will be able to \nreinitiate this debate and discussion tomorrow or the next day or the \nnext day. But there was some very harsh rhetoric used about this side \nof the aisle when we were debating the minimum wage bill about \ninsensitive, uncaring, and those kinds of things. Some of it I really \nregretted hearing and I thought it lowered the level of the debate and \ndiscourse in the Senate.\n  I have to say I cannot think of any good reason why we should not \nvote tomorrow, vote cloture on this bill tomorrow and move forward, why \nwe should drag it out for 3 days and not have these projects, many of \nwhich the Senator from Texas referred to and which, by the way, I will \nget a list of and have read and included in the Record tomorrow. Why we \ndo not move forward with those escapes me.\n  I want to point out one thing again for the Record. The Senator from \nTexas was involved in a task force convened immediately after the TWA \ntragedy and made some very in-depth studies and came up with some \nrecommendations, which, by the way, I am very happy to say, the Vice \nPresident's task force came up with almost identically. I am very \ngrateful for her efforts because if it had not been for that, some of \nthese provisions would not be in this legislation which is so \nimportant. So we owe a great debt to the Senator from Texas.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise not to prolong our proceedings; they \nhave gone on far too long, but I wanted to express my thanks to the \nSenator from Arizona for his willingness to consider the problems with \nDenver's sixth runway. Denver is not only the newest major airport in \nthe Nation but the biggest and perhaps one of the biggest in the world. \nIt does need a sixth runway. I support the sixth runway. It is \nintegral, I think, not only for operations in severe weather but \nintegral for international flights out of the airport.\n  Mr. President, I have had a concern as the sixth runway has gone \nforward, and that is the record of Denver of not accepting the lowest \nbid when they contract out for projects. It strikes me we all have a \nresponsibility, including within our States and districts, to make sure \nthe public money is not wasted.\n  In requesting the GAO audit of the practices that led to the huge \ncost overruns at the Denver airport, we discovered, as reported by the \nGAO, that there were a significant number of contracts which were let \nfor construction at the airport that were not given to the lowest \nqualified bidder.\n  Here, Mr. President, let me emphasize these are screened and deemed \nqualified, and there were a large number, significant number of \ncontracts, I\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\nshould say, that were not given to the lowest bidder who was qualified.\n  I had asked the GAO to determine how much money that cost the \ntaxpayers, how much difference there was between the lowest bid and the \nhigher bid that the airport in Denver accepted, and they were unable to \ncome up with that. The information was simply not available as to how \nmuch money the taxpayers had lost because they had not taken the lowest \nqualified bid.\n  I give that background because my concern about the sixth runway is \nthat that practice may be repeated on the sixth runway construction \ngrants, and I think we would be remiss if we gave money for \nconstruction to that project which did not insist on either the lowest \nbid or, if they choose not to take the lowest bid--and there may be \ncircumstances that justify that--at least they would disclose the \namount of money that the bid they accepted exceeded the lowest bid.\n  Frankly, I believe disclosing that would be a strong incentive for \nofficials who get Federal money to look for the best bargain for the \ntaxpayer.\n  Here is what has happened. The amendment I offered--it was adopted on \nthis floor--that required disclosure when you do not take the lowest \nbid of the major contracts was lost in conference. The House would not \ngo along with it. I asked the City of Denver to give me a letter \ncommitting to disclose the amount of money of the bid that they \naccepted for the sixth runway exceeds the lowest bid, and they have \ndeclined to do so.\n  Mr. President, I cannot in good conscience ask this Congress to send \nmoney for the sixth runway in Denver without at least a disclosure by \nthe city of how much money they leave on the table or how much money it \ncost the taxpayers.\n  So I am sad tonight. The Senator from Arizona listened to our \nconcern. He was willing to help out Denver to try to work with us. He \nbent over backwards to try to be helpful, to look for avenues where \nthis could be corrected and the sixth runway could go ahead, but I was \nnot able to bring to the Senator from Arizona or this body a commitment \nfrom Denver that said they will disclose the facts when they get the \nlowest bid.\n  Mr. President, in light of that, unfortunately, the sixth runway is \nlost for this year. As I leave this body, I know it will be considered \nagain next year. But, Mr. President, I hope future Congresses do not \nhand out money for someone who is not going to take the lowest bid, or \nat least disclose how much over that lowest bid they took.\n  Mr. President, I might point out that what happens in some of these \ncases is that the contractor who gets the bid, when he has not been the \nlowest bidder, then gets hit up for paying contributions from the \npoliticians who ran for office who were involved in letting the bids. I \nthink it is crystal clear to everyone what is involved here. You turn \ndown the lowest bidder, you give the contract to someone who did not \ndeserve it, at least in terms of the bidding process, and then you go \nand ask that contractor for money. I think there is not any doubt in \nanybody's mind who understands this situation what is going on there.\n  I do not think we ought to let it happen. I do not think we ought to \nhand out money without at least insisting that it be disclosed. I \nappreciate the efforts of the Senator from Arizona. I appreciate the \nefforts of the Senator from South Dakota, to work on this.\n  I am sad that we have not been able to go ahead with the sixth \nrunway. But, Mr. President, this is an issue we should not ignore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. I want \nto tell him that I had no idea that it was not a matter of public \nrecord when taxpayers' dollars are being used, as to what the bids were \nand who made the low bid and who made the high bid and what, in fact, \nwas the entire process of ascertaining and awarding these bids. They \nshould be open to public scrutiny. For the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand any rationale, when it is taxpayers' dollars being used, why \nthis procedure and process should be hidden from public view.\n  I want to assure the Senator from Colorado that I view it, not only \nas something that I would want to do, it is something that I feel \nobligated to do, and that is to follow up on this issue next year. I do \nnot know all the details of this matter in regards to Denver \nInternational Airport but let me tell the Senator from Colorado, as he \nknows as well as I do, when processes like this are kept from public \nview, it lends itself to procedures and results which are not always in \nthe public's interest. That is why we demand open disclosure of bidding \nin the Federal process. Frankly, it should not happen anywhere without \nan open and complete accounting to the taxpayers for the taxpayers' \ndollars uses.\n  If they are using private money, if someone donates the money to the \nairport and says use this however you want to--fine. If they do not \nwant to describe how it is being used or who gets the bid, that is fine \nalso.\n  But, as long as it is taxpayers dollars--and correct me if I am \nwrong, some $4 billion has gone into the construction of Denver \nInternational Airport, I would ask the Senator from Colorado? Then I \nthink, obviously, the best value for the dollar should be gained, not \nonly for the people of Colorado, but for taxpayers all over America.\n  So, I again thank my dear, dear friend from Colorado. Frankly, I view \nhim as our conscience. I am not sure what we are going to do without \nhim. Everyone is replaceable around here, but he is one that I think is \nfar harder to replace than most. I appreciate, again, his commitment on \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, before going through closing down the Senate, I want \nto again thank my friend from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, the \nchairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which \nI will do again at the end of this process on Thursday.

Mr. President, as the 20th century draws to a close, we all \nfind ourselves musing and marveling over the changes history has \nbrought the world in this millennium. Human ingenuity has brought \nastounding advances in technology and in medicine. Society has also \nfaced revolutionary changes and our forbearers who welcomed the year \n1900 would little recognize the lives their descendants lead today. In \npolitics, the 20th century brought new ways of thinking about the \nsocial contract between citizens and their government. Some, like \nfascism and communism, were dangerous and ultimately discredited \nfailures. But democracy, the great experiment our Founding Fathers \ncreated on the shores of the New World, has not just endured but spread \naround the world. It has been my great delight to watch democracy begin \nto spread in Asia.\n  Some would argue that it is not natural that democracy would grow in \nAsia. Some Asian leaders and intellectuals have actively resisted the \nidea that democracy be a political option for the region. They have \nargued that Asian values--loosely Confucian, authoritarian, and family- \nor group-focused rather than individually-focused--are inconsistent \nwith democracy. These leaders further argue that the stunning economic \nsuccess of the East Asian ``Tigers'' is specifically due to their more \nclosed political systems and to their emphasis on social stability at \nthe expense of individual voice and choice. Moreover, these same \nleaders will point to legitimate problems in many Western societies--\nsuch as drug abuse, homelessness, violent crimes, to name a few--are \nthe direct result of an overly permissive society that emphasizes \nindividual freedom over social stability. But I believe that these \ncultural arguments distort reality and are\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\noften used as excuses for maintaining an authoritarian-style regime.\n  Democracy precludes neither economic success nor social stability. In \nfact, the rapid economic development of many Asian countries has \nbrought new social problems and pressures that perhaps only a more \ndemocratic political system can relieve. Take, for example, Taiwan. As \nincome levels rose, individuals gained a new sense of control over \ntheir own and their children's futures. Many traveled to the West and \nsent their children to study in Western universities, where they \nlearned of the plethora of opportunities--professional, social, and \npersonal--that democratic societies offer their citizens. They returned \nwith new ideas and new expectations of and for their own government. \nThe authoritarian style of leadership that characterized the government \nunder Chaing Kai-shek proved unable to meet the needs of the rising \nmiddle class in Taiwan and the government was forced to evolve. \nTaiwan's current president, Lee Teng-hui, deserves much credit for \nmanaging and even fostering the change. Perhaps as a just reward, Lee \nwon a popular re-elected bid last March and became the first \ndemocratically-elected Chinese leader in history.\n  Mr. President, the political and social system on Taiwan is far from \nperfect, something the leadership there readily admits. But Taiwan has \nmanaged an astounding economic and political transformation in a \nrelatively short period of time, with little violence or social \nupheaval. I believe that Taiwan serves as a sharp rebuttal to those who \nsay that traditional Asian values will not permit the growth of a \nhealthy democracy. Other Asian states, including Japan and South Korea, \nhave found democracy to be consistent with economic development. Now \neven Mongolia has chosen democracy as its path to a brighter future.\n  Other Asian nations could benefit from following a Taiwan model of \npolitical reform. I find it unlikely that a country that is \nexperiencing the rapid economic growth, technological development and \nsocial change that China is experiencing can long restrain the \ninevitable pressure for political changes as well. The military leaders \nin Burma have only hindered their country's economic development by \nforcibly resisting the results of democratic elections there.\n  Indonesia, in particular, has reached a critical point in its \neconomic and social development. There are clear signs that the \ndeveloping middle class is restless and chaffing within the current \nrestrictive political system. President Soeharto, who has done so many \ngood things for his country's development already, could cement his \nlegacy as a great leader by taking steps toward a more responsive and \nparticipatory political system. Such steps would serve to enhance his \ngovernment's standing in the country and in the world, not diminish it.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. cannot and should not ignore important \ncultural and historical differences between our own country and \ncountries in Asia. There is much in Asian society that we in this \ncountry can learn from and we should be open to doing so. But Asian \nindividuals are no less deserving of a responsive government and \nfreedom of choice than their Western counterparts and cultural \ndifferences should not be used as a mask to conceal and support \nauthoritarian regimes. It is very much in the U.S. interest to promote \nand support the trend toward democracy in Asia, as we have done for \nseveral decades.\n  We do not know what changes the 21st century will bring to our world. \nBut we can hope and expect that our descendants will enjoy greater \npeace and prosperity if our nation trades and cooperates with a \ndemocratized Asia. Individual freedom and choice are not exclusively \nWestern values and promoting them around the world is not Western \nimperialism. The growth of democracy has brought great benefits to \nnations that adopted it and Asian nations deserve these benefits as \nwell. The trend toward democracy is already there; we should do all we \ncan to foster and encourage it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11943-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE SAVINGS IN CONSTRUCTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, during my time in the Senate, I have worked \nto see that United States joins the rest of the world by converting to \nthe metric system of measurement. Believe it or not, the United States \nis the only industrialized nation in the world that has failed to \nchange to the metric system of measurement.\n  I believe the Federal Government, as a major consumer of goods and \nservices, should lead the way and convert to the metric system. In \n1973, I authored the Metric Conversion Act that later became law in \n1975. That act set forth the policy of the United States to convert to \nthe metric system. Section 3 of the Act requires each Federal Agency to \nuse the metric system of measurement in its procurement, grants and \nother business-related activities.\n  Slowly but surely, the Federal Government has started to make that \nmove. Federal construction officials in particular have made great \nprogress in this area and have met with limited resistance from the \nconstruction community around the United States. All concerned deserve \nour praise for their efforts.\n  Unfortunately, legislation introduced in both the House and the \nSenate during this Congress would have provided permanent, complete \nexemptions for two industries from requests for the metric-sized \nbuilding products required by Federal law for Federal construction \nprojects.\n  Needless to say, I strongly opposed that legislation. Federal laws \nand Presidential Executive orders signed by Presidents of both parties \nover for 20 years clearly state that the United States should move to \nthe metric system and that the Federal Government should lead the way--\nby example.\n  Over the last several weeks, I have joined with Senators Hollings, \nGlenn, and Burns to craft an acceptable amendment to the original \nlegislation. I am not completely pleased with the result of our efforts \nand it is certainly not what I would have written. The result is, \nhowever, a compromise. I believe compromise to be integral to the \nworking of the U.S. Senate and did, therefore, not oppose this \nsubstitute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11944-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11944-S11946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THANKS TO STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, I was \nassigned to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, which we of \ncourse know today as the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As \nI prepare to finish my Senate career, I look back on my years on that \ncommittee as the source of the most rewarding and intellectually \nstimulating challenges of my years here. From the Arab embargo of 1973 \nto the natural gas wars of 1978, from the complex Alaska land issues of \nthe early 1980's to the National Energy Policy Act of 1992, we have \nbeen engaged in vitally important work that is often long on complexity \nand short on glamour.\n  I am proud of the record we achieved, not only during my 8 years as \nchairman, but throughout my service, and I wish today to say thank you \nto a professional staff unlike any other, one which has served the \ncommittee and the country so well over the years.\n  Some of the best minds in the country have served on the committee \nstaff over the years.\n  Whatever their reasons for coming, I believe most stayed and relished \ntheir time there because they found themselves in the company of other \nkeen minds, and they knew that their mission would not be mortgaged to \npolitics and that their task was to find honest, pragmatic, workable \nsolutions to vexing problems. Almost all of them have gone on to \nrewarding careers in government and business, and I can only hope they \nwere as enriched by their experience as the public product was by their \nservice.\n  Luckily for me, some of the very best and brightest have remained to \nassist me as my service in this body comes to a close.\n  One of those staff members who has served me the longest and with \nparticular distinction is the minority staff director of the committee, \nDr. Ben Cooper. About the time I joined the committee, we became \ninvolved in the development of national energy policy in response to \nthe crude oil supply interruptions in the Middle East that were \ndisrupting our domestic economy. The committee has continued to be \ninvolved deeply in this issue, as indicated\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\nby its current name, which was attached to the committee during the \nreorganization of Senate committees that occured in early 1977.\n  Shortly after I joined the committee, a long-haired doctor of physics \njoined the Democratic committee staff from the University of Iowa, \nwhere he had been an instructor. He first joined the staff as a \ncongressional science fellow employed by the then-chairman, our dear \ndeparted colleague, Senator Henry M. Jackson. Since those early days, I \nhave worked closely with Ben, who officially became part of my staff in \n1981, when I became ranking minority member of the committee. Ben has \ncontinued with me through my chairmanship of the committee and through \nour return to the minority.\n  Mr. President, there can be no better staff than Dr. Ben Cooper. He \nis perhaps the only remaining staff of either the House or Senate who \nhas a complete institutional memory of the evolution of modern Federal \nenergy policy. Ben has been active on energy issues that range from \ncrude oil pricing to natural gas deregulation to the current electric \nrestructuring debate. Ben is particularly an expert on nuclear policy, \nas would be expected from his physics background. I can say without \nreservation that Ben has played an active and, usually, key staff role \non every piece of legislation relating to nuclear matters that has been \nconsidered by Congress in the last 20 years. In addition, Ben has \nplayed a key role on non-energy-related legislation ranging from public \nlands legislation to the risk assessment legislation that has been \nconsidered by the Senate during the last two Congresses.\n  Mr. President, throughout his long career as Senate staff, Ben has \nearned a reputation for honesty and professionalism both among the \nstaff and Members of the House and Senate. Unfortunately for the Senate \nand, I believe, the process of developing sound public policy, Ben has \nindicated that he will be leaving the Senate by the end of the year to \npursue new challenges.\n  Mr. President, my friendship with Ben Cooper will continue, but our \ndaily interaction is not likely to continue, and I will miss Ben's \ndaily good counsel tremendously. I commend Ben for a career well spent \nand well-conducted, congratulate him on the contribution he has made to \nour Nation and wish him the best in his future pursuits.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been fortunate \nto have a second long-term Democratic staff member who is as eminent in \nhis field as Dr. Cooper is in the field of energy policy. I refer, of \ncourse, to Tom Williams, who is without equal in his knowledge of \nFederal policy toward public lands, national parks, the United States \nForest Service and a variety of lands issues relating to the great \nState of Alaska.\n  Tom joined the Democratic committee staff of the committee in 1973 \nand has continued his service with the committee through today, except \nfor a brief interlude at the Department of the Interior early in the \ncurrent administration. During his service with the committee, Tom has \nserved as key staff on every public lands and national parks bill that \nhas been considered or enacted by the Senate. No staff member in the \nCongress has a greater institutional knowledge of these important, and \noften divisive issues that are often at once arcane and tremendously \nimportant both to the Nation as a whole and to individuals that may be \naffected directly by Federal policy.\n  I have had the pleasure of considering Tom my staff since I became \nranking member of the committee in 1981. Throughout that period of \ntime, I have valued Tom's counsel not only on the parks and lands \nissues, but on a host of other issues including the mining reform \nlegislation that has been considered by the committee in the past \nseveral Congresses. Tom has the ability to counsel wisely and honestly \non the various policy options available and on the often diametrically \nopposed arguments of industry and the environmental community. Tom has \nthat great ability, shared by Ben Cooper and many of my staff, to \nremain calm and professional in the midst of the hottest and most \ndivisive debates. For that reason, among others, Tom Williams has \nearned an excellent reputation among Members and staff alike in both \nthe House and Senate.\n  Mr. President, I will miss my daily interaction with Tom, but I \nunderstand that Tom's talents will not be lost to the Senate or the \npublic. I understand that Tom desires to continue in his service and I \nam sure that my colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, \nwho will become the ranking Democrat on the committee, will continue \nTom's service with the committee.\n  Mr. President, I extend my thanks to Tom for his service and counsel \nto me and for his friendship and I am pleased that the committee and \nthe Senate will continue to have access to Tom's talents and service.\n  A uniquely talented attorney serves as minority chief counsel of the \ncommittee: Sam Fowler. Sam has a long history of distinguished public \nservice, first with the Smithsonian Institution, then with the \nPresident's Council on Environmental Quality, next with the House \nInterior and Insular Affairs Committee and, finally, beginning in 1991, \nwith our committee.\n  Mr. President, Sam is a lawyer's lawyer. If Sam says the law says X, \nthen you can be sure that the law says X. He is one of the most \nfastidious and careful researchers I have ever encountered. He has a \nspecial talent for expressing himself through the written word in a \nconcise and precise manner.\n  Sam has staffed many issues in which I have taken particular \ninterest. Perhaps in no area has his contribution been any greater than \nin the area of nuclear policy. Sam has exhibited the rare talent, at \nleast among lawyers, for mastering the scientific terms and concepts \nassociated with the development of nuclear power and the safe disposal \nof nuclear waste.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not mention one \nother activity of Sam's that has enlightened and enriched my life and \nthose of the committee staff. Sam, on his own time, prepares incisive \nmemoranda that trace the history and development of various aspects of \nthe institution of republican government. Among his topics have been a \nhistory of gift rules, privileged motions, and the evolution of the \nmodern State of the Union Address. This aspect of Sam's life \nillustrates his wonderful intellectual curiosity that is so vital in \ngood staff.\n  Mr. President, Sam is a treasure of the committee, a treasure I will \nmiss greatly.\n  In 1993, I learned that Bob Simon of the Department of Energy would \nbe detailed to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Bob had \nstarted working for the Department during the Bush administration, and \nmy staff director, Ben Cooper, told me of the high regard he had for \nBob's acumen and integrity. I can say now from the perspective of 3 \nyears later that Ben's endorsement, strong though it was, has turned \nout to be an understatement.\n  While many agency detailees treat their time with congressional \noffices as something like school without the examinations, Bob took his \nopportunity very seriously and began distinguishing himself almost \nimmediately by his deft and thorough handling of difficult issues. \nSince coming on board, Bob has won the respect and admiration of his \ncolleagues on the staff and the trust of the members who rely on his \nwork, and he has demonstrated his possession of a rare combination of \nattributes--intellectual and technical mastery, outstanding political \nand strategic judgment, and complete reliability--which has made his \nwork extremely valuable.\n  I want to express my sincere appreciation for Bob Simon's hard work \nand dedication, and I wish him the very best in the future.\n  No subject has presented more of a challenge to my committee or \nconsumed more of our time than the vast issue of electricity \nderegulation, and I am frank to say that the sterling work done by \nBetsy Moeller, Don Santa and Bill Conway raised the bar significantly \non my expectations for staff work in this area.\n  I am pleased to say that Cliff Sikora, whom we enticed to come from \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has more than met those \nstandards. I am persuaded that no one in the country has a more \ncommanding overall grasp of the thorny issue of electricity \nderegulation than Cliff, and he has done an exceptional job of bringing \nthose talents to bear to assist me and other members of the committee \nin our deliberations in the scant year or so that he has been on the \nstaff.\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\n  David Brooks came over from the House Interior Committee to join our \nstaff in 1989. He has played a major role in shaping much of this \ncountry's recent policy on public lands, national parks and historic \npreservation. The California Desert Protection Act is one such example \nof David's craftsmanship. And there could be no more appropriate bill \nwith which to associate David--whom we often refer to as the third \nSenator from Arizona--than the Arizona Wilderness Act, to which he \ndevoted his unstinting attention. If we are fortunate enough to see \nenactment of the pending omnibus parks bill before the end of this \nCongress, it will owe in significant measure to David's determination \nand negotiating skills. His great knowledge and exemplary work ethic \nhave added so much to the work of our committee, and I am most \ngrateful.\n  Vicki Thorne, through her years as majority and minority office \nmanager and clerk, has performed the unsung, often unnoticed, but \nalways critical job of keeping the committee running, whether in \norganizing hearings, supervising publications or playing den mother to \na large and diverse family of staff. Her efficiency has been matched \nonly by an equable temperament and warm smile that enabled her and us \nto get our way far more often than not. She has my deepest thanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11944-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11946-S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO STAFF OF SENATOR JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, it was my great fortune to be assigned \nto the Committee on Appropriations relatively early in my first term in \nthe Senate. It is through that committee that I have been able to serve \nmy State in a way that I believe has contributed measurably to an \nimprovement in the economic quality of life for the people of \nLouisiana.\n  As I began my second full term in the Senate, I had the added good \nfortune of taking over the reins of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nPublic Works, as it was known at the time, from a wonderful man who \ntaught me so much about the Senate, the late and beloved Senator John \nStennis of Mississippi. When I fell heir to that chairmanship, I also \ninherited the services of the longtime staff director of the \nsubcommittee, Proctor Jones. It is of Proctor and his service to the \nSenate and his country that I wish to speak today.\n  Every now and then in this body, someone of the thousands of loyal \nstaff who toil for us and our constituents achieves an elevated status \namong Senators and staff colleagues. I think few would deny that \nProctor has long since reached that plateau.\n  Proctor Jones came to this body in 1960, and aside from 4 years of \nservice as a proud Marine, he has served here continuously since that \ntime. He has seen and participated in more of the sweep of politics and \npublic policy than most of us can imagine, and along the way he has \namassed an unrivaled knowledge of the legislative process and a nearly \nunmatched institutional memory.\n  Members of both Houses and on both sides of the aisle know they can \nturn to Proctor for advice and assistance with absolute confidence that \ntheir requests will be treated fairly and respectfully. And they know \nthat he gets results. Proctor's broad and detailed knowledge of his \nappropriation areas helps account for his uncanny ability to find the \nmeans--when none appears available--to achieve the legislative goals \nthat we set. While such knowledge gives Proctor authority, he would \nnever think of abusing the great powers we entrust to him. He is a man \nwho loves and cherishes the institutions of government and who is \nguided by the fine Georgia code of honor he learned from his early \nmentor, the late Senator Richard Russell, the giant whom Proctor served \nearly in his Senate career.\n  If anything, he is self-depreciating and deferential to a fault: as \nhe is fond of saying, ``I just work here, I don't vote. And I love my \njob.'' He has indeed loved his job and has performed his duties in a \nway that has made a profound difference in those areas covered under \nour Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee. He has \nalways understood that we have a serious obligation to protect and \nimprove the country's physical infrastructure and to support and \nnurture the Nation's scientific brain trust at the national \nlaboratories and throughout the Federal Government. Uninformed critics \nhave sometimes derided those vital responsibilities as pork or \nmisplaced priorities, but I firmly believe that Proctor's vision and \ndedication have contributed mightily to the security and strength of \nthis country.\n  Proctor has also become my valued personal friend, owing in large \nmeasure to his infectious enthusiasm for everything in life from opera, \nto travel, to sports, to hiking, and joyous gatherings of friends and \nfamily. As I conclude my service in the Senate, I want Proctor and his \nfamily to know that I speak for my colleagues, past and present, in \nsaying thanks for a job done well and as no one else could have done \nit.\n  Mr. President, no senator has been blessed with a more capable, more \nloyal, more effective staff than I have. For 24 years, they have worked \nfor my office, our State, and our Nation with energy and diligence. All \nof the staff over these years have been excellent, but at this time I \nwant to especially recognize the three most senior staffers in my \nWashington office for their special talents and contributions.\n  When I arrived in Washington in November 1972, I was taken in tow by \nBill Cochrane of the Rules Committee, who gave me invaluable assistance \nand counsel in setting up my office. Like most new Senators, I was \nshort-handed and uncertain about the best way to staff my office and \ndeal with the avalanche of mail, telephone calls, and visitors. Bill \nmentioned to me that he knew of a young woman, Patsy Guyer, who had \nworked with him on the staff of Senator B. Everett Jordan of North \nCarolina and who was available and was a prodigious worker. She was \nquickly hired, and I don't think her output has slowed one iota over \nthe 24 years she has been on my staff. As my executive assistant, Patsy \nhas handled a huge array of responsibilities over the years, ranging \nfrom supervising State offices to managing summer interns, to creating \nand overseeing an exceptionally efficient mail operation.\n  But if Patsy should be singled out for anything, it is her management \nof and deep personal commitment to a ``case work'' operation that is \nunmatched in the volume and quality of service it has rendered to \ncountless thousands of Louisianians in need. I am very proud of the aid \nmy office has given over the years to people who had nowhere else to \nturn, whether it was securing a visa, locating a loved one, or breaking \nan impasse on a disability payment or a VA widow's benefits.\n  We were able to be effective principally because Patsy Guyer has an \nastounding network of friends and colleagues throughout the Congress \nand among Federal agencies and, most of all, because she greeted every \ncase, no matter how routine, with the enthusiasm and commitment she \nbrought to her first day on the job in November of 1972. Whether the \nchallenge was to bring home from Abu Dhabi a tragically injured \nLouisiana businessman, locate a missing child in a Rwandan refugee \ncamp, or organize a food airlift to Cambodia, we always knew Patsy \nwould have the ingenuity and contacts to start the process and the \nabsolutely iron-willed determination and dedication to see it through \nto completion. I have never known a more selfless and giving \nindividual, and I know I speak for untold thousands in Louisiana in \nexpressing deep gratitude for the extraordinary service that this loyal \ndaughter of North Carolina has rendered to Louisiana and our country.\n  Mr. President, as many Senators know, Becky Putens has been my \npersonal secretary for the last 18 years. While that is her title, it \nhardly does justice to the multitude of roles that she has had to play \nin that time. She has been my gatekeeper, my scheduler, my right-hand \nperson; she keeps track of where I need to be, arranges how I will get \nthere, and generally has acted as a buffer between me and the enormous \nnumber of outside demands on my time and attention that characterizes \nthis job. Most of all, though, Becky Putens is a fixer: she takes care \nof problems, from the routine to the seemingly insurmountable, with an \naplomb and calmness that is remarkable, and that has, in countless \nlarge and small ways, made my time as a Senator more effective, more \nefficient, and generally more fun.\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\n  As my colleagues and her peers--a group of Senators' personal \nsecretaries who call themselves ``senior babes''--can attest, the small \narea just outside a Senator's office often takes on the aspect of Grand \nCentral Station at rush hour. Becky is the person who keeps it all \ntogether and all running smoothly. Through it all, and maybe because of \nit all, Becky displays a sense of humor and a way with people and with \nwords that is legendary among many of the longtime staff and Senators. \nFor someone in a position that is always demanding and often thankless, \nsuch an attitude is almost a requirement, and for me it has often \nserved to make even the most tiring and demanding days and nights in \nthe Senate bearable.\n  But, to me, the most fundamental aspect of Becky's personality is her \nunquestioning dedication. Whatever the circumstances, however late or \nearly, on weekends or during vacations, if I am there, Becky is there; \nif I am under the gun, Becky is at my side. In short, in a field of \nendeavor where loyalty is an often-invoked but seldom-realized ideal, \nBecky personifies it. I am grateful for her service.\n  Mr. President, Eric Silagy has managed to pack more achievements into \nhis brief career than any young man I know. He came to my office in \n1987, fresh out of the University of Texas. In less than 2 years, he \nwas chief scheduler for a Senate campaign that was as politically \nsignificant and hard fought as any in this century. His intelligence, \ngood judgment, and youthful energy were important factors in our \nvictory. For the next 4 years, he served as my legislative assistant \nwhile attending Georgetown University Law School, performing superbly \nin both capacities. Since 1994, he has been my administrative assistant \nand chief of staff. Thanks to his excellent organizational skills and \nhis tact and good humor, it is an office that has been a productive \nworkplace for a happy, hardworking, and extremely talented staff.\n\n  Just as important to me as his skill in running the office, however, \nhas been his remarkable political and policy judgment, which I rely \nupon in making all the most crucial decisions that come before me; and \nhis extraordinary effectiveness in getting the job done, no matter what \nthe odds against it.

Mr. President, I want to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to a new book by a very brave Arkansan, James ``Paladin'' \nFore. Written along with Larry Jacks, the book, ``Tragedy and Triumph: \nA Pilot's Life Through War and Peace,'' serves as both a biography and \na history. In a very unique way, Jim writes about the horrific events \nhe witnessed through a flying career of more than 40 years. I want to \ncommend Jim for writing this fascinating book which follows him from \nWorld War II through the conflict in Southeast Asia accumulating more \nthan 37,000 flying hours.\n  As both a military and civilian pilot, Jim witnessed history in the \nmaking in over 100 countries. Mr. President, for a unique perspective \non history through the eyes of a pilot, I highly recommend this book.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11947-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JAN PAULK\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

William Fulbright. In \n1971, she joined the Committee on Foreign Relations and served as a \nprofessional staff member for 10 years. However, most of my colleagues \nhave become better acquainted with her in her most recent post.\n  Since 1982, Jan Paulk has served as the director of the Office of \nInterparliamentary Services, guiding and assisting each one of us in \nour official duties both here and abroad as Members of the U.S. Senate. \nMr. President, the entire Senate will miss Jan Paulk, but I know she \nwill move on to other challenges. Mr. President, Jan Paulk will face \nall of these new endeavors with the charm and grace that made her such \na viable part of the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11947-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, truth be told, I don't know which I find \nmore upsetting, the idea that the Government is losing a much-valued \njudicious voice, or the idea that I might inherit the dubious honor of \nhaving ``the slowest drawl in the U.S. Senate.'' Either way, we'll miss \nHowell Heflin greatly.\n  However, I welcome this opportunity to celebrate the career of a man \nwho has built a grand reputation as both advocate and judge.\n  Today, with every front page screaming about the public's \ndisillusionment with politicians, Howell Heflin stands as a model of \nintegrity and dedication. In this era of increasing partisanship, he is \na Senator who would not vote along party lines against his own \nconstituency. In this atmosphere of media scrutiny, he is a judge who \ncould not vote along the lines of popular opinion against his own \nconscience. He leaves a legacy of what it truly means to be in \ngovernment: to represent the interests of the voters and to govern \naccording to the law.\n  Whether he was working on court reforms, championing agriculture, \nadvocating a balanced budget, or defending the space program, Howell \nhas spent his 16 years in the Senate working hard for the people who \nput him there. He has been a tireless representative for the people of \nAlabama, and a tenacious defender of their interests. He is not a \ndistant politician immersed in Washington business.\n  Howell Heflin's record of public service did not just benefit his \nhome State. With his distinguished service on the Senate Ethics \nCommittee, the country came to know a just, pragmatic, and \ncompassionate judge of character. Though he didn't like to sit in \njudgment of his peers, he steered the country through some rough and \ndivisive episodes and our Nation became familiar with the man we \nalready knew as the Judge.\n  As you well know, Senator Heflin has a reputation for being an \nindependent thinker, a master storyteller, and a strong proponent of \nissues he believes in from civil rights to family values.\n  One thing that never fails to amuse me is when critics attempt to \nmalign Howell Heflin, the most scathing thing they can come up with is \nto call him a fence-straddler or indecisive. This is ironic because it \nis this quality that has made him such an exemplary Member of the \nSenate. He listens to all the arguments before making his decision, and \nwhen he does, it is fair and just. As Thomas Jefferson pointed out in a \nletter to George Washington: ``Delay is preferable to error.''\n  We will miss Senator Heflin and his charming wife Mike, but we \ncouldn't expect to keep them in Washington forever. So I wish for them \nthe best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11947-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11947-S11948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BROWN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

We have the shared \ngoal of reducing this Nation's deficit, even if we have not agreed on \neach and every step of the way.\n  I am proud to say I worked with Senator Brown on the Kerrey-Brown \ndeficit reduction package 3 years ago, a proposal that would in and of \nitself\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nhave chopped $100 billion from the deficit. Although we were ultimately \nunsuccessful, the Kerrey-Brown proposal was a model of bipartisanship, \nand I am convinced it laid the groundwork for more recent bipartisan \ndeficit reduction efforts.\n  Senator Brown and I have also served together on the Judiciary and \nForeign Relations Committees, and I have appreciated his comity and his \nopen-mindedness.\n  Mr. President, Senator Brown leaves us after only one term as a U.S. \nSenator. We all wish him well, and we all hope future Senators, from \nColorado and elsewhere, take a lesson from his tenure in the value of \nbipartisanship and civility. Those qualities have served him well, and \nthey have served the Senate well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11947-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Senator Bill \nBradley as he closes a distinguished career in the U.S. Senate.\n  A thorough recitation of Senator Bradley's achievements would require \na large portion of today's Record. His many accomplishments as a \nscholar, an athlete, a writer, and a lawmaker are well-known. So let me \nlimit myself with just one area to which he has applied his \nconsiderable intelligence and energy, that of bringing a sense of \nfiscal responsibility to the Federal budget, and particularly, fairness \nto our Tax Code.\n  Senator Bradley has been praised as a serious student and an original \nthinker in terms of fiscal policy, marked by a disposition for \nprudence, fairness, and clarity. Little wonder he has been ranked \nhighly by the bipartisan Concord Coalition for his efforts to cut \nwasteful spending.\n  I have specifically appreciated his leadership in the effort to \nreform our system of tax expenditures, what amounts to a $400 billion \nannual Federal spending program with scant congressional oversight. \nSenator Bradley has sought reform of this system for years, and I will \nbe one of those who will continue that fight in the 105th Congress. I \nhope citizen Bradley will be available for advice, encouragement and \nsupport in that effort.\n  Mr. President, I know the U.S. Senate will miss the presence of Bill \nBradley, and I hope that, from whatever vantage point he has after he \ntakes his leave of us, he remains engaged in the public policy debate. \nWe need people of intelligence, energy and good will, and Bill Bradley \npossesses all those traits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11948-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my best wishes to \nSenator Alan Simpson of Wyoming upon his retirement from the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, in a New York Times interview published in June, \nSenator Simpson was asked to offer valedictory advice to the next class \nof Senators who will arrive with the 105th Congress. Among his \nsuggestions was ``be your best self'' and ``learn to compromise an \nissue without compromising yourself.'' Those words would be an apt \nsummation of Senator Simpson himself.\n  You always know where you stand with Alan Simpson, and where he \nstands with you, even when it's against you. He has demonstrated \nrespect for the Senate, his colleagues, and for the public policymaking \nprocess. He is a man to be trusted, and, therefore, respected, and that \nhas made working with him on the Judiciary Committee a pleasure.\n  I also appreciated Senator Simpson's cosponsorship of the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reform legislation.\n  Like so many of my colleagues, I will miss Alan Simpson, and I wish \nhim and his wife, Ann, all the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11948-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SIMON\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished lawmaker, a devoted public servant, and a good friend, \nthe senior Senator from IL, Paul Simon.\n  It has been nearly half a century since Paul Simon bought the Troy, \nIllinois, Tribune and began crusading against local crime and political \ncorruption, a pretty gutsy thing to do for a 19-year-old who had just \nleft college.\n  But, as many of us have learned, courage, candor, and dedication to \nprinciple are fundamental components of Paul Simon's character. I am \nproud to have had the opportunity to serve with him in the U.S. Senate, \nand I will miss him greatly upon his retirement.\n  Mr. President, 1996 marks Senator Simon's 40th year in public \nservice. He served in the Illinois House and Senate, and as Illinois' \nLieutenant Governor before coming to Washington in 1974 as a \nCongressman. He joined this body in 1985.\n  Millions of Americans can thank Paul Simon for his important role in \nthe passage of legislation to improve literacy and to support adult \neducation and school-to-work programs. He fought to make student loans \nmore affordable.\n  He has stood by America's working families. He has worked to improve \nAmerica's relations with the nations of Africa. His sense of social \njustice has anchored his opposition to the death penalty, and, not \nsurprisingly, this former crusading journalist also has been a reliable \ndefender of the first amendment.\n  He has been, as columnist Jack Anderson once described him, ``a model \nof integrity.''\n  He has also found time to write a weekly newspaper column, which has \nenjoyed a run of 48 years.\n  Mr. President, Senator Simon and I have served together on the \nJudiciary Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, and we have \nworked together closely on many issues, including bipartisan \nlegislation to reform our system of funding political campaigns, \nlegislation on which he was a cosponsor. Throughout it all, I have \nvalued his opinions, his camaraderie and his ability to maintain his \ncordiality so many feel is slipping away in our public debate.\n  I understand Senator Simon will be taking a post at Southern Illinois \nUniversity, teaching journalism and politics. I expect he may also keep \nwriting books. He has authored or coauthored 16 of them at last count, \nincluding an authoritative book on Abraham Lincoln's years in the \nIllinois Legislature and one about another crusading journalist, Elijah \nLovejoy.\n  Whatever his future pursuits, Paul Simon has already created a \nmemorable legacy in his public service career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11948-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11948-S11949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PRYOR\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the service \nand the friendship of Senator David Pryor of Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pryor's story begins in much the same way as \nanother retiring Senate colleague, Paul Simon--as a journalist. After \ngraduating from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville in 1957, \nSenator Pryor founded a weekly newspaper, The Ouachita Citizen. He \nentered politics in 1960, winning a seat in the Arkansas House of \nRepresentatives, to which he was reelected in 1962 and 1964, while \nsimultaneously earning a law degree from the University of Arkansas.\n  His career in public service carried him to Congress in 1966, to the \nGovernor's office in 1974 and then to the U.S. Senate in 1978. \nFollowing him to the Governor's office that same year was the young \nattorney general of Arkansas, William Jefferson Clinton.\n  Mr. President, my association with Senator Pryor began with my \njoining the Senate in 1993. As it happened, we both share a deep \ninterest in the issues affecting older Americans. Whether the issue is \nnursing homes, the price of prescription medications, fighting fraud \nand abuse, consumer protection, or, perhaps most importantly, the \nreform of our system of providing long-term health care, Senator Pryor \nhas been a leader.\n  In his position as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, and \nnow in his role as ranking member, Senator Pryor has been this \nChamber's pre-eminent voice on aging issues. It was no surprise that he \nwas selected last year to chair the White House Conference on Aging.\n  Perhaps most crucially, Senator Pryor has helped Americans to see \nthat we must all face the inescapable fact of growing older and the \nissues that fact presents. He has argued that issues of concern to our \nsenior citizens\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\nare not special interest issues, but have an impact on all other \ngenerations as well. When we are debating and voting on these issues, \nwe are debating and voting on our own futures. In Senator Pryor's eyes, \nwe are all, in fact, in this together, and one of the measures of our \nsociety is how well we treat one another.\n  Mr. President, America's senior citizens are losing a knowledgeable \nand effective advocate as David Pryor retires, and the U.S. Senate is \nlosing a gentleman and a friend. I have enjoyed working with Senator \nPryor, and I wish him and his family all the best as he takes his leave \nof an institution he has served so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11948-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR EXON\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my best wishes to \nmy colleague, Senator James Exon of Nebraska, upon his retirement from \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Exon's political career stretches back to 1970, when \nNebraskans first elected him as their Governor, and throughout, he has \nbuilt a reputation for fiscal responsibility and sober assessment of \nthe cost of government. He carried those qualities with him when he was \nelected to the Senate in 1978, part of a class which is seeing several \nmembers retire this year.\n  In a political environment that many fear is marked, perhaps a better \nword is scarred, by ever-greater partisanship and ever-declining \ncivility, Senator Exon has been able to work in a birpartisan manner \nand retain his cordiality, qualities which would be well-recommended to \nany lawmaker. His dedication to fiscal responsibility and reducing the \nFederal deficit has led him to take many courageous stands. I am \nparticularly grateful for his early and steadfast support of my efforts \nto prevent a massive tax cut from undermining our efforts to achieve a \nbalanced budget, a position that has not always been popular.\n  I have enjoyed working with Jim Exon, and I hope he enjoys a well-\nearned retirement from public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11949-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PELL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngentleman who has done so much to advance the cause of education in our \nNation, Senator Claiborne Pell, as he nears the close of a 36-year \ntenure in the U.S. Senate.\n  A recitation of Senator Pell's accomplishments and the qualities of \nhis character that have earned him the respect of so many of his Senate \ncolleagues would fill a sizable portion of the Congressional Record, \nbut I will limit myself to a few remarks which, I hope, reflect the \nrespect and admiration I feel for the senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, I have served with Senator Pell on the Foreign \nRelations Committee since I joined the Senate in 1993, and I quickly \nlearned to respect the word of a man who has been engaged in \ninternational affairs, and the development of America's role in the \npostwar world, since he attended the founding conference of the United \nNations in 1945.\n  He has been a stalwart supporter of the movement to secure and \nprotect human rights in all parts of the world. We have joined forces, \nfor example, to protest human rights abuses by the Indonesian \nGovernment against the people of East Timor.\n  Senator Pell pressed for his country to take a strong leadership role \nin protecting the global environment, and he has also been active in \nefforts to control chemical weapons and to keep nuclear weapons from \nbeing sited on the floors of our oceans.\n  But, Mr. President, Claiborne Pell will doubtless be remembered for \nanother accomplishment.\n  Since 1973, more than 60 million Americans have received college \neducations with the assistance of the Basic Educational Opportunity \nGrant Program, known since 1980 as the Pell grants. Fathering a program \nthat has done so much good would, in and of itself, rightly establish a \nSenator's reputation. For Senator Pell, it was a high point in a long \nand distinguished career.\n  Mr. President, it has been wisely said that only the educated are \nfree. In that sense, Senator Pell has probably been as responsible as \nanyone for securing freedom for millions of Americans.\n  He also did much to improve the quality of their lives with his \nefforts to create and nurture the National Endowments for the Arts and \nfor the Humanities.\n  If his accomplishments were not enough, Mr. President, Claiborne Pell \nalso set an example for senatorial behavior.\n  The people who send us here expect us to study the issues with care, \nconduct our business with civility and make our decisions with respect \nto the common good. That is exactly what Senator Pell did for 36 years, \nand that is why the people of Rhode Island kept sending him here.\n  Mr. President, I will miss Claiborne Pell. I wish him every \ncontentment in his life after he leaves this chamber, and I hope that \nwe who remain will be mindful of his example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11949-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NUNN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the long \nservice of Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and to wish him well as he \nleaves the Senate after 24 years.\n  Mr. President, I have read that, as a young man, Sam Nunn was judged \nby his home town newspaper back in Perry, GA as ``headed for something \nbig or important in this old world.'' Anyone who reflects on Senator \nNunn's long and distinguished career in this Chamber would agree that \nprediction was fulfilled, both in terms of ``something big'' and \n``something important.'' For Senator Nunn leaves behind an impressive \nreputation as a lawmaker.\n  Senator Nunn's reputation as an expert on military matters is well-\nknown, and, of course, well deserved. But I believe that reputation \ninadequately describes the breadth of Senator Nunn's intellectual \nreach, his deliberate and thoughtful approach to the issues before him, \nand his skill at forging bipartisan consensus. I was particularly \npleased when he became a co-sponsor of the McCain-Feingold bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform bill.\n  Whether the subject is national defense, economics, domestic policy \nor cultural values, and whether or not you end up agreeing with him, \nyou can learn things from listening to Sam Nunn. Equally as important, \nyou could, through his actions, be reminded of the value of respecting \nthis institution and the lawmaking process.\n  Mr. President, when Senator Nunn last year announced he would be \nleaving this body, to the shock and surprise of nearly everyone, he \nexpressed concern that the qualities of sensitivity and prudence were \nbeing driven out of political debate ``by the extremes in both parties, \nwho are usually wrong but never in doubt.''\n  I am not alone in sharing that concern with Senator Nunn, and I am \ncertain I am not alone in my appreciation for the way he has \ndemonstrated the value of a thoughtful, prudent approach to the making \nof public policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11949-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few heart-felt words \nof appreciation to Senator Nancy Kassebaum as she closes the book on a \ntruly distinguished public service career.\n  Last December, shortly after she announced her intention to retire, I \nrose to thank Senator Kassebaum for her leadership, her independent \nmind, and her graciousness, particularly in her stewardship of the \nSubcommittee on African Affairs. I am here today to offer a last \nfarewell to an outstanding colleague.\n  Since I spoke last December, Senator Kassebaum has added another \nsignificant accomplishment to her career--the passage of the Kassebaum-\nKennedy health insurance reform bill, and she was a cosponsor of the \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, support I greatly \nappreciated.\n  I am not certain what the future holds for Senator Kassebaum, but no \nmatter where she goes, she will, I am certain, always be an example of \nindependence, intelligence, prudence, and integrity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11949-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, J. Bennett Johnston, and to acknowledge \nhis long service in this body.\n  Senator Johnston's political career spans 32 years, beginning in the \nLouisiana State legislature. Since his first election to the U.S. \nSenate in 1972, he has universally been regarded as a leader on issues \naffecting this Nation's energy policy. He has also built a reputation \nas a patient lawmaker, willing to listen and always cordial.\n  When he announced his retirement in January of 1995, Senator Johnston \ndelivered a ringing statement of his respect for this chamber, saying, \n``The United States Senate, with all its faults and criticisms, remains \na bulwark of our democracy and a hallowed institution. I will stand up \nfor it, will not bash it, and will defend it against those who do.'' He \nhas contributed much to the deliberations and the workings of this \nbody, as well as being dedicated to advancing the interests of \nLouisiana and his constituents.\n  I wish Senator Johnston well after he leaves this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11950-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to an \noutstanding U.S. Senator, Mark Hatfield of Oregon, upon his retirement \nfrom this Chamber.\n  Serving in the U.S. Senate with Mark Hatfield, who was one of my \npersonal heroes long before I aspired to join this body, has been a \nvery meaningful experience in my career in public service. Senator \nHatfield has made his mark as one of the finest Senators to serve in \nthis body.\n  In a New York Times article 2 years ago, Senator Hatfield \ncharacterized himself as having been out of step most of my political \nlife. While it may perhaps be accurate that Senator Hatfield was out of \nstep with political fashion, he was always in step with his conscience, \nhis view of right and wrong, and his personal sense of integrity.\n  As a student in Wisconsin during the turbulent Vietnam war era, Mark \nHatfield's courage and leadership were well known to me. His persistent \nopposition to the United States' involvement in that tragic conflict \ndrew attention to the costs, material and spiritual, of the war, and he \ntook a bold step toward trying to avert further tragedy with his \njoining then-Senator George McGovern in sponsoring the McGovern-\nHatfield amendment to end the war.\n  This was the stance of a man who had himself seen the terrible costs \nof war up close. He commanded landing craft at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, \nand he was one of the first Americans to see Hiroshima after the \ndropping of the first atomic bomb in 1945.\n  A man of fiscal prudence, Senator Hatfield has consistently advocated \nmore reasonable levels of military spending, even during the 1980's, \nwhen a President from his own party was calling for the largest \nmilitary expansion in our Nation's history. He voted for a nuclear \nfreeze and voted against the gulf war resolution.\n\n  Mr. President, I have also admired Senator Hatfield's unwavering \nopposition to the death penalty, even in a time when increasing numbers \nof political leaders are suggesting that capital punishment is the \nsolution to crime.\n  Senator Hatfield once reminded us that, ``shallow symbols like the \ndeath penalty, only serve to further pummel the battered fabric of our \ndecreasingly civilized society.''\n  It has been an honor to stand with Senator Hatfield, voting against \nmeasures that would expand this barbaric practice of executions.\n  Mr. President, I spoke moments ago of Senator Hatfield as a man of \nfiscal prudence. He demonstrated his fidelity to that principle when he \nwithstood great pressure and voted against a proposed balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, asserting that the amendment was nothing \nmore than a procedural gimmick. Senator Hatfield recognized that \nCongress must accept its responsibility to use its power to reduce \nspending and balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, when Senator Hatfield announced his retirement, he \nsaid, ``I felt the call to public service and believed in the positive \nimpact government can have on the lives of people.'' For 40 years, Mark \nHatfield has been an example of a public servant who obeys the dictates \nof his conscience, who acts with the common good foremost in his mind, \nand who has tried to have a positive impact.\n  It truly has been an honor, Senator Hatfield, one for which I thank \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11950-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nsenior Senator from Alabama, a dedicated public servant, a respected \nlawmaker and a man I am proud to call my colleague, Howell Heflin.\n  Mr. President, in three U.S. Senate terms, Howell Heflin has \ndistinguished himself in many ways, and perhaps the most prominent has \nbeen in the area of judicial reform. He has always trusted and \nrespected the American judicial system.\n  His passion for the highest standards in our judicial system was \nkindled long before Howell Heflin joined the U.S. Senate in 1978. \nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice of the Alabama State Supreme Court, \nhe was recognized as one of the Nation's leaders on judicial reform.\n  He was subsequently selected as this country's outstanding appellate \njurist in 1975 and served as chairman of the National Conference of \nChief Justices in 1976 and 1977.\n  I have worked alongside Senator Heflin on the Judiciary Committee \nand, in particular, on the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and \nthe Courts. Throughout that association, I have appreciated his \nintelligence and his wisdom.\n  I will miss him, as, I am sure, will all his colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate, as he retires, I am told, to Tuscumbia, AL. I wish him all the \nbest as he takes his leave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11950-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments today to \npay tribute to our departing colleague, Senator Jim Exon.\n  Jim Exon's retirement brings to a close 26 years of distinguished \npublic service to the people of Nebraska. In Nebraska's proud political \ntradition, Jim Exon may be its most celebrated figure having served \nthat State for more than a quarter century--8 years as Governor and 18 \nas Senator.\n  Over the past 16 years of my Senate tenure, I've had the privilege to \nserve alongside Jim Exon, and I will sorely miss his spirit of \nfairness, his sense of humor and his fiery independent streak.\n  Mr. President, one of the most stricken features of the U.S. Senate \nis the wonderful river of diversity that flows through this Chamber. \nCase in point; Jim Exon and Chris Dodd.\n  Jim Exon and I come from far different backgrounds. We were born and \nraised in different parts of the country, he from South Dakota and \nNebraska, I from Connecticut. My training is as lawyer, his as a small \nbusinessman. And of course we focus on many different issues here in \nthe Senate, he on rural, agricultural and trade issues, me on \nchildren's, banking and foreign policy issues.\n  But that level of diversity is what makes this body and this Nation \nsuch a wonderful place. Ultimately, our recognition and appreciation \nfor those with different backgrounds and divergent views is what bring \nsuch greatness to America.\n  It is in that spirit that while serving on the Budget Committee with \nJim Exon I have come to truly cherish his\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\nsmall-town, common sense, Midwestern values.\n  If any trait best epitomizes Jim Exon, it is his overriding desire to \nmake the Federal Government live within its means. Democrats are often \nunfairly stereotyped as politicians who never met a spending program \nthey didn't like. While I find that characterization unfair, I can \nguarantee one thing, no one will ever say it about Jim Exon.\n  Jim Exon is certainly no Johnny-come-lately to the issue of deficit \nreduction. His adherence to the notion of fiscal responsibility has \ncharacterized his career, from his days as a small businessman to the \nNebraska Governor's Mansion and the U.S. Senate.\n  And, while I may have disagreed with his long-standing support for \nthe balanced budget amendment, I've always deeply respected and \nappreciated his tireless efforts to trim the Federal deficit.\n  Because, Senator Exon always rallies behind ideas and beliefs and not \npartisan politics.\n  He has always been a champion of a strong military force. When not \nfighting to keep our military preparedness at the highest level, he \nworked to lessen American military dependance on foreign suppliers and \nstop foreign takeovers that threaten national security.\n  Yet, at the same time he advocated a strong military, he was working \ntirelessly to end U.S. nuclear testing. Jim Exon can take particular \npride that due in part to his efforts, the United States signed on to a \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty recently at the United Nations in \nNew York. His unyielding pugnacity in bringing this issue to the fore \ndeserves the appreciation of every American.\n  But, for all his legislative accomplishments his most enduring legacy \nmay be his willingness to stretch out his hand in the name of \ncompromise and bipartisanship. As the National Journal noted, Jim \nExon's instincts run toward conciliation.\n  I fear that his intense dislike for conflict, partisan politics, and \nas he put it, the ever-increasing vicious polarization of the \nelectorate, has hastened his departure from the Senate\n  If anything, this is a body that must embody the spirit of men like \nJim Exon and not turn them away from the legislative process.\n  But, Senator Exon has made the decision to return to his beloved \nNebraska with his wife of 53 years, Patricia, and I join all my \ncolleagues in wishing him the best of luck in his retirement.\n  Most of all, and I'm sure this is the way Jim would want it, I wish \nbest of his luck to his beloved St. Louis Cardinals, champions of the \nNational League Central division. I know he looks forward to the end of \nthe 104th Congress so he can get out to the ballpark and cheer on the \nCards.\n  Mr. President, for almost two decades Jim Exon's dedication, \nsincerity, and commitment to public service have graced these Halls. I \njoin all my colleagues in saying he will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11950-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11951-S11954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as we bring the 104th Congress to a \nclose, I want to provide an update on our progress to enact ocean \nshipping reform legislation.\n  Last October, I introduced S. 1356, a companion bill to H.R. 2149. I \ndid so to begin Senate discussion of this important reform proposal. In \nNovember, I chaired a Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation hearing on the bill. The hearing revealed numerous \nissues affecting all segments of the liner ocean shipping industry that \nrequired further consideration. On July 18, 1996, I placed a proposed \namendment to S. 1356 in the Record for public review and comment. After \nseveral additional meetings with affected segments of the ocean \nshipping industry, we have made further progress in crafting acceptable \nlegislation.\n  Today I will ask to have printed in the Record a revised version of \nthat amendment to S. 1356. While there are a few issues requiring \nadditional work, we have made substantial progress toward producing a \nbill that will gain broad support within the affected industries and \nthe Congress.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Gorton, Lott, Hutchison, Snowe, \nInouye, Exon, and Breaux as cosponsors in this amendment. This \nbipartisan approach demonstrates just how serious we are about \nachieving meaningful reform.\n  We have run out of time in the 104th Congress to complete this \neffort. However, I intend to introduce ocean shipping reform \nlegislation early in the 105th Congress. With the support of my fellow \nCommerce Committee members and other Senators, we can pass ocean \nshipping reform legislation next year.\n  Mr. President, 95 percent of U.S. foreign commerce is transported via \nocean shipping. Approximately half of this amount is shipped in bulk \nform, oil, grain, chemicals, and so forth, on an unregulated vessel \ncharter basis. The remainder is shipped by container on liner vessels, \nregularly scheduled service under the Shipping Act of 1984, as \nregulated by the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC]. As the \ninternational liner shipping trade has evolved since 1984, many \nindustry segments have requested changes in the Shipping Act of 1984 to \nkeep pace with this evolution.\n  My amendment, the International Ocean Shipping Act of 1996, would \nimprove the Shipping Act of 1984 in several key areas. First, it would \neliminate the filing of common carrier tariffs with the Federal \nGovernment. Instead of requiring Government approval, tariffs would \nbecome effective upon publication through private systems. My amendment \nalso would increase tariff rate flexibility by easing restrictions on \ntariff rate changes and independent action by conference carriers.\n  Second, it would allow for greater flexibility in service contracting \nby shippers and ocean common carriers. The amendment would allow \nindividual ocean common carriers and shippers to negotiate confidential \nservice contracts.\n  Finally, responsibility for enforcing U.S. ocean shipping laws would \nbe shifted to the Surface Transportation Board, which would be renamed \nthe Intermodal Transportation Board. The Federal Maritime Commission \nwould be terminated at the end of fiscal year 1998. A single \nindependent agency would then administer domestic surface, rail, and \nwater transportation and international ocean transportation \nregulations. The Government would catch up to the carriers and \nshippers, who are already thinking intermodally.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my proposed amendment to \nS. 1356 be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  There being no objection, the text of the amendment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            amendment no. --\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Shipping Act of 1984 to encourage competition in \ninternational shipping and growth of United States imports and exports, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate Oakwood College as \nit celebrates its centennial year. Located in a beautiful setting on \n1,185 acres of prime land in the northwest region of Huntsville, AL, \nOakwood College was founded in 1896. It is a historically black liberal \narts college operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\n  The school enjoys a rich mix of more than 1,600 students drawn from \nmany States, nations, experiences, and outlooks on life. The college \nfosters a nurturing environment that has enabled students to develop \nself-esteem and achieve academic success, often for the first time.\n  A caring, supportive faculty of over 90 members--57 percent of whom \nhold doctorates--is responsible for Oakwood's proven ability to meet \nits students' academic needs.\n  Oakwood's keen sense of community is reflected in its direct \ninvolvement with citizens of the Tennessee Valley through various \ncampus initiatives and services. These include a speakers bureau, adult \ndegree completion program, student-manned Volunteer Action League, a \n25,000 watt radio station, annual United Negro College Fund banquet, \nand homecoming. Each year, the Oakwood homecoming events bring over \n10,000 alumni and friends of the college to Huntsville.\n  Oakwood is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and \nSchools, and offers associate and bachelor's degrees in more than 35 \nareas of concentration.\n  Oakwood has much to celebrate during its centennial year. Enrollment \nis higher than ever, graduates are achieving success at levels higher \nthan ever before, and the campus is beautiful and its atmosphere \ninviting. I congratulate Oakwood College on its 100th anniversary and \ncommend its administration, faculty, and students on all their \naccomplishments and academic success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11955-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE HISTORIC TREATY BETWEEN HUNGARY AND ROMANIA\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a \nhistoric event in Central Europe that, given the world focus on Bosnia, \nmay have been overlooked, the signing of a treaty this month making the \nend of a rivalry between Hungary and Romania that dates back at least \n1,000 years.\n  Our admirable Ambassadors, Donald M. Blinken in Hungary, and Alfred \nH. Moses in Romania, have written an article that nicely sums up the \nsignificance of this agreement in securing a stable Central Europe and \nprotecting the rights of ethnic minorities. It deserves as wide an \naudience as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the attached article \nfrom the Washington Post be placed in the Record at this point.\n  There being on objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 19, 1996]\n\n                         Looking Beyond Bosnia\n\n               (By Donald M. Blinken and Alfred H. Moses)\n\n       The attention devoted to events in Bosnia overlooks other \n     important and positive developments in the region which, in \n     history's ledger, could prove equally important. This week \n     Hungary and Romania signed a basic bilateral treaty marking \n     the end to centuries of contention. The treaty has the same \n     significance to Central Europe as the Franco-German \n     reconciliation had to Western Europe. Similar treaties have \n     been concluded between longtime rivals Slovakia and Hungary \n     and between the former Yogoslav Republic of Macedonia and \n     Greece.\n       Historic rivalry between Hungary and Romania dates back at \n     least a thousand years to the Magyar migrations from Central \n     Asia. This led to Hungarian domination of the Carpathian \n     basin, including modern-day Transylvania now in Romania, \n     which was part of Hungary until 1919, when the Treaty of \n     Trianon put an end to 300 years of Austro-Hungarian dominance \n     in the region. Unfortunately, Trianon did not end the \n     rivalry, and at the end of World War II, Budapest found \n     itself occupied by Romanian troops for the second time in the \n     century.\n       The people of Romania and Hungary liberated themselves from \n     communism seven years ago. But their rivalry remained. Now, \n     together, they are engaged in one final act of liberation, \n     this time from the unresolved legacies of their own tragic \n     and angry past.\n       The heart of the treaty also is the heart of post-Cold War \n     Europe's security challenges: how to reconcile the rights and \n     responsibilities of minorities with majorities in a part of \n     the world where peoples and borders do not match.\n       Bosnia is a brutal reminder of the power of these ethnic \n     and nationalistic hatreds. It shows how dangerous this power \n     is to peace not just in the Balkans but to Europe as a whole, \n     and how important it is to defuse ethnic grievances before \n     they explode.\n       The basic treaty obligates both countries to protect the \n     civil liberties and cultural identity of their national \n     minorities. Education at all levels is guaranteed by the \n     state in the minority's native tongue, as is the right to use \n     one's historic language in administrative and judicial \n     proceedings in areas of minority concentration. The same is \n     true of road signs, print and broadcast media and almost \n     every other aspect of communal life.\n       The test, of course, will come with implementation, but the \n     overwhelming support for the treaty in both countries is \n     reason for optimism. Moreover, both sides are committed \n     because both know the treaty clears an important hurdle to an \n     even more historic goal: integration with the West.\n       President Clinton's January 1994 decision, embraced by our \n     allies, to open NATO to new members and new partners, \n     together with efforts by the European Union to enlarge \n     eastward, has given every nation of Central Europe an \n     incentive to strengthen democracy and improve relations with \n     its neighbors.\n       Both Hungary and Romania have been active participants in \n     the Partnership for Peace, the innovative U.S. initiative \n     that has as one of its purposes to prepare NATO aspirants for \n     eventual membership. Romania was the first to join. And \n     Hungary hosts U.S. forces engaged in Bosnia. Troops from both \n     countries participate in joint Partnership for Peace \n     exercises on the territory of the other and are serving with \n     the implementation force in Bosnia.\n       NATO and the European Union have made it clear that states \n     aspiring to membership that have unresolved border disputes \n     or are unable to respect international norms on the treatment \n     of minorities ``need not apply.''\n       This clear message moved Hungary and Romania to look beyond \n     traditional boundaries and historical divisions toward a new \n     vision of a secure and prosperous continent no longer mired \n     in the conflicts of the past. In this spirit, both nations \n     have committed in the basic treaty to support NATO and EU \n     membership for the other.\n       By embracing countries in Central Europe that show the will \n     and the means to contribute to the stability and prosperity \n     of the continent as a whole, the EU and NATO can help bring \n     an end to historic enmities based on ethnic, cultural and \n     religious differences, including the historic divide between \n     Catholic West and Orthodox East. The example of Hungary and \n     Romania may point to the end of a millennium of Central \n     European history marked by perpetual conflict and human \n     tragedies past counting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11955-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11955-S11956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMERICA'S FUTURE BIRTHDAY: 50 YEARS OF REMARKABLE SERVICE BY GREAT \n                                PATRIOTS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, speaking of remarkable, I have been in \ncorrespondence with a great lady who fits that description perfectly. \nPhyllis Schlafly long ago became a legend in her own time, a fact that \nonce more came to mind a few weeks back when she and I discussed the \nthen-upcoming 50th anniversary of America' Future, Inc.\n  America's Future was founded by great Americans dedicated to the \npreservation--and the restoration--of the principles outlined by the \nFounders of this Republic. Dr. Robert Morris, who, by the way, \ncelebrates his 81st birthday today, is chairman and president, and a \ntrustee of America's Future, along with the following who also serve as \ntrustees: D. Clifford Allison, attorney of Wichita; Dr. Anthony T. \nBouscaren of Fayetteville, NY; Philip C. Clark of Greensboro, NC; \nWilliam J. Gill of Washington; Wesley H. Hillendahl of Santa Rosa, CA; \nDr. Anthony Kubek of Clearwater Beach, FL; John J. Metzler of New York \nCity; Mrs. Herbert Philbrick of Rye Beach, NH; Elizabeth E. Racer of \nWinchester, VA; Brig. Gen. Robert C. Richardson III (retired) of \nWashington; Henry Salvatori of Los Angeles; Phyllis Schlafly of Alton, \nIL; Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub (retired), Arlington, VA; Retired \nAmbassador Raymond L. Telles of El Paso; James L. Tyson of Darien, CT; \nW. Raymond Wannall, retired Assistant FBI Director, Silver Spring, MD, \nand John C. Wetzel, Milford, PA. Gen. Dan Graham was a trustee prior to \nhis death sometime back. I have been a trustee for several years.\n  Mr. President, when America's Future was founded, 50 years ago, the \nSecond World War had just ended and the United Nations had just been \nlaunched. The cold war had not yet begun, and neither had the \nconservative movement. Fifty years ago, the number of conservative, \nconstitutionalist, free-market-oriented organizations and\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\npublications could be counted on one hand. But the number of Communist-\nfront organizations, to say nothing of liberal and left groups, \nnumbered more than 1,000.\n  Our Nation was in transition, and our enemies moved quickly to make \nthe most of it. There was an obvious need for organizations and \nindividuals willing to defend the American way. And so, on April 24, \n1946, America's Future, Inc., a nonprofit, tax-exempt educational \norganization, was founded in New York City by a group of businessmen \ndedicated to the preservation of two great fundamental principles: The \ncompetitive, private enterprise system that has made our country strong \nand prosperous, and the constitutional form of government that has kept \nus free from the tyranny of individuals or factions.\n  America's Future had among its founding members such distinguished \nAmericans as Frank E. Gannett, Mrs. Amos Pinchot, and Gen. Robert E. \nWood of Sears, Roebuck & Co. The many prominent Americans who served as \ntrustees include National Association of Manufacturers past president, \nRobert L. Lund, Henning W. Prentis, Jr., of Armstrong Cork Co., former \nNew Jersey Governor Charles Edison, George W. Strake of Houston, and \nCharles Hook of Armco Steel.\n  Mr. President, between 1946 and 1948, America's Future sponsored and \nproduced over the ABC Radio Network a Sunday afternoon commentary \nfeaturing Samuel B. Pettengill, former Member of Congress and \nnationally known constitutional authority. America's Future also began \nthe publication and distribution of books, pamphlets, and reprints now \nnumbering in the millions.\n  In the 1950's, noted journalist and staunch patriot John T. Flynn \njoined forces with America's Future. He went behind the headlines to \nexplain the real significance of events and personalities. His \ncommentary for America's Future, aptly named ``Behind The Headlines,'' \nwas carried on more than 300 radio stations of the Mutual Broadcasting \nSystem. Commentaries by Flynn were also distributed to hundreds of \nnewspapers.\n  America's Future launched its Textbook Evaluation Project in 1958, to \ngive due recognition to textbooks that accurately portray our history, \nour government, and our economic system--and to alert the unsuspecting \npublic to those who distort the fact or justify the expansion of big \ngovernment. The first issue of the America's Future newsletter appeared \nthe following year, in 1959.\n  R.K. Scott devoted 31 years of his life to America's Future, \nsucceeding the late Robert Lund as president in 1958, and becoming the \nfull-time moderator of ``Behind the Headlines'' in 1961. John Wetzel, \nwho had served America's Future as treasurer since 1958, succeeded as \npresident in 1989. Philip Clarke, a veteran journalist who has reported \nfor the Associated Press, Newsweek magazine, and the Mutual \nBroadcasting System, became the voice of the syndicated radio \ncommentary, ``Behind the Headlines.''\n  Robert Morris, the renowned geopolitical strategist and one of \nAmerica's foremost authorities on intelligence and national security, \nbecame chairman of the board of America's Future in 1989 and president \nin 1995. He served as a U.S. Navy intelligence officer during World War \nII and was chief counsel to the U.S. Senate Internal Security \nSubcommittee from 1951 to 1953. A former judge, the former president of \ntwo Texas universities, the author of numerous books and a syndicated \nnewspaper column, Morris is currently the chairman of the National \nCommittee to Restore Internal Security.\n  Mr. President, America's Future continues to provide its ``Behind The \nHeadlines'' commentaries free of charge to any radio station or \nnewspaper that requests them. ``Behind the Headlines'' is currently \nbroadcast by more than 120 radio stations across America, and published \nby more than 300 newspapers. The commentaries are summarized for \nthousands of subscribers nationwide in the bimonthly America's Future \nnewsletter, which is available free of charge to college and high \nschool libraries, ``Behind The Headlines'' can also be found on the \nAmerica's Future worldwide website--http://www.accessus.net/\neamiller/af.\n  Methods of communications may change, but the principles America's \nFuture espouses will remain timeless. Whether it's on the radio, in \nnewspapers and pamphlets and newsletters, on the Internet, or though \nsome medium not yet imagined, America's Future will keep reminding our \ncountrymen that the best way to protect the freedoms Americans enjoy is \nby preserving our constitutional form of government and our private \nenterprise system.\n  As it stands poised on the threshold of a new century, America's \nFuture can by justly proud of its success in combating the \nphilosophical errors of our era. Big government is not dead yet, but it \nis discredited. We have every reason to hope, therefore, that tomorrow \nwill bring a rebirth of freedom in our country. There truly is a lot to \nlook forward to in America's future, and we congratulate America's \nFuture, Inc., on the occasion of its golden anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11955-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11956-S11957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we approach the end of another Congress, \nwe engage in our biannual tradition of bidding farewell to those \nSenators who will not be returning in January. This practice epitomizes \nthe wonderful circle of closure and renewal that marks our service in \nthe U.S. Senate. Senators who have been blessed to serve their country \nmove on to accept new challenges, and fresh lawmakers, intent on \nserving their constituents and their Nation, take that place. All, of \ncourse, of these exits are not always voluntary because they are also \ncontingent on the desires and wishes of the people we represent. But, \nin some cases, our fellow Members decide on their own, sometimes \nagainst the wishes of their constituents, that they will no longer \nserve in the U.S. Senate. Such is the case this year.\n  Mr. President, the 105th Congress will be a much different place come \nJanuary 1997, whether it is controlled by Democrats or Republicans. \nCome January, some of America's finest public servants will be moving \non to fresh challenges and embracing new goals.\n  For more than 200 years, some of our Nation's greatest thinkers and \nmost eminent legislators have served in this body, from John Calhoon, \nHenry Clay, and Daniel Webster to Lyndon Johnston, Everett Dirksen, and \nRichard Russell.\n  Those who are retiring this year, both Democrats and Republicans, are \na distinguished and impressive group of lawmakers.\n  Mr. President, we unfortunately live in an era where the level of \npartisanship and the level of brinkmanship, I believe, threatens the \nvery foundations of this institution. When compromise has become \nsynonymous with failure, and name calling, too often, and scoring \npolitical points is taking the place of legislating, the 13 Senators \nwho are retiring represent, in my view, the spirit of compromise and \nbipartisanship that must invigorate this institution if we are to \nregain the abiding faith of the American people.\n  These legislators--these 13, in my view--are the sort of legislators \nwho have sought common ground, not partisan advantage. They have \nstrived to build bridges to their opponents instead of using wedge \nissues to divide us as a people and as a nation. They are exactly the \ntype of lawmakers I believe our Founding Fathers had in mind when they \ncreated this institution more than 200 years ago.\n  Over the past 2 years I have come to the floor on several occasions \nto bid farewell to our retiring colleagues. Today I would like to focus \nmy remarks on two Members who I know will be particularly missed.\n  Throughout my 16 years as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I have had the \ngreat honor to serve alongside David Pryor. I mean that both \nfiguratively and literally, as he has been my neighbor here on the \nSenate floor for the past 12 years. David Pryor is one of the body's \nmost distinguished and best loved Members. He is an able legislator \nand, most of all, a very close and dear friend.\n  Mr. President, the small State of Arkansas has an impressive \npolitical tradition. By all accounts, it has given this country some of \nits most influential and distinguished leaders and lawmakers. William \nFulbright was a giant in the area of international relations.\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\n Senator Bumpers, our colleague in the Senate, is truly one of the \ngreat orators of this institution and one of the most passionate voices \nwho has ever served in the U.S. Senate. And, of course, our President, \nWilliam Clinton.\n  But for all of those wonderful politicians who have served the State \nof Arkansas, David Pryor remains by all accounts the most popular and \nthe most beloved politician in all of Arkansas. This is certainly no \naccident, because throughout his career in politics, from the House of \nRepresentatives to the Arkansas Governor's mansion to the U.S. Senate, \nDavid Pryor never forgot where he came from and he never lost touch \nwith the people who elected him.\n  Our colleague, Dale Bumpers, said of David Pryor that he personifies \n``the nobility of public service.'' Mr. President, I could not agree \nmore.\n  As a freshman Senator in 1979, David sent his Senate staff back to \nArkansas to work alongside their constituents to learn firsthand the \nconcerns of Arkansans, and as a young House Member he investigated \nnursing homes by donning an orderly's uniform and going undercover into \nnursing homes. That subterfuge is one of many burdens David Pryor took \non for our Nation's elderly.\n  Throughout his hard work, he helped establish the Special Committee \non Aging. And he never stopped fighting to keep drug prices down for \nelderly patients. David and I didn't always see eye to eye on this \nissue. In fact, we disagreed on this particular question. But our \npolicy differences never resulted in personal differences. Most \nimportantly, they never got in the way of our friendship and genuine \naffection for each other.\n  David Pryor has also long been a tireless advocate for American \ntaxpayers, working from his position on the Senate Finance Committee to \nsmooth relations between the Internal Revenue Service and taxpayers.\n  Here in the U.S. Senate he has worked as hard as any Member to \nencourage civility and a family-friendly atmosphere. Time limits on \nvotes and recess schedules remain a lasting part of his senatorial \nlegacy.\n  But, most of all, David Pryor brought a quiet humility and gentle \ndemeanor to a place that too often is known for its sharp elbows and \nshort tempers. He has earned the respect and admiration of both \nRepublicans and Democrats, which is no easy feat in this day and age.\n  I doubt there is a Member who isn't genuinely saddened to see David \nPryor leave the U.S. Senate. He personifies all that we must continue \nto strive for as politicians and lawmakers, and as national leaders.\n  For myself and all of those whose lives he has touched and for all of \nthose in this Chamber, he will be sorely missed. I wish he and Barbara \na happy and healthy and busy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11956-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RETIRING MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me also today pay tribute to a great \nSenator and a close and dear friend from the State of Louisiana, J. \nBennett Johnston.\n  Bennett Johnston has served his beloved State of Louisiana for the \npast 32 years. He began his life in politics in the Louisiana House of \nRepresentatives in 1964, and went on to the Louisiana Senate in 1968, \nand in 1972 he became a Member of the U.S. Senate, where he has served \nwith great distinction and honor for the past 24 years.\n  As much as any man or woman in this body, Bennett Johnston truly \nunderstands the critical importance of compromise, bipartisanship, and \nworking across party lines. He always embraced the opportunity to \nengage an opponent rather than tear them down, and by doing so he has \nmade the Senate a more civil place in which to serve.\n  I think the words of our former colleague, Russell Long, best \ndescribed Bennett Johnston's tenure. Russell Long said, ``No other \nMember of the Senate has accomplished more for the people he \nrepresents. No State in the Union has had a more faithful servant nor a \nmore powerful advocate than Louisiana has had in Bennett Johnston.''\n  Bennett Johnston was always looking out for the people and the best \ninterests of the people of Louisiana. He became an expert on issues \nthat make many Senators' eyes glaze over with the mere mention of the \nsubject matter. But they were vitally critical to his State's future: \nwetlands issues, national defense, and energy policy.\n  For his home State of Louisiana, Bennett Johnston worked to improve \neducational opportunities and helped to provide funds for new research \nfacilities, better interstate highways, new ports, levies, and three \nnational parks.\n  His knowledge of the minutia of energy issues, his skill at crafting \ncoalitions, and his tireless efforts shepherded one of the most \ncomprehensive energy-related measures through the U.S. Senate in 1992. \nThat bill remains one of the most important achievements of the 102d \nCongress, and it is a fitting legacy to Bennett Johnston's tenure in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  When he announced his retirement from this body, he didn't use it as \nan opportunity to attack the Senate or to decry his service here, but \ninstead to reaffirm his commitment to the principles and values of this \ninstitution, and of public service.\n  I would like to quote from his own statement on the day he announced \nhis retirement. He said, ``Politics and public service are synonymous \nwith the pursuit of public office. It is a high calling in our society. \nIt is the best opportunity for helping your State, your country, and \nyour fellow man. The Senate, with its faults and criticisms, remains \nthe bulwark of our democracy, and a hallowed institution. I will stand \nup for it, will not bash it, and will defend it against those who do.''\n  Those words, I think, Mr. President, stand in sharp contrast to the \nvoices of cynicism that we often hear not only in this town but also, \nfrankly, too often in this Chamber. They are the words of a man who \nloves the U.S. Senate and who treasures the opportunity to serve his \nState and his country.\n  To Bennett Johnston and his wife, Mary, and their family, I wish them \nGodspeed and the best wishes in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11957-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11957-S11958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO THE JUDGE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues in paying tribute to our distinguished and venerable \ncolleague, the Judge, Senator Howell Heflin.\n  I've had the great honor to serve--and here on the floor of the \nSenate, to sit alongside the Judge from Alabama--throughout my entire \ntenure as a U.S. Senator.\n  Mr. President, Howell Heflin brought integrity, character, virtue and \nhis folksy Southern humor to a body that is often devoid of such \ncharacteristics. What's more, his life has been consistently marked by \na constant, single-minded devotion to public service and the love of \nhis country.\n  During WWII, like many of his contemporaries, he answered the call of \nhis Nation and enlisted in the Marine Corps. In the process, he became \na bonafide war hero.\n  Lt. Howell Heflin joined in the initial assault to liberate the \nisland of Guam from its Japanese occupiers. He was wounded twice and \nspent considerable time recovering in stateside hospitals. For his \nbravery, he was awarded two Purple Hearts and the Silver Star.\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\n  After the War, Senator Heflin became a trial lawyer in his native \nAlabama, which began his career-long fascination and devotion to the \nlaw. In 1970, he was elected Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, where \nhe received the moniker that many know him by in this body--Judge \nHeflin.\n  That nickname describes well his tenure here in the U.S. Senate and \nprovides context to the issues he championed as a Senator.\n  As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he brought an \nunparalleled understanding of the judicial process and judicial \ninterpretation to the Senate. Judge Heflin was instrumental in \nimproving our Federal courts, and he worked tirelessly to improve and \nreform our Nation's judicial system.\n  Howell Heflin also brought his wealth of legal knowledge to his role \nas chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. While largely a thankless \nand sometimes tedious position, he never shirked his responsibilities \nto his colleagues and to the reputation and integrity of the Senate.\n  Most of all though, Howell Heflin was always looking out for the \npeople of Alabama. Not surprisingly he's been dubbed the ``Spokesman \nfor Southern Agriculture'' for his unwavering and vigilant support for \nAlabama's rich agricultural heritage.\n  While often tagged as a conservative Democrat, he displayed the \nfervor of many a New Deal Democrat when he came to the Senate floor to \nspeak passionately about issues that directly affected his \nconstituents--from rural electrification, Federal crop insurance, the \npeanut subsidy program to the space station and civil rights \nlegislation.\n  But, most of all Howell Heflin brought a sense of quiet dignity and \ntolerance to this body. When he announced his retirement from the \nSenate, he spoke with great fervor about the need for a new level of \npolitical discourse and conduct in our Nation.\n  He said: ``We must set a new course in this Congress and across the \nland--a course of moderation, tolerance, responsibility and \ncompassion.'' These words epitomized Howell Heflin's service in this \nbody, and in my view they are the essence of what service in the U.S. \nSenate is all about.\n  This place will not quite be the same without Howell Heflin's \nindomitable presence, his deep Southern drawl and and his wonderful \nsense of humor. They will not easily be replaced.\n  But for every Member of this body there comes a time to move on and \nembrace new challenges and new goals. That time has come for the Judge. \nI wish Howell and his wife ``Mike'' best wishes in their retirement and \nall their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11957-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PAUL SIMON\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as the Senate fast approaches the end of the \n105th Congress, I would like to take this opportunity to bid a fond \nfarewell to one of our most distinguished colleagues--Senator Paul \nSimon from Illinois.\n  Throughout his entire life, Paul Simon has been devoted to his fellow \ncitizens and has never wavered from the firmly-held beliefs and \nprinciples that guide his public life.\n  From his first job in 1948, at the tender of age 19, as the Nation's \nyoungest editor-publisher, Paul Simon was focused on helping his \ncommunity. From his position at the Troy Tribune he led an impressive \ncrusade against local criminals and machine politicians.\n  In 1954, he officially began his career in public service as a member \nof the Illinois House of Representatives. He went on to serve in the \nState Senate and as Illinois Lieutenant Governor until coming to \nWashington as a Congressman in 1974 and finally becoming a Senator in \n1984.\n  Throughout that time, Paul Simon never lost touch with his Midwestern \nroots, his reformist ideals or with his constituents, who continued to \nreturn him to office, year after year.\n  Paul Simon was one of the first politicians in this Nation to \ndisclose his personal finances, starting in the 1950's.\n  Additionally, throughout his career he focused on helping provide \neducational opportunity for the American people. In the Illinois \nLegislature, he was one of the first lawmakers to propose legislation \nthat would provide a public education for children with disabilities.\n  Later he was one of the original sponsors of similar landmark \nlegislation on the Federal level, which became the law of the land in \n1975.\n  Paul Simon helped lead the way in attacking the problem of illiteracy \nby working to pass the National Literacy Act.\n  In 1994, he continued to lead the way on education by working to open \nup new school-to-work opportunities, and he was the lead sponsor of the \nPresident's effort to reform our student loan program. I was pleased to \nwork with Senator Simon and today we can both look with pride to the \nnew direct student loan program.\n  Throughout his career, Paul Simon has represented the traits of \nfairness, integrity, and honesty, which has earned him the respect of \nall members of this body.\n  This was never more evident then last week, when all the members of \nthe Senate gathered together to honor him by donning imitations of his \ntrademark bow-tie. That salute to our distinguished colleague was an \nappropriate tribute to a man as unique and distinctive as Paul Simon.\n  To Paul and his wife Jeanne, I wish him the best of luck in all their \nfuture endeavors. For a man who has written 15 books I can't imagine \nthat we've heard the last of Paul Simon and I look forward to enjoying \nhis wise counsel in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11958-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11958-S11959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like this opporunity to pay tribute \nand bid farewell to our distinguished colleague from Colorado--Senator \nHank Brown.\n  Hank Brown will be leaving the U.S. Senate after an all-too brief, \nyet impressive stay in this body. A dedicated and thoughtful \nlegislator, his leadership and intellect will be sorely missed.\n  Beginning with his experiences in the House of Representatives to his \none term here in the Senate, he's been an outspoken leader on issues of \nforeign policy, deficit reduction, trade, and the military.\n  His integrity, fairness, and commitment to principles were evident in \nhis approach to all these issues.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Senator Brown on both the Budget \nand Foreign Relations Committees. In both committees, I've been \nimpressed with his perseverance and dedication to developing innovative \npolicy options.\n  Senator Brown possesses a rare but important enthusiasm for delving \ninto the Government's fiscal situation. His dedication to discuss \nbudgetary issues is particularly evident in his extra-curricular \nactivities.\n  While many of us are consumed by the lengthy schedules of day-to-day \ncongressional affairs, Hank Brown took the time to earn two graduate \ndegrees while a Member of the Congress. In 1988, while still in the \nHouse, he earned a degree in accounting, and 2 years earlier, he \nreceived a master's degree in taxation. His scholarly grasp of \nbudgetary matters is evidence of his abiding commitment to be well-\ninformed and aware of all possible policy directions.\n  Senator Brown has been equally dedicated to foreign policy issues. \nHis amendment to expand NATO to include former Communist states in \ncentral and Eastern Europe is just one example of his efforts. The NATO \namendment gained bipartisan support because of his strong analytical \ngrasp of the issue and an important willingness to seek out compromise.\n  Hank Brown's efforts on this issue stand as an example to us all that \na political process often accused of inefficiency and gridlock can work \nwhen ideas and cooperation are elevated above the cynical tone too \noften found in this Chamber.\n  Senator Brown is also a distinguished Vietnam veteran, awarded the \nAir Medal with gold stars, the Vietnam Service Medal, the National \nDefense Medal, and a Naval Unit Citation. He served in the Colorado \nState Senate from 1972 to 1976, and was named ``Outstanding Young Man \nof Colorado.'' Afterwards, he spent 10 years in the House of \nRepresentatives before being elected to the Senate in 1990.\n  Senator Brown's experience as a military veteran and long-term public \nservant is indicative of his tireless devotion to addressing the \nproblems that face our Nation today.\n\n[[Page S11959]]\n\n  His extraordinary public service has been marked by his intelligence, \nfirm commitment to principle, and genuine sense of duty to the State of \nColorado. He has made a place for himself in this Senate that will far \noutlast the time spent here.\n  I wish him and his wife Nan the best of luck in all their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11958-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A TRIBUTE TO SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, after 24 years of service we are sad to \nsee Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia go. Like his uncle before him, the \nHonorable Carl Vinson, chair of the House Armed Services Committee, and \nthat other eminent Georgian, the Venerable Richard Russell, chair of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, he has served with distinction, \nensuring our Nation's defense in the shifting sands of the post cold \nwar. Sam Nunn can claim credit for overhauling the much maligned \nprocurement system and for streamlining excess base closings. \nAdditionally, he is responsible for engaging the Department of Defense \nin the war against drugs. With bipartisan support, he sponsored the \ncomprehensive Omnibus Anti-Drug Substance Abuse Act of 1988 that \naddresses every facet of the issue: law enforcement, interdiction, \ntreatment, education, and increased cooperation with the international \ncommunity and our own Internal Revenue Service. The latter signals the \nagency's return to its former G-man days, targeting organized crime and \nthe narcotics industry.\n  Among our esteemed colleague's forays on crime are his chairmanship \nand current ranking minority leadership on the Senate's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. In this venue, Sam probed the fraud and \nabuse of student financial aid. He likened the Nation's Pell Grant \nProgram to ``an open bank with no security guards and no tellers''. As \na result of this and other investigations like it, reform measures were \nincluded in reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 1992.\n  Other significant achievements belonging to Sam include a 1974 bill \nwhich created a mechanism for tracking down runaway parents and holding \nthem financially responsible for their children, definitely a harbinger \nof family values. He saw the value of providing numerous initiatives \nfor small businesses, including the Small Business Development Center \nprogram which provides management and technical assistance to small \nbusinesses across the country, and the Preferred Surety Bond Guaranty \nProgram enacted in 1988 and designed to encourage more standard surety \ncompanies to participate in the Small Business Administration's \nGuaranteed Bond Program, strengthening the heart of the American \neconomy, the small businessman. And lest you ever think that Sam \nforgets the agricultural heritage of Georgia, he cosponsored the \nConservation Reserve Program that encourages farmers to retire highly \nerodible and environmentally sensitive crop land on a 10-year cycle. \nGeorgia, along with the rest of us, can thank him for the Georgia \nWilderness Act of 1984 and the creation of the Chattahoochee River \nNational Recreation Area.\n  Yes, he will be remembered as an outstanding Senator and defence \nexpert in the Georgia tradition, but as you can see, he has been much \nmore. Most of all, he has been someone that the people of Georgia and \nthe United States were proud to have serve them as a Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11959-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11959-S11961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATOR PRESSLER'S SERVICE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON \n      COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION IN THE 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a friend and long-time \ncolleague, Senator Larry Pressler from South Dakota. Not only does \nSenator Pressler serve South Dakotans' by fighting for the traditional \nway of life South Dakotans want and deserve, he serves the people of \nhis State and all Americans as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. President, by any measure \nthe Senate Commerce Committee has been one of the most productive in \nthe Senate and, indeed, in either body, during the 104th Congress.\n  I say this with the greatest sincerity. I know it is true because I \nhave the pleasure of working side-by-side with Senator Pressler on the \nCommerce Committee. As a committee member, I have watched him work \ntirelessly on behalf of all Americans on some of the most far-reaching \nand challenging issues this Congress has faced.\n  Let me say a bit about the vast responsibilities the senior Senator \nfrom south Dakota has as chairman of the Commerce Committee. On a daily \nbasis, Chairman Pressler labors on matters ranging from promoting the \nUnited States as an international tourism destination to shaping the \ndynamic course of a modernized national communications policy; from \nintervening on behalf of ranchers into questionable meatpacking \nconcentration practices to working to make the skies as safe as \npossible for the travelling public.\n  These are just a few examples of the chairman's vast \nresponsibilities. The list goes on. His job is no small task and in my \nhumble opinion, Senator Pressler is a superb chairman.\n  As I think about significant national events we faced during the \n104th Congress, the safety of our Nation's skies comes to mind. Two \nrecent air tragedies, first in the Florida Everglades, and more \nrecently, off the coast of New York, have focused the Nation on \naviation safety. Long before he was chairman of the committee with \njurisdiction over aviation, Senator Pressler worked aggressively to \nachieve safer skies for the travelling public.\n  As chairman, Senator Pressler made aviation safety one of the main \npriorities of his committee, holding various aviation safety hearings \nand leading Congress on working to improve air safety.\n  Much of his work on aviation safety and security should soon become \nlaw as part of compromise legislation he introduced reauthorizing the \nFederal Aviation Administration. Senator Pressler served as chairman of \nthe joint House/Senate Conference Committee that produced the \ncompromise FAA reform and reauthorization bill that will soon be on its \nway to the White House for the President's signature.\n  Among its provisions, the bill makes it easier for family members to \nget accurate information and counseling after a loved one has perished \nin a plane crash. The bill also calls for the immediate installation of \nexplosive detection technology to beef-up security at our Nation's most \nvulnerable airports. This is why I chose Senator Pressler to represent \nthe Senate on Vice President's Gore's Commission on Air Safety and \nSecurity. He has the kind of experience in aviation matters that the \nGore Commission needs.\n  As he does time and time again, Senator Pressler also delivered for \nSouth Dakota in this legislation. Under his leadership, the bill \nreauthorizes the Essential Air Service program at a level of $50 \nmillion per year. Mr. President, that doubles the size of this program \nso vitally important to South Dakota's, and this Nation's, smallest air \nports. Senator Pressler's hard work ensures people living in our small \ncommunities will remain linked to the national air transportation \nnetwork.\n  The bill also creates a new funding formula for the Airport \nImprovement Program. AIP is the program by which airports across the \ncountry, from the largest to the smallest, receive assistance in \nmaintaining their core facilities such as runways and terminals. Once \nagain fighting for the people of South Dakota, Chairman Pressler saw to \nit that the new AIP program guarantees that if overall airport funding \nis significantly reduced, smaller airports will not be \ndisproportionately disadvantaged. Also of importance to smaller \nairports, the bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a \nrural air service study, including an examination of why air fares are \nso high in small air service markets and provides increased flexibility \nto small airports working on multi-year airport construction projects.\n  If we look at aviation in the context of global commerce, Senator \nPressler has used his chairmanship to pry open air service markets for \nU.S. carriers worldwide. The German open skies aviation agreement, \nwhich Pressler helped secure earlier this year, is just one example. \nThese agreements are good for our national economy, good for the \nairline industry and good for the consumer. Under Pressler's \nstewardship, we are making more progress\n\n[[Page S11960]]\n\nthan ever before on securing international aviation agreements.\n  When most people hear the name Pressler, they think of \ntelecommunications. He is, after all, credited with achieving the most \nmassive overhaul of our Nation's telecommunications policy since the \n1930's. Already, people are using new telecommunications products made \npossible through the deregulation of the industry. Through Chairman \nPressler's efforts, we are now ready to take America's \ntelecommunications industry into the 21st century.\n  Pressler's telecommunications law translates into new, more \naffordable communications options for our homes, hospitals, schools, \nfarms and even highway infrastructure. Under the Pressler \nTelecommunications Act, phone service providers, cable companies, local \ntelevision broadcasters, and other companies will compete to bring us \nentertainment, telephone service, news and information. Once fully \nimplemented, this will mean lower prices for a wide range of \ncommunication products.\n  Mr. President, this new law certainly will benefit all Americans. \nHowever, in drafting the law, Senator Pressler once again championed \nthe needs of those in rural parts of the country--those who \nhistorically have benefited least from advances in communications \ntechnologies. Thanks to Senator Pressler, South Dakotans will enjoy a \nwide range of new services.\n  Take, for example, telemedicine. Telecommunications can connect the \nworld's finest physicians to the most remote areas of the country. It \nmeans equality. It means people living in sparsely populated or rural \nareas will enjoy the latest medical information via computer and \nsatellite.\n  On the farm, access to information on weather, market conditions, new \ncrops and the latest scientific advances is vital to successful farming \noperations. The Pressler Telecommunications Act will help bring this \ninformation to farmers and ranchers more quickly and efficiently than \never before, and at affordable rates.\n  Thanks to Senator Pressler, students in the classrooms of South \nDakota will more rapidly see expanding opportunities in distance \nlearning. These students will be able to receive foreign language, \nscience and advanced mathematics instruction from teachers miles away. \nElectronic library support will increase, allowing more readers to \nreserve or renew books by phone or computer. All this will allow \nschools to better manage scarce resources.\n  Mr. President, the Pressler Telecommunication Act is one of, if not \nthe most significant legislative accomplishment of this Congress. It is \nextremely important consumer oriented legislation. It is the most \nsweeping and revolutionary piece of legislation authored by a South \nDakota Senator since the framing of America's Interstate Highway System \nwas initiated by the venerable Senator Karl Mundt.\n  A second major piece of consumer oriented legislation also came from \nSenator Pressler's Commerce Committee--a product liability reform bill \naimed at curtailing frivolous lawsuits. This legislation is good for \nbusinesses both small and large. At the same time, Chairman Pressler \nwas committed to the proposition that the Commerce Committee write a \nreform bill that also would benefit consumers.\n  In 1995, the Commerce Committee reported legislation that would do so \nin a number of ways. First, it would mean more jobs. Second, it would \nlower the cost of goods. Third, it would mean a greater selection of \ngoods from which to choose. Fourth, it would encourage testing to make \ngoods safer. Finally, it would help to maintain and, in some cases, \nimprove the quality of products available to consumers.\n  While the Commerce Committee had held 23 days of hearings on product \nliability reform and reported seven product liability reform bills \nsince 1981, under Senator Pressler's chairmanship, the full Senate \npassed a bill for the very first time in its history. Chairman Pressler \nthen led the Senate delegation into a conference that crafted a \ncompromise bill that ultimately looked very much like the legislation \noriginally reported from Pressler's committee.\n  In another first, both Houses of Congress passed this product \nliability reform legislation and sent it to the White House for \nsignature. Sadly, in a display of raw, election year political game \nplaying, the President vetoed this important bill. I know Chairman \nPressler's committee will again produce meaningful product liability \nreform legislation in the next Congress.\n  As Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler also has been \na leader in efforts to reduce the size of government. Late last year, \nthe President signed into law the ICC Termination Act of 1995. Senator \nPressler introduced the bill in the Senate. As a result of his efforts, \nan entire Federal agency, the Interstate Commerce Commission, closed \nits doors forever on December 31, 1995.\n\n  The ICC Termination Act also eliminated scores of outdated, \nunnecessary, and burdensome regulatory requirements and restrictions \nhampering surface transportation industries. At the same time, Senator \nPressler ensured the law also was designed to ensure continued \nprotections for shippers against industry abuse--protections vitally \nimportant to shippers in places like his home State of South Dakota. A \nbalance between regulatory relief and continued oversight was achieved.\n  The law also created a Rail-Shipper Transportation Advisory Council. \nThe council is designed to advise the new Board and Congress on issues \nof importance to small shippers and small railroads, issues such as \nrail car supply, rates, competition, and procedures for addressing \nclaims.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, in response to the disturbing trend \nunder which America slipped out of first place as the world's most \nvisited country, Senator Pressler wrote legislation to put the United \nStates back on the map as the world's No. 1 tourism destination. His \nbill, the Tourism Organization Act of 1996, passed the Senate and he \nworked tirelessly to craft a compromise bill that later passed in the \nHouse.\n  The Pressler tourism bill is now heading to the White House for the \nPresident's signature. Some may overlook the significance of the travel \nand tourism industry, but it employs more than 6.3 million people and \nis the second largest employer in America. Senator Pressler knows how \nvital this industry is to all Americans.\n  I have mentioned just a few of the different hats this chairman has \nworn during the 104th Congress. There are many, many more. Chairman \nPressler toiled hard at the helm of a committee that also produced a \ngreat deal of vital, although not headline grabbing, legislation. His \ncommittee developed legislation needed to allow the Coast Guard to \ncontinue its functions vital to the security and safety of this Nation. \nIt crafted what many are calling the most important environmental \nlegislation to come out of the 104th Congress in the form of the \nSustainable Fisheries Act. Senator Pressler's Commerce Committee \nfurthered its environmental agenda by producing the Antarctic Science, \nTourism, and Conservation Act of 1996. Each of these bills is of major \nconsequence. All of these measures are on their way to the President \nfor signature.\n  Mr. President, I note with a certain amount of personal pride that \nCongress also acted on a bill I introduced, S. 1505, the Accountable \nPipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996. This legislation also \noriginated in the Commerce Committee. It reauthorizes appropriations \nfor natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety programs, but it \ndoes much more.\n  S. 1505 is designed to make changes in existing law that reduce the \nrisks and enhance environmental protection associated with pipeline \ntransportation. I introduced this bill last December. Since that time, \nChairman Pressler and I have worked with a broad constituency \ninterested in the legislation. Together, we worked out a consensus \namendment to the bill that was unanimously approved by the Commerce \nCommittee in June.\n  S. 1505, as passed by the House and Senate, applies a simple, \nflexible, commonsense risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to new \npipeline safety standards. It moves pipeline safety away from \nprescriptive, command-and-control approaches and focuses future \nstandards on actions that address assessed safety risks. I am proud of \nthe bill this Congress sent to the President for signature into law. I \nthank Chairman Pressler for all his good efforts in getting this \nimportant job done.\n\n[[Page S11961]]\n\n  Mr. President, under Senator Pressler's leadership the Commerce \nCommittee also produced, and the Congress has now passed and sent to \nthe President, reauthorization legislation for the National \nTransportation Safety Board and the Federal Trade Commission. The NTSB \nis one of our Government's most important agencies. Its mission is to \ndetermine the probable cause of transportation accidents and to promote \ntransportation safety. The NTSB is world renown for its timely and \nexpert determinations of accident causation and for issuing realistic \nand feasible safety recommendations. The FTC is charged with the dual \nmission of consumer protection and antitrust enforcement. Both agencies \nare critically important to the safety and well being of American \nconsumers. Both will continue their important work thanks to Chairman \nPressler's efforts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to make brief mention of two other \nbills. Chairman Pressler has worked over the last 2 years to achieve a \nconsensus on a National Space Policy Act and authorization legislation \nfor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, both of which \nwere also introduced by Senator Pressler. The Space Policy Act embodies \nauthorizations for NASA programs such as Mission to Planet Earth and \nthe space station and enjoys broad bipartisan support in both Houses of \nCongress. The NOAA authorization legislation is another bill vital to \nthe public safety. Among other things, NOAA is charged with forecasting \nand warning against impending destructive natural events such as \nhurricanes, thunderstorms, and tornados.\n  Mr. President, I commend Commerce Committee chairman, Senator Larry \nPressler. He is a shining example of how to get things done in the \nSenate. Just look at the record. Chairman Pressler has left his \ndistinguished mark on some of the most important pieces of legislation \nthis Congress produced.\n  I conclude by also congratulating the members, members on both sides \nof the aisle, of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation for an exceptional legislative record in this Congress. \nWithout a doubt this was one of the most active and productive of all \nSenate committees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11959-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TIRBUTE TO SENATOR MARK O. HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, when the full Appropriations Committee \nmarked up H.R. 3755, the fiscal year 1997 Labor/HHS appropriations \nbill, I was pleased that the committee accepted an amendment to name \nthe new NIH clinical research center, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical \nResearch Center. This center will be of major importance to our \nNation's health and will be named for a man who has dedicated his \nentire public life to enhancing the quality of all human life. There is \nno greater tribute to his innumerable contributions in this area than \nto designate, in his name, a living legacy within whose walls will be \nstate-of-the-art facilities for a combined effort of basic and clinical \nresearch--laboratories and clinics side-by-side--to discover \ninterventions and deliver the most effective health care our Nation or \nany nation has ever known.\n  In his 30 years of Senate service, Senator Hatfield brought to this \ninstitution, his great intellect, a quiet decency, and a tenacious \nadvocacy for those who have little voice. He is a true and eloquent \nspokesman for the protection of our people from the forces of ignorance \nand illiteracy, social injustice, weapons of mass destruction, and \ndiseases that ravage the mind and body. Throughout his career, he \nconsistently fought to direct our Nation's precious fiscal resources to \nprograms that held promise in eradicating society's ills and improving \nthe human condition. At times, he was a lone voice facing a hostile \nreception by administrations with different priorities but his \ndedication did not waiver.\n  Our chairman adheres to no political or ideological boundary but the \nvoice of his own conscience, often placing himself in direct opposition \nthe prevailing winds of the day. Whether fighting major rescissions in \nsocial discretionary programs in the early 1980's or in protecting \nbiomedical research funding as recently as in last year's budget \nresolution, he never lost sight of the importance of maintaining strong \nnational programs for both basic and clinical health research as well \nas the training of tomorrow's scientists.\n  Our colleague always believed that we would be acting irresponsibly \nby shortchanging these and other life sustaining efforts, therefore, \nany immediate savings achieved would be offset by a weakened human \ncondition for decades to come. ``If we fail to provide adequately for \nthe training of future generations of research scientists'', I have \noften heard him say, ``then we are effectively eating our seed corn.'' \nIn failing to provide necessary annual increases in funds for research \ngrants, he insists, we will ``lose the momentum'' in our capacity to \neradicate human suffering at home and world-wide.\n  WHen it is completed, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center \nwill be a magnificent structure and a world model. With this amendment, \nwe honor a man who, in his retirement from the Senate, should leave \nsecure in the knowledge that his life's work has made a difference. By \ncreating the opportunity for new discoveries in disease prevention and \ntreatment a more healthy future has been insured for all Americans \ntoday and for generations to come.\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SENATOR COHEN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \ncontributions of retiring Senator William Cohen of Maine, as he \nprepares to take leave of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, the Christian Science Monitor once referred to Senator \nCohen as a ``true Renaissance man.'' That is an apt compliment, because \nit describes a person of broad interests who applies his intellect and \nenergy with distinction in many theaters of human activity.\n  Senator Cohen certainly embodies that description.\n  In my 3 years here, I have come to appreciate Senator Cohen's \nintelligence, independence of thought and action, his integrity, his \ncapacity for hard work and his respect for the Senate and for the \nprocess of making public policy.\n  He has also found time to write a pretty good book or two.\n  Senator Cohen and I have both served on the Senate Special Committee \non Aging, and there I have been able to watch, first-hand, his skill \nand dedication in dealing with issues of particular importance to \nsenior citizens and of relevance to us all. He has, in particular, been \na leader in the battle against waste, fraud and abuse in our Medicaid \nsystem.\n  He has also, upon assuming the chair, continued the tradition of \nbipartisan cooperation on that committee.\n  I have also appreciated Senator Cohen's insistence on the highest \nethical standards for lawmakers. He wrote the law that renewed the \nOffice of Government Ethics and, in fact, made it stronger. He has been \na reliable ally in the fight for congressional reform. He played an \nimportant role in lobbying reform and was an important supporter of the \nefforts to restrict gift giving.\n  Mr. President, several months ago, Senator Cohen delivered a moving \ntribute to another Maine lawmaker, Senator Edmund Muskie, after Senator \nMuskie's passing.\n  Senator Cohen quoted John Kennedy on how to take the measure of \npeople: ``First, were we truly people of courage? Second, were we truly \npeople of judgment? Third, were we truly people of integrity? Fourth, \nwere we truly people of dedication?\"\n  Senator Cohen said at the time that the answer to each of those \nquestions in Ed Muskie's case was ``yes.'' The same can be said for \nSenator Cohen.\n  Mr. President, the residents of Maine know, I am sure, they have been \nwell-served by Senator Cohen. Let me say, for the record, so have the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11961-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11961-S11962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REFORM LEGISLATION IN THE 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress winds to a close, I \nwanted take this opportunity to comment on the demise of the Food and \nDrug Administration Reform legislation.\n  It has been extremely disappointing to me that efforts to prod the \nFDA into meaningful reform have not been fruitful. It is doubly \ndisappointing because,\n\n[[Page S11962]]\n\nour colleague, Senator Kassebaum, and her staff have spent countless \nhours crafting a solid reform bill, a bill that won overwhelming, \nbipartisan support from the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  In remarks before this body earlier this year, I outlined my views on \nthe need for FDA reform and the principles which should be embodied in \nany reform legislation. I continue to believe that reform of this tiny, \nbut important, agency is sorely needed, reform that will both \nstreamline its operations and preserve its commitment to ensuring the \npublic health.\n  I know that many who have worked on the FDA issues are discouraged, \nbut we can be proud of three significant reforms to food and drug law \nthis year: The first being the drug and device export amendments I \nauthored with Representative Fred Upton; the Delaney clause reform \nembodied in the pesticide legislation the President recently signed; \nand the animal drug amendments so long championed by Senator Kassebaum. \nIt seems, therefore, that the revolutionary course we charted for FDA \nreform at the beginning of the 104th Congress, evolved into a path \nevoluntary in nature, but still productive nonetheless.\n  Much more remains to be done, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues next year to advance the work we started this year. There \nare many priorities for further action, among them--speeding up generic \ndrug approvals, clarifying how tissue should be regulated, expediting \nmedical device approvals, deficiencies in the foreign inspection \nprogram, and rigorous oversight of the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act's implementation.\n  Another issue that I would like to see addressed next year is one \nthat has been periodically on the FDA radar screen: The issue of \nnational uniformity in regulation of products that fall within the \nFDA's purview.\n  In 1987, FDA Commissioner Frank Young, in response to California's \nproposition 65, was on the verge of issuing an FDA regulation that \nwould have acted to preempt certain warning statements required by the \nState of California. In fact, in August of that year, Commissioner \nYoung wrote the Governor of California to underscore his concerns about \nthe potential negative effect of proposition 65 on ``the interstate \nmarketing of foods, drugs, cosmetics and other products regulated by \nthe FDA.''\n  Further, Commissioner Young pointed out that ``the Agency has \nadequate procedures for determining their safety and taking necessary \naction if problems arise.''\n  Although ultimately this regulation was not issued, the 1991 Advisory \nCommittee on the Food and Drug Administration, chaired by former FDA \nCommissioner and Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Charles Edward, \nexamined this issue. The panel recommended that Congress enact \nlegislation, ``that preempts additional and conflicting state \nrequirements for all products subject to FDA regulation.''\n  The issue of Federal preemption is extremely important for several \nindustries, especially over-the-counter drugs, cosmetics, and foods. I \nwas heartened when the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved \nSenator Gregg's amendment on national uniformity for over-the-counter \ndrugs during consideration of the FDA reform legislation, S. 1477, but \nwas disappointed that Senator Gregg did not extend the concept further \nin his amendment.\n  Let us take the cosmetics industry as a case in point.\n  In the United States, the cosmetics sector of the economy represents \nan estimated $21 billion in annual sales, a significant amount by \nalmost any measure. It consists of over 10 billion individual packages \nthat move through the stream of interstate commerce annually. These \ninclude soap, shampoo, mouthwash, and other products that Americans use \ndaily. These hundreds and hundreds of product lines, and thousands and \nthousands of products are each subject to differing regulation in the \nvarious State--even though all must meet the rigorous safety, purity, \nand labeling requirements of Federal law.\n  Given this volume of economic activity, it is imperative that \nmanufacturers be able to react quickly to trends in the marketplace; \nthey must have the ability to move in to new product lines and move \ninto and out of new geographic areas with a minimum--but adequate--\nlevel of regulation to ensure the products are not adulterated and are \nmade according to good manufacturing practices.\n  Today, cosmetics manufacturers are competing more and more in a \nglobal economy, and are making products consistent with the \ninternational harmonization of standards in such large marketing areas \nas the European Union. A single nationwide system for regulating the \nsafety and labeling of cosmetic products would take a great step toward \nhelping that industry move toward the international trends in \nmarketing. At the same time, it would be a more efficient system, since \nallowing individual States to impose varying labeling requirements \ninevitably leads to higher prices.\n  In other words, the time has more than come for enactment of a \nnational uniformity law for cosmetic regulation. It is my hope that \nthis issue will be high on our congressional agenda next year.\n  In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to offer my great respects to \nChairman Kassebaum for the hours, weeks, and months of time she has \ndevoted to the FDA reform issue. Although I have paid tribute to \nSenator Kassebaum in separate remarks here today, I must reiterate \nagain how much her reputation for equilibrium and fairness have lent to \ndevelopment of an FDA reform proposal which cleared the committee in \nsuch a bipartisan fashion.\n  Finally, I must also pay tribute to the lead staffer on FDA issues, \nJane Williams, who has worked virtually round-the-clock to try to \nfashion a good, fair, bipartisan reform bill. Jane more than exceeded \nthat goal, and I think this body should give her some much-deserved \nrecognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11961-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11962-S11963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO BENNETT JOHNSTON--LOUISIANA'S SENIOR SENATOR\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to bid fond farewell and \nGodspeed to one of my good friends and colleagues, Bennett Johnston, \nthe senior senator from Louisiana. Senator Johnston soon will retire \nfrom the Senate, leaving behind a record of major legislative \nachievements. His dedication and perseverance will be missed by all of \nus who remain, as well as his constituents in Louisiana. Bennett \nJohnston's career of public service began with his enlistment in the \nArmy in 1956. He served in the Louisiana State Legislature--4 years \neach in the House and Senate--before he was elected to the U.S. Senate \nin 1972.\n  Mr. President, during his four terms in the Senate, Bennett Johnston \nalways championed his state's interests. He fought diligently for \nFederal funding that transformed a pothole-filled road through \nLouisiana into frequently traveled Interstate 49. This vital \ntransportation artery will be a fitting reminder to all Louisianians of \nBennett Johnston's commitment to them. He also led the way for a new \nRed River navigation system, ports and levees, research facilities, \nwildlife refuges and parks.\n  His roles as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources made Senator Johnston a national figure. \nPerhaps his most significant legislative achievement was the National \nEnergy Security Act--a comprehensive bill that established him as a \nmaster of energy policy. This bill was passed in the wake of the \nPersian Gulf War, and it has reduced our country's dependence on \nforeign oil. According to Marribell S. Ayres, executive director of the \nNational Independent Energy Producers, the way Bennett Johnston handled \nthe bill reminded her of the old saying, ``talent is when opportunity \nmeets preparation.'' The bill was a masterful achievement in \nlegislating and he always will be remembered for that accomplishment.\n  I will miss Bennett Johnston's thoughtfulness and fairness on issues \nrelating to our national resources, such as mining and timber issues. \nHe has been a fair advocate for the concept of multiple use of Federal \nlands. He knows that multiple use is responsible use.\n\n[[Page S11963]]\n\n  Mr. President, Bennett Johnston put it best when he announced in \nJanuary 1995 that he would not run for re-election: There are rhythms \nand tides and seasons in life. I have been fortunate in my life to \nsense the rhythm and sail it full tide, and now I believe that season \nfor a new beginning approaches. With that thought in mind, I wish my \nfriend from Louisiana and his wonderful wife, Mary, the best of luck as \nthey set sail from the Senate on what surely will be yet another \nrewarding journey in an already exciting, fulfilling lifetime voyage of \npublic service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11962-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am honored to salute one of Oregon's \nand our nation's finest legislators and statesmen, my colleague Senator \nMark Hatfield, who will soon retire from the U.S. Senate. Mark Hatfield \nis one of the Senate's all-time great leaders. His career has been \nmarked by a voting record based upon consistency and a deep commitment \nto high principles. The Senator from Oregon will leave behind a very \ndistinguished history of public service to his State and country.\n  As a young serviceman in the Navy, Mark Hatfield was one of the first \nAmericans to see Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped. When he \nreturned home, he became a political science professor and university \ndean at his alma mater, Willamette University. In 1951, Mark Hatfield \nwas elected to the Oregon House of Representatives where he quickly \nmoved up through the ranks and then was appointed Oregon's secretary of \nstate. Soon after, he was elected Governor of Oregon for two terms. \nThroughout his career of more than four decades in state and national \npolitics, Mark Hatfield never lost an election. In 1966, he was elected \nto the U.S. Senate.\n  During two periods as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Hatfield exemplified the perseverance and diligence \nof an experienced legislator. In his role as chairman, he succeeded in \nthe challenging task of matching the more local needs of his colleagues \nwith the national need to reduce our budget deficits. In the past 2 \nyears, he has kept his committee on track to achieve a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. For that alone, all Americans should be grateful.\n  My friend from Oregon has been one of our most articulate champions \nfor arms control and nuclear nonproliferation. These are special issues \nfor me as well. He has stood by me as I've worked to reduce the spread \nof nuclear weapons in South Asia. He deserves to feel great pride in \nhis untiring efforts to achieve a moratorium on nuclear testing.\n  Mark Hatfield also will be remembered as a strong voice for economic \ngrowth and development. He has pushed to allow more roads and \nresponsible logging practices in Federal forests. He has fought to \nprotect Columbia River salmon and has demonstrated much concern for the \ninterests of Oregon's Indian tribes.\n  Senator Hatfield's determination to stand by his principles, even in \nthe face of severe partisan pressure, has been admired by all his \ncolleagues. Mark Hatfield has always been a consensus builder on bills \nthat have become bogged down in partisan politics. For example, he \nvoiced his strong concerns about the safe drinking water legislation \nand the need to establish reasonable standards for contaminants. In \nthis effort he kept in mind the many concerned States and cities that \nfear the onerous financial burdens the Federal bureaucracy too often \nimpose. I applaud my colleague for his many valiant bipartisan efforts.\n  The Senate soon will bid farewell to our friend from Oregon, Mark \nHatfield. His colleagues and constituents can look back on his career \nwith great respect and gratitude. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress \ndraws to a close, I wish Senator Hatfield all the best in his future \nendeavors. My wife, Harriet, and I wish Senator Hatfield and his lovely \nwife Antoinette continued happiness, joy, and more quality time with \ntheir grandchildren. I am proud to have served in the Senate with Mark \nHatfield. I am even more proud to call Mark and Antoinette Hatfield my \ngood friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11963-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO BILL COHEN--A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my dear friend \nand colleague, Senator William Cohen of Maine. Upon his retirement from \nthis body, Senator Cohen will leave behind a legacy of camaraderie, \nhard work, and dedication to the people of Maine and the United States. \nHis spirit of cooperation will be missed by his friends, constituents \nand colleagues.\n  Mr. President, it is fitting that Senator Cohen announced his \nretirement in the chambers of the Bangor City Council--the place where \nhe began his three decades of public service to the people of Maine. In \n1969, he proved to be a gifted leader during his tenure as Bangor City \nCouncilor. In 1971, he was elected mayor. In his role as a local public \nofficial, Senator Cohen realized quickly the necessity for strong \nleadership and representation at the national level. In response, he \nwalked over 600 miles across the State of Maine and knocked on \nthousands of doors in his campaign for the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In 1972, his grassroots effort paid off and he was \nelected to Congress.\n  It was in the House that my colleague first made his mark as an \nadvocate of a stalwart national defense, effective intelligence system, \nand the highest ethical standards for Members of Congress and \nintelligence agency employees. As a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, he consistently has sought to keep our national security a \ntop priority. He fought to ensure that America's defense readiness did \nnot fall by the wayside in the face of budgetary constraints. He has \nbeen a true guardian of our Nation's security. His efforts have earned \nthe gratitude and respect of all Members of this body and the people of \nMaine and our Nation.\n  A legislator, author, father, husband, and attorney, Bill Cohen often \nis referred to as a ``Renaissance Man.'' Over the years, he has shared \nhis literary talents through books such as ``Of Sons and Seasons,'' \n``Murder in the Senate,'' and ``A Baker's Nickel.'' His poetry first \nimpressed us 20 years ago during a congressional prayer breakfast when \nhe read several of his poems aloud. He acquired many of his literary \nfans then and has kept us entertained and inspired ever since. Since \nthen, his literary gift has provided us a fascinating glimpse into his \nthoughtful and insightful mind. He is a multi-talented leader whose \nknowledge and genius are certain to guide him through a fulfilling \npost-Senatorial career.\n  My friend from Maine has said that writing takes solitude--a rare \ncommodity in the busy life he now leads. As he moves on from this \nhurried lifestyle, I wish him years of solitude, peace, and happiness \nwith his children and wife Janet. Godspeed to my dear friend from \nMaine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11963-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11963-S11964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO JIM EXON: A DEDICATED MIDWESTERN SENATOR\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a friend and \nfellow midwestern Senator--Jim Exon. Senator Exon and I entered the \nSenate together in 1978. I have enjoyed working with him on issues \nimportant to our states: South Dakota and Nebraska. We are not just \nfellow Senators, but fellow South Dakotans. He was born in Geddes, \nSouth Dakota, and once a South Dakotan, always a South Dakotan. When he \nretires at the end of the 104th Congress, I will miss him personally, \nas well as his dedication to rural America.\n  I have a great deal of respect for Senator Exon. He has served his \nfellow Nebraskans well. As ranking member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, he has been a driving force to get a balanced budget \namendment passed in Congress. He understands well the importance of \nbalancing the Federal budget. He knows that Federal spending must be \nreined in and that we owe it to our children to control our \nGovernment's ``out-of-control'' spending habits. He has a vision for \nour economic future--a vision that embraces the interests of rural \nAmerica.\n  Senator Exon and I have served together for many years on the Senate \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. He has worked hard on \nthe Commerce Committee, as he has\n\n[[Page S11964]]\n\non the Armed Services and Budget Committees. As our Nation evolves into \nthe information age, Jim Exon has worked diligently to ensure that the \ninformation superhighway maintains high decency standards and that \ntelecommunications reform includes the interests of rural states. \nAdditionally, Jim Exon has worked to keep our transportation network \nsafe. Whether the issue is high speed rail safety or the transportation \nof hazardous materials, Jim Exon has been committed to improving our \ncurrent transportation infrastructure.\n  Jim Exon's expertise on commerce and budget issues will not be easily \nreplaced in Congress following his retirement. His care and concern for \nthe people of Nebraska and the midwest will be missed. I will not \nforget Jim's dedication and commitment to his State and nation. As a \nWorld War II veteran, he has brought a level of patriotism, pride, and \ntenacity to this congressional body that cannot be matched. As I bid my \nfriend farewell, I am saddened by his departure, but am happy for him \nas he embarks on a new facet of his life. I wish Jim and his wife, \nPatricia Ann, all the best in their post-Senate days. Their presence in \nWashington will be missed, but never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11963-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we hope this will be the last day of the \n104th Congress, and I would be remiss if I did not take this \nopportunity to remark about several of my colleagues--friends from both \nsides of the aisle--for whom today will be their last day as a member \nof this distinguished institution.\n  Let me first acknowledge my colleague from Alabama, Senator Howell \nHeflin. He came to the Senate the same year I came to the House of \nRepresentatives: 1979. He had a distinguished record as a lawyer and \nthen as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. As Chief Justice, \nSenator Heflin led the modernization of the judicial system in Alabama.\n  Throughout his three terms as a member of the Senate, he has served \nwith distinction and honor. His integrity and dedication made him an \nexemplary Chairman of the Ethics Committee. We also should not forget \nhis service on both the Judiciary and Agricultural Committees. He was \nvery active, as he has been throughout his career, on both of these \ncommittees, where he showed his concern for the welfare of the country. \nSenator Heflin's retirement is indeed a great loss to this body.\n  There are a number of other colleagues, in addition to Senator \nHeflin, whom we will miss.\n  Senator Simpson of Wyoming, who served this side of the aisle as our \nassistant minority leader, is a man of untold ability, wit and \nintelligence.\n  Senator Simon of Illinois is a man of unquestioned integrity.\n  Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, who was on the floor just a few \nmoments ago, is ending his third term as a Member of the U.S. Senate \nwhere he, too, has distinguished himself. A former Congressman and \nGovernor of Arkansas, he concludes a laudable political career.\n  One of our most senior Senators, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the \nlongtime chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is recognized as \na leader in the area of international relations. He also has made his \nmark in the field of education. All of us are familiar with the Pell \ngrant and other programs that he has inspired.\n  We will certainly miss Senator Nunn who brought a very reasoned \nposition to all issues relating to foreign relations and national \nsecurity. This goes without saying, but I thought he was an outstanding \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I feel fortunate to have had \nthe privilege to serve with him on that committee for 8 years.\n  Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican from Kansas who \ncurrently chairs the Labor and Human Resources Committee, is a \ndistinguished Senator in her own right. Just look at her recent \nleadership to bring about long overdue reforms in the field of health \ninsurance.\n  Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana is the former chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee. We are certainly going to miss \nhim. He has had a distinguished career here during his 24 years in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the current chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee on which I now serve, has served with his \ncharacteristic civility and integrity. In recent days, he has worked \nthrough the night in the negotiations with the White House on the \nomnibus appropriations bill that we are getting ready to consider in a \nfew hours.\n  Senator Jim Exon of Nebraska, a former Governor of Nebraska, is a \nthree-term Senator from that state. I had the privilege of serving with \nhim on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Senator William S. Cohen, a Republican from Maine, a former \noutstanding Member of the U.S. House of Representatives before he was \nelected to the Senate. We will miss not only his wit, his intelligence, \nand his thoughtfulness, but also his writing ability, which at one time \nor another helped us all.\n  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Hank Brown, a Republican \nfrom Colorado as it was to serve together in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. What has saddened me, and a number of my colleagues, \nis he will leave this body with such a bright and promising career \nafter only 6 years.\n  Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has served 18 years in the Senate. \nHe has spent days and nights, weeks and months up here, and I think, \nnot in vain, in dealing with a common sense income tax program for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, we will miss all these people because individually and \ncollectively they have enriched this body. I wish them well in their \nfuture endeavors. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11964-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11964-S11965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. For the past 17 years, the people of Kansas and of \nthe United States have had the great honor of being represented by \nSenator Nancy Landon Kassebaum. For the past 4 years, I have had the \nprivilege of serving with her.\n  I am here today because of I admire what she has accomplished in the \nSenate, what she has modeled for women and because I am pleased to be \nable to call her my friend.\n  I have disagreed with Senator Kassebaum on some legislative issues, \nbut on many occasions there were common ground and agreement. \nNonetheless, I always knew that she considered issues fully and made \nindependent judgements on the merit of a specific piece of legislation. \nI know that she always considered the competing interests and judged \nthem against her own beliefs.\n  Senator Kassebaum has championed causes that I hold dear, including \nreproductive choice, responsible gun control, and the 1994 crime bill \nthat, among other things, sent police back to the neighborhoods to walk \nthe beat. But even when I don't agree with her, I respect her \nintellect, her integrity, and her votes, for they are always votes of \nconscience.\n  Her leadership of the Labor, Education, and Human Resources Committee \nexemplifies her desire and ability to work across party lines on issues \nsuch as health insurance portability which is vital to working families \nand to the Nation.\n  She is the first woman in the Senate ever to chair a full committee. \nIn this, as in all her accomplishments, Senator Kassebaum is a role \nmodel for women. She showed women active in community issues or serving \nin local and State governments, that they could aspire to more.\n  She served from 1978 to 1980 as the only female member of this \nillustrious body. I remember when I got here, elected with three other \nfemale freshman, and they handed me a spouse's I. D. badge. I know that \nmistakes like this must have been plentiful when Senator Kassebaum \narrived. From all the women Senators, I thank her for making things \neasier for us, in the little and the big ways.\n  I'd like to note that it is not just her colleagues who hold Senator \nKassebaum in such high esteem. There is a quote in an A.P. story from a \nUniversity of Kansas political science professor that I'd like to share \nbecause it illustrates the enormous respect and affection felt by \nKansans for the Senator. ``[Senator] Kassebaum sometimes deferred to \n[Senator] Dole as a leader. But [Senator] Dole knew, every day he went \nto work, that he was the second-most popular politician in Kansas.''\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\n Another newspaper quotes a Democratic official as saying that in \nKansas, ``the only thing more popular than Nancy is wheat.'' Now that's \nsaying something.\n  The last thing that I would like to say today on the floor is that I \nwill miss Senator Kassebaum. I will miss talking with her on the floor. \nI will miss her contributions to legislative debate. And I will miss \nher great and moderate influence on this body as a whole.\n  We need more Senators like Nancy Kassebaum in the Senate. I think the \nSenate, the people of Kansas, and Americans all across this country are \nlucky to have had her service in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11964-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JIM EXON\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \ndistinguished service of my friend and colleague, Senator Jim Exon of \nNebraska.\n  When I think of America's heartland--the great plains, the small \ntowns, farmers in the field, hard work, helping your neighbor--I think \nof Senator Exon. No other Senator better embodies the image, the \nvalues, and the beliefs of rural America. He fights for fiscal \nresponsibility. He fights for the family farm. He fights for a strong \nnational defense. After 26 years of public service to Nebraska, and a \nstunning record of five winning statewide elections in a row, his \ndeparture from public service leaves in its wake a record of \naccomplishment that will be difficult to match.\n  During his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Senator Exon has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of issues important to Nebraskans. He has \nstrengthened the farm economy by fighting to promote ethanol fuels and \nexpanding foreign markets for farm commodities. He has fought to \nimprove rural health care by fixing unfair Medicare rules. He preserved \nFederal funding for the reformed crop insurance program. And he has \nimproved transportation access for rural communities with his \nauthorship of the current Essential Air Service law and by fighting to \nstrengthen and preserve Amtrak.\n  Senator Exon has also left his mark on issues important to our \nNation. He coauthored legislation passed in 1992 requiring the \nmoratorium on nuclear testing and an end to all testing by 1996. He has \nused his position as a senior Member of the Senate Budget Committee to \nhelp reign in Federal spending and reduce the Federal deficit. He has \ngreatly increased safety in the inspection of trucking and railroad \nindustries.\n  These accomplishments are his legacy. The retirement announcement of \nSenator Exon, widely recognized as the chief architect in the creating \na strong Democratic party in Nebraska, will leave a void in Nebraskan \nleadership that will likely be felt for years. I know Nebraskans are \nproud of his achivements. I wish Senator Exon the very best in his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11965-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE RETIREMENT OF U.S. SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nabout a great U.S. Senator, Howell Heflin, or Judge Heflin as he is \nknown to all of us who have had the privilege to work with him.\n  For over 24 years, Howell Heflin has fought for the interests of \nAlabama and America. He began his career in public service when he \nfought in the Pacific during World War II. There he was wounded twice \nand earned the Silver Star. After graduating from the University of \nAlabama Law School he began to practice law in Alabama. He went on to \nserve as President of the Alabama State Bar Association from 1965 to \n1966.\n  In 1971 Howell Heflin became Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme \nCourt. He is credited with reforming Alabama's antiquated court system. \nHis court reform package has earned him national recognition. His other \naccomplishments include serving as chairman of the National Conference \nof Chief Justices, vice president of the American Judicature Society, \nand being selected the American Association of Trial Lawyers ``Most \nOutstanding Appellate Judge in the United States'' in 1975.\n  I came to know Judge Heflin during his tenure in the Senate. He has \nprovided constant leadership and has always had the time to listen. He \nhas always had the time to take a junior Member under his wing and talk \nwith them about issues, no matter how arcane.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I was assigned to the Judiciary \nCommittee and was able to take advantage of Judge Heflin's incredible \nexpertise as a member of that committee. It has been a pleasure working \nwith him.\n  A man of integrity, Howell Heflin represents the new South. He has \ngiven rise to the kind of moral force that has lifted this body and \nindeed, this entire country. His integrity, his intelligence, his \ncommitment to the Constitution, and his faith in what the American \ndream has always stood for and can be in the future, has led Judge \nHeflin in a direction of greatness that is without peer and without \nparallel in this body.\n  Howell Heflin is a man of courage. He stood on this floor about 2 \nyears ago during the debate on the United Daughters of the Confederacy \npatent extension and made one of the most eloquent speeches I have ever \nheard. He made it from the heart and he made it with courage. It was \nthat courage that the people of Alabama recognized when they elected \nhim to serve in this body.\n  The Senate will not be the same place when Howell Heflin leaves. He \nhas been a force for the good. He has been a force for the light. He \nhas made a tremendous contribution. I will personally miss Judge Heflin \nand the people of his state will miss one of the best advocates for \nAlabama the Senate has ever seen. I wish Judge Heflin and his wife Mike \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11965-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the \nopportunity today to reflect on the career of a Senator who I have had \nthe honor of serving with during the last 4 years, Colorado's Senior \nSenator, Hank Brown.\n  Senator Brown has served the people and interests of the State of \nColorado with distinction and independence, first as a State Senator \nbetween 1972 and 1976, then as a United States Congressman from \nColorado's 4th district for 10 years and finally as a U.S. Senator \nsince 1990. Prior to his distinguished career in public service, \nSenator Brown applied the same affability, hard work, and talent as a \nvice-president at a Colorado meat-packing firm. In addition to his \ncontributions as a statesman and a businessman, Senator Brown also \ncontributed to the State of Colorado and to the Nation as a Navy \nForward Air Controller in Vietnam, where he earned numerous \ndecorations, including the Air Medal with two Gold Stars.\n  Senator Brown will leave behind a clear record as a foe of the budget \ndeficit. In October of 1990, he opposed the budget-summit agreement, \ngoing against his party and with his conscience. Senator Brown also \nsupported the 1995 Balanced Budget Amendment.\n  This body will certainly miss the voice of Senator Hank Brown. Upon \nhearing of Senator Brown's retirement, the Daily Camera wrote on \nDecember 22, 1994 that ``we admire the consistency of Hank Brown's \nconvictions.''. I share the Daily Camera's opinion and I wish Senator \nHank Brown the best of luck and God speed as he begins a new life \noutside of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11965-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11965-S11966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF SENATOR J. BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to say farewell to a \ncolleague who is retiring from the Senate the end of this Congress--\nSenator J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. Senator Johnston has been a \ngood friend to Illinois, and his decision to retire will be a loss to \nLouisiana, a loss to this Chamber, and a loss to the Unites States.\n  Senator Johnston was born in Shreveport, LA in 1932, attended Byrd \nHigh School and studied at the U.S. Military Academy and Washington and \nLee University. He began his political career 32 years ago, serving \neight years in the Louisiana Legislature and 24 years in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Since his arrival to the Senate, Senator Johnston has fought hard on \nbehalf of the people of Louisiana. He has\n\n[[Page S11966]]\n\nused his seniority on the Senate Agriculture Committee to fight for the \npriorities of Louisiana farmers. He has worked to enhance navigation, \nflood control and hurricane protection in Louisiana, a State with many \ncritical waterways. And he has fought to bring Federal dollars back to \nhis home State, such as creating five national research centers at \nLouisiana universities and working to modernize Louisiana's military \ninstallations.\n  Today, Senator Johnston is known nationally as a leader on energy \nissues. As a member and former chairman of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, Senator Johnston has been one of the \nchief congressional architects in crafting national energy policy, \nincluding what is considered his crowning achievement, the National \nEnergy Security Act, the most comprehensive energy bill ever to pass \nCongress.\n  I appreciate the assistance that Senator Johnston has provided to the \nState of Illinois over the years. Illinois is home to two major \nDepartment of Energy laboratories, Fermi National Accelerator \nLaboratory and the Argonne National Laboratory. Senator Johnston's \nsupport has been critical to ensuring that Federal funding for these \ninstitutions, and the programs under their jurisdiction, is preserved \nas much as possible during these times of tight budgets. During the \ndebate on the Integral Fast Reactor, a major Illinois research program \non next-generation nuclear technology, it again was Senator Johnston \nwhose assistance and support were crucial to our victory. And it was \nhis support that ensured that the jobs, research and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars invested in IFR research were not wasted once the \nIFR program was eventually phased out.\n  There are other Illinois programs and priorities that would not have \nbeen possible without the assistance of Senator Johnston, including \npreserving Federal funding for such critical Illinois projects as the \nreconstruction of the Chicago shoreline, the ongoing development the \nDeep Tunnel Flood Control System, and the Upper Mississippi River \nFeasibility Study.\n  I have always admired the distinguished Senator's skilled advocacy in \ndefending his State's interests. During the Senate debate on ethanol, I \nfound him a formidable opponent, as was demonstrated by the fact that \nit took a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President to reach a final \ndecision on that issue. That tight margin exemplifies the kind of \nexcellence and thoroughness Senator Johnston brings to his legislative \nefforts.\n  This institution will lose a great asset with the retirement of the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. I wish him, and his family, the \nvery best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11965-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the news today is filled with the \nsad stories of foreign lands--war in Bosnia, tyranny in Iraq, terrorism \nin the Middle East. Here, in 1996, on the edge of the 21st century, we \nlive in a world still plagued with fear and war.\n  These are not, however, the stories of America. America instead is \nthe place where foreign lands turn for hope. When war-torn nations \nplead for assistance, America answers. When war-like nations terrorize, \nAmerica responds. And when war-weary nations seek peace, America \nmediates.\n  In its 220th year, America stands strong in national security, \nmilitary might, and world leadership. This is in large part due to one \nof the chief architects of American strength, Senator Sam Nunn of \nGeorgia.\n  As a longtime member and former Chairman of the Senate Armed Service \nCommittee, Sam Nunn is internationally recognized as the preeminent \nAmerican legislator in all aspects of defense policy. His expertise is \nexpansive, from major weapons programs, to manpower, and from defense \nresearch, to military benefits. He has faced national crises such as \nUnited States citizens held as hostages in Iran, humanitarian relief in \nSomalia, and war in Kuwait. From disarmament talks, to the demise of \nthe communist eastern bloc, and to the reduced threat of nuclear war, \nSam Nunn has helped craft the defense policies that kept America secure \nduring the Soviet years, and left America the sole superpower in the \npost-cold war era.\n  In these times of tight budgets, Senator Nunn has also kept a \nwatchful eye on the Pentagon, working to strike the right balance \nbetween defense spending and maintaining defense readiness. He has \nworked to increase fiscal responsibility in defense programs, \nstreamline bureaucracy, and stop wasteful and excessive spending--\nputting an end to such controversies as the infamous hundred-dollar \nhammers.\n  Defense issues are not simple issues; they are divisive, and often, \nheated. Some decisions are not popular. I have always respected Senator \nNunn for making these tough choices. Sam Nunn today is considered a \nmodel of American statesmanship and leadership. And that is because his \nrecord demonstrates the kind of excellence and thoroughness he brings \nto his legislative efforts.\n  After announcing his retirement, one Georgia public official \ndescribed Senator Nunn's career as ``a career that has a beginning and \nan end, no compromises, no ethical lapses. . .a monument to public \nservice to young people for generations to come.'' I agree. His \ndeparture from the United States Senate leaves a great void of \nexpertise--but in its place, leaves security for our citizens, and \nleadership for the world. As the longtime watch of Senator Nunn draws \nto a close, America remains strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11966-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11966-S11967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR BILL COHEN\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to say farewell to a \ncolleague who is retiring from the Senate at the end of this Congress--\nSenator Bill Cohen of Maine. Senator Cohen's decision to retire will be \na loss to Maine, a loss to this body, and a loss to the United States.\n  Bill Cohen began his career in public service over a quarter of a \ncentury ago, when he served a term on the Bangor City Council, and \nlater as the Mayor of Bangor. In 1972 he was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives where he represented Maine for three terms. He was \nfirst elected to the United States Senate in 1978, and easily won two \nsubsequent elections to that office.\n  Known for his independence and integrity, he first gained national \nprominence during his tenure on the House Judiciary Committee during \nthe Watergate investigation. He was the first Republican to oppose \nPresident Nixon's attempt to provide edited rather than full \ntranscripts of White House conversations to the committee. He later \nplayed an instrumental role in the Iran-Contra hearings.\n  In 1975 Bill Cohen began serving on the House Aging Committee, and \nlater served as the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, \nwhere I have had the pleasure of working with him. During his tenure on \nboth the House and Senate committees he has tirelessly fought for \nissues affecting the elderly. During his tenure in the House he was the \nauthor of the Nursing Home Patients Bill of Rights. In 1995 he led the \nfight in the Senate for more stringent health and safety standards in \nnursing homes. And he also led a Senate investigation into questionable \npractices in the hearing aid industry. Due to these efforts, advocates \nof issues affecting the elderly have dubbed Senator Cohen ``one of the \nmost valuable and able and dedicated members'' working on seniors \nissues.\n  Bill Cohen has also dedicated himself to making government work \nbetter. He wrote the Competition in Contracting Act which has saved the \ngovernment billions of dollars through the use of competitive bidding \nfor the vast majority of goods and services. He drafted comprehensive \nhealth care fraud reform legislation which passed the Senate in 1995 \nand which the Congressional Budget Office estimated would save billions \nof dollars. And he sponsored the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, \nwhich provided greater protection for Federal workers who ``blow the \nwhistle'' on fraud or mismanagement that they witness in their \nagencies. Mr. President, these are only a few of Senator Cohen's \naccomplishments during his tenure in Congress, but they demonstrate his \ncommitment to serving the people of Maine and the citizens of our \ncountry.\n  He has provided invaluable leadership in the area of race relations, \nand demonstrates daily his commitment to\n\n[[Page S11967]]\n\nequality and opportunity for all Americans. During my first 2 years in \nthe Senate, Senator Cohen joined in hearings on the effect of a popular \nmusic genre known as ``gansta rap.'' Senator Cohen made it clear that \nwhile he respected the First Amendment claims of the young men who \nproduced the music, all of us--parents, politicians and corporations --\nhave a responsibility to address the ugly realities which that music \nreflected. He was right, once again, and our country has benefitted \nfrom the attention the music industry gave his admonitions.\n  The State of Maine and the Nation will lose a fine public servant \nwhen Bill Cohen retires at the end of this Session. The senior Senator \nfrom Maine has served his State and the country with integrity, \nleadership, and dignity. I wish Senator Cohen and his wife Janet all \nthe best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11966-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE OF SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the dictionary defines a \nhumanitarian as ``a person devoted to promoting the welfare of \nhumanity, especially though the elimination of pain and suffering.'' \nThe picture next to the definition of humanitarian ought to be a \npicture of Senator Hatfield.\n  Over these last 4 years, I have had the honor of working with and \nlearning from the Senior Senator from Oregon. His commitment to the \nwell-being of all people, his historic work to eliminate nuclear \nproliferation, and his commitment to his State of Oregon have made him \na role model in the Senate.\n  Senator Hatfield and I agree on many issues. He is a man who truly \nbelieves that education is even more important to our national defense \nthan a missile system. His contributions to math and science education \nwill leave a lasting mark on our Nation's youth and future scholars. As \nthe steward of the Appropriations Committee, his steadfast commitment \nto education funding has earned him numerous professional accolades, my \nenduring admiration, and the thanks of millions of American \nschoolchildren and parents.\n  Where we don't agree, I have never ceased to respect his courage and \nintegrity. We disagreed on the balanced budget amendment, but he earned \nmy admiration as he voted against the amendment and against intense \npressure from his party's leaders, because he believed it was the right \nthing to do. It was a mighty reminder of the strength of principle in \nmen of character.\n  Senator Hatfield's rational, bipartisan approach to issues, his \nrespectful manner, and his quiet leadership will be sorely missed. The \nSenate is a body in which ideas are discussed, arguments made, and \nthoughtful votes cast. Senator Hatfield exemplified this ideal of the \nSenate.\n  As a representative of the State of Illinois, I would also like to \ncommend Senator Hatfield for his taste in historical figures. As a \nPresidential history scholar, he has had the good sense to focus much \nof his attention on Illinois' native son, Abraham Lincoln.\n  President Lincoln could have been describing the character and \napproach of Mark Hatfield when he said in his second inaugural address, \n``* * * with malice towards none, with charity for all, with firmness \nin the right as God gives us [or, in this case, him] to see the \nright.''\n  The clearest praise for the work of Senator Hatfield comes from the \npeople of his State of Oregon. He has never, in his 46 years in public \nservice, lost an election. The people of Oregon have supported him from \nthe State Legislature to the state house to the Senate.\n  Mark Hatfield is the longest serving Senator in the history of \nOregon. I do not need to tell the people of Oregon that they are losing \na great voice, but I will tell them that the Senate is losing a great \nman.

Mr. President, I am honored, but also saddened, to \nbe here speaking about one of our finest retiring colleagues, Senator \nBill Bradley of New Jersey.\n  As one of the newest members of the Senate Finance Committee, I have \nhad the privilege and the pleasure to work with Senator Bradley for \nonly a brief period; however, I have had the opportunity to see what an \nenormous impact he has had, and I have had the benefit of his counsel \nand advice--something I will surely miss.\n  I am sure that all of my Colleagues share my sentiment regarding the \noutstanding leadership demonstrated by Senator Bradley in the Senate. \nNot only has he been an asset in his position as a Senator, but also in \nthe various positions that he has held over his career. Mr. Bradley \nserved this Nation in a number of ways during his lifetime. He \nrepresented this country as a member of the 1964 U.S. Olympic Team and \nfrom 1967 through 1978 he served this country in the Air Force \nReserves. He was a very popular pro basketball player for the New York \nKnicks during the 1967 through 1977 seasons. Bill Bradley has truly \nbeen a public servant throughout his life, and it is my hope that after \nretiring from the Senate, he will go on to serve in another position of \nnational leadership.\n  In the Senate, Bill Bradley has been a central figure in the national \nfiscal debate, on family issues and helping to strengthen the \ntraditional Democratic values that define our Nation.\n  Senator Bradley is the author of many bills and resolutions here in \nthe Senate but has distinguished himself as an author of a book that \nhad a huge impact on tax policy in the United States, entitled, ``The \nFair Tax,'' published in 1982. ``The Fair Tax'' led directly to the \nmost significant tax legislation of our generation, the 1986 Tax Reform \nAct. This Act ended the abusive tax shelter regime and closed huge \nloopholes in many areas of the tax law. Consequently, billions of \ndollars in revenue were saved. Although many in this body deserve \ncredit, it was Senator Bradley's undying persistence and intellectual \nintegrity that were largely responsible for that major tax reform.\n  Demonstrating a keen understanding and willingness to work on fiscal \nlegislation has not hindered the Senator's efforts to advocate on \nbehalf of families. He has used the bully pulpit of the Senate to \nhammer home the need for, among other things, more innovative methods \nof dealing with issues that affect the impoverished of our Nation.\n  The Senator has worked to prevent cuts in the earned income tax \ncredit, which is legislation that truly helps families go from welfare \nto work. This measure has proved viable in rewarding work and providing \ntax relief to those who need it most.\n  Senator Bradley's hallmark, the Urban Community-Building Initiative, \nhas served to revitalize national domestic policy. Three of the main \nfeatures of this legislation: Community Policing, Community Schools, \nand Community Banking are essential to revitalizing our communities and \nrestoring its economy, education, and safety. The Senator's Self-\nReliance Loans will pave the way for every student to have an \nopportunity to go on to seek a higher education. Countless future \ngenerations will reap the benefits of his education vision and it will \nprove a long-term benefit for America's economy as a whole.\n  As a Senator who is noted for having conviction in the face of \ncompromise and faith above cynicism, Senator Bradley has shown himself \nto be a model for statesmanship and as a model for real leadership and \nreal heroism---the kind that is the backbone of democracy. I believe \nthat it was this conviction that has compelled him to speak out on the \ndivisive issue of race. Senator Bradley has pushed all Americans on \ntoward a higher calling---to look beyond race, religion, and creed but \nto relate on personal human levels. In doing so, he has been a true \ndefender of American values, a true Senator for the people of the State \nof New Jersey, and the United States of America.\n\n  I, like many of my colleagues, hope that Senator Bradley will \ncontinue to serve the public on a national level. His is a voice that \nbridges community and generation gaps that is needed in the 21st \ncentury. As the Senator himself eloquently stated, ``there are other \nways to serve the country.''\n  In short, Senator Bradley has been a model of senatorial excellence. \nHis passion, commitment, and zealous representation will all be greatly \nmissed,\n\n[[Page S11968]]\n\nyet it is Senator Bill Bradley, the personal man, whom we shall miss \nmost.\n  I know I will miss him greatly. He has always been willing to take \nthe tough stand, to defend American principles and American values, and \nhe has always worked to make sure that the opportunity to achieve the \nAmerican Dream was available to every American, he has always \ndemonstrated the kind of modesty, good judgment, and good humor that is \nthe hallmark of real leadership.\n  Senator Bill Bradley has lived a life filled with accomplishment. I \nknow that although he is leaving the Senate, his work on behalf of the \nAmerican people is far from over. I look forward to seeing him continue \nhis record of achievement in whatever new role he chooses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11967-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR SHEILA FRAHM\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take the \nopportunity to say a few words about a Senator who has been with us \nbriefly, but has nonetheless, made an impact on all of us in the \nSenate. Sheila Frahm joined us in June, bringing the number of women in \nthe Senate to nine, an all time high. This is not the first time that \nSenator Frahm has made history. Before her arrival in the Senate, she \nserved as the first woman Lieutenant Governor in Kansas and prior to \nthat, she was Kansas' first woman Senate majority leader.\n  However, Senator Frahm is much more than a history maker. In her time \nhere, she has proven how seriously she takes her job as a legislator \nand policy-maker. The best example of this can be found in her voting \nrecord, which is perfect. And her voting record is perfect because \nSheila Frahm decided that it was more important for her to remain in \nWashington to debate important issues like Kennedy-Kassebaum healthcare \nreform, and the welfare reform bill than for her to return to Kansas to \ncampaign for reelection. Sheila Frahm proved just how senatorial she \nreally is in prioritizing legislative business over her own political \nrace.\n  I have every confidence that Senator Frahm will continue to serve her \nbeloved Kansas with the same calm, good humor, and steadfast dedication \nto duty which she exhibited here in the Senate of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11968-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE RETIREMENT OF U.S. SENATOR AL SIMPSON\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, as most of the Members of this \nbody, I rise today to wish Senator Al Simpson a fond farewell. After 18 \nyears of superior service to the State of Wyoming and his country, \nSenator Simpson is leaving the Senate to teach at Harvard.\n  Al Simpson was born in Cody, Wyoming, a town founded by Buffalo Bill. \nHe comes from a family that helped settle much of northwestern Wyoming \nand has a long tradition of public service in Wyoming. His father was \ngovernor of Wyoming from 1954 to 1958, and served in the U.S. Senate \nfrom 1962 to 1966.\n  Al Simpson began his career in public service when he joined the \nArmy, upon graduation from college. He served overseas in the 5th \nInfantry Division and in the 2nd Armored Division in the final months \nof the Army of Occupation in Germany. In 1956 he received an honorable \ndischarge and returned to Wyoming to study law at the University of \nWyoming. Upon graduation from law school he joined his father's law \nfirm and practiced law in his hometown of Cody for 18 years.\n  Senator Simpson began his political career in Wyoming's State \nLegislature. In 1964 he was elected to the State Legislature as a State \nrepresentative of his native Park County. He served there for 13 years.\n  In 1978, following in his father's footsteps, Al Simpson was elected \nU.S. Senator. He won subsequent reelection bids in 1984 and 1990, \neasily defeating all challengers.\n  In the U.S. Senate, he quickly became known for his support of Social \nSecurity reform, immigration reform, and veterans issues. I came to \nrecognize his commitment to entitlement reform, when I had the pleasure \nof serving with him on the bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax \nReform in 1994. We also served on the Senate Finance Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over certain mandatory spending programs such as \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Federal retirement. It was \nclear from day one that Senator Simpson believes that entitlement \nreform should be a priority in this country. Continuing his belief in \nreform, I understand that he plans to teach his students at Harvard \nabout the state of entitlement programs, among other things.\n  During his career in public service, he has won a variety of honors, \nincluding the Distinguished Alumni of the University of Wyoming, \nhonorary law degrees from Notre Dame, American University, and Rocky \nMountain College, and a variety of awards including the Silver Helmet \nAward from AMVETS of World War II.\n  The Senate will miss a Member who is known for his support of \nbipartisan solutions. I have enjoyed working with Alan Simpson. I will \nmiss his wonderful sense of humor, his willingness to always say what \nhe thinks, and his intellectual integrity. Although we have often \ndisagreed, I am proud to have served with Alan Simpson. I would like to \nadd for the record my respect for this man who has served Wyoming and \nhis country well. I wish Senator Simpson, his wife Ann, and his family \nall the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11968-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to my colleague and friend, Senator David \nPryor, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this term.\n  Public service is a strong tradition in Senator Pryor's family. His \nmother was the first woman in Arkansas to run for public office after \nthe passage of the 19th amendment, and both his father and grandfather \nwere county sheriffs.\n  Senator Pryor's own involvement in public service began early, as a \ncongressional page. During that time, Senator Pryor demonstrated both \nhis commitment to a life of public service and his ability to \naccurately predict the future: As a teenage page, he placed a dime in \none of the recesses of a column of the Capitol, and vowed that he would \nreturn for that coin as a Senator. Less than three decades later, after \nserving three terms in the Arkansas House, three terms in the U.S. \nHouse, and two terms as Governor of Arkansas, Senator Pryor reclaimed \nhis dime, which had somehow eluded cleaning crews for all those years.\n  I am grateful to have served with Senator Pryor on two committees: \nFinance and Special Aging, where I have had the opportunity to observe \nfirst hand his dedication to serving the needs of our Nation's elderly \nand children in need, as well as his delightful creativity.\n  Senator Pryor's commitment to serving the needs of older Americans \nwas first demonstrated when he was a young freshman Congressman. He was \ninnovative enough to host a number of catfish fundraising dinners to \nestablish the House Select Committee on Aging, which he housed \ntemporarily in a trailer. Senator Pryor later served as the chairman of \nthe Senate Special Aging Committee, where he concentrated his efforts \non improving the quality of long term care in nursing homes. In his own \ninimitable fashion, he gathered information about these issues while \nserving as an undercover orderly in the 1960's. The most recent example \nof his creativity and his thoughtfulness came to fruition earlier this \nweek, when the entire Senate sported bow ties in honor of my colleague, \nPaul Simon. Senator Pryor arranged to have the ties made in Little Rock \nas a tribute to my fellow Illinoisian.\n  The Senate will not be the same without David Pryor. His presence in \nWashington will be sorely missed by Arkansas, by the Senate, and by me, \npersonally. I am very proud to have served with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11968-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11968-S11969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, in a very short time, the 104th \nCongress will adjourn for the last time\n\n[[Page S11969]]\n\nand bring to a close this chapter of the magnificent career of Senator \nClaiborne Pell.\n  Senator Pell's contributions to education have expanded opportunities \nand opened doors for millions of Americans. His foreign policy \naccomplishments have made the world a safer and more peaceful place for \neveryone. His grace, dignity, and dedication have reminded us all for \nthe last 36 years what public service is all about.\n  Senator Pell has authored or been a major contributor to dozens of \nlaws expanding educational opportunities. No single achievement stands \nout clearer than the creation of the Pell grant program in 1972. This \nprogram has given 60 million students access to the American Dream, by \nproviding $70 billion in Federal grants to students to help them attend \npostsecondary educational institutions. This program, and the dozens of \nothers that Senator Pell has contributed, are lasting tributes to his \nrecognition that education is a public good, even more than it is a \nprivate benefit.\n  The rungs of the ladder of opportunity in America are crafted in the \nclassroom. Quality, public education gave America a strong middle \nclass, and has given children of all socioeconomic and racial \nbackgrounds reason to believe that the promises of life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness apply equally to each of them.\n  Educational attainment has always correlated to career earnings. The \nmost educated Americans today earn 600 percent more than the least \neducated Americans.\n  Education is more important than ever. By the year 2000, the \nDepartment of Labor estimates that more than half of all new jobs will \nrequire an education beyond high school.\n  Senator Pell's contributions to education will continue to allow \nmillions of Americans to access education beyond high school--assuring \nthem that, at least by the accident of their family's wealth, they will \nnot be shut out of the American dream.\n  He has also been a leader in foreign policy, carefully helping to \nsteer American foreign policy from his seat on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for more than two decades. He has contributed to worldwide \narms control, nuclear disarmament, and international law. He even \nhelped to draft the original United Nations charter--shaping an \norganization that, 50 years later, helps to preserve peace and \nstability around the world.\n  The incomparable list of legislative and policy accomplishments \naside, what I will miss most is the careful grace with which Senator \nPell approaches his day-to-day work and his job as Senator. His \npresence is a constant reminder to me--and to many of my colleagues I \nknow--of exactly why it is an honor to serve in this body as a U.S. \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11968-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11969-S11970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             INTERNATIONAL DOLPHIN CONSERVATION PROGRAM ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. On October 4, 1995, 12 nations agreed in the Panama \nDeclaration to create a binding regime to reduce dolphin mortality and \nconserve fish in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean [ETP]. The Panama \nDeclaration would cap dolphin mortality in the ETP at 5,000 dolphin per \nyear, with the goal of eventually eliminating dolphin mortality. To put \nthis cap in perspective, in the 1970's, over 300,000 dolphin were being \nkilled each year.\n  We now have the opportunity to lock in the significant reductions \nthat have been achieved in the killing of dolphins in the ETP. In \naddition, the Panama Declaration would create binding measures for \nfishing vessels for observers, bycatch reduction and measures to \nprotect specific stocks of dolphins in the ETP.\n  On November 17, 1995, Senator Breaux and I introduced S. 1420, the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program Act, to implement the Panama \nDeclaration. Cosponsors include Senators Chafee, Johnston, Moseley-\nBraun, Murkowski, Thurmond, and Simpson. The Commerce Committee held a \nhearing on S. 1420 in April, and voted to approve the bill on June 6, \n1996, without objection. At the hearing in April, we heard the \ntestimony of Senators Boxer and Biden. The bill approved by the \ncommittee in June accommodated their concerns to the extent that we \ncould. We've also tried to accommodate Senator Smith, who raised some \nconcerns about the legislation.\n  The bill passed by the House (H.R. 2823) addresses the concerns of \nthe three Senators as much as possible too. If we make further changes, \nhowever, we will not fulfill the requirements of the Panama \nDeclaration, and we may as well pass nothing. The new binding \nconservation measures under the Panama Declaration can only take effect \nwith the specific changes to U.S. law in S. 1420 and H.R. 2823. The two \nkey changes to U.S. law are: (1) a change to allow tuna caught in \ncompliance with the Panama Declaration (including through the \nencirclement of dolphins) to be imported into the United States; and \n(2) a change so that ``dolphin safe'' in the U.S. will mean tuna caught \nin a set in which no dolphin mortality occurred (rather than through \nnonencirclement).\n  S. 1420 and H.R. 2823 would make these changes and would allow the \nnew regime envisioned in the Panama Declaration to go forward. If the \nU.S. does not make the changes, other nations will move forward without \nadequate conservation measures--and progress in protecting dolphins in \nthe ETP will be lost.\n  Our legislation would guarantee U.S. consumers that no dolphin were \nkilled during the harvest of tuna that is labeled as ``dolphin safe.'' \nUnder existing law, dolphins may have been killed, but as long as the \ntuna was not harvested by intentionally encircling dolphins, it can be \nlabeled as ``dolphin safe.'' Our legislation is supported by: (1) U.S. \ntuna boat owners; (2) the mainstream environmental community including \nGreenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental \nDefense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, and the World Wildlife \nFund; (3) the American Sportfishing Association; (4) U.S. Labor, \nincluding the National Fishermen's Union, Seafarers International, and \nthe United Industrial Workers; (5) the 12 nations who signed the Panama \nDeclaration (Belize, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, \nMexico, Panama, Spain, Vanuatu, and Venezuela); and (6) the \nAdministration.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the letter I received from Vice \nPresident Gore in support of S. 1420 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                         Washington, June 3, 1996.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, U.S. Senate, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I am writing to thank you for your leadership on \n     the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, S. 1420. \n     As you know, the Administration strongly supports this \n     legislation, which is essential to the protection of Dolphins \n     and other marine life in the Eastern Tropical Pacific.\n       In recent years, we have reduced dolphin mortality in the \n     Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna fishery far below historic \n     levels. Your legislation will codify an international \n     agreement to lock these gains in place, further reduce \n     dolphin mortality, and protect other marine life in the \n     region. This agreement was signed last year by the United \n     States and 11 other nations, but will not take effect unless \n     your legislation is enacted into law.\n       As you know, S. 1420 is supported by major environmental \n     groups, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, the \n     National Wildlife Federation, the Center for Marine \n     Conservation, and the Environmental Defense Fund. The \n     legislation is also supported by the U.S. fishing industry, \n     which has been barred from the Eastern Tropical Pacific tuna \n     fishery.\n       Opponents of this legislation promote alternative fishing \n     methods, such as ``log fishing'' and ``school fishing,'' but \n     these are environmentally unsound. These fishing methods \n     involve unacceptably high by-catch of juvenile tunas, \n     billfish, sharks, endangered sea turtles and other species, \n     and pose long-term threats to the marine ecosystem.\n       I urge your colleagues to support this legislation. Passage \n     of this legislation this session is integral to ensure \n     implementation of an important international agreement that \n     protects dolphins and other marine life in the Eastern \n     Tropical Pacific.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Al Gore.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge other Senators to help us enact this important \nlegislation before the 104th Congress adjourns.\n  Mr. President, I am greatly disappointed by the efforts that have \nbeen made to prevent S. 1420 and H.R. 2823 from being enacted this \nCongress. As I\n\n[[Page S11970]]\n\nmentioned in my statement, this legislation would implement the Panama \nDeclaration, an important step forward in the protection of dolphins \nduring tuna fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Because of \nthe Senate floor time needed for the appropriations bills, we simply \nhave not had the time to overcome the procedural obstacles that \nopponents of S. 1420 have used, or would attempt to use, to try to stop \nS. 1420.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I agree with the Senator from Alaska. By stopping our \nbill, opponents of S. 1420 and H.R. 2823 have sent a dangerous message \nto the other nations fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. \nThat message could have dire consequences on dolphin conservation. If \nwe were from those nations, we might feel the same way. They have \nsatisfied the conservation goals set by the United States in the last \n10 years, and now the United States has turned its back on them.\n  Mr. LOTT. I share the disappointment and concern of the Senators from \nAlaska and Louisiana. Their bill, S. 1420, as well as the House \ncompanion, H.R. 2823, have broad bipartisan support in the Congress and \nthe support of the U.S. tuna boat owners, the mainstream environmental \ncommunity, and the Administration. Last week Senator Boxer objected to \nour motion to consider H.R. 2823. Because of the time constraints we \nface in the closing days of the 104th Congress, there is no way to \novercome her objections--even though a substantial majority of the \nSenate would probably vote for this legislation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is truly unfortunate that the bill will not pass this \nyear, but the issue will not just disappear. We will do what we can to \nconvince the signatory nations of the Panama Declaration not to abandon \nthe Declaration, and we intend to pursue the enactment of these changes \nearly in the next Congress.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I concur. Though we have been unsuccessful in enacting \nS. 1420 and H.R. 2823 before the close of the 104th Congress, it is our \nintent to reintroduce the bill at the beginning of the 105th Congress \nand seek its expeditious enactment. At the beginning of the next \nCongress, we will have the time to overcome procedural measures used by \nopponents.\n  Mr. LOTT. It pleases me to hear the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Louisiana commit to pursuing this legislation in the next \nCongress. I will do everything I can to provide time on the Senate \nfloor to allow a vote on this important legislation as soon as the \nlegislation is ready at the beginning of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11969-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11970-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11970-S11971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1332.

A bill to provide for the disposition of certain funds \nappropriated to pay judgments in favor of the Mississippi Sioux \nIndians, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  the mississippi sioux tribes judgment fund distribution act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will fairly resolve a longstanding problem with respect to a \njudgment distribution to Sioux tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. \nSpecifically, the bill would distribute the accrued interest on funds \nawarded by the Indian Claims Commission in 1967 to the Mississippi \nSioux tribes. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Daschle and \nPressler in introducing this measure.\n  In 1972, Congress enacted legislation that authorized the Secretary \nof the Interior to distribute 75 percent of a $5,900,000 judgment award \nto the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe of North Dakota, the Sisseton and \nWahpeton Sioux Tribe of North and South Dakota, and the Assiniboine and \nSioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. The remaining 25 \npercent was to be distributed to individuals who could trace their \nlineal ancestry to a member of the aboriginal Sisseton and Wahpeton \nSioux Tribe.\n  The three Sioux tribes received their respective shares of the \njudgment award by the mid-1970's. To date, though, the funds allocated \nfor the lineal descendants have never been distributed. This has \nresulted in a situation where the accrued interest on the original \nprincipal of approximately $1.5 million has now grown to more than $13 \nmillion.\n  If the 1,969 lineal descendants identified by the Department of the \nInterior receive per capita payments, they would receive more than 18 \ntimes what the 11,829 enrolled tribal members received in the 1970's.\n  In 1987, the three Sioux tribes filed suit in Federal court to \nchallenge the constitutionality of the lineal descendancy provisions of \nthe 1972 Act. This litigation is currently in its second appeal. In \n1992, Congress enacted legislation which authorized the Attorney \nGeneral to settle the case on any terms agreed to by the parties \ninvolved. However, the Department of Justice has refused to proceed \nwith any settlement negotiations and has taken the position that the \n1992 law did not authorize the Department to settle the case on any \nterms other than those laid out in the original 1972 act. While I \nbelieve this interpretation flies in the face of congressional intent, \nthe Department has been unwilling to actively pursue this issue.\n  The legislation I am introducing on behalf of the three Sioux tribes \nrepresents a reasonable solution to this matter and a substantial \ncompromise on behalf of the tribes. In the past, the tribes have sought \nto repeal the lineal descendancy provisions of the 1972 act altogether, \nand, in 1986, a bill was reported by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs which would have achieved this goal.\n  In contrast, the Mississippi Sioux Tribes Judgment Fund Distribution \nAct of 1996 would retain the undistributed principal for the lineal \ndescendants and distribute the accrued interest to the three Sioux \ntribes. There would be no per capita payments of the interest, which \nwould have to be used by the tribes for economic development, resource \ndevelopment, or for other programs that collectively benefit tribal \nmembers, such as educational and social welfare programs. In addition, \nthe legislation contains an audit requirement by the Secretary of the \nInterior to ensure that the funds are properly managed.\n  I believe that this legislation is fundamentally fair. It keeps the \ncommitment that the Federal Government made to provide compensation to \nlineal descendants while ensuring that most of the remaining \nundistributed funds go to the tribes. It was, after all, the\n\n[[Page S11974]]\n\ntribes who were wronged and who should be compensated for their losses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on legislation that the \nsenior Senator from North Dakota is introducing today that will provide \nfor the distribution of a judgment to the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe \nand lineal descendants of tribe members.\n  This issue has been in litigation for many years and has been \npreviously dealt with by Congress. Still, the issue remains unresolved.\n  I want to see this matter taken care of to the satisfaction of all \nparties involved, once and for all. I believe the legislation the \nSenator from North Dakota is sponsoring is an essential first step in \ngetting the job done. While perhaps not the ultimate resolution of the \nissue, the legislation should be carefully considered by Congress. All \nparties involved deserve a chance to be heard.\n  As I believe thoughtful, bipartisan consideration of this bill will \nhelp push this issue off dead center and rolling toward resolution, I \nhave decided to cosponsor this legislation. I urge my colleagues to \ngive it serious consideration when the measure appears before them in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 2163. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to regulate \nthe manufacture, importation, and sale of ammunition capable of \npiercing police body armor; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwould amend Title 18 of the United States Code to strengthen the \nexisting prohibition on handgun ammunition capable of penetrating \npolice body armor, commonly referred to as bullet-proof vests. This \nprovision would require the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral to develop a uniform ballistics test to determine with \nprecision whether ammunition is capable of penetrating police body \narmor. The bill also prohibits the manufacture and sale of any handgun \nammunition determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney \nGeneral to have armor-piercing capability.\n  I am encouraged that President Clinton has taken an interest in this \nsubject. In a statement similar to remarks he has made many times \nrecently at campaign appearances around the country, President Clinton \nsaid to an audience in Cincinnati, OH, on September 16, 1996:\n\n       So that's my program for the future--do more to break the \n     gangs, ban those cop killer bullets, drug testing for \n     parolees, improve the opportunities for community-based \n     strategies that lower crime and give our kids something to \n     say yes to.\n\n  Mr. President, it has been almost 15 years since I first introduced \nlegislation in the Senate to outlaw armor-piercing, or cop-killer, \nbullets. In 1982, Phil Caruso of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association \nof New York City alerted me to the existence of a Teflon-coated bullet \ncapable of penetrating the soft body armor police officers were then \nbeginning to wear. Shortly\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\nthereafter, I introduced the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of \n1982 to prohibit the manufacture, importation, and sale of such \nammunition.\n  At that time, armor-piercing bullets--most notably the infamous \n``Green Hornet''--were manufactured with a solid steel core. Unlike the \nsofter lead composition of most other ammunition, this hard steel core \nprevented these rounds from deforming at the point of impact--thus \npermitting the rounds to penetrate the 18 layers of Kevlar in a \nstandard-issue police vest or flak-jacket. These bullets could go \nthrough a bullet-proof vest like a hot knife through butter. My \nlegislation simply banned any handgun ammunition made with a core of \nsteel or other hard metals.\n  Despite the strong support of the law enforcement community, it took \n4 years before this seemingly noncontroversial legislation was enacted \ninto law. The National Rifle Association initially opposed it--that is, \nuntil the NRA realized that a large number of its members were \nthemselves police officers who strongly supported banning these \ninsidious bullets. Only then did the NRA lend its grudging support. The \nbill passed the Senate on March 6, 1986 by a vote of 97 to 1, and was \nsigned by President Reagan on August 8, 1986 (Public Law 99-408).\n\n  That 1986 act served us in good stead for 7 years. To the best of my \nknowledge, not a single law enforcement officer was shot with an armor-\npiercing bullet. Unfortunately, the ammunition manufacturers eventually \nfound a way around the 1986 law. By 1993, a new Swedish-made armor-\npiercing round, the M39B, had appeared. This pernicious bullet evaded \nthe 1986 statute's prohibition because of its unique composition. Like \nmost common ammunition, it had a soft lead core, thus exempting it from \nthe 1986 law. But this soft core was surrounded by a heavy steel \njacket, solid enough to allow the bullet to penetrate body armor. Once \nagain, our Nation's law enforcement officers were at risk. Immediately \nupon learning of the existence of the new Swedish round, I introduced a \nbill to ban it.\n  Another protracted series of negotiations ensued before we were able \nto update the 1986 statute to cover the M39B. We did it with the \nsupport of law enforcement organizations, and with technical assistance \nfrom the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In particular, James \nO. Pasco, Jr., then the Assistant Director of Congressional Affairs at \nBATF, worked closely with me and my staff to get it done. The bill \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent on November 19, 1993 as an \namendment to the 1994 crime bill.\n  Despite these legislative successes, it was becoming evident that \ncontinuing innovations in bullet design would result in new armor-\npiercing rounds capable of evading the existing ban. It was at this \ntime that some of us began to explore in earnest the idea of developing \na new approach to banning these bullets based on their performance, \nrather than their physical characteristics. Mind, this concept was not \nentirely new; the idea had been discussed during our efforts in 1986, \nbut the NRA had been immovable on the subject. The NRA's leaders, and \ntheir constituent ammunition manufacturers, felt that any such broad-\nbased ban based on a bullet performance standard would inevitably lead \nto the outlawing of additional classes of ammunition. They viewed it as \na slippery slope, much as they have regarded the assault weapons ban as \na slippery slope. The NRA had agreed to the 1986 and 1993 laws only \nbecause they were narrowly drawn to cover individual types of bullets.\n  And so in 1993 I asked the ATF for the technical assistance necessary \nto write into law an armor-piercing bullet performance standard. At the \ntime, however, the experts at the ATF informed us that this could not \nbe done. They argued that it was simply too difficult to control for \nthe many variables that contribute to a bullet's capability to \npenetrate police body armor. We were told that it might be possible in \nthe future to develop a performance-based test for armor-piercing \ncapability, but at the time we had to be content with the existing \ncontent-based approach.\n  Two years passed and the Office of Law Enforcement Standards of the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology wrote a report \ndescribing the methodology for just such a armor-piercing bullet \nperformance test. The report concluded that a test to determine armor-\npiercing capability could be developed within 6 months.\n  So we know it can be done, if only the agencies responsible for \nenforcing the relevant laws have the will. The legislation I am \nintroducing requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Attorney General, to establish performance standards for the \nuniform testing of handgun ammunition. Such an objective standard will \nensure that no rounds capable of penetrating police body armor, \nregardless of their composition, will ever be available to those who \nwould use them against our law enforcement officers.\n  I wish to assure the Senate that this measure would in no way \ninfringe upon the rights of legitimate hunters and sportsmen. It would \nnot affect legitimate sporting ammunition used in rifles. It would only \nrestrict the availability of armor-piercing rounds, for which no one \ncan seriously claim there is a genuine sporting use. These cop-killer \nrounds have no legitimate uses, and they have no business being in the \narsenals of criminals. They are designed for one purpose: to kill \npolice officers.\n  The 1986 and 1993 cop-killer bullet laws I sponsored kept us one step \nahead of the designers of new armor-piercing rounds. When the \nlegislation I have introduced today is enacted--and I hope it will be \nearly in the 105th Congress--it will put them out of the cop-killer \nbullet business permanently.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2164. A bill to establish responsibility and accountability for \ninformation technology systems of the Department of Agriculture, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Department \nof Agriculture Responsibility and Accountability Act of 1996. This bill \nestablishes an Information Technology System Control Board to manage \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture's [USDA] technology planning and \nprocurement processes. The Board will give the Department a strong \ncentralized decision-making body to eliminate the duplication and \ninefficiencies associated with the independent agency-based approach \nthat has plagued the Department for years, delivered poor service, and \nsquandered hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  The Office of Management and Budget estimates the Department of \nAgriculture will spend $1.4 billion on information technology and \nautomated data processing equipment in fiscal year 1997. The \nInformation Technology System Control Board will oversee all \ninformation technology spending at the Department. The Board, \nconsisting of the Secretary and two appointees, will assume control of \ninformation technology planning and acquisition until the year 2002, \nguiding the creation of a technical architecture to take the Department \ninto the 21st century. Finally, the Board will determine how best to \naccomplish the missions of the various agencies and the Department \nbefore purchasing information technology systems.\n  The General Accounting Office, the Department of Agriculture's Office \nof Inspector General, and independent contractor reviews since 1989 \nhave identified ongoing problems with USDA's administration of \ninformation resource management programs, including the multiagency \nprogram called Info Share and computer and telecommunication purchases. \nSince the USDA Reorganization Act was enacted in 1994, USDA management \nhas continued their historic trend of purchasing telecommunication and \ninformation systems that: fail to link information technology budgeting \nand purchases to strategic business needs; fail to integrate \ninformation management strategies with financial and programmatic \ninformation and reporting requirements; fail to define information \ntechnology requirements through business process reengineering; fail to \nachieve departmentwide efficiencies by standardizing administrative \nfunctions; and, fail to address the cultural changes necessary to \nmigrate from a piecemeal approach to a standardized,\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\ncollaborative delivery system in field service centers.\n  The Department continues to acquire hardware, software, and other \nequipment that does not match user needs, provides inefficient delivery \nof services to USDA customers, and creates unnecessary duplication. \nMany duplicated product and service acquisitions could have been \navoided by departmentwide consolidation and sharing. Procurement \nactivities do not allow the Farm Services Agency, Natural Resources \nConservation Service and Rural Development to exchange information \nelectronically in the agency headquarter and field offices. The \nDepartment lacks leadership to direct the changes necessary to \nestablish a working field service center infrastructure.\n\n  In April 1993, USDA established the Info Share program to reframe the \nbusiness activities of individual agencies into a consolidated strategy \nto meet the goals outlined for one-stop-shopping field service centers. \nIn August 1993, the General Services Administration delegated \nprocurement authority for USDA to spend up to $2.6 billion on Info \nShare. Besides the General Accounting Office, the Office of Management \nand Budget, and the USDA Office of the Inspector General, the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology criticized USDA's approach to \npurchasing computer equipment, hardware, and software before defining \nthe future mission objectives of its agencies in a May 1994 report. The \nreport stated that Federal agencies should first determine how best to \naccomplish their mission and then acquire technology solutions to meet \ntheir needs. Info Share was to be the cure-all for USDA's management \nand acquisition control problems.\n  The USDA Office of Inspector General sharply criticized the Info \nShare Program in a May 1995 report. The inspector general reported that \nUSDA agencies were proceeding with their own information technology \nprojects for information sharing between agencies with an apparent lack \nof funding and acquisition controls. The Office of Management and \nBudget complained to the Office of Budget and Program Analysis [OBPA] \nabout inaccurate acquisition cost reporting and the need for a formal \napproval process for information technology purchases.\n  Despite heavy pressures for Info Share to succeed, by December 1995 \nInfo Share had failed. The failure was due to an evident lack of upper \nmanagement leadership, inadequate planning, failure to obtain consensus \non program objectives, and poor program management. USDA's leadership, \ndespite commitments made by Secretary Glickman, again failed to focus \non the necessary development of departmentwide computer and information \nstandards and a comprehensive analysis of emerging business \nrequirements. The Info Share Program has now been replaced by a \ndecentralized agency-led initiative under the National Food and \nAgriculture Council. As a result, individual agencies are again \nindependently deciding what is best for their individual needs, \nabandoning the departmentwide effort necessary to consolidate \nadministrative and information technology systems.\n  According to an August 1994 GAO Report, ``USDA Restructuring--Refocus \nInfo Share Program on Business Processes Rather Than Technology'', USDA \nis not performing key business process reengineering [BPR] steps \nnecessary for a successful reorganization of the Department. BPR is a \nmanagement technique used fundamentally to rethink and redesign \nbusiness processes to achieve dramatic changes in overall performance. \nIt is also used to change how employees think and work to improve \ncustomer satisfaction. The success of the field service center \ninitiative depends on cross-training field office employees to operate \nas educated contacts for all USDA programs. The lack of training is \nmaking it difficult for field office employees who remain after \ndownsizing efforts to provide quality service to their customers. \nUSDA's focus on improving computer automation prior to concentrating on \nthe skills of its work force has hamstrung program delivery.\n\n  During farm bill deliberations, it was determined that reforms were \nneeded to rein in the uncontrolled and obscured use of CCC funds for \ninformation technology. Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] borrowing \nauthority has been historically abused within the Department. Transfers \nand expenditures of CCC funds have too often been obscured from \ncongressional oversight and at times have been of questionable \nlegality. As a result, the FAIR Act established spending caps on the \nuse of CCC funds for purchases or services for automated data \nprocessing or information technology, and for all reimbursable \nagreements--contracts--funded by the CCC. Finally, the CCC was required \nto report to Congress on a quarterly basis all expenditures of over \n$10,000 for these expenditures. This new level of transparency was \ndesigned to increase accountability by forcing USDA managers to fully \nexamine information technology purchases and link purchase plans with \nwork force needs.\n  Despite repeated calls for leadership, USDA does not have the \nnecessary management to link the Department's ability to define its \nwork force to its information technology purchases. The Department has \nyet to determine how to provide quality services with a reduced work \nforce and changing mission requirements. In addition, USDA is still \nusing its Info Share initiative, now guided by the National Food and \nAgriculture Committee, as a vehicle to acquire new information \ntechnology, rather than develop a method to improve the way USDA does \nbusiness and prepare the Department for the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n  On May 31, 1996, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts and \nI wrote to the Secretary stating that the USDA should not make \nadditional investments in information technology products that are \nexclusive to one agency unless USDA can show that the investments will \nprovide technology that will be shared among agencies. We also shared \nour concern that funds were being spent without adequate consideration \nof USDA's future business requirements. The Department responded with a \nless than adequate catalog of ongoing initiatives designed for \nindividual agency program use rather than a departmentwide information \ntechnology architecture.\n\n  Despite efforts by USDA to meet the goal of information sharing as \nmandated by the USDA Reorganization Act of 1994 and Info Share, the \nFarm Services Agency, Rural Development, and Natural Resources \nConservation Service field offices remain unable to operate in a common \ncomputing environment. This has resulted in the delivery of poor \nservices to its customers. If USDA is ever to successfully share \ninformation, the Department must prevent agencies from planning and \nbuilding their own individual networks.\n  For example, last year the Farm Services Agency [FSA] spent $36 \nmillion in Commodity Credit Corporation [CCC] funds to purchase new \nminicomputers for FSA field offices during the debate of the Federal \nAgriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. The FAIR Act resulted \nin a 7-year phaseout of farm subsidy programs, significantly reducing \nwork force requirements and workload of the Farm Service Agency. Less \nthan a year later, FSA is proposing another upgrade that does not meet \nthe requirements necessary for information sharing with other field \noffice agency computer systems. Why did FSA spend $36 million on a new \nsystem if the agency knew it would be outdated only 9 months later? \nUSDA estimates the upgrade alternative will result in acquisition costs \nof $125.8 million for FSA alone. Estimates of costs to be incurred by \nthe Natural Resources Conservation Service and Rural Development to \nacquire similar equipment have not been made. This ill-conceived \napproach will result in an investment of $11,604 per computer in FSA \noffices that may not have employees to run those computers after work \nforce downsizing occurs. This is yet another example of poor planning \nand waste of taxpayer dollars resulting from a lack of direction.\n  Despite repeated reviews by the General Accounting Office and the \nUSDA Office of the Inspector General, and considerable concern of \nCongress, the Director of the Office of Information Resource Management \nhas not determined how to address the information sharing needs of the \nDepartment. Therefore, USDA risks wasting millions by building new \nnetworks that are redundant, do not address future business needs, and \ndo not provide the information sharing capabilities necessary among \nagencies. The creation of\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\nthe Information Technology System Control Board will put the Department \nback on track and save millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  My bill also makes necessary changes to the buyout authority granted \nto USDA in the 1997 Agriculture Appropriation Conference Report. The \nbuyout authority gives the Department the authority to offer $25,000 \nbonuses to retirement-age employees, and those eligible for early \nretirement. This golden handshake approach to Department downsizing \npays off employees who are already preparing to retire. In addition, it \ncomes at the expense of conservation programs. The Senate Agriculture \nCommittee recently learned that the Department may transfer an \nestimated $43 million from unobligated Conservation Reserve Program \nfunds to pay for buyouts for 1,341 Farm Services Agency employees. The \nbill mandates that buyouts can only be paid from appropriations made \navailable for salaries and expenses and prohibits the use of mandatory \nfunds, including Commodity Credit Corporation funds, for buyout plans. \nIn addition, the bill limits the Department's buyout authority to 1 \nyear. These changes are important to monitor the Department's work \nforce downsizing efforts by compelling USDA to properly plan for future \nwork force reductions.\n\n  I cannot overstate my concern that the Department has failed to \nadequately assess the impact that the FAIR Act will have on the people \nwho use the services of the Department and on the Department's work \nforce requirements. Department management lacks strong central \nleadership in planning for information technology for the 21st century, \ncontinues to acquire equipment, hardware, software, and computers that \ndo not match user needs, continues to provide inefficient delivery of \nservices to USDA customers, and continues to allow unnecessary \nduplication.\n  Since I am introducing my bill at the end of this session, obviously \nit cannot become law before the 105th Congress convenes next year. \nHowever, I intend to pursue this important issue in the next Congress, \nand I will reintroduce this bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important endeavor and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the summary and the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n       Sec. 101. Findings.--Studies by several governmental and \n     private organizations have repeatedly found that the \n     Department of Agriculture has made planning decisions for, \n     and procurement of, information technology in a piecemeal \n     fashion, and on an individual agency basis (instead of a \n     Department-wide basis), resulting in duplication, a lack of \n     coordination, and wasted financial and technological \n     resources. The Department has failed to adequately assess the \n     impact that the 1996 Farm Bill will have on the people who \n     use the services of the Department and on the Department's \n     workforce requirements. Because of these and other \n     longstanding deficiencies, it is necessary to establish a \n     single entity within the Department that has the exclusive \n     responsibility and authority to make decisions regarding \n     planning for, and procurement of, information technology. \n     This entity will--provide the Department with strong and \n     coordinated leadership; ensure that funds will be spent on \n     information technology only after a thorough review of future \n     business requirements; and ensure that planning and \n     procurement for information technology is performed on a \n     departmental basis, instead of the Current independent \n     agency-based approach.\n       Sec. 102. Definitions.\n       Sec. 103. Information Technology System Control Board.\n       An Information Technology System Control Board (Board) is \n     established within the Department that consists of three \n     members- the Secretary of Agriculture and two persons with \n     extensive experience from the private sector who have \n     qualifications such as quality management, strategic \n     planning, and business process reengineering. The two members \n     of the Board other than the Secretary shall be compensated at \n     a rate according to level V of the Executive Schedule.\n       Sec. 104. Mission of the Board.--The Board is required to--\n       Develop and implement for the future a blueprint for a \n     single platform for information technology; ensure that \n     planning and procurement for information technology is \n     performed on a departmental basis, instead of an independent \n     agency-based approach;\n       Ensure that information technology for field service \n     centers is coordinated, cost effective, and designed in light \n     of the changed requirements and reduced work force realities \n     created by the 1996 Farm Bill;\n       Establish a technical architecture for information \n     technology for the Department; and\n       Submit to Congress a business plan on how the Board intends \n     to carry out its mission though 2002.\n       Sec.  105 & 106. Duties and Powers of the Board.\n       The Board is authorized and required to--\n       Review, evaluate, and approve every plan or design for an \n     activity or regulation of the Department regarding planning, \n     providing services, or procuring information technology for \n     offices and agencies of the Department;\n       Develop a plan or design for activities of the Department \n     regarding planning, providing services, or procuring \n     information technology for offices and agencies of the \n     Department; and\n       Approve every transfer or obligation of funds for \n     procurement of information technology for offices and \n     agencies of the Department.\n       The Board will not be subject to the control, direction, or \n     supervision of the Secretary. The Board will obtain the \n     exclusive authority to exercise these powers when the last \n     member of the Board is confirmed by the Senate, or March 31, \n     1997, whichever is earlier, and will terminate on March 31, \n     2002.\n       Sec.  107. Review by Office of Management and Budget.\n       The Office of Management and Budget may review any \n     regulation or transfer or obligation of funds approved by the \n     Board.\n       Sec. 108.  Technical Amendment.\n       A technical change is made to a reporting requirement \n     regarding funding for automated data processing or \n     information resource management.\n       Sec. 109. Termination of Authorities.\n       All authorities of this subtitle (except the technical \n     amendment in section 108) will terminate on March 31, 2002.\n\n         TITLE II--ADMINISTRATION OF DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n       The personnel buyout authority in the FY 1997 Agriculture \n     Appropriations Act is amended--\n       By prohibiting persons who are eligible for retirement from \n     also obtaining a buyout payment;\n       By requiring that only funds from an agency's salaries and \n     expense accounts be used to pay for buyout payments;\n       By limiting this buyout authority to only FY 1997.\n\n                       TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This bill will become effective when it is signed into law \n     by the President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2165. A bill to require that the President to impose economic \nsanctions against countries that fail to eliminate corrupt business \npractices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n                       UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Unfair Trade \nPractices Act to level the playing field for U.S. companies competing \nwith foreign firms overseas by imposing sanctions against foreign \npersons and concerns engaging in corrupt trade practices to the \ndisadvantage of a U.S. company and against countries that refuse to \nenforce or adopt their own foreign corrupt practices laws similar to \nour Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n  I am introducing this bill at the end of this session rather than \nwaiting to introduce it in the 105th Congress in order to provide \npeople an opportunity to review this legislation over the intervening \nmonths. Earlier introduction of the bill was prevented by the press of \nSenate Intelligence Committee business.\n  The Select Committee on Intelligence, which I chair, had a \nparticularly heavy agenda this year, including, among many other items, \nthe annual Intelligence Authorization Act providing for the first real \nreform of the U.S. intelligence community since 1947, criminalizing \neconomic espionage, and directing a thorough study of how the U.S. \nGovernment is organized to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. In addition, the committee has undertaken significant \ninquiries into CIA activities in Guatemala, the actions of U.S. \nofficials regarding the flow of arms from Iran to\n\n[[Page S11980]]\n\nBosnia, and the bombing of United States facilities in Saudi Arabia.\n  Mr. President, this bill directs the President to report to Congress \nregarding foreign persons and concerns that engage in corrupt practices \nand countries that do not have or do not enforce laws similar to our \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act. Countries that the President determines \nare not engaged in a good faith effort to enact or enforce such laws \nwill be sanctioned. Sanctions include a 50-percent reduction in foreign \naid and USG opposition to the extension of any loan or financial or \ntechnical assistance by international financial institutions.\n  The bill also provides for sanctions against foreign persons and \nconcerns engaging in corrupt trade practices to the disadvantage of a \nU.S. company. If the country with primary jurisdiction over the \noffenders fail to take action against them within 90 days, the \nPresident must, to fullest extent consistent with international \nobligations, ban all U.S. Government contracts with the offenders as \nwell as all licenses or other authority allowing the offenders to \nconduct business within the United States.\n  In testimony earlier this year before the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch said the \nproblems of economic espionage and unfair trade practices were among \nthe most serious economic issues facing the country today. Earlier this \nyear, Senator Kohl and I introduced legislation to criminalize economic \nespionage, S. 1557, subsequently included in S. 1718, and S. 1557. The \nbill I am introducing today attempts to address the second issue, \nunfair trade practices by foreign concerns.\n  The importance of this effort to level the playing field by \nencouraging other countries to criminalize bribery of foreign officials \nthroughout the world cannot be overstated. Earlier this year, then-U.S. \nTrade Representative Mickey Kantor noted that ``from April 1994 to May \n1995, the U.S. Government learned of almost 100 cases in which foreign \nbribes undercut U.S. firms' ability to win contracts valued at $45 \nbillion.''\n  A recent poll of 3,000 Asian executives conducted by the ``Far \nEastern Economic Review'' found that more than a third of the business \nleaders in four major countries preferred to bribe a customer rather \nthan lose a big sale. Another index is published annually by an \ninstitution called Transparency International, created by a group of \nmultinational corporations including General Electric and the Boeing \nCorp. This index, which was a compilation of polls of business men and \nwomen around the world, revealed that corruption is not limited to any \nspecific culture or business area but exists worldwide. Nor is it \nlimited to less developed countries. In 1994, a year described in ``The \nFinancial Times--Dec. 30, 1994, at 4--as ``The Year of Corruption,'' \ncomplaints of corruption surfaced in some of the wealthier countries, \nincluding Britain, Canada, France, and Japan.\n\n  Despite the evidence that corruption is still widespread, there are \nindications that the international community may finally be susceptible \nto increased pressure to crack down on these unfair trade practices. \nThere is a growing recognition that bribery exacts a cost on the \nforeign country whose officials are corrupted. Studies show corrupt \nprocurement practices deter foreign investment while as much as \ndoubling the price that emerging countries pay for goods and services.\n  We may finally be approaching the point when focused U.S. pressure \ncan actually make a difference, just as U.S.-led efforts to combat \nmoney laundering, including U.S. sanctions, extraterritorial \nenforcement of U.S. laws, and multilateral efforts, finally led \ncountries to recognize that the stigma of being a dirty-money haven \noutweighed the benefits of attracting illicit funds.\n  Change will not occur without significant U.S. pressure, however. \nWhen then-Trade Representative Kantor returned this past March from \ndiscussions with the Organization on Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment [OECD], he expressed his frustration at the lack of \nprogress in trying to get our European allies to adopt laws to stop \nunfair trade practices and suggested U.S. sanctions may be required to \nprovide the necessary incentive. While most countries have enacted laws \nto punish the bribing of their officials by their nationals and \nforeigners, no other major nation has laws banning their nationals from \nbribing foreign officials. In fact, in a number of countries--including \nGermany and France--corruption and bribery are so accepted that \nindividuals are permitted to deduct the cost of bribes from their \ntaxes.\n  Sustained U.S. efforts finally led in April of this year to an \nagreement by the members of the OECD that these tax laws should be \nrewritten so that bribes paid to foreign officials, often listed as \ncommissions or fees, would no longer be tax deductible. However, this \nagreement is not binding and there is no deadline by which members are \nto have adopted the changes. Moreover, this is still a long way from \ncriminalizing bribery of foreign officials.\n  There is much more that needs to be done. In addition to pressing the \nOECD members to adopt foreign corrupt practices laws, the USG should \nmove promptly to support the treaty negotiated this past April in the \nOrganization of American States requiring each signatory to make \nbribery of foreign officials a crime and an extraditable offense. We \nshould press for similar commitments in other fora, such as the G-7 \nmeetings and the World Trade Organization.\n  In the meantime, the U.S. should take steps to ensure that U.S. firms \nare not penalized by the failure of other countries to enact laws \nprohibiting foreign bribery. Foreign firms that bribe foreign officials \nto gain an unfair advantage over U.S. competitors are, in effect, \nrobbing those U.S. competitors of their right to compete fairly for \ninternational contracts. Such ``theft'' has adverse effects within the \nUnited States in terms of lost income and, often, jobs. If countries \nwith jurisdiction over these trade thieves will not act to stop them, \nthe U.S. should.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 2166. A bill to increase the overall economy and efficiency of \nGovernment operations and enable more efficient use of Federal funding, \nby enabling State, local, and tribal governments and private, nonprofit \norganizations to use amounts available under certain Federal assistance \nprograms in accordance with approved flexibility plans; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        THE LOCAL EMPOWERMENT AND FLEXIBILITY PILOT ACT OF 1996\n\nMr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the appropriations process of the \npast few weeks has been very complex. Rolling several spending bills \ninto one--to the tune of $600 billion--is not the most appropriate \nmethod to appropriate. However, as the fiscal year expires tonight, \navoiding a Government shutdown is our national priority. As a result of \nour need to be hasty, many Members have lost, or been asked to \nwithhold, their legislative priorities. This is the compromising nature \nabsolutely necessary to reach agreement in time for the President to \nsign this bill today.\n  One withheld legislative goal that I would like to expound upon is my \nown--the Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act of 1996. I introduced \nthis bill on the first day of the 104th Congress. Congress has held \nthree hearings, one in the Senate and two in the House, and ``Local-\nFlex,'' as I call it, was reported favorably out of both the House \nGovernment Reform and Oversight Committee and the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee months ago.\n  An agreement had been reached to include a six-State Local-Flex pilot \nin the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. The assistance of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee as well as Senators Shelby, Kerrey, \nKennedy, and Simon was greatly appreciated. However, before the \nagreement could be incorporated into the Treasury-Postal bill, various \nother amendments forced leadership to pull the bill off the floor. I \nthen included the agreed upon pilot in the Senate CR with the hope and \nexpectation that it would be included in the final omnibus bill. \nUnfortunately, the necessary haste of the government-wide spending bill \nprecluded securing final agreement to incorporate the Local-Flex pilot. \nI have no doubt that a few additional moments would have made this \npossible.\n\n  Local-Flex provides communities flexibility in the administration of \nFederal funding. States and localities receive numerous Federal grants, \neach with their categorical purposes and\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\nspecific requirements. As grantees use more than one grant together, \nrequirements conflict and common sense government can be lost. Under \nLocal-Flex, in exchange for flexibility in the form of waivers of \nstatutory and regulatory requirements, grantees agree to focus on and \nmeasure results rather than procedural compliance. With over 635 \nFederal grants available to be mixed and matched at the local level, \nthere should be little doubt that flexibility is required.\n  Mr. President, the past year, the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nHouse of Representatives, administration, interest groups and other \ninterested Members have come to the table to practically discuss how \nthe bill would work and what improvements should be made. Serious \nconcerns have been addressed and great headway was made to the point \nthat the Local-Flexibility Pilot has the broad bipartisan support of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n  Unfortunately, I am disappointed to report that even with the \nbipartisan support of the committee of jurisdiction, the support of the \nNational League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, and \nyet other interest groups have targeted Local-Flex, warning their \nmembers of the danger that results whenever communities are empowered \nto make decisions which affect their citizens.\n  As former Governor of Oregon, I vividly recall the lack of trust \nWashington has for the State and local level. That is why for several \nyears I have been pushing forward what I call the ``flexibility \nfactor.'' The Education Flexibility Act or ``Ed-Flex,'' was my first \npiece and become law in 1993. It provides much needed flexibility in a \nselect number of education programs. Ed-Flex has been enormously \nsuccessful, and what started as a six-State pilot is being expanded \nwith New Mexico becoming the most recent Ed-Flex State.\n  The second piece to my flexibility factor is ``Work-Flex.'' \nOriginally a part of the Careers Act of Senator Kassebaum, and now a \npart of the omnibus appropriations bill, Work-Flex reduces Government \nbureaucracy specifically in the area of job training programs, of which \nthere are over 100, by measuring and rewarding outcomes and not \nbureaucratic procedure.\n  The last and most significant piece to the flexibility factor has \nbeen Local-Flex--legislation which will not be passed this year, but I \nwould like to, in a moment, introduce as a free-standing bill the \nLocal Empowerment and Flexibility Pilot Act of 1996.\n\n  The key organization that resisted the concept of local-flexibility, \nwas the National Education Association. No matter what changes were \nmade to Local-Flex, an offshoot of the Education Flexibility Act, it \nhas been made clear to me that the NEA would never support Local-Flex. \nIt is not my usual custom to focus on any one group or individual on \nthe Senate floor, but I cannot be silent as my commitment to education \nis questioned as flagrantly as it has been by the NEA. My support for \neducation funding is absolute, but my support for flexible funding is \njust as strong.\n  More than once I have been endorsed by the Oregon Education \nAssociation, and on the issue of education vouchers, the NEA and I have \nstood on the same ground. To witness the NEA's uncompromising view on \nthis matter has been at best disheartening. While I single out the NEA, \nmany groups trying to protect their piece of the Federal pie have been \nvocal in their opposition.\n  Madam President, I would just like to close by explaining why I \nbelieve the flexibility factor is so important. As I mentioned a moment \nago, we have been attempting--and when I say we I mean Members on both \nsides of the aisle and both sides of the Mall--to balance the budget on \nan 18-percent baseline of nondefense discretionary programs. By 2002, \nit is projected this baseline will decrease by 12 percent. In barely 5 \nyears, it is estimated that nondefense discretionary spending will be \nonly 13 percent of the Federal budget. These numbers should encourage \neach of us to stop and think. In short, we are running out of \nnondefense discretionary dollars.\n\n  On the first day of this Congress I introduced the Local Empowerment \nand Flexibility Act because if we are going to try and get our fiscal \nhouse in order using 18 percent of our budget, we may as well ensure \nthat Federal dollars are doing more than being thrown at problems--we \nought to be providing flexibility and measuring results.\n  It is appropriate then, that on this last day, the Local Empowerment \nand Flexibility Pilot Act--which has been built on the foundation of my \noriginal bill--be introduced today and made available to the 105th \nCongress for debate.\n  Mr. President, I would like to especially thank the Governmental \nAffairs Committee for their work with Local-Flex, especially Chairman \nStevens, Ranking Member Glenn and Senator Levin. I would also like to \nthank Senator Kennedy for his assistance with this legislation. Their \nexpertise has been invaluable. The Government Reform and Oversight \nCommittee on the House side has also shown excellent leadership under \nChairman Clinger and the companion bill's sponsor Congressman Shays. \nAnd finally, I am delighted to know of Congressman Steny Hoyer's \ninterest in moving the flexibility factor forward in the 105th \nCongress. I introduce this bill today to serve as a starting point for \nnext year's discussion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2168. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide \nprotection for airline employees who provide certain air safety \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   THE AVIATION SAFETY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in an effort to increase overall safety of \nthe airline industry, I am introducing the Aviation Safety Protection \nAct of 1996, which would establish whistle blower protection for \naviation workers.\n  The worker protections contained in the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act [OSHA] are of great importance to American workers. A number \nof members of this body have worked hard to maintain those protections. \nOSHA properly protects both private and Federal Government employees \nwho report health and safety violations from reprisal by their \nemployers. However, because of a loophole, aviation employees are not \ncovered by these protections. Flight attendants and other airline \nemployees are in the best position to recognize breaches in safety \nregulations and can be the critical link in ensuring safer air travel. \nCurrently, those employees face the possibility of harassment, \ndiscipline, and even termination if they work for unscrupulous airlines \nand report violations.\n  Aviation employees perform an important public service when they \nchoose to report safety concerns. No employee should be put in the \nposition of having to choose between his or her job and reporting \nviolations that threaten the safety of passengers and crew. For that \nreason, we need a strong whistle blower law to protect aviation \nemployees from retaliation by their employers when reporting incidents \nto Federal authorities. Americans who travel on commercial airlines \ndeserve the safeguards that exist when flight attendants and other \nairline employees can step forward to help Federal authorities enforce \nsafety laws.\n  This bill would close the loophole in OSHA law and provide the \nnecessary protections for aviation employees who provide safety \nviolation information to Federal authorities or testify or assist in \ndisclosure of safety violations. The act provides a Department of Labor \ncomplaint procedure for employees who experience employer reprisal for \nreporting such violations, and assures that there are strong \nenforcement and judicial review provisions for fair implementation of \nthe protections. The act also protects airlines from frivolous \ncomplaints by establishing a fine which will be imposed on an employee \nwho files a complaint if the Department of Labor determines that there \nis no merit to the complaint.\n  I want to acknowledge the leadership of Representative Clyburn who \nhas introduced the bill in the House of Representatives as H.R. 3187. I \nam pleased to introduce the companion legislation in the Senate.\n  This bill will provide important protections to aviation workers and \nthe general public. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PELL:\n\n[[Page S11982]]\n\n  S. 2169. A bill to promote the survival of significant cultural \nresources that have been identified as endangered and that represent \nimportant economic, social, and educational assets of the United States \nand the world, to permit United States professionals to participate in \nthe planning and implementation of projects worldwide to protect the \nresources, and to educate the public concerning the importance of \ncultural heritage to the fabric of life in the United States and \nthroughout the world, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the endangered cultural heritage act of 1996\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President. I rise to express my concern for the many \nhistoric and artistic sites around the world that are in grave danger \nthrough a growing range of threats from natural catastrophes and \nenvironmental deterioration to destructive acts of man. These \nmagnificent sites are resources of great importance, not only for their \nspiritual and educational meaning, but also as valuable economic, \nsocial, and learning blocks for the global community.\n  Through personal travel and my observations as a member of the \nForeign Relations Committee and Honorary Chairman of the American \nCommittee for Tyre, I have come to understand the value of preserving \nand protecting cultural heritage, especially in times of political \nupheaval or social change. In Cambodia, Vietnam and Croatia, we have \nseen that the use and abuse of culturally significant sites plays a \nlarge role in international relations.\n  The actual number of endangered sites is being well-documented by the \nWorld Monuments Fund, a United States nonprofit organization devoted to \nthe conservation of cultural heritage on a worldwide scale that \nmaintains an international listing of endangered sites. Within this \ncountry, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the National \nPark Service work with the World Monuments Fund to track sites in need \nof conservation and rehabilitation.\n  I believe that the United States is in a unique position to lead an \neffort among independent nations to protect the future of our cultural \nlegacy worldwide. A timely response is critical to prevent further \nlosses. This can be achieved through sustained funding to stabilize and \nstrengthen the ability of local institutions to protect their cultural \nresources on a consistent and long-term basis. Conservation work must \nincrease. Professionals need to be trained in cultural resource \nmanagement, and the public needs to be instilled with a concern for the \nsurvival of our significant cultural heritage.\n  I hope that the 105th Congress will take action to establish an \nendangered cultural heritage fund and am today introducing legislation \nto serve as a discussion piece to move us in that direction. As a \nnation composed of the people of many cultures, it is fitting to \nsupport the care of great historic and artistic sites which define \nnational character and pay tribute to human accomplishment of universal \nsignificance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM:\n  S. 2170. A bill to establish spending limits for entitlement programs \nand other mandatory spending programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly.\n\n\n                    the save our savings act of 1996\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, one good result of the \nstrenuous budget debate of the past 2 years has been a bipartisan \nembrace of the need for reform in the long-sacrosanct realm of \nentitlement spending. The exchange of offers and counteroffers that \ncharacterized the budget process produced a new consensus that \nentitlement spending must be controlled. Most of us now realize that \nwithout controls, entitlement programs will continue to grow at a pace \nthat threatens our fiscal security, jeopardizing any effort to balance \nthe budget and squeezing funding away from important discretionary \nprograms.\n  As we come to the end of this Congress, the fruits of that consensus \nare in peril. Republicans and Democrats, Congress and the White House--\nalmost all of us have agreed that, at the very minimum, we can save \n$232 billion over 6 years from entitlement programs. We have not been \nable to agree on the policies to produce those savings, but we should \nnot release ourselves from our obligation to do so. The legislation I \nam introducing today, the Save Our Savings Act of 1996, would ensure \nthat we fulfill that obligation.\n  Sometimes when we talk about entitlements, we use terms that support \nthe view that they are beyond our control. We often define entitlements \nas programs not controlled by the annual appropriations process, \nprograms that must distribute payments to all eligible, regardless of \nthe cost. On its face, that definition is correct. But at a more basic \nlevel, it betrays a sense of helplessness, an aversion to action, and a \npassive acceptance of their growing might.\n  When I was sworn in as a Senator 18 years ago, discretionary spending \nrepresented nearly 50 percent of the Federal budget. Now we spend \nlittle more than a third on these programs. We have seen in the past 2 \nyears how hard it is to squeeze savings from discretionary programs. If \nwe do nothing about entitlements, spending constraints will become \ntighter still.\n  Part of the explanation is that we now must set aside about one-sixth \nof the budget just to pay interest on the debt. At the same time, \nspending on entitlement programs has escalated rapidly in recent years, \nand the forecast is for even more rapid expansion in the future. In \nfact, if entitlements are allowed to grow unimpeded, they, combined \nwith interest on the debt, will consume all revenues by 2012.\n  This bill takes affirmative steps to lock in significant entitlement \nsavings that, without action, will vanish. The legislation would cap \nentitlements from fiscal years 1997 to 2002 at the CBO-defined levels \nof the President's budget or, where applicable, the levels in the \nrecently passed welfare reform legislation. You can consider those \nlevels of savings the lowest that most of us have agreed to.\n  Multiple caps would be enforced, including individual caps on the 11 \nlargest entitlement programs, an all other cap, and an aggregate cap. \nSequestration would be triggered only on programs that exceeded their \ncaps, and the caps themselves would be adjusted for economic and \ndemographic factors. The caps could be adjusted by recorded vote.\n  Some might argue that the very fact that both parties now advocate \nsignificant savings from entitlement programs has demonstrated our \ncapacity to control Government spending--that we do not need our feet \nheld to the fire--but experience is eloquent. If we let the evolution \nof the last 2 years' budget proposals fade into memory, the courage and \nresolve that should be invested in making difficult policy decisions \nwill be spent instead on producing yet another set of budget \nblueprints. Congress does not need to start all over again; we need to \nfinish what we have started.\n  I realize that nothing more can be done on this matter in this \nCongress. I also realize that I will not be here in the next Congress \nto carry on this effort. However, I believe it is important to voice \nboth my concern and a specific proposal to give weight to that concern \nfor those who must take up this battle in the years ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n\n  S. 2171. A bill to provide reimbursement under the Medicare Program \nfor telehealth services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                THE COMPREHENSIVE TELEHEALTH ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto help improve health care delivery in rural and underserved \ncommunities throughout America through the use of telecommunications \nand telehealth technology.\n  Telehealth encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from \nthe telephone to high-tech equipment that enables a surgeon to perform \nsurgery from thousands of miles away. It includes interactive video \nequipment, fax machines and computers along with satellites and fiber \noptics. These technologies can be used to diagnose patients, deliver \ncare, transfer health data, read x rays, provide consultation, and \neducate health professionals. Telehealth also includes the electronic \nstorage and transmission of personally identifiable health information, \nsuch as medical records, test results, and insurance claims.\n\n[[Page S11983]]\n\n  The promise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. \nThroughout the country, providers are experimenting with a variety of \ntelehealth approaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical \nand other health-related services. Those programs are demonstrating \nthat telecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of \ntime and distance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of \ntransporting patients to medical providers. Many approaches show \npromising results in reducing health care costs and bringing adequate \ncare to all Americans. Technological advances and the development of a \nnational information infrastructure for the first time give telehealth \nthe potential to overcome barriers to health care services for rural \nAmericans and give them the access that most Americans take for \ngranted. But it is clear that our Nation must do more to integrate \ntelehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure.\n  Because I believe telehealth holds incredible promise for rural \nAmerica, I formed the ad hoc steering committee on telemedicine and \nhealth care informatics to explore telehealth and related issues in \n1994. The purpose of the steering committee, which includes \ntelehealth experts from Government, private industry, and the health \ncare professions, is to evaluate federal policies on telehealth and how \nto use telecommunications technology more effectively to increase \naccess to health care throughout America.\n\n  Throughout the last few years, as the steering committee held \nmeetings and policy forums, it became increasingly apparent that there \nis enormous energy and financial effort being devoted to telehealth \ntoday, both by Government and private industry.\n  Because so many rural and underserved communities lack the ability to \nattract and support a wide variety of health care professionals and \nservices, it is important to find a way to bring the most important \nmedical services into those communities. Telehealth provides an \nimportant part of the answer. It helps bring services to remote areas \nin a quick, cost-effective manner, and can enable patients to avoid \ntraveling long distances in order to receive health care treatment.\n  Telehealth is already making a difference in my State. The University \nof North Dakota has a fiber optic two-way audio and video interactive \nnetwork that has been used to train students in areas like social work \nand medical technology. Recently, I had the opportunity to spend some \ntime with two of the premier telehealth systems in the State of North \nDakota. I was amazed at the capabilities of these systems. They \ncurrently supply speciality care to rural North Dakota clinics, manage \nchronic disease, lower administrative costs, and reduce the isolation \nfelt by rural and frontier practitioners.\n  Because telehealth is in many respects an emerging health care \napplication, it is particularly important to constructively capitalize \non efforts like these. My proposal attempts to facilitate this in a \nnumber of ways.\n  The first element of my proposal builds on current demonstration \nprojects to require the Health Care Financing Administration to put in \nplace a reimbursement system for telehealth activities under Medicare. \nMedicare reimbursement policy is an essential component of helping \nintegrate telehealth into the health care infrastructure, and must be \nexplored. It is particularly important in rural areas, where many \nhospitals do as much as 80% of their business with Medicare patients.\n\n  The second element of this proposal asks the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to submit a report to the Congress on the status of \nefforts to ease licensing burdens on practioners who cross State lines \nin the course of supplying telehealth services. Currently, consultation \nby almost any licensed health professional in this situation requires \nthat the practitioner be licensed in both States.\n  In talking with telehealth providers in my State, and with experts on \nthe Ad Hoc Committee, I have been told repeatedly that this is one of \nthe most significant barriers to developing broad integrated telehealth \nsystems. More importantly, they tell me States have actively been using \nlicensure to close their borders to innovative telehealth practice. In \nthe past two years, nine States have taken legislative action to ensure \nthat out-of-state practitioners must be fully licensed in their State \nin order to provide telehealth services, even if they are fully \nlicensed in the State they are practicing from. During a recent \ndiscussion with a telehealth practitioner from my home State of North \nDakota, I was told about a group of telehealth specialists who, among \ntheir small group practice, were licensed in over 30 different States. \nThat means they pay thirty different fees, are responsible for 30 \ndifferent continuing education requirements, and are overseen by 30 \ndifferent regulatory bodies. This is a costly and burdensome procedure \nfor many practitioners, but the burden falls particularly heavily on \nrural practitioners, who face long travel times to acquire continuing \neducation, and who frequently run on lower profit margins than urban \npractitioners.\n  While I am not prepared at this time to propose that the Federal \nGovernment get involved with professional licensure, I have asked the \nSecretary to study the issue and report to Congress yearly on the \nstatus of efforts by states and other interested organizations to \naddress this issue. As part of this report, I have asked to the \nSecretary to make recommendations to Congress, if appropriate, about \npossible Federal action to lower the licensure barrier.\n  A third element of my proposal involves coordination of the Federal \ntelehealth effort. Vice President Gore has been making outstanding \ncontributions in the area of the information super highway. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, in large part at the urging of \nthe Vice President, has created an informal interagency task force that \nis examining our Federal agency telehealth efforts. My bill attempts to \nuse that task force to inventory Federal activity on telehealth and \nrelated technology, determine what applications have been found \nsuccessful, and recommend an overall Federal policy approach to \ntelehealth.\n\n  Many departments and agencies of the Federal Government are engaged \nin telehealth activity, including the Veterans Administration, \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Agriculture, Office of Rural \nHealth Policy, and many others. The more these agencies work together \nto coordinate the Federal effort and consolidate Federal resources, the \nmore effective the Federal Government will be at contributing to \ntelehealth in a positive way. Such coordination will also help protect \nthe American taxpayer from unnecessary duplication of effort.\n  The fourth part of my proposal helps communities build home-grown \ntelehealth networks. It attempts to both build a telehealth \ninfrastructure and foster rural economic development. Clearly, the \nscarcity of resources in many rural communities requires that the \ncoordination and use of those resources be maximized. My bill \nencourages cooperation by various local entities in an effort to help \nbuild sustainable telehealth programs in rural communities. It plants \nseed money to encourage health care providers to join with other \nsegments of the community to jointly use telecommunications resources. \nUsing a unique loan forgiveness program, it rewards telehealth systems \nthat supply appropriate, high-quality care while reducing overall \nhealth care costs.\n  Most importantly, it does not create a system where various \ntechnological approaches are imposed upon communities. Rather it \nenables potential grantees to determine user-friendly approaches that \nwork best for them. This home-grown approach to developing user-\nfriendly telehealth systems, as well as the preference for coordinating \nresources within communities, will help ensure the long-term viability \nof such programs after the grant expires.\n  Mr. President, my proposal is a sound first step in our national \nefforts to integrate telecommunications technology into the rapidly \nevolving health care delivery system. Over the past several weeks, I \nhave attempted to reach out to different groups and incorporate their \nideas into this proposal. I hope the result is a bill that will command \nbroad support. But, as with any complex issue, I understand that some \nmay prefer different approaches. By introducing this legislation in the \nwaning moments of the 104th Congress, I hope to send a message to all \ninterested parties that now is the time to\n\n[[Page S11984]]\n\ncome forward with creative solutions to these important issues, because \nI am certain that they will be revisited again in the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2171\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Hospitals, clinics, and individual health care \n     providers are critically important to the continuing health \n     of rural populations and the economic stability of rural \n     communities.\n       (2) Rural communities are underserved by specialty care \n     providers.\n       (3) Telecommunications technology has made it possible to \n     provide a wide range of health care services, education, and \n     administrative services between practitioners, patients, and \n     administrators across State lines.\n       (4) The delivery of health services by licensed health \n     practitioners is a privilege and the licensure of health care \n     practitioners and the ability to discipline such \n     practitioners is necessary for the protection of citizens and \n     for the public interest, health, welfare, and safety.\n       (5) The licensing of health care practitioners to provide \n     telehealth services has a significant impact on interstate \n     commerce and any unnecessary barriers to the provision of \n     telehealth services across State lines should be eliminated.\n       (6) Rapid advances in the field of telehealth give the \n     Congress a need for current information and updates on recent \n     developments in telehealth research, policy, technology, and \n     the use of this technology to supply telehealth services to \n     rural and underserved areas.\n       (7) Telehealth networks can provide hospitals, clinics, \n     practitioners, and patients in rural and underserved \n     communities with access to specialty care, continuing \n     education, and can act to reduce the isolation from other \n     professionals that these practitioners sometimes experience.\n       (8) In order for telehealth systems to continue to benefit \n     rural and underserved communities, medicare must reimburse \n     the provision of health care services from remote locations \n     via telecommunications.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To mandate that the Health Care Financing \n     Administration reimburse the provision of clinical health \n     services via telecommunications.\n       (2) To determine if States are making progress in \n     facilitating the provision of telehealth services across \n     State lines.\n       (3) To create a coordinating entity for Federal telehealth \n     research, policy, and program initiatives that reports to \n     Congress annually.\n       (4) To encourage the development of rural telehealth \n     networks that supply appropriate, cost-effective care, and \n     which contribute to the economic health and development of \n     rural communities.\n       (5) To encourage research into the clinical efficacy and \n     cost-effectiveness of telehealth diagnosis, treatment, or \n     education on individuals, practitioners, and health care \n     networks.\n        TITLE I--MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR TELEHEALTH SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of introducing \nlegislation regarding subsistence hunting and fishing in Alaska.\n  I am under no false hope that this legislation will move through the \nSenate this year but I want it to appear in the Record for purposes of \ndiscussion.\n  The issue of subsistence hunting and fishing in Alaska has caused a \ngreat divisiveness in my State that has led to the State of Alaska \nbecoming the only State in the union which no longer retains control of \nits fish and game resources on public lands.\n  This legislation calls for the appointment of a special master to \ncome up with non-binding recommendations to the Secretaries of \nAgriculture and the Interior, the Governor of the State of Alaska and \nto the Congress.\n  The recommendations will be on how to return management of fish and \ngame resources to the State, and how best to provide for the \ncontinuation of a subsistence lifestyle for Alaska's rural residents.\n  I hope to have significant discussions with the people of Alaska on \nthis issue between now and the start of the 105th Congress and intend \nto introduce legislation again upon our return in January.\n  Mr. President, I intend to place a longer statement in the Record \nnext week on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n\n  S. 2173. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nfamily-owned business exclusion from the gross estate subject to estate \ntax, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           The Family Business Estate Tax Relief Act of 1996\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I introduce the Family Business \nEstate Tax Relief Act of 1996, which would help preserve our Nation's \nmost important economic assets. I am referring, of course, to our \nfarms, ranches and other family-owned small businesses which are the \nmajor creators of new wealth and jobs in this country.\n  Farms, ranches and other closely held family businesses that operate \nin this country face a number of obstacles to succeeding, ranging from \nprice gouging by tough international competitors to excessive U.S. \nregulations. That is why it is not surprising to find, for example, \nthat we have lost some 377,000 family farms since 1980, a decline of \nsome 23,500 family farms every year.\n  Since 1980, we have lost some 9,000 of our family farms in North \nDakota. At the same time, we see that only a small fraction of other \nfamily-run businesses survive beyond the second generation.\n  When family farms are sold or family-run businesses on Main Street \nare boarded up, those families lose their very livelihood. Moreover, \nour country loses the jobs and services those families provide to our \ncommunities.\n  I have been approached on a number of occasions at town meetings by \nNorth Dakotans who say it is virtually impossible for them to pass \nalong their farm or business--which has been the family's major asset \nfor decades--to their children because of the exorbitant estate taxes \nthey would pay. They think it is unfair, and I agree.\n  Unfortunately, our estate tax laws force many family members who \ninherit a modestly sized farm, ranch or other family business to sell \nit, or a large part of it, out of the family in order to pay off estate \ntaxes. This is especially onerous when the inheriting family members \nhave already been participating in the business for years and depend \nupon it to earn a living.\n\n[[Page S11987]]\n\n  I think that we must take immediate steps to breathe new economic \nlife and opportunities into our family businesses and the communities \nin which they operate. It seems to me that a good first step is \ncorrecting our estate tax laws so they do not unfairly penalize those \nworking families who are now prevented from passing along a small farm \nor business to their kids or grandkids because they would have to pay \nexorbitant estate taxes.\n  There are a few provisions included in our estate tax laws that are \nintended to help a family's effort to keep the family business running \nlong after the death of its original owner. But, for the most part, \nthese provisions are either too modest or too narrowly drawn to do much \ngood.\n  Now I also understand that there are some complicated estate tax \nplanning techniques available for those wealthy enough to hire \nsophisticated and costly tax advisors. Clearly some estate planning \ndevices may reduce the estate tax burden imposed on some family \nbusinesses upon the death of a principal owner. But for those less \naffluent families inheriting a family business--where such estate \nplanning tools were unavailable for whatever reason--the estate taxes \nwill ultimately force them to amass a pile of debt, or to sell off all \nor a large part of a family business, just to pay off their estate \ntaxes. I think that this is wrong, and it runs counter to the kinds of \npolicies that we ought to be pursuing in support of our family-owned \nbusinesses.\n  That is why I am introducing the Family Business Estate Tax Relief \nAct to rectify this matter, and I urge you consider joining me in this \nendeavor.\n  The Family Business Estate Tax Relief Act would provide two \nsignificant measures of estate tax relief to those families hoping to \npass along their businesses to the next generation.\n  First, my bill allows a decedent's estate to exclude up to the first \n$900,000 of value of the family business from estate taxes so long as \nthe heirs continue to materially participate in the business for many \nyears after the death of the owner. Together, this proposal, when \ncoupled with the existing $600,000 benefit from unified estate and gift \ntax credit, will eliminate estate tax liability on qualifying family \nbusiness assets valued up to $1.5 million. In addition, the full \nbenefit of this new $900,000 exclusion is available to couples trying \nto pass along the family business without the complicated tax planning \ntailored to one spouse or the other that is sometimes used today.\n  Second, my bill would allow the executor of a qualifying estate who \nchooses to pay estate taxes in installments to benefit from a special 4 \npercent rate on the estate taxes attributable to a family business \nworth between $1.5 and $2.5 million. In other words, my bill would also \nlighten the estate tax burden on the next $1 million of estate assets.\n  My proposals expand upon the well-tested approaches found in Sections \n2032A and 6601(j) of the Tax Code.\n  For example, we currently provide a ``special-use'' calculation for \nvaluing real estate used in a farm or other trade or business for \nestate tax purposes, where a qualifying business is passed along to \nanother family member after the death of the owner. To benefit from the \n``special-use'' formula under Section 2032A, the inheriting family \nmember must continue to actively participate in the business operation. \nIf the heir ceases to participate in the business, he or she may face a \nsubstantial recapture of the estate taxes which would have been paid at \nthe time of the original owner's death.\n\n  In enacting this provision, Congress embraced the goal of keeping \nfarms and other closely held business in the family after the death of \nthe owner. However, in the case of family farms, special-use valuation \nprimarily helps those farms adjacent to urban areas, where the value of \nthe land for non-farm uses is often much higher. But Section 2032A does \nnot help many farms located in truly rural areas of the country where \nfarming is the land's best use. This provision also provides little \nhelp for families transferring other non-farm small businesses under \nsimilar circumstances. My legislation would correct these glaring \nshortfalls in current law.\n  In addition, my bill would increase the benefit of the existing \npreferential interest rates under Section 6601(j) that apply to farms \nand other closely held businesses. The benefits of the current \nprovision have been significantly reduced by inflation over the past \nseveral decades, and my bill simply increases the amount of estate \ntaxes that qualify for a special 4 percent interest rate if paid to the \nIRS in installment payments over time.\n  Moreover, my bill includes several safeguards to ensure that its tax \nbenefits are truly targeted at the preservation of most family \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, I plan to offset any estimated revenue losses from this bill \nby offering another legislative package to close a number of outdated \nor unnecessary tax loopholes for large multinational corporations doing \nbusiness in the United States. As a result, passing my estate tax \nrelief proposals will not increase the Federal deficit. But passing the \nFamily Business Estate Tax Relief Act will help to preserve the \neconomic backbone of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this much-needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n\n  S. 2174. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with \nrespect to the admission of temporary H-2A workers; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                The H-2a Temporary Agricultural Workers\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that would make \nneeded reforms to the so-called H-2A Program, the program intended by \nCongress in the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for a reliable \nsupply of legal, temporary, immigrant workers in the agricultural \nsector, under terms that also provide reasonable worker protections, \nwhen there is a shortage of domestic labor in this sector.\n  Let me start by once again thanking my good friend, Al Simpson, the \nsenior Senator from Wyoming, who agreed to including in the Illegal \nImmigration Reform conference report some compromise language regarding \nthe Sense of the Congress on the H-2A Program and requiring the General \nAccounting Office to review the effectiveness of the program by the end \nof the year. Al Simpson is a true friend, a statesman, and a dedicated \npublic servant. The Senate will miss him and I will miss our working \ntogether on a regular basis.\n  The language included in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 is essentially the same as language agreed \nto in the conference report on fiscal year 1997 Agriculture \nAppropriations. With these provisions, the Congress now has gone on \nrecord twice on the importance of having a program that helps ensure an \nadequate work force for agricultural producers.\n  This is an issue that of the utmost importance to this country's \nfarmers and ranchers, especially in light of the impact that \nimmigration reform will have on the supply of agricultural labor. There \nis very real concern among Idaho farmers and throughout the country \nthat these reforms will reduce the availability of agricultural \nworkers.\n  Farmers need access to an adequate supply of workers and want to have \ncertainty that they are hiring a legal work force. In 1995, the total \nagricultural work force was about 2.5 million people. That equals 6.7 \npercent of our labor force, which is directly involved in production \nagriculture and food processing.\n  Hired labor is one of the most important and costly inputs in \nfarming. U.S. farmers spent more than $15 billion on hired labor \nexpenses in 1992 $1 of every $8 of farm production expenses. For the \nlabor-intensive fruit, vegetable and horticultural sector, labor \naccounts for 35 to 45 percent of production costs.\n  The competitiveness of U.S. agriculture, especially in the fruit, \nvegetable and horticultural specialty sectors, depends on the continued \navailability of hired labor at a reasonable cost. U.S. farmers, \nincluding producers of labor-intensive perishable commodities, compete \ndirectly with producers in other countries for market share in both \nU.S. and foreign commodity markets.\n\n  Wages of U.S. farmworkers will not be forced up by eliminating alien \nlabor, because growers' production costs are capped by world market \ncommodity prices. Instead, a reduction in the work force available to \nagriculture will force\n\n[[Page S11988]]\n\nU.S. producers to reduce production to the level that can be sustained \nby a smaller work force.\n  Over time, wages for these farm workers have actually risen faster \nthan non-farm worker wages. Between 1986-1994, there was a 34.6 percent \nincrease in average hourly earnings for farm workers, while non-farm \nworkers only saw a 27.1 percent increase.\n  Even with this increase in on-farm wages, this country has \nhistorically been unable to provide a sufficient number of domestic \nworkers to complete the difficult manual labor required in the \nproduction of many agricultural commodities. In Idaho, this is \nespecially true for producers of fruit, sugar beets, onions and other \nspecialty crops.\n  The difficulty in obtaining sufficient domestic workers is primarily \ndue to the fact that domestic workers prefer the security of full-time \nemployment in year round positions. As a result the available domestic \nwork force tends to prefer the long term positions, leaving the \nseasonal jobs unfilled. In addition, many of the seasonal agricultural \njobs are located in areas where it is necessary for workers to migrate \ninto the area and live temporarily to do the work. Experience has shown \nthat foreign workers are more likely to migrate than domestic workers. \nAs a result of domestic short supply, farmers and ranchers have had to \nrely upon the assistance of foreign workers.\n  The only current mechanism available to admit foreign workers for \nagricultural employment is the H-2A program. The H-2A program is \nintended to serve as a safety valve for times when domestic labor is \nunavailable. Unfortunately, the H-2A program isn't working.\n  Despite efforts to streamline the temporary worker program in 1986, \nit now functions so poorly that few in agriculture use it without \nrisking an inadequate work force, burdensome regulations and potential \nlitigation expense. In fact, usage of the program has actually \ndecreased from 25,000 workers in 1986 to only 17,000 in 1995.\n  The bill I am introducing would provide some much-needed reforms to \nthe H-2A program. I urge my colleagues to consider the following \nreasonable modifications of the H-2A program.\n  First, the bill would reduce the advance filing deadline from 60 to \n40 days before workers are needed. In many agricultural operations, 60 \ndays is too far in advance to be able to predict labor needs with the \nprecision required in H-2A applications. Furthermore, virtually all \nreferrals of U.S. workers who actually report for work are made close \nto the date of need. The advance application period serves little \npurpose except to provide time for litigation.\n\n  Second, in lieu of the present certification letter, the Department \nof Labor [DOL] would issue the employer a domestic recruitment report \nindicating that the employer's job offer meets the statutory criteria \nand lists the number of U.S. workers referred. The employer would then \nfile a petition with INS for admission of aliens, including a copy of \nDOL's domestic recruitment report and any countervailing evidence \nconcerning the adequacy of the job offer and/or the availability of \nU.S. workers. The Attorney General would make the admission decision. \nThe purpose is to restore the role of the Labor Department to that of \ngiving advice to the Attorney General on laboravailability, and return \ndecision making to the Attorney General.\n  Third, the Department of Labor would be required to provide the \nemployer with a domestic recruitment report not later than 20 days \nbefore the date of need. The report either states sufficient domestic \nworkers are not available or gives the names and Social Security \nNumbers of the able, willing and qualified workers who have been \nreferred to the employer. The Department of Labor now denies \ncertification not only on the basis of workers actually referred to the \nemployer, but also on the basis of reports or suppositions that \nunspecified numbers of workers may become available. The proposed \nchange would assure that only workers actually identified as available \nwould be the basis for denying foreign workers.\n  Fourth, the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] would \nprovide expedited processing of employers' petitions, and, if approved, \nnotify the visa issuing consulate or port of entry within 15 calendar \ndays. This would ensure timely admission decisions.\n  Fifth, INS would also provide expedited procedures for amending \npetitions to increase the number of workers admitted on 5 days before \nthe date of need. This is to reduce the paperwork and increase the \ntimeliness of obtaining needed workers very close to or after the work \nhas started.\n  Sixth, DOL would continue to recruit domestic workers and make \nreferrals to employers until 5 days before the date of need. This \nmethod is needed to allow the employer at a date certain to complete \nhis hiring, and to operate without having the operation disrupted by \nhaving to displace existing workers with new workers.\n  Seventh, the bill would enumerate the specific obligations of \nemployers in occupations in which H-2A workers are employed. The \nproposed definition would define jobs that meet the following criteria \nas not adversely affecting U.S. workers:\n  1. The employer offers a competitive wage for the position.\n  2. The employer would provide approved housing, or a reasonable \nhousing allowance, to workers whose permanent place of residence is \nbeyond normal commuting distance.\n  3. The employer continues to provide current transportation \nreimbursement requirements.\n  4. A guarantee of employment is provided for at least three-quarters \nof the anticipated hours of work during the actual period of \nemployment.\n  5. The employer would provide workers' compensation or equivalent \ncoverage.\n  6. Employer must comply with all applicable federal, state and local \nlabor laws with respect to both U.S. and alien workers.\n  This combination of employment requirements would eliminate the \ndiscretion of Department of Labor to specify terms and conditions of \nemployment on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the scope for \nlitigation would be reduced since employers (and the courts) would know \nwith particularity the required terms and conditions of employment.\n  Eighth, the bill would provide that workers must exhaust \nadministrative remedies before engaging their employers in litigation.\n  Ninth, certainty would be given to employers who comply with the \nterms of an approved job order. If at a later date the Department of \nLabor requires changes, the employer would be required to comply with \nthe law only prospectively. This very important provision removes the \npossibility of retroactive liability if an approved order is changed.\n  With the Illegal Immigration Reform bill on its way to becoming law, \naction on these H-2A reforms would be necessary early next year to \navoid jeopardizing the labor supply for American agriculture.\n  Therefore, it is fully my intention to reintroduce this bill at the \nstart of the 105th Congress. I am introducing it at this time, at the \nend of the 104th Congress, so that those in Congress and around the \ncountry who are interested in this issue can get a head start on \ndiscussing these issues and examining these vitally-needed reforms.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to examine this bill, hopefully with an \neye toward supporting these reforms when they are reintroduced in the \nnext Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2174\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROCEDURES FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF H-2A PETITIONS.\n\n       Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1188) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) through (i) as \n     subsections (g) through (j), respectively; and\n       (2) by adding the following after subsection (e):\n       ``(f) Procedures for the Consideration of H-2A Petitions.--\n     The following procedures shall apply to the consideration of \n     petitions by the Attorney General under this section:\n       ``(1) Expedited processing of petitions.--The Attorney \n     General shall provide an expedited procedure for the \n     adjudication of petitions filed under this section, and the \n     notification of visa-issuing consulates where aliens seeking \n     admission under this section will apply for visas and/or \n     ports of entry where aliens will seek admission under this \n     section within 15 calendar days from the date such petition \n     is filed by the employer.\n       ``(2) Expedited amendments to petitions.--The Attorney \n     General shall provide an expedited procedure for the \n     amendment of petitions to increase the number of workers on \n     or after five days before the employers date of need for the \n     labor or services involved in the petition to replace \n     referred workers whose continued availability for work at the \n     time and place needed under the terms of the approved job \n     offer can not be confirmed and to replace referred workers \n     who fail to report for work on the date of need and replace \n     referred workers who abandon their employment or are \n     terminated for cause, and for which replacement workers are \n     not immediately available pursuant to subsection (b)(6).''.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIMITATION ON EMPLOYER LIABILITY.\n\n       Section 218(g) (8 U.S.C. 1188(g)) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (2)(A); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (2)(A) the following:\n       ``(B) No employer shall be subject to any liability or \n     punishment on the basis of an employment action or practice \n     by such employer that conforms with the terms and conditions \n     of a job offer approved by the Secretary pursuant to this \n     section, unless and until the employer has been notified that \n     such certification has been amended or invalidated by a final \n     order of the Secretary or of a court of competent \n     jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. 7. LIMITATION ON JUDICIAL REMEDIES.\n\n       Section 218(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1188(h)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(3) No court of the United States shall have jurisdiction \n     to issue any restraining\n\n[[Page S11990]]\n\n     order or temporary or permanent injunction preventing or \n     delaying the issuance by the Secretary of a certification \n     pursuant to this section, or the approval by the Attorney \n     General of a petition to import an alien as an H-2A worker, \n     or the actual importation of any such alien as an H-2A worker \n     following such approval by the Attorney General.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\nSummary of the Bill to Reform the Immigration and Nationality Act with \n       Respect to the H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers Program\n\n       The following proposed changes to the H-2A program would \n     improve its timeliness and utility for agricultural employers \n     in addressing agricultural labor shortages, while providing \n     wages and benefits that equal or exceed the median level of \n     compensation in non-H-2A occupations, and reducing the \n     vulnerability of the program to being hamstrung and delayed \n     by litigation.\n       1. Reduce the advance filing deadline from 60 to 40 days \n     before workers are needed.\n       Rationale: In many agricultural operations, 60 days is too \n     far in advance to be able to predict labor needs with the \n     precision required in H-2A applications. Furthermore, \n     virtually all referrals of U.S. workers who actually report \n     for work are made close to the date of need. The advance \n     application period serves little purpose except to provide \n     time for litigation.\n       2. In lieu of the present certification letter, DOL would \n     issue the employer a domestic recruitment report indicating \n     that the employer's job offer meets the statutory criteria \n     (or the specific deficiencies in the order) and the number of \n     U.S. workers referred, per #3 below. The employer would file \n     a petition with INS for admission of aliens (or transfer of \n     aliens already in the United States), including a copy of \n     DOL's domestic recruitment report and any countervailing \n     evidence concerning the adequacy of the job offer and/or the \n     availability of U.S. workers. The Attorney General would make \n     the admission decision.\n       Rationale: The purpose is to restore the role of the Labor \n     Department to that of giving advice to the AG on labor \n     availability, and return the true gatekeeper role to the AG. \n     Presently the certification letter is, de facto, the \n     admission decision.\n       3. DOL provides employer with a domestic recruitment report \n     not later than 20 days before the date of need stating either \n     that sufficient domestic workers are not available, or giving \n     the names and Social Security Numbers of the able, willing \n     and qualified workers who have been referred to the employer \n     and who have agreed to be available at the time and place \n     needed. DOL also provides a means for the employer to contact \n     the referred worker to confirm availability close to the date \n     of need. DOL would be empowered to issue a report that \n     sufficient domestic workers are not available without waiting \n     until 20 days before the date of need for workers if there \n     are already unfilled orders for workers in the same or \n     similar occupations in the same area of intended employment.\n       Rationale: DOL now denies certification not only on the \n     basis of workers actually referred to the employer, but also \n     on the basis of reports or suppositions that unspecified \n     numbers of workers may become available. These suppositions \n     almost never prove correct, forcing the employer into costly \n     and time wasting redeterminations on or close to the date of \n     need and delaying the arrival of workers. The proposed change \n     would assure that only workers actually identified as \n     available would be the basis for denying foreign workers. DOL \n     also interprets the existing statutory language as precluding \n     it from issuing each labor certification until 20 days before \n     the date of need, even in situations where ongoing \n     recruitment shows that sufficient workers are not available.\n       4. INS to provide expedited processing of employer's \n     petitions, and, if approved, notify the visa issuing \n     consulate or port of entry within 15 calendar days.\n       Rationale: The assure timely admission decisions.\n       5. INS to provide an expedited procedures for amending \n     petitions to increase the number of workers admitted (or \n     transferred) on or after 5 days before the date of need, to \n     replace referred workers whose continued availability can not \n     be confirmed, who fail to report on the date of need, or who \n     abandon employment or are terminated for cause, without first \n     obtaining a redetermination of need from DOL.\n       Rationale: To reduce the paperwork and increase the \n     timeliness of obtaining needed workers very close to or after \n     the work has started.\n       6. DOL would continue to recruit domestic workers and make \n     referrals to employers until 5 days before the date of need. \n     Employers would be required to give preference to able, \n     willing and qualified workers who agree to be available at \n     the time and place needed who are referred to the employer \n     until 5 days before the date workers are needed. After that \n     time, employers would be required to give preference to U.S. \n     workers who are immediately available in filling job \n     opportunities that become available, but would not be \n     required to bump alien workers already employed.\n       Rationale: A method is needed to allow the employer at a \n     date-certain close to the date of need to complete his \n     hiring, and to operate without having the operation disrupted \n     by having to displace existing workers with new workers.\n       7. Create a ``bounded definition'' of adverse effect by \n     enumerating the specific obligations of employers in \n     occupations in which H-2A aliens are employed. The proposed \n     definition would define jobs that meet the following criteria \n     as not adversely affecting U.S. workers:\n       7a. Offer at least the median rate of pay for the \n     occupation in the area of intended employment.\n       7b. Provide approved housing or, if sufficient housing is \n     available in the approximate area of employment, a reasonable \n     housing allowance, to workers whose permanent place of \n     residence is beyond normal commuting distance.\n       NOTE: Provision should also be made to allow temporary \n     housing that does not meet the full set of Federal standards \n     for a transitional period in areas where sufficient housing \n     that meets standards is not presently available, and for such \n     temporary housing on a permanent basis in occupations in \n     which the term of employment is very short (e.g. cherry \n     harvesting, which lasts about 15-20 days) if sufficient \n     housing that meets the full standards is not available. \n     Federal law should pre-empt state and local laws and codes \n     with respect to the provision of such temporary housing.\n       7c. Current transportation reimbursement requirements (i.e. \n     employer reimburses transportation of workers who complete 50 \n     percent of the work contract and provides or pays for return \n     transportation for workers who complete the entire work \n     contract).\n       7d. A guarantee of employment for at least three-quarters \n     of the anticipated hours of work during the actual period of \n     employment.\n       7e. Employer-provided Workers' Compensation or equivalent.\n       7f. Employer must comply with all applicable federal, state \n     and local labor laws with respect to both U.S. and alien \n     workers.\n       Rationale: The objective is to eliminate the discretion of \n     DOL to specify terms and conditions of employment on a case-\n     by-case basis and reduce the scope for litigation of \n     applications. Employers (and the courts) would know with \n     particularity, up front, what the required terms and \n     conditions of employment are. The definition also reduces the \n     cost premium for participating in the program by relating the \n     Adverse Effect Wage Rate to the minimum wage and limiting the \n     applicability of the three-quarters guarantee to the actual \n     period of employment.\n       8. Provide that workers must exhaust administrative \n     remedies before engaging their employers in litigation.\n       Rationale: To reduce litigation costs.\n       9. Provide that if an employer complies with the terms of \n     an approved job order, and DOL or a court later orders a \n     provision to be changed, the employer would be required to \n     comply with the new provision only prospectively.\n       Rationale: To reduce the exposure of employers to \n     litigation seeking to overturn DOL's approval of job orders, \n     and to retroactive liability if an approved order is \n     changed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself and Mr. Simpson):\n  S. 2176. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nSocial Security Act to provide for personal investment plans funded by \nemployee security payroll deductions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE PERSONAL INVESTMENT PLAN ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in May 1995, it was my distinct pleasure \nto join the fine, distinguished Senator from Wyoming, the Honorable \nAlan K. Simpson, to introduce the Kerrey-Simpson Retirement Reform \nbills. The intent of this series of eight bills has two important \ngoals: Put Social Security and other Federal retirement programs on the \npath to long term fiscal health; and renew America's commitment to \nnational savings.\n  Today, I rise with Senator Simpson to reintroduce two of these bills, \nS.824 and S.825, for the purpose of offering technical changes.\n  Specifically, it was our original intent to permit contributors to a \npersonal investment plan to pass the balance of such plan to their \nsurviving spouse upon their death, except if the surviving spouse \nagrees in writing that such balance should be transferred to a \ndesignated beneficiary, such as child or sibling. Our intent was to \nprovide the contributor with the greatest amount of flexibility in his/\nher estate planning, while at the same time recognizing the \nvulnerability of a surviving spouse.\n  The second technical correction would require that in the event of \nthe contributor's death where there is no surviving spouse and there \nhas been no designation of a beneficiary of the proceeds of the \npersonal investment plan, the proceeds should revert to the deceased's \nestate, not to the Social Security trust fund. It was our original \nintent to allow contributors to retain ownership of their personal \ninvestment plan, even after death.\n  The third technical correction would permit financial institutions--\nin addition to banks--to administer personal\n\n[[Page S11991]]\n\ninvestment plans. It was our original intent to permit personal \ninvestment plans to be administered by the identical institutions \npermitted to administer individual retirement accounts.\n  Finally, technical corrections are made to S.825 to adjust certain \ndates in the formula for determining benefits to our original intent.\n  As these changes are technical in nature, we have been assured by the \nactuaries of the Social Security Administration that such changes \nshould have no effect on the solvency of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Finally, I would like to add what a joy and pleasure it has been to \nwork with my good friend from Wyoming. His leadership and candidness on \nthis issue will be sorely missed. But more importantly, Mr. President, \nthe character and leadership of Alan K. Simpson as a Senator, \ncolleague, and friend will be equally difficult to replace in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I wish him all the best in whatever his fine future holds, and I \nexpect he will continue to fight the good fight on this matter of \ncritical importance to our Nation's fiscal future.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, on May 18, 1995, I joined my able and \nsteady colleague Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska in introducing a \nseries of eight bills to address the long-term problems of Social \nSecurity. I rise today to join Senator Kerrey in reintroducing two \nbills, S. 824 and S. 825, which address the long-term solvency problems \nof the Social Security Program. The changes that Senator Kerrey and I \npropose are technical in nature and are made in both S. 824 and S. 825 \nunless otherwise indicated.\n  Specifically, it was our original intent to permit contributors on a \nPersonal Investment Plan [PIP] to pass the balance of such plan to \ntheir surviving spouse upon their death, except if the surviving spouse \nagrees in writing that such balance should be transferred to a \ndesignated beneficiary, such as a child or sibling. Our intent was to \nprovide the contributor with the greatest possible flexibility in his \nor her estate planning, while at the same time recognizing the \nvulnerability of a surviving spouse.\n  The second technical correction would require that in the event of \nthe contributor's death where there is no surviving spouse and there \nhas been no designation of a beneficiary of the proceeds of the \npersonal investment plan, the proceeds should revert to the deceased's \nestate, not to the Social Security trust fund. It was our original \nintent to allow contributors to retain ownership of their personal \ninvestment plan, even after death.\n  The third technical correction would permit financial institutions, \nin addition to banks, to administer personal investment plans. It was \nour original intent to permit personal investment plans to be \nadministered by the identical institutions that were permitted to \nadminister individual retirement accounts.\n  Finally, technical corrections are made to S. 825 to conform to our \noriginal intent adjustments in the formula for determining benefits to \nour original intent.\n  As these changes are technical in nature, we have been assured by the \nactuaries of the Social Security Administration that such changes \nshould have no effect on the present solvency of the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n\n  S. 2177.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nallow for additional deferred effective dates for approval of \napplications under the new drugs provisions, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              the better pharmaceuticals for children act\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Better \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act. This bill will create a new \npartnership among pharmaceutical researchers and manufacturers, \npediatric researchers, and the government to improve the information \nabout pediatric uses of pharmaceuticals. The provisions of this bill \nwere originally included in S. 1477, the Food and Drug Administration \n[FDA] Performance and Accountability Act, which was approved in March, \nwith bipartisan support, by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires a showing of safety and \neffectiveness before drugs can be marketed to the American public. \nUntil recently, it was thought that such a showing would be the same \nfor adults and children. It is now clear, however, that children are \nnot small adults. They do not necessarily react to drugs the same way. \nNew data are necessary to ensure that America's children have the same \nbenefit of safe and effective drugs as our adults do. As it stands now, \nhowever, 80 percent of the drugs taken by children are not labelled for \npediatric use.\n  The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act addresses this need for \npediatric use data by providing an incentive to manufacturers to \nconduct pediatric studies for new and approved drugs. Manufacturers who \nprovide pediatric data for the drugs most urgently needed by our \nchildren would receive an extra six months market exclusivity for their \nproduct. By taking this type of partnership approach, we can get \ncritically needed information on pediatric uses. Providing the FDA with \nthe extra authority to offer this type of encouragement will help to \nensure that companies conduct such studies.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is \nrequired to develop, in consultation with pediatric experts, a list of \napproved drugs for which additional pediatric information may produce \nhealth benefits in the pediatric population. For pediatric studies of \nnew and approved drugs to trigger the six-month exclusivity incentive, \nthey must be formally requested by the Secretary, and filed with the \nSecretary in an acceptable manner. Manufacturers would be precluded \nfrom obtaining more than one six-month period of exclusivity.\n  I am proud to join with Senators Kennedy, Dodd, DeWine, Mikulski, and \nSimon in introducing this bill. Mr. President, it creates a win-win \nsituation in which manufacturers get a benefit for proactively testing \ndrugs for pediatric use, while our children get timely access to the \nsafe and effective drugs they so desperately need.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor, again, of \nthe Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. I have cosponsored this \nlegislation in several Congresses now, and hope that finally, we will \npass this enormously important legislation.\n  This act would address a problem that pediatricians first recognized \nmore than 30 years ago: information about safe and effective therapies \nfor their young patients is scarce. According to the American Academy \nof Pediatrics only about one-fifth of all drugs marketed in the United \nStates today, and only four of the 25 new drugs approved by the FDA \nlast year, have been labeled for use by children.\n  Given this largely adults-only drug market, individual doctors face \nan uncomfortable dilemma with many of their child patients. Should \ndoctors limit themselves to the handful of proven pediatric drugs? Some \nmight not even exist for certain illnesses, and in such cases this \ncould mean not treating a sick child. Or should they take a gamble on \nan adult drug and rely on their training, professional judgment, and \nluck to make it work as intended?\n  Most physicians find the latter option, known as ``off-label \nprescribing,'' to be the more acceptable choice. As a result, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics says that off-label prescribing has ``by \ndefault become an established standard of care of children.''\n  This practice is neither illegal nor improper, but it can present \nunnecessary risk for young patients. Children are not just smaller than \nadults. Their bodies function very differently from adults. And as any \nparent can tell you, they change drastically from infancy to childhood \nto adolescence. For young, growing patients, the only way to be sure \nwhether a medication is safe and effective, and what the dosage should \nbe, is the test it on different age groups.\n  The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act is a straightforward \nsolution to the unnecessary shortage of pediatric medicine. It grants \nan additional 6 months of market exclusivity for drugs which have \nundergone pediatric studies according to accepted scientific protocols. \nThis provides a fair and reasonable market incentive for drug companies \nto make the extra effort needed to label their products for use by \nchildren.\n  Simply put, this bill is a sensible way to keep our children \nhealthier. That is why it has enjoyed broad bipartisan support, both \ninside and outside this body. In addition to the American Academy of \nPediatrics, other supporters include the Pharmaceuticals Research and \nManufacturers of America, and the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this act.\n  By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2179. A bill to protect children and other vulnerable \nsubpopulations from exposure to certain environmental pollutants, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            Children's Environmental Protection Act of 1996\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill that \nwill help protect the children of this country from the harmful effects \nof environmental pollutants including pesticides and other hazardous \nsubstances.\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have \nworked to protect children and other vulnerable subpopulations from \ncontaminants in drinking water. The Safe Drinking Water Act that was \nrecently signed into law by President Clinton included my amendments to \nrequire that Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] drinking water \nstandards be set at levels that take into account the special \nvulnerability of our children, our infants, pregnant women, our \nelderly, the chronically ill, and other groups that are at \nsubstantially higher risk than the average healthy adult. That was a \nvery important step forward because our safe drinking water standards--\nand, in fact, most of our country's public protection standards--are \nset at levels to protect the average healthy person, and not our most \nvulnerable loved ones.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Children's Environmental \nProtection Act [CEPA], carries the concept of my Safe Drinking Water \nAct amendments even further. It requires the EPA to set all health and \nsafety standards at levels that protect our children and our vulnerable \nsubpopulations.\n  Mr. President, this is a much needed step forward because science \ntells us that children are not simply smaller versions of adults. \nRecent studies by the National Academy of Sciences found that children \nare more vulnerable to the chemical hazards in the environment for two \nprincipal main reasons. First, children eat more food, drink more \nwater, and breath more air as a percentage of their body weight than \nadults. As a consequence, they are more exposed to the chemicals \npresent in food, water and air. Second, because children are still \ngrowing and many of their internal systems are still in the process of \ndeveloping and maturing, children may be physiologically more \nsusceptible than adults to the hazards associated with these exposures.\n  Today, there are more questions than ever with respect to children's \ndevelopmental health. For example, it has been estimated that up to one \nhalf of a person's lifetime cancer risk may be incurred in the first \nsix years of life, but current science cannot tell us exactly where and \nhow children are exposed to cancer risks in the environment.\n  Unfortunately, while we have many questions, we have very few \nanswers. It is clear that the factors behind the special environmental \nrisks that children face need immediate special attention.\n\n  If the EPA is to be able to fulfill a mandate to set all of its \nstandards to protect our children, it must collect more data and carry \nout more research to improve our understanding of how children are \nexposed to environmental pollutants, where they are exposed, and how \nthe exposure may affect their health. My bill would require the EPA to \nwork with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to develop and implement research studies to examine the \nphysiological and pharmacokinetic effects of environmental pollutants \non children and other vulnerable subpopulations. It also requires \nresearch on children's dietary, dermal and inhalation exposure to \nenvironmental pollutants.\n  Mr. President, CEPA would also institute measures that would help \nprotect our children from coming into contact with environmental \npollutants including pesticides and other hazardous substances. First, \nmy bill includes a family-right-to-know initiative to be adopted by \nevery State. The principle behind the initiative is that public health \nand safety depends on citizens being aware of the toxic dangers that \nexist in their communities and neighborhoods. We must provide basic \ninformation to parents to give them the ability to make informed \ndecisions to protect their family.\n  The Children's Environmental Protection Act would require users who \napply pesticides and other hazardous substances in public areas that \nare reasonably accessible to children, to keep a record of the amount \nof chemical used, where it was applied and when it was applied. States \nwould provide the public with copies of annual reports summarizing the \ninformation. The reports would also be available on the Internet. \nDetailed information such as information on a particular school would \nbe available to the public upon request. The EPA would complete a \nnationwide survey every two years and make the information available to \nthe public in written form and on the Internet. So both scientists and \nparents would have information about to what extent children are being \nexposed in public areas such as school, parks, playgrounds, shopping \nmalls, and movie theaters.\n  CEPA takes a further step in the case of schools and parks by \nrequiring that the EPA identify a list of most dangerous commonly used \nhazardous substances and pesticides--and within one year prohibit their \nuse.\n  I would like to pay tribute to one exceptional mother. This mother \nknows the intense sadness of losing her child. This very special mother \nlives in my State and I am proud to call her my friend. Three years \nago, Mrs. Nancy Chuda came to visit me to ask for help. Her little \ngirl, all of 5 years old, had died of a nongenetic form of cancer. No \none knows why or how or what caused little Colette Chuda to become \nafflicted. She was a normal, beautiful girl in every way. She liked to \ndraw pictures of flowers and happy people. One thing is certain, she \nwas blessed to have two wonderful parents. Nancy and Jim Chuda, despite \ntheir grief, chose to turn their own personal tragedy into something \npositive. They have labored endlessly to bring to the country's \nattention the environmental dangers that threaten our children. If \nfuture illness and death can be prevented, I know we all will be \nindebted to the tremendous energy and perseverance of Nancy Chuda.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this title.''.\n       By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n\n  S. 2180. A bill to establish felony violations for the failure to pay \nlegal child support obligations and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              THE DEADBEAT PARENTS PUNISHMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Deadbeat Parents Punishment \nAct of 1996. Along with Senator Shelby and Congressmen Hyde and \nSchumer, I introduced the original Child Support Recovery Act in 1992, \nand today I am pleased to introduce a bill that will toughen the \noriginal legislation to ensure that more serious crimes receive more \nserious punishment. In so doing, we can send a clear message to \ndeadbeat dads--and moms: ignore the law, ignore your responsibilities, \nand you will pay a high price; that is, pay up or go to jail.\n  Current law already makes it a Federal offense to willfully fail to \npay child support obligations to a child in another State if the \nobligation has remained unpaid for longer than a year or is greater \nthan $5,000. However, current law provides for a maximum of just 6 \nmonths in prison for a first offense, and a maximum of 2 years for a \nsecond offense.\n  Police officers and prosecutors have used the current law \neffectively, but they have found that these penalties do not adequately \ndeal with more serious cases--those deadbeat parents who deliberately \nignore or evade the law. These are cases in which parents move from \nState to State to intentionally evade child support penalties, or fail \nto pay child support obligations for more than 2 years--serious cases \nthat deserve serious punishment. In response to these concerns, \nPresident Clinton has drafted legislation that would address this \nproblem, and I am pleased to introduce it today.\n  This new effort builds on past successes achieved through bipartisan \nwork. In the 4 years since the original deadbeat parents legislation \nwas signed into law by President Bush, collections have increased by \nnearly 50 percent, from $8 billion to $11.8 billion, and we should be \nproud of that increase. Moreover, a new national database has helped \nidentify 60,000 delinquent fathers, over half of whom owed money to \nwomen on welfare.\n  Nevertheless, there is much more we can do. It has been estimated \nthat if delinquent parents fully paid up their child support, \napproximately 800,000 women and children could be taken off the welfare \nrolls. Our legislation cracks down on the worst violators, and makes \nclear that intentional or long-term evasion of child support \nresponsibilities will not receive a slap on the wrist. In so doing, it \nwill help us continue the fight to ensure that every child receives the \nparental support they deserve.\n  Mr. President, we introduce this measure today, at the end of the \nsession, in order to provide an opportunity for review in the coming \nmonths. But when we return for the 105th Congress, it will be one of my \nhighest priorities. So I look forward to working with my colleagues to \ngive police and prosecutors the tools they need to effectively pursue \nindividuals who seek to avoid their family obligations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The Child Support Recovery Amendments Act of 1996 amends \n     the current criminal statute regarding the failure to pay \n     legal child support obligations, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 228, to \n     create felony violations for egregious offenses. Current law \n     makes it a federal offense willfully to fail to pay a child \n     support obligation with respect to a child who lives in \n     another State if the obligation has remained unpaid for \n     longer than a year or its greater than $5,000. A first \n     offense is subject to a maximum of six months of \n     imprisonment, and a second or subsequent offense to a maximum \n     of two years.\n       The bill addresses the law enforcement and prosecutorial \n     concern that the current statute does not adequately address \n     more serious instances of nonpayment of support obligations. \n     A maximum term of imprisonment of just six months does not \n     meet the sentencing goals of punishment and deterrence. \n     Egregious offenses, such as those involving parents who move \n     from State-to-State to evade child support payments, require \n     more severe penalties.\n       Section 2 of the bill creates two new categories of felony \n     offenses, subject to a two-year maximum prison term. These \n     are: (1) traveling in interstate or foreign commerce with the \n     intent to evade a support obligation if the obligation has \n     remained unpaid for a period longer than one year or is \n     greater than $5,000; and (2) willfully failing to pay a \n     support obligation regarding a child residing in another \n     State, if the obligation has remained unpaid for a period \n     longer than two years or is greater than $10,000. These \n     offenses, proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 228(a) (2) and (3); \n     indicate a level of culpability greater than that reflected \n     by the current six-month maximum prison term for a first \n     offense. The level of culpability demonstrated by offenders \n     who commit the offenses described in these provisions is akin \n     to that demonstrated by repeat offenders under current law, \n     who are subject to a maximum two-year prison term.\n       Proposed section 228(b) of title 18, United States Code, \n     states that the existence of a support obligation in effect \n     for the time period charged in the indictment or information \n     creates a rebuttable presumption that the obligor has the \n     ability to pay the support obligation for that period. \n     Although ``ability to pay'' is not an element of the offense, \n     a demonstration of the obligor's ability to pay contributes \n     to a showing of willful failure to pay the known obligation. \n     The presumption in favor of ability to pay is needed because \n     proof that the obligor is earning or acquiring income or \n     assets is difficult. Child support offenders are notorious \n     for hiding assets and failing to document earnings. A \n     presumption of ability to pay, based on the existence of a \n     support obligation determined under State law, is useful in a \n     jury's determination of whether the nonpayment was willful. \n     An offender who lacks the ability to pay a support obligation \n     due to legitimate, changed circumstances occurring after the \n     issuance of a support order has civil means available to \n     reduce the support obligation and thereby avoid violation \n     of the federal criminal statute in the first instance. In \n     addition, the presumption of ability to pay set forth in \n     the bill is rebuttable; a defendant can put forth evidence \n     of his or her inability to pay.\n       The reference to mandatory restitution in proposed section \n     228(d) of title 18, United States Code, amends the current \n     restitution requirement in section 228(c). The amendment \n     conforms the restitution citation to the new mandatory \n     restitution provision of federal law, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3663A, \n     enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \n     Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, section 204. This change \n     simply clarifies the applicability of that statute to the \n     offense of failure to pay legal child support obligations.\n       For all of the violations set forth in proposed subsection \n     (a) of section 228, the requirement of the existence of a \n     State determination regarding the support obligation is the \n     same as under current law. Under proposed subsection (e)(1), \n     as under current subsection (d)(1)(A), the government must \n     show that the support obligation is an amount determined \n     under a court order or an order of a administrative process \n     pursuant to the law of a State to be due from a person for \n     the support and maintenance of a child or of a child and the \n     parent with whom the child is living.\n       Proposed subsection (e)(2) of section 228 amends the \n     definition of ``State,'' currently in subsection (d)(2), to \n     clarify that prosecutions may be brought under this statute \n     in a commonwealth, such as Puerto Rico. The current \n     definition of ``State'' in section 228, which includes \n     possessions and territories of the United States, does not \n     include commonwealths.\n  By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 2181. A bill to provide for more effective management of the \nNational Grasslands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   NATIONAL GRASSLANDS MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nGrasslands Management Act. This bill applies to the grasslands in North \nDakota and half a dozen other States. I want to explain briefly what \nthe objective of this bill is and how it came about.\n  For several years, the ranchers in western North Dakota have been \nasking for a less cumbersome approach to management of the grasslands \nand in North Dakota, both Chambers of the 1995 legislature passed a \nresolution unanimously asking for change on the grasslands as well.\n\n[[Page S11996]]\n\n  The current regulatory regime is cumbersome mainly because the Forest \nService must manage the grasslands under the same framework as it does \nthe rest of the National Forest System. It doesn't handle efficiently \nthe day-to-day problems of the ranchers and grazing associations. For \nexample, ranchers have had to wait for as long as 2 to 3 years to get \napproval for a stock tank because of the labyrinth of regulations that \nthe Forest Service overlays on the management of the grasslands. This \nlegislation will change that by removing the national grasslands from \nthe National Forest System and creating a new structure of rules \nspecifically suited to the grasslands and their environment.\n  However, it is not only the ranchers needs that I am attempting to \naddress. There is a broad range of uses on the public lands which must \nbe protected. All hunting, fishing and recreational activities will \ncontinue as before and environmental protections will continue to be in \nplace. Further, it is my intention that the public must be involved in \nthe decision making process as these new rules are implemented. Only by \nworking together can we solve the problems on the grasslands.\n  Several environmental groups and interested citizens have expressed \nconcern that this bill, which was originally incorporated as part of a \nlarger grazing package, would make grazing the dominant use of the \npublic lands at the expense of other uses and some have expressed \nconcern that this bill would prohibit hunting and fishing, end the \nmultiple use of the national grasslands, turn over the management of \nthe Grasslands to the ranchers and disconnect the grasslands from \nenvironmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air \nAct, and the Clean Water Act.\n  These concerns are unfounded. I have worked diligently with the \nranchers, environmentalists, and other recreational users of the \ngrasslands to ensure that further misinterpretation is not possible. \nThe result of that work is the National Grasslands Management Act that \nI am introducing today.\n  The legislation explicitly states that there will be no diminished \nhunting or fishing opportunities, that all applicable environmental \nlaws will apply to those lands, and that the grasslands will be managed \nunder a multiple use policy. The bill directs the Secretary to \npromulgate regulations which promote the efficient administration of \nlivestock agriculture and provide environmental protections equivalent \nto that of the National Forest System.\n  In short, I believe that the National Grasslands Management Act is a \nsolid piece of legislation that will make the administration of the \nGrasslands more responsive to the people who live there, without \ndiminishing the rights and opportunities of other multiple users of \nthis public land.\n  By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 2182. A bill to consolidate certain mineral interests in the \nNational Grasslands in Billings County, North Dakota, through the \nexchange of Federal and private mineral interests to enhance land \nmanagement capabilities and environmental and wildlife protection, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  MINERAL RIGHTS EXCHANGE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator Kent Conrad, \nam introducing a bill that will facilitate a mineral exchange in \nWestern North Dakota. The purpose of this mineral exchange is to \nconsolidate certain mineral estates of both the U.S. Forest Service and \nBurlington Resources, formerly known as Meridian Oil. This \nconsolidation will produce tangible benefits to an economically \ndistressed region in North Dakota and also protect environmentally \nsensitive areas.\n  For years, the land and mineral ownership pattern in Western North \nDakota has been extremely fragmented. In many cases the Forest Service \nowns and manages the surface land while private parties, such as \nBurlington Resources, own the subsurface mineral estates. This \nfragmentation has not only frustrated the management objectives of the \nForest Service, it has also inhibited mineral exploration and \ndevelopment.\n  By consolidating the mineral estates, the Forest Service will have \nthe opportunity to protect the viewshed along the Little Missouri \nRiver, creating a more attractive hunting, fishing and hiking area. \nFurther, the mineral exchange will protect certain bighorn sheep \ncalving areas. The Forest Service and Burlington have already signed a \nMemorandum of Understanding which will aid in the protection of \nwildlife and wildlife habitat after the exchange is concluded. The \nexchange is also supported by all major environmental groups in the \nState, the Governor of North Dakota, and the Bureau of Land \nManagement's Dakotas Resource Advisory Council.\n  Burlington Resources supports this legislation. Burlington will have \nbetter opportunities for mineral exploration and development within \ntheir consolidated mineral estates. This increased development will \nbenefit not only Burlington, but also Billings County and the State of \nNorth Dakota through increased tax revenue..\n  One point that I would like to make clear is that this mineral \nexchange should in no way be seen as affecting the multiple uses of the \nland. Current multiple uses, such as recreation, livestock grazing, \nwatershed protection or fish and wildlife purposes, will continue as \nbefore.\n  I would also like to point out that this mineral exchange is not \nmeant as a preamble to--or a substitute for--a designation of this area \nas wilderness. I do not favor the designation of wilderness within \nBillings County.\n  May I further underscore that this mineral exchange costs the U.S. \ntaxpayer nothing. The bill provides for an exchange of about the same \nnumber of acres with equivalent monetary values. Yet, this no-cost \ntransaction will yield substantial economic, environmental, and \nmanagement dividends.\n  It is my hope that this mineral exchange will address some of the \ndifficult land use questions in this area. It will accomplish a number \nof objectives. It will protect certain environmentally sensitive and \nscenic areas from development and I think that is important in these \nunique circumstances. It will also consolidate mineral holdings so that \nmore orderly and predictable development will occur where development \nis feasible and appropriate. And, as I noted before, it will preserve a \nmultiple use framework for managing these lands so that grazing and \nother activities are not otherwise affected by this legislation.\n  Further, it does not rely on the Government imposing a solution. \nRather, this voluntary agreement embodies a consensus reached between \nthe affected parties, the mineral holders, the State and its citizens, \nthe environmental organizations, and the United States Forest Service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the Governor of \nNorth Dakota, the Dakotas Resource Council and the Sierra Club, and the \nMemorandum of Understanding signed by the Forest Service and Burlington \nResources be printed in the Record in order to aid my colleagues in \ntheir deliberations on the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        State of North Dakota,\n\n                                       Bismark, ND, July 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The State of North Dakota supports the \n     introduction of a bill which would implement a proposed \n     mineral exchange between the United States Forest Service and \n     Meridian Oil, Inc. This effort will advance our ``2020'' \n     program to plan and implement sound management of the \n     Badlands well into the future.\n       Current land and mineral ownership patterns in the Bullion \n     Butte and Ponderosa Pine areas of the Little Missouri \n     National Grasslands are fragmented, thereby complicating \n     management of surface and mineral resources.\n       The proposed exchange is an opportunity to consolidate \n     ownership, enhance natural badlands habitat adjacent to the \n     Little Missouri River and facilitate mineral development \n     while reducing conflict by competing activities.\n       Finally, I have included a summary describing more \n     completely, the intended exchange and its effect.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Edward T. Schafer,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Legislation To Effect an Exchange of Mineral Rights in the Little \n               Missouri National Grasslands, Billings, ND\n\n       For over a decade, the United States Forest Service (USFS) \n     and Meridian Oil, Inc. (Meridian) have been considering a \n     possible exchange of oil and gas rights in the Bullion\n\n[[Page S11997]]\n\n     Butte and Ponderosa Pine areas of the Little Missouri \n     National Grasslands in North Dakota. The land ownership \n     pattern in those areas is very fragmented, with both federal \n     and privately owned mineral rights and federal surface and \n     private subsurface estates. This lack of unity between the \n     surface and subsurface estates and intermixture of public and \n     private mineral rights have complicated both effective \n     management of surface resource values and efficient \n     extraction of minerals. The USFS views an exchange to \n     consolidate mineral ownerships as an opportunity to protect \n     bighorn sheep and their habitat and the viewshed in the \n     Little Missouri River corridor. Meridian expects an exchange \n     to facilitate exploration for and development of oil and gas \n     by reducing the conflict such activities would have with \n     other sensitive Grasslands resources.\n       At the urging of Senator Dorgan and Governor Schafer, the \n     USFS and Meridian reached an agreement last year on an \n     exchange of certain federal and private mineral rights and \n     the imposition of certain constraints on Meridian oil and gas \n     activities. The agreement would be implemented by this \n     legislation.\n       What the legislation does. The legislation would accomplish \n     the following:\n       Direct the completion of the transfer of Meridian's mineral \n     rights in approximately 9,582 acres to the USFS for federal \n     oil and gas rights in 8,796 acres, all in Billings County, \n     North Dakota, within 45 days of enactment.\n       Authorize the exchange of any other private mineral rights \n     in the same area for federal mineral rights within 6 months \n     of enactment.\n       Deem the mineral rights to be transferred in the USFS/\n     Meridian exchange to be of equal value (since the two parties \n     have already negotiated the exchange and are of the informed \n     opinion that the values are equivalent) and require that the \n     other mineral rights to be transferred be of approximately \n     equal value.\n       Require Meridian, as a condition for the exchange, to \n     secure release of any leasehold or other contractual rights \n     that may have been established on the Meridian oil and gas \n     interests that will be exchanged.\n       Assure Meridian that it will have access across federal \n     lands to be able, subject to applicable federal and State \n     laws, to explore for and develop oil and gas on the interests \n     it will receive in the exchange and that it will have the \n     same surface occupancy and use rights on the interests it \n     will receive that it now holds on the interests to be \n     surrendered.\n       Find that the USFS/Meridian exchange meets the requirements \n     of other federal exchange, environmental, and cultural laws \n     that would apply if the exchange were to be processed without \n     Congressional approval and direction.\n       Assure that no provision of the legislation can be \n     interpreted to limit, restrict, or otherwise affect the \n     application of the principle of multiple use (including such \n     uses as hunting, fishing, grazing and recreation) in the \n     Grasslands.\n       In addition to facilitating the exchange, the legislation \n     would memorialize a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) also \n     negotiated and executed by the USFS and Meridian concerning \n     management of certain Meridian oil and gas properties that \n     will remain in Grasslands' areas with high surface resource \n     values. In particular the MOU, adopted by reference in the \n     legislation, obligates Meridian to make its best efforts to \n     locate any oil and gas facilities and installations outside \n     of the \\1/4\\ mile view corridor on either side of the stretch \n     of the Little Missouri River being considered for designation \n     as a Wild and Scenic River and to access certain other \n     property adjacent to an important bighorn sheep lambing area \n     only by directional drilling.\n       Equally important is what the legislation does not do:\n       It does not increase the amount of surface which the USFS \n     controls. The USFS currently controls the surface on \n     essentially all the land involved in the exchange, and this \n     will not change since only mineral interests will be \n     transferred.\n       It does not decrease the federal land available for oil and \n     gas development. To the contrary, in the exchange the federal \n     government will receive a net gain of almost 800 acres in \n     mineral rights that may be leased for exploration and \n     development by other parties. And, by consolidating federal \n     mineral rights which now are scattered in a checkerboard \n     pattern, access to them should be improved. The extent to \n     which existing and new federal mineral rights are leased to \n     private parties will be decided by the USFS in the ongoing \n     planning and Environmental Impact Statement for the Southern \n     Little Missouri Grasslands. The ``multiple use'' provision of \n     the legislation makes certain the legislation will not affect \n     that decisionmaking process.\n       It does not decrease revenue to the county, state, and \n     federal governments. For the same reason that the exchange \n     would not decrease land available for oil and gas \n     development, the economic interests of taxing entities and \n     the oil and gas industry should not be affected significantly \n     by the exchange. In fact, with Meridian consolidating its \n     mineral holdings in a more manageable and less sensitive \n     unit, area oil and gas activity should increase and produce a \n     net positive economic effect.\n       It does not provide either Meridian or USFS with mineral \n     rights of greater value than those they now hold. The USFS \n     with the assistance of the Bureau of Land Management, has \n     reached the conclusion that the mineral rights to be \n     exchanged between the USFS and Meridian are of equal value. \n     Some additional value will accrue to both sets of mineral \n     rights transferred by the exchange because of the greater \n     ease of access and management that will result from \n     consolidation. The legislation requires that any other \n     mineral rights exchanged by other parties under the \n     legislation be of approximately equal value.\n       It does not resolve the issue of wilderness designation. \n     Some parties desire wilderness protection for the area. Other \n     parties, including Meridian, oppose wilderness designation, \n     and the USFS has not indicated any intent to establish a \n     wilderness. The legislation would not increase, or decrease, \n     the prospect for wilderness designation since wilderness may \n     be designated whether the mineral rights are privately or \n     publicly owned, the designation can only be accomplished by a \n     separate Act of Congress, and the legislation's ``multiple \n     use'' language makes clear the intent of Congress that the \n     exchange is not intended to affect the wilderness issue.\n\n\n                            Dakotas Resource Advisory Council,\n\n                                Dickinson, ND, September 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Ed Schafer,\n     Governor of North Dakota, State Capitol, Bismarck, ND.\n       Dear Governor Schafer: The Dakota Resource Advisory Council \n     (RAC), a 12-member body appointed by the Secretary of the \n     Interior, represents users of public lands in North and South \n     Dakota. The RAC provides opportunities for meaningful public \n     participation in land management decisions at the district \n     level and encourages conflict resolution among various \n     interest groups.\n       At our meeting in Dickinson, North Dakota on September 9, \n     1996, the RAC reviewed and discussed the Meridian Mineral \n     Exchange that you have been considering. After careful review \n     by our RAC, a resolution was passed indicating our support \n     for legislative to allow the Meridian Mineral Exchange to be \n     completed by the Bureau of Land Management.\n       Since there is considerable activity in this area, there is \n     a definite urgency to move this legislation in the remaining \n     of this Congress. The Dakota RAC respectfully requests the \n     introduction and passage of legislation of the Meridian \n     Mineral Exchange.\n       If we can be of further assistance to your efforts in this \n     regard, we are most willing to help. District Manager, Doug \n     Burger, has more details with respect to the exchange and we \n     have asked him to assist you.\n       Thank you for considering the recommendations of the Dakota \n     RAC.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Trimmer,\n     Chair, Dakota RAC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Memorandum of Understanding\n\n       The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between Meridian \n     Oil Inc. (Meridian) with offices in Englewood, Colorado and \n     the U.S. Forest Service, Custer National Forest (Forest \n     Service).\n       The intent of the MOU is to set forth agreement regarding \n     development of certain oil and gas interests beneath Federal \n     surface. This MOU is in addition to, and does not abrogate, \n     any rights the United States otherwise has to regulate \n     activities on the Federal surface estate or any rights \n     Meridian otherwise has to develop the oil and gas interest \n     conveyed.\n       The provisions of this MOU shall apply to the successors \n     and assigns of Meridian.\n       The MOU may be amended by written agreement of the parties.\n       Section A.

Includes \n     the following land (Subject Lands) in Township 137N., Range \n     102W.:\n       Section 3: Lots 6, 7, 9-12, 14-17 (+) River Bottom 54.7 \n     acres\n       Section 10: Lots 1-4, N\\1/2\\, N\\1/2\\SE\\1/4\\, SE\\1/4\\SE\\1/4\\ \n     (+) River Bottoms 7.3 acres\n       Section 14: Lots 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, NW\\1/4\\NE\\1/4\\, NW\\1/\n     4\\SW\\1/4\\, S\\1/2\\S\\1/2\\ (+) River Bottom 41.4 acres\n       Section 24: Lots 1-9, NE\\1/4\\, S\\1/2\\NW\\1/4\\, NE\\1/4\\NW\\1/\n     4\\ (+) River Bottom 75.84 acres\n       1. The purpose of this Section is to set forth the \n     agreements that Meridian and the Forest Service have made \n     concerning reasonable protection of the view from the Little \n     Missouri River which has been identified as potentially \n     suitable for classification as a Wild and Scenic River under \n     the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This section of the MOU shall \n     remain in effect as long as the Forest Service maintains a \n     corridor for this purpose.\n       2. The Forest Service has designated a \\1/4\\ mile corridor \n     on either side of the River for protection of the view from \n     the River, and this Section applies to the location permanent \n     improvements within said corridor and not to temporary \n     activities such as seismic operations within said corridor.\n       3. Meridian agrees to use its best efforts to locate \n     permanent production facilities, well sites, roads and other \n     installations outside the \\1/4\\ mile corridor on the Subject \n     Lands. However, such facilities may be located within the \\1/\n     4\\ mile corridor if mutually agreed to by the parties in \n     writing.\n       4. The Forest Service agrees that Meridian may access its \n     minerals within or without the \\1/4\\ mile corridor of the \n     subject lands from a well or wells whose surface location is \n     on adjoining lands in which Meridian owns the severed mineral \n     estate.\n       Section B.

The purpose of this section is to set forth the \n     agreement that Meridian and the Forest Service have made \n     concerning the option to develop the mineral resources in the \n     S\\1/2\\ Section 12 from specified locations in Section 13, T. \n     138N., R. 102W.\n       2. If, at any time, Meridian, at its sole discretion, \n     decides that the development potential of the S\\1/2\\ Section \n     12 justifies additional directional drilling the following \n     options are hereby made available to them by the Forest \n     Service:\n       A. Directional drilling from an expanded pad on the Duncan \n     MP#1 location is Section 13, T. 138N., R. 102W. or\n       B. Directional drilling from a location in Section 13 \n     adjacent to the county road and screened from the bighorn \n     sheep lambing area located in Section 12.\n       If Meridian elects to develop the S\\1/2\\ Section 12 from \n     one of the specified locations in Section 13, surface \n     disturbing activities related to development and production \n     will only be allowed from June 16 through October 14, \n     annually.\n       3.

Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I am writing to convey the Sierra \n     Club's support for the ``agreement in principle'' for a \n     mineral exchange between Meridian Oil Inc. (MOI) and the \n     Bureau of Land Management (BLM)/United States Forest Service \n     (USFS). This agreement follows extensive negotiations between \n     MOI, USFS, BLM, the North Dakota Game and Fish Department \n     (NDGF) and local conservation organizations.\n       It is my understanding that their are two components to the \n     agreement. Part One involves the actual exchange of the \n     mineral estate. Part Two outlines a Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) between the USFS and MOI to protect the \n     viewshed of the Little Missouri State Scenic River while \n     still allowing MOI to access their minerals. The MOU also \n     addresses a plan to directionally drill an oil well to \n     protect a bighorn sheep lambing area.\n       I have contacted the enclosed list of conservation \n     organizations and they have also stated their support for \n     Parts One and Two of the agreement as proposed. I join them \n     in urging you to introduction enabling legislation at the \n     earliest opportunity. Your efforts throughout this process \n     have been very much appreciated. Please contact me if there \n     is anything conservationists can do to facilitate this \n     mineral exchange.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayde Schafer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Conservation Organizations in Support of the Mineral Exchange\n\n       Dacotah Chapter of the Sierra Club, National Wildlife \n     Federation, National Audubon Society, Clean Water Action, \n     North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society, Bismarck Mandan \n     Bird Club, Lewis and Clark Wildlife Club.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, to introduce legislation that would \nimplement an exchange of subsurface mineral rights between the U.S. \nForest Service and Burlington Resources in the Little Missouri National \nGrasslands.\n  Mr. President, this exchange and consolidation of mineral rights \nmakes sense. The current pattern of ownership resembles a checkerboard, \nand this consolidation will help protect sensitive lands in the North \nDakota Badlands and also facilitate additional oil and gas exploration \nin other areas of the grasslands. The legislation being introduced \ntoday would transfer Burlington's subsurface mineral rights of 9,582 \nacres to the Forest Service, and transfer 8,796 acres of Forest Service \nsubsurface mineral rights to Burlington Resources. The parties have \nagreed that the value of the mineral rights being exchanged are of \nequal value. The legislation would also authorize the exchange of other \nprivate mineral rights for federal mineral rights within 6 months of \nenactment. Finally, this bill contains a very important provision that \nassures that nothing in the legislation can be interpreted to limit, \nrestrict, or otherwise affect the application of the principle of \nmultiple use.\n  It is also important to acknowledge what this legislation does not \ndo. This legislation does not increase the surface area controlled by \nthe Forest Service. This bill only deals with subsurface mineral \nrights. This bill does not decrease revenue to the county, State, or \nFederal government, nor does it provide Burlington Resources with \nmineral rights of greater value than they currently hold. Finally, this \nlegislation is silent on the issue of wilderness designation.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a good, balanced piece of \nlegislation that deserves the support of every Member of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. Exon):\n  S.J. Res. 65. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to protect the rights of crime \nvictims; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the victims' rights constitutional amendment\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to ensure that crime victims are treated with \nfairness, dignity, and respect, I rise--along with Senator Feinstein--\nto introduce a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to \nestablish and protect the rights of crime victims.\n  This joint resolution is the product of extended discussions with \nSenators Hatch and Biden, the Department of Justice, the White House, \nlaw enforcement, major victims' rights groups, and such diverse \nscholars as Professors Larry Tribe and Paul Cassell.\n  This latest joint resolution is still a work in progress; Senator \nFeinstein and I anticipate modifications. We are introducing this new \nversion to show the changes that have been made and to make clear that \nSenate Joint Resolution 52--which was introduced on April 22--has been \nsuperseded. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve the amendment and \nask that comments refer to this new joint resolution.\n  Three principal issues remain unresolved. First, whether there should \nbe an effective remedy when crime victims are denied rights regarding \nsentences or pleas. Second, whether to include non-violent crimes--\nother crimes--and if these crimes are included, whether they should be \ndefined by Congress or by Congress and the states. Third, whether to \nhave a right to a final disposition free from unreasonable delay or \nwhether to limit this right to trial proceedings.\n  The introduced version--and the most recent version--contain the core \nprinciples that crime victims should have:\n  To be informed of the proceedings.\n  To be heard at certain crucial stages in the process.\n  To be notified of the offender's release or escape.\n  To proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\n  To an order of restitution.\n  To have the safety of the victim considered in determining a release \nfrom custody.\n  To be notified of these rights.\n  The language describing these rights has changed--and we continue to \nwelcome suggestions. But it is clear that these rights are necessary. \nThey are the core of the amendment.\n  In putting together a constitutional amendment, a broad consensus has \nto be reached to obtain two-thirds approval in the House and Senate and \nto ensure ratification by three-fourths of the States. In making \nchanges, Senator Feinstein and I have tried to accommodate the concerns \nof those who work in the criminal justice system--including judges, \nprosecutors, police officers, corrections officials, and defense \nattorneys--while at the same time protecting fundamental rights for \ncrime victims.\n  Senator Feinstein and I will continue to work intensively with these \ngroups, law professors, and other Members of Congress from both parties \nand both Houses over the ensuing months to craft the best amendment \npossible. We then intend to introduce the finished revised amendment at \nthe beginning of the next Congress. We believe that we now are close to \na version that can be voted on by the House and Senate. We welcome \ncomments and input as we move forward.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Dianne Feinstein for her \nhard work on this amendment and for her tireless efforts on behalf of \ncrime victims.\n  Mr. President, for far too long, the criminal justice system has \nignored crime victims who deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity, \nand respect. Our criminal justice system will never\n\n[[Page S11999]]\n\nbe truly just as long as criminals have rights and victims have none. \nWe need a new definition of justice--one that includes the victim.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 65\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid for all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years from \n     the date of its submission by the Congress:\n       Section 1. Victims of crimes of violence and other crimes \n     that Congress and the States may define by law pursuant to \n     section 3, shall have the rights to notice of and not to be \n     excluded from all public proceedings relating to the crime; \n     to be heard if present and to submit a statement at a public \n     pre-trial or trial proceeding to determine a release from \n     custody, an acceptance of a negotiated plea, or a sentence; \n     to these rights at a parole proceeding to the extent they are \n     afforded to the convicted offender; to notice of a release \n     pursuant to a public or parole proceeding or an escape; to a \n     final disposition free from unreasonable delay; to an order \n     of restitution from the convicted offender; to have the \n     safety of the victim considered in determining a release from \n     custody; and to notice of the rights established by this \n     article.\n       Section 2. The victim shall have standing to assert the \n     rights established by this article; however, nothing in this \n     article shall provide grounds for the victim to challenge a \n     charging decision or a conviction, obtain a stay of trial, or \n     compel a new trial; nor shall anything in this article give \n     rise to a claim of damages against the United States, a \n     State, a political subdivision, or a public official; nor \n     shall anything in this article provide grounds for the \n     accused or convicted offender to obtain any form of relief.\n       Section 3. The Congress and the States shall have the power \n     to enforce this article within their respective federal and \n     state jurisdictions by appropriate legislation, including the \n     power to enact exceptions when required for compelling \n     reasons of public safety.\n       Section 4. The rights established by this article shall be \n     applicable to all proceedings occurring after ratification of \n     this article.\n       Section 5. The rights established by this article shall \n     apply in all federal, state, military, and juvenile justice \n     proceedings, and shall also apply to victims in the District \n     of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession \n     of the United States.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today along with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, to introduce a \nrevised and substantially improved version of the victims' rights \namendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Since Senator Kyl and I originally introduced a victims' rights \namendment in April, we have been working very diligently and \nintensively with the Department of Justice, law enforcement, the White \nHouse, major victims' rights groups, Senate Judiciary Committee \nChairman Hatch and Ranking Member Biden, House Judiciary Committee \nChairman Hyde, and a variety of distinguished scholars in the field of \nlaw enforcement, to more finely craft this amendment and resolve \nvarious concerns with its initial language. We have gone through 41 \ndifferent drafts of the amendment, so far, as the language has evolved, \nculminating in the resolution that we are introducing today.\n  We are introducing this most recent version so that interested people \nhave an up to date draft to evaluate. Many of the people who have \ncommented on the victims' rights amendment were commenting on an out of \ndate draft, leading to erroneous and false conclusions by some, \nincluding legal scholars.\n  What really focused my attention on the need for greater protection \nof victims' rights was a particularly horrifying case, in 1974, in San \nFrancisco, when a man named Angelo Pavageau broke into the house of the \nCarlson family in Portero Hill. Pavageau tied Mr. Carlson to a chair, \nbludgeoning him to death with a hammer, a chopping block, and a ceramic \nvase. He then repeatedly raped Carlson's 24-year old wife, breaking \nseveral of her bones, He slit her wrist, tried to strangle her with a \ntelephone cord, and then, before fleeing, set the Carlson's home on \nfire--cowardly retreating into the night, leaving this family to burn \nup in flames.\n  But Mrs. Carlson survived the fire. She courageously lived to testify \nagainst her attacker. But she has been forced to change her name and \ncontinues to live in fear that her attacker may, one day, be released. \nWhen I was mayor of San Francisco, she called me several times to \nnotify me that Pavageau was up for parole. Amazingly, it was up to Mrs. \nCarlson to find out when his parole hearings were.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe this case represents a travesty of justice--\nIt just shouldn't have to be that way. I believe it should be the \nresponsibility of the State to send a letter through the mail or make a \nphone call to let a victim know that her attacker is up for parole, and \nshe should have the opportunity to testify at that hearing.\n  But today, in most States in this great Nation, victims still are not \nmade aware of the accused's trial, many times are not allowed in the \ncourtroom during the trial, and are not notified when convicted \noffender is released from prison.\n  I have vowed to do everything in my power to add a bit of balance to \nour Nation's justice system. This is why Senator Kyl and I have crafted \nthe victim's rights amendment before us today.\n  The people of California were the first in the Nation to pass a crime \nvictims' amendment to the State constitution in 1982--the initiative \nproposition 8--and I supported its passage. This measure gave victims \nthe right to restitution, the right to testify at sentencing, probation \nand parole hearings established a right to safe and secure public \nschool campuses, and made various changes in criminal law. California's \nproposition 8 represented a good start to ensure victims' rights.\n  Since the passage of proposition 8, 20 more States have passed \nconstitutional amendments guaranteeing the rights of crime victims--and \nfive others are expected to pass by the end of this year. In each case, \nthese amendments have won with the overwhelming approval of the voters.\n  But citizens in other States lack these basic rights. The 20 \ndifferent State constitutional amendments differ from each other, \nrepresenting a patchwork quilt of rights that vary from State to State. \nAnd even in those States which have State amendments, criminals can \nassert rights grounded in the Federal constitution to try to trump \nthose rights.\n  I stand before you today to appeal to my colleagues in this body--the \nhighest legislative institution in the land--that the time is now to \namend the U.S. Constitution in order to protect the rights of victims \nof serious crimes.\n  The U.S. Constitution guarantees numerous rights to the accused in \nour society, all of which were established by amendment to the \nConstitution. I steadfastly believe that this Nation must attempt to \nguarantee, at the very least, some basic rights to the millions \nvictimized by crime each year.\n  For those accused of crimes in this country, the Constitution \nspecifically protects: The right to a grand jury indictment for capital \nor infamous crimes; the prohibition against double jeopardy; the right \nto due process; the right to a speedy trial and the right to an \nimpartial jury of one's peers; the right to be informed of the nature \nand cause of the criminal accusation; the right to confront witnesses; \nthe right to counsel; the right to subpoena witnesses--and so on.\n  I must say to my colleagues that I find it truly astonishing that no \nwhere in the text of the U.S. Constitution does there appear any \nguarantee of rights for crime victims.\n  To rectify this disparity, Senator Kyl and I introduce the victims' \nrights amendment in April. That amendment, like the one we introduced \ntoday, provides for certain basic rights for victims of crime: The \nright to be notified of public proceedings in their case; The right to \nbe heard at any proceeding involving a release from custody or \nsentencing; The right to be informed of the offender's release or \nescape; The right to restitution from the convicted offender; and the \nright to be made of all of your rights as a victim.\n\n  Personally, I can say that the process of forging a constitutional \namendment for victims' rights has been truly fascinating. The \nConstitution our forefathers scribed 200 years ago is a remarkable \ndocument that has withstood the test of time. Earlier this year, \nSenator Kyl and I embarked on a journey\n\n[[Page S12000]]\n\nto include an amendment to this magnificent document that would ensure \nthat the rights of the roughly 43 million people victimized by crime \neach year will be protected.\n  Our ongoing effort to include a victims' rights amendment in the \nConstitution has been at times frustrating, while at other times \nexhilarating. Each sentence, each word, and each comma has undergone \nhours of deliberation and questioning.\n  Having said that, I must tell this body and share with my colleagues \nthat this latest resolution is still a work in progress--let me be \nperfectly clear, we anticipate modifications. Three principal issues \nremain unresolved:\n  First, whether there should be an effective remedy when crime victims \nare denied rights regarding sentences or pleas.\n  Second, whether to include nonviolent crimes (``other crimes''), and \nif these crimes are included, whether they should be defined by \nCongress or by Congress and the States.\n  Third, whether to have a right to a ``final disposition free from \nunreasonable delay'', whether to limit this right to trial proceedings, \nor whether to exclude this altogether.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kyl and I believe that the latest resolution \nbefore us is much better than the version than was previously \nintroduced for a number of reasons. The language describing these \nrights has changed--and we continue to welcome suggestions to ensure \nthat this amendment pass with the largest majority.\n  Unfortunately, there was precious little time to advance the \namendment in this Congress, and once it became clear that the other \nChamber would not proceed with the amendment this session, Senators Kyl \nand Biden and I decided not to press for Senate action in the last few \nweeks of the Congress, but, rather, to spend the next few months \ncontinuing to work to fine tune the amendment and build a consensus for \nits passage.\n  We implore Members of this body to examine this amendment, and to \nhelp to secure passage of this monumental piece of legislation. After \n200 years, doesn't this Nation owe something to the millions of victims \nof crime? I believe that is our obligation and should be our highest \npriority--not only for the crime victims, but, for all Americans--to \nensure passage of a victims' rights constitutional amendment.\n  I want to personally than Senator Kyl for his tireless efforts to \naccomplish this amendment, and to say that I look forward to continuing \nto work with him in the months to come.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S11973-2",

OKINAWA\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Nunn) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 306\n\n       Whereas the Senate finds that the Treaty of Mutual \n     Cooperation and Security Between the United States of America \n     and Japan is critical to the security interests of the United \n     States, Japan and the nations of the Asian Pacific region;\n       Whereas the bilateral security relationship is the \n     foundation for U.S. security strategy in Asia and the \n     Pacific;\n       Whereas strong bilateral security ties provide a key \n     stabilizing influence in an uncertain post-Cold War world;\n       Whereas the bilateral security relationship makes it \n     possible for the United States to preserve its interest in \n     the Asia Pacific region;\n       Whereas U.S. forward-deployed forces are welcomed by our \n     allies in the region because they are critical for \n     maintaining stability in East Asia;\n       Whereas the recognition by our allies of the importance of \n     American troops for regional security confers on the United \n     States irreplaceable good will and diplomatic influence in \n     the Asia Pacific;\n       Whereas Japan's host nation support is a key element in the \n     U.S. ability to maintain forward-deployed forces;\n       Whereas the people of Okinawa have borne a disproportionate \n     share of the burdens of Japan's host nation support for \n     America's bases in Japan;\n       Whereas the Government's of the United States and Japan \n     have made a commitment to reducing the burdens of U.S. forces \n     of the people of Okinawa;\n\n[[Page S12001]]\n\n       Whereas gaining the support of the people of Okinawa in \n     this process is crucial to effective implementation of the \n     Treaty: Now, therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between \n     the United States of America and Japan remains vital to \n     American and Japanese security interests as well as the \n     security interests of the nations of the Asia-Pacific region; \n     and\n       (2) the people of Okinawa deserve special recognition and \n     gratitude for their contributions toward ensuring the \n     Treaty's implementation.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Thomas and Nunn to submit a sense of the Senate Resolution \nexpressing our gratitude to the Okinawan people for their contributions \ntoward ensuring the viability of Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and \nSecurity between the United States of America and Japan.\n  Mr. President, that treaty forms the core of our bilateral security \narrangements with Japan and of our overall security strategy for the \nAsia-Pacific region. Those arrangements have helped provide the peace \nand stability that have undergirded the region's economic success--from \nwhich the United States has benefited directly.\n  Japan provides our forces based in that country with significant host \nnation support. And no one in Japan shoulders a more disproportionate \nshare of that burden than the people of Okinawa. For their many \ncontributions to the U.S.-Japan relationship and the peace and \nstability of all of the Asia-Pacific region, the Okinawan people justly \ndeserve our recognition and our sincerest thanks. That is precisely \nwhat this resolution does. But it also goes further: The resolution \nmakes it clear that the continued support of the Okinawan people is \ncrucial if we are to maintain a bilateral relationship that serves both \nour countries' interests, as well as those of the Asia-Pacific and the \nentire world.\n  Mr. President, I know time is short in this Congress, but I urge all \nmy colleagues to join me in making passage of this resolution possible \nbefore we adjourn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12000-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12001-S12003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              THE PENSION CHOICE AND SECURITY ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       McCAIN AMENDMENT NO. 5420\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 4000) to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote \navailability of private pensions upon retirement; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n                    TITLE II--DEPOT-LEVEL ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 201.

Mr. President, in late July, IRS issued a \nRevenue Procedure that may cost thousands of State and local \ngovernments and their taxpayers as much as $2 billion. The purpose of \nthe IRS action is to recover funds that were diverted from the Treasury \nwhen local governments were overcharged by investment firms for \nsecurities they purchased in the course of tax-exempt municipal bond \nrefinancings. If these State and local governments had caused the \novercharges or if they themselves benefitted then the IRS ruling, even \nthough costly, might be fair.\n  That, however, is not the case. There has been no suggestion \nwhatsoever that municipal authorities across America acted unlawfully. \nInstead, as expressed by the president of the League of Cities in a \nrecent letter to Treasury Secretary Rubin, ``it appears that the IRS \nunderstands that cities are not at fault, but rather the IRS wants to \nuse cities to go after the underwriters who overcharged us.''\n  In Iowa alone the IRS ruling could cost taxpayers more than $1.5 \nmillion. For other States the totals run even higher. In California, \nfor example, Rev. Proc. 96-41 could require State and local governments \nto pay as much as $200 million to the IRS.\n  If, as the IRS suggests, underwriters and investment bankers were \nresponsible for use of ``a valuation method that results in prices * * \n* that exceed fair market value,'' it is those underwriters and \ninvestment bankers who should repay the Treasury, not towns, cities, \nState universities, school districts, transportation systems and \nutility authorities. Indeed, by some estimates, according to the New \nYork Times: ``underwriters may have earned some $2 billion to $3 \nbillion of illegal profits.''\n  Fortunately, under the False Claims Act, the Government has the \nability to proceed directly against any party which causes financial \nloss to the Treasury and recover treble damages plus penalties. The \nFalse Claims Act may be helpful in the yield burning context.\n  Ten years ago, President Reagan signed the 1986 amendments to the \nFalse Claims Act into law. As the principal sponsor of the 1986 \namendments, my purpose was to strengthen and revitalize the Justice \nDepartment's efforts to fight fraud against the Government wherever it \noccurs. Since then, false claims recoveries to the Treasury have \ntotaled more than $1.3 billion.\n  While the statute has been applied most often in the context of \nFederal defense spending and federally funded health insurance \nprograms, with the narrow exception of income tax cases, the act allows \nthe Government to recover treble damages and penalties against anyone \nwho defrauds the Treasury. If the overcharges described by the IRS \noccurred, the U.S. Treasury may have sustained substantial losses as it \nessentially paid unlawful profits to those who sold the overpriced \nsecurities. If such losses occurred, the False Claims Act offers an \nideal remedy.\n  For these reasons, I intend to write to Attorney General Reno and \nurge that the Department of Justice investigate the circumstances \nunderlying the IRS action, and that if so warranted, the Department \nthen seek to pursue all remedies against any party which damaged the \nGovernment by overpricing securities sold in connection with municipal \nbond refinancings. I will also write to IRS Commissioner Margaret \nRichardson to indicate my concern that the IRS is seeking to make local \ngovernments the primary target for repayment of any sums that were lost \nby the Government as a result of overcharges for escrow \nsecurities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12004-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12004-S12005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          S. 1711, VETERANS' BENEFITS IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1711, \nthe Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1996. I am especially \npleased that this measure includes provisions that would improve the \nCenters for Minority and Women Veterans and allow refinancing under the \nVeterans' Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992. These provisions are \nbased on measures I introduced earlier in this Congress which were \nreported by the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n\n\n                 Native American Home Loan Refinancing\n\n  Mr. President, S. 1711 contains a provision that authorizes the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to refinance direct loans issued to \nNative American veterans under Native American Home Loan Program, \nestablished by Public Law 102-547. This initiative is derived from S. \n1342, legislation I introduced with Senators Rockefeller, Inouye, \nWellstone, and Simon. Under this provision, the same credit standards \nthat apply to refinancing of VA guaranteed loans also apply to \nrefinancing of Native American direct loans.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Native American Direct Loan Pilot \nProgram was established by Congress to ensure equal access to home \nloans for those veterans residing on reservations or other trust lands. \nBecause trust lands cannot be used as collateral, commercial lending \ninstitutions are unwilling to issue mortgages for housing on such \nlands. The direct loans authorized under Public Law 102-547 permit \nNative Americans to purchase, construct, or improve dwellings on trust \nland despite the absence of commercial financing.\n  As of May 1996, VA had entered into agreements with 38 tribes and \nNative Hawaiians to provide direct home loans to tribal members, and \nnegotiations were ongoing to conclude agreements with 21 additional \ntribes. More than 90 loans had been closed, 42 commitments issued, and \n130 applications pending.\n  Recently, however, VA determined that Native Americans wishing to \ntake advantage of lower interest rates could not refinance under the \nprogram. This clearly violated the intent of Congress\n\n[[Page S12005]]\n\nin establishing the program, which was to ensure that Native American \nveterans enjoy the same access to VA home loan benefits as other \nveterans, especially when one considers the fact that refinancing is \nauthorized under other VA loan programs.\n  This bill will correct this inequity and, hopefully, encourage other \nNative Americans to utilize the direct loan program.\n  It is important to point out that VA will not incur additional costs \nif this refinancing option is adopted, since the agency will be \npermitted to charge an administrative refinancing fee. In fact, it is \npossible that the refinancing provision will save the department money \nas well, by allowing veterans to lower their mortgage payments and thus \nreduce the likelihood of default.\n\n\n                Centers for Minority and Women Veterans\n\n  Mr. President, S. 1711 also contains improvements to the Centers for \nMinority and Women Veterans as well as the Advisory Committee on \nMinority Veterans that were enacted as part of Public Law 103-446. \nThese provision are derived from S. 749, legislation I introduced with \nSenator Rockefeller last year.\n  Among other initiatives, Public Law 103-446 established within VA a \nCenter for Minority Veterans, a Center for Women Veterans, and an \nAdvisory Committee on Minority Veterans. These provisions were adopted \nin order to ensure that VA appropriately addresses the special needs \nand concerns of veterans who are women or members of minority groups. \nS. 1711 makes the following modifications to these initiatives:\n  First, it allows the directors of the Center for Minority Veterans \nand the Center for Women Veterans to have either career or noncareer \nstatus. Under the legislation adopted 2 years ago, both directors are \nrequired to be noncareer appointees. I believe the Secretary should \nhave the discretion to appoint either career or noncareer individuals \nto these jobs. This bill restores that option so that the Secretary \nwill have the flexibility to appoint directors with career status so as \nto be able to consider the widest possible field of qualified \ncandidates.\n  Second, it adds an additional function to the list of statutory \nfunctions of the Center for Minority Veterans. Specifically, the \nlegislation requires the center to advise the Secretary of the \neffectiveness of VA's efforts to include minority groups in clinical \nresearch and on the particular health conditions affecting the health \nof minority group members. This provision is consistent with the goals \nset forth in section 492B of the Public Health Service Act. The Center \nfor Women Veterans is already mandated by law to carry out a similar \nfunction with respect to the health of women veterans.\n  Third, it explicitly requires that the Center for Minority Veterans \nprovides support and administrative services to the Advisory Committee \non Minority Veterans. This provision is consistent with the traditional \nagency role of providing professional and technical support to advisory \nentities. Again, this provision parallels existing law requiring that \nthe Center for Women Veterans provide support to the Advisory Committee \non Women Veterans.\n  Fourth, it defines the minority veterans for whom the Center for \nMinority Veterans has responsibility. The law establishing the Center \nneglected to provide such a definition. This bill defines minority \nveterans as individuals who are Asian American, Black, Hispanic, Native \nAmerican--including American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native \nHawaiian--and Pacific-Islander American. This definition is identical \nto the definition included in current law with respect to the Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans.\n  Fifth, the legislation extends the termination date of the Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans an additional 2 years, from December 31, \n1997, to December 31, 1999. This provision is necessary because delays \nin establishing the Advisory Committee have reduced its potential \nworking life to significantly less than the three years authorized by \nCongress. Extending the life of the Advisory Committee to December 1999 \nis not unreasonable, given that all other statutory VA advisory boards, \nincluding the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans, the Advisory \nCommittee on Former Prisoners of War, and the Advisory Committee on \nProsthetics and Special-Disabilities Programs, are authorized \npermanently. In fact, I hope that Congress will in the future consider \nan initiative to authorize the Advisory Committee on a permanent basis.\n  Finally, S. 1711 contains a provision that gives the Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans and the Advisory Committee on Women \nVeterans responsibility for monitoring and evaluating the respective \nactivities of the Center for Minority Veterans and the Center for Women \nVeterans. Insofar as the Advisory Committees were established to \noversee all of the activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nwith respect to minorities and women, they necessarily should be tasked \nwith overseeing the work of the very offices that are chiefly \nresponsible for ensuring that the special needs of minority and female \nveterans are accommodated by VA.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply grateful to Senator Simpson and Senator \nRockefeller for including the home loan and minority provisions in the \npending measure. I also wish to thank their respective Committee \nstaffs, including Bill Tuerk and Tom Harvey for the majority and Bill \nBrew and Jim Gottlieb for the minority, for working so hard on a \nbipartisan basis to help me develop and refine these initiatives. \nTogether, our efforts will significantly improve access by minority and \nwomen veterans to VA benefits and services.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge swift passage of this important \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12004-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TENNESSEE ALLOYS CO.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to Tennessee Alloys Co. of Bridgeport, AL, for their remarkable \nhealth and safety record. On April 19, 1996, the Tennessee Alloys Co. \nplant reached the 4-year mark without a single lost time accident. \nDuring this time period, the plant worked a total of 678,585 hours. Mr. \nPresident, this is an outstanding accomplishment.\n  Tennessee Alloys Co. is a producer of ferroalloys, and employs nearly \n80 people. It is a joint venture of Applied Industrial Materials Corp., \nthe managing partner, and Allegheny Ludlum Corp. Specifically, \nTennessee Alloys Co. manufactures 50 percent ferrosilicon, 75 percent \nferrosilicon, and high purity ferrosilicon. These products are a \ncritical element used in the production of iron castings and steel and \nhave special application in high performance generators, transformers, \nand motors.\n  Bridgeport plant manager Jerry Rich and his management team deserve \nspecial recognition on this occasion, as do the Tennessee Alloys Co.'s \nother hard working employees. Tennessee Alloys Co. sets a fine example \nby demonstrating the importance of high productivity balanced with \nconcern for the health and safety of employees. This balance is not \npossible without the total commitment of both employees and management \nwho take great pride in their work and their company. I would therefore \nlike to recognize Tennessee Alloys Co. for its outstanding health and \nsafety record and wish them continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12005-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12005-S12006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AIDS DRUG\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in appreciation of \nthe leadership of Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, and \nSenator Moynihan, who brought to the Senate and secured passage of \nmiscellaneous tariff legislation. The legislation takes a number of \nimportant steps and deserves our support.\n  I am particularly pleased Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan were able \nto incorporate S. 2021, a bill I introduced earlier this year which \nwould reduce tariffs for certain chemicals used in a new AIDS drug that \nhas shown encouraging test results. Upon approval, the Finance \nCommittee bill will take an important step to reduce tariffs for these \nchemicals, which are not available in the United States.\n  We must do everything we can to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. However, \nuntil we have a cure for this urgent health priority, we need to find \neffective treatments and put them in the hands of people with needs. \nThis provision will accelerate the manufacturing and final\n\n[[Page S12006]]\n\ntesting for a new protease inhibitor and deserves the full support of \nCongress.\n  S. 2021, legislation I introduced with my colleague Senator Boxer, \nwould eliminate the tariff for several chemical compounds which are \nrequired for the manufacture of an AIDS drug, nelfinavir mesylate, \nwhich has produced promising test results.\n\n\n                          PROTEASE INHIBITORS\n\n  Nelfinavir is one of a new class of AIDS drugs called protease \ninhibitors. These drugs are designed to block an enzyme, called \nprotease, that appears to play a crucial role in the replication of \nHIV.\n  During the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia, researchers released evidence that protease inhibitor \ndrugs, when taken in combination with existing therapies, can reduce \nlevels of the AIDS-causing virus in blood to levels so low that the \nvirus is undetectable by even the most sensitive tests. AIDS \nresearchers at the conference describe this new drug therapy as a major \nand unprecedented step in combating AIDS, one that may represent a \ntreatment approach that may delay the onset of AIDS, extend patients' \nlives, and transform AIDS into a long-term, manageable disease.\n  Mr. President, HIV/AIDS is a critical public health issue, requiring \nthe Nation's full attention. In America today, AIDS is the leading \ncause of death for young Americans between the ages of 25 and 44.\n  In my State of California, 1 out of every 200 Californians is HIV \npositive, while one of every 25 is HIV positive in my home of San \nFrancisco.\n  More than 220,700 American men, women and children died of AIDS by \nthe end of 1993. While the number of deaths trails other urgent health \npriorities such as cancer or heart disease, AIDS is nearly equally \ndebilitating to the Nation when measured by the years of potential and \nproductive life lost due to the disease.\n\n  AIDS is a paramount public health concern and every effort should be \nmade to ensure that drugs are made available as swiftly and at as low a \ncost as possible. We simply cannot delay or waste time in providing \ndrugs, treatments or materials needed to fight this disease. This \ntariff legislation represents a modest, but important, step.\n\n\n                    ZERO TARIFF FOR PHARMACEUTICALS\n\n  Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are \nentitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero \ntariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their \nchemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals needed to make \nnelfinavir mesylate, an AIDS protease inhibitor currently undergoing \nresearch testing, but not yet a recognized pharmaceutical product under \nGATT, would be ineligible for the pharmaceutical zero tariff.\n  During negotiations with World Trade Organization nations to \nimplement the pharmaceutical zero tariff, the administration \nsuccessfully added the chemical compounds needed to manufacture the \nAIDS drug. As a result, the tariff will drop to zero on April 1, 1997.\n  Nelfinavir is on the Food and Drug Administration's fast-track \napproval process for AIDS drugs. Commercial production of the drug will \nbegin well before April 1, in order that the drug can be immediately \navailable to AIDS patients upon FDA approval. Although currently \nimported duty-free for use in clinical research trials, the imported \nchemicals will soon be used for commercial production. During the \nperiod of commercial production prior to April 1, the chemical \ncompounds will face a 12 percent tariff, which will only add to the \ncost and delay the drug's production and distribution to individuals in \nneed.\n  Fifteen days after enactment, this bill will eliminate the tariff for \ntwo of the essential and unique chemical inputs, as well as for the \nactive ingredient nelfinavir, acid chloride, chloroalcohol and AG 1346, \nuntil April 1, 1997. On April 1, the tariff drops to zero under the WTO \npharmaceutical agreement. Without this legislation, the manufacturer \nwould face a 12 percent tariff for its chemicals, which are not \navailable in the United States, as the drug proceeds into production. \nThis tariff reduction will allow for the acceleration of drug \nproduction, providing more timely relief for the public.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reviewed S. 2021, concluding the \nlegislation will have only a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. \nHowever, for AIDS patients, their families and those at risk, the \nimpact may be profound. Congress should take this opportunity to reduce \ntariffs for these AIDS chemicals.\n  As a matter of public policy, we should do everything we can to \ndevelop AIDS drugs and treatments. Without this legislation to remove \nthe tariff, we will be tolerating needless hurdles and delay, rather \nthan expediting needed relief. Patients and their families do not have \ntime to wait for the next round of drugs to be approved and added to \nthe zero-tariff list, which is scheduled for review in 1999. By \nimporting the chemical compounds without a tariff, we can accelerate \nthe drug development process.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky and others in the Administration deserve \ntremendous credit for extending a zero tariff for these chemical \ncomponents through international negotiations. I am pleased to support \nChairman Roth and Senator Moynihan, the Finance Committee bill. I also \nwish to thank California Representatives Bill Thomas, Robert Matsui and \nBrian Bilbray for their bipartisan efforts to build support on the \nHouse. The legislation represents an encouraging step forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12005-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12006-S12007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DAVIS-BACON REFORM IN THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, throughout the 104th session, \nCongress and the American people sought new ways to enhance the \ntraining, health care, and retirement security of the Nation's \nworkforce. Statistics tell us that our economy is healthy, stronger \nthan it has been for years, yet, our sense of personal economic \nsecurity has been shaken. News articles of corporate downsizing and \nconsolidations have disturbed the confidence in the American economy.\n  Under a much harsher economic umbrella, Congress, 64 years ago, \nintent on sustaining a construction industry already ravaged by the \neconomic instability of the Great Depression, reasoned that the \ndestructive practices of the Southern contractors would be best \nresolved by requiring that Federal contracted labor be paid the locally \nprevailing wage, thereby halting the tendency of Government contractors \nto drive down workers' wages in order to win lucrative projects. Thus, \nI believe today, more than ever, we need the Davis-Bacon Act to enhance \nthe training, health care, and retirement security of the Nation's work \nforce. The dividends of the Davis-Bacon Act are pervasive: a ready pool \nof trained and highly skilled construction workers, decreased \nconstruction accidents and the injuries and fatalities that are caused \nthereby, and the contributions to local, State, and Federal tax \nrevenues that can only be made by working men and women.\n  As Governor of Oregon, I signed that State's little Davis-Bacon Act \ninto law 37 years ago, and I have supported the intelligent use of the \nprevailing wage standard in Government contracts since.\n  Mr. President, Davis-Bacon has been debated year after year, and I do \nagree with opponents of Davis-Bacon that it needs revision. I emphasize \nthat we need reform of Davis-Bacon and not repeal, as my colleagues \nagreed on May 22 of this year when 99 Senators voted in support of \nDavis-Bacon reform and not repeal. As my colleagues well know, it has \nbeen my objective during the 104th Congress to enact several long \noverdue changes to the 65-year-old Davis-Bacon Act, which enforces a \nprevailing wage standard on Federal construction projects. In the final \nhours of the 104th Congress, I ask the Members of the 105th Congress to \nreflect on the progress that was made under my Davis-Bacon reform bill, \nS. 1183. For example, 7 Republican cosponsors and 19 Democrats \ncosponsoring S. 1183 for a total of 26 cosponsors serves as a simple \nillustration of the progress that was made under the 104th Congress \ntoward Davis-Bacon reform and not repeal.\n  Mr. President, I ask those who adamantly support Davis-Bacon repeal \nto harken to the cry of Davis-Bacon reform. The Davis-Bacon Act as it \nnow stands, indeed deserves some of the\n\n[[Page S12007]]\n\ncriticism that has been levied against it by some of my distinguished \ncolleagues. Nevertheless, its purpose of protecting the jobs of our \nNation's construction workers must persuade us to reform, rather than \nrepeal, the act. I ask my colleagues who support repeal, do we continue \nto live under a Davis-Bacon law, which we agree needs reform, or \ncontinue on under current law which will not be repealed now or in the \nforeseeable future. The logical answer is to support and vote for \nsensible reform, as in my bill S. 1183. The Davis-Bacon reform bill \nwhich I sponsored is supported by the building trades unions and \nseveral coalitions of contractors groups whose 21,000 members across \nthe Nation perform major construction projects covered by Davis-Bacon.\n  I urge my colleagues who will remain in this great body and the new \nMembers who will arrive in the Senate and House in January to continue \nthis bi-partisan, management-labor compromise for it provides us with a \nrare window of opportunity to pass the reforms that Davis-Bacon \nurgently requires. Such broad-based support for Davis-Bacon reform was \nand is extraordinary on Capitol Hill and I hope that it can be \nrecreated in the next Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12006-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12007-S12008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DR. CHRISTINA JEFFREY\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have been contacted by my \nconstituent, Dr. Christina Jeffrey of Kennesaw, GA, who was formerly \nthe historian for the other body.\n  Dr. Jeffrey has asked that I place in the Record materials which \nwould help correct unfounded media reports about her professional \nreputation. I am pleased to do this for Dr. Jeffrey because I have long \nnoted the fact that the media is sometimes quick to report the \nnegative, but slow to report corrections.\n  I know of Dr. Jeffrey from her service as a volunteer with other \nacademicians on my nonpolitical advisory board which selects young men \nand women to serve as interns in my Senate offices. Based on what I \nknow regarding her reputation among her colleagues who know her best, \nDr. Jeffrey is a person of integrity with a genuine interest in public \nservice as well as higher education.\n  It is sad that in this city, both elected officials and staff are \noften subjected to accusations and actions that go far beyond the \nbounds of fair play. I hope the following material helps clarify the \nfacts involving Dr. Jeffrey's professional reputation.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n                                      Department of Education,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 1989.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shelby: Your letter to Secretary Cavazos \n     concerning Dr. Christina Price has been forwarded to me for \n     reply.\n       Dr. Price's concern is understandable. She was generous in \n     acting as a reviewer for the National Diffusion Network (NDN) \n     on the application for funding of a curriculum entitled \n     ``Facing History and Ourselves.'' Denial of that funding \n     application has created an extended controversy, and \n     disclosure of her comments in the media has created a great \n     deal of misunderstanding about both the program and Dr. \n     Price's own views.\n       I believe Dr. Price was acting in good faith, and was \n     delivering honest opinions, when she reviewed ``Facing \n     History.'' She argues that here comments were written in a \n     kind of academic shorthand, not for public consumption, and \n     that in no way did she intend to convey an attitude of racism \n     or anti-Semitism. We accept her contention. And to the extent \n     that any Department of Education official has characterized \n     Dr. Price herself as racist or anti-Semitic, we do indeed \n     apologize.\n       However, it is also true that some of Dr. Price's review \n     comments were ambiguously phrased, and that portions lifted \n     out of context and reprinted in the media could lead an \n     objective reader to conclude that she favored presenting the \n     Nazi or KKK point of view in the interests of ``balance or \n     objectivity.'' While the best education about any historical \n     issue requires an understanding of the motivations of all \n     parties, the teaching of the Holocaust demands clear \n     delineation between good and evil. To the extent that outside \n     observers believed Dr. Price to be advocating a morally \n     neutral approach to the teaching of the Holocaust--and to the \n     extent that they further believed this represented the \n     position of the Department of Education--it is not surprising \n     that they would raise strenuous objections.\n       It should also be noted that under the Freedom of \n     Information Act, the Department of Education was required to \n     release a list of reviewers, and the evaluations of the \n     projects submitted by them, without identifying which \n     reviewers made which comments. We complied with FOIA \n     requirements in supplying this information. Dr. Price was \n     informed of this policy in a letter from Dr. Shirley Curry, \n     director of the Recognition Division, on November 19, 1986. \n     It read in part: ``Your review of applications for grants \n     becomes part of the official government record and will be a \n     determining factor in choosing who will be funded. If \n     requested, applicants will be given copies of the reviewers' \n     comments. However, the names of the reviewers will be removed \n     from the review instruments before being sent out. ''\n       The most difficult aspect of this episode is that I am sure \n     Dr. Price feels as strongly about appropriate teaching of the \n     Holocaust as we do (and for that matter, as strongly as those \n     who created the ``Facing History'' curriculum).

Sam Nunn,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: As president of the nation's largest \n     Catholic civil rights organization, I am delighted to write a \n     letter of support for Dr. Christina Jeffrey. Dr. Jeffrey, as \n     the public knows, was terminated as House historian on the \n     grounds that she promoted the inclusion of the Nazi \n     perspective in Holocaust curriculum.\n       What the public does not generally know is that Dr. Jeffrey \n     is a determined anti-Nazi scholar whose reputation has been \n     unfairly maligned by uninformed ideologues. It was a disgrace \n     that she was terminated in the first place, and it is doubly \n     disgraceful that her reputation remains unfairly tarnished. \n     That is why I am appealing to you to clear her name by \n     submitting this letter, and others like it, into the \n     Congressional Record.\n       I have spent most of my life as a college professor, and, \n     having taught Political Sociology, I know that it is \n     important for students to understand the mind-set of those \n     who sponsor genocide. Yes, in the hands of a Nazi \n     sympathizer, such a pedagogical approach could be misused to \n     engender empathy for terrorists. The same is true of \n     virtually any topic of an incendiary nature. But when taught \n     by someone with the impeccable moral credentials of a Dr. \n     Jeffrey, such an orientation can yield very positive results, \n     both scholarly and morally. After all, if the goal is to stop \n     another Holocaust from ever happening again, it is critical \n     that everyone know the psychology and social soil in which \n     genocidal ambitions flourish.\n       Dr. Jeffrey represents the very best of her Catholic \n     training: she wants to help craft a world where injustice \n     does not prevail. It is a travesty that injustice has been \n     visited upon her, even if those who perpetrated it remain \n     sadly ignorant of her character, intentions and effects.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William A. Donohue,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Georgia Conference, American Association of University \n           Professors,\n                                 Carrollton, GA, October 24, 1995.\n     Re Christina Jeffrey.\n\n     To: Whom it May Concern.\n     From: Don Wagner.\n       The national office of the American Association of \n     University Professors, in response to a request from the \n     Georgia Conference-AAUP, wrote to Secretary of Education \n     Richard Riley to protest the treatment which Dr. Christina \n     Jeffrey received from the Department of Education, i.e., the \n     release of her name without her knowledge or permission in \n     conjunction with a grant review she did for the Department in \n     1986. This treatment led ultimately to her being fired as \n     House historian by House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The peer \n     review process is designated to be confidential and the \n     Department, when it breaches that promised confidentiality, \n     damages the whole system, and can, as we saw in Dr. Jeffrey's \n     case, unfairly harm the individuals involved. The Department \n     of Education responded to our inquiry positively and shares \n     our concerns about confidentiality and Dr. Jeffrey's case.\n\n\n                             National Association of Scholars,\n\n                                  Princeton, NJ, October 31, 1995.\n       The National Association of Scholars is pleased to endorse \n     the public vindication of Professor Christina Jeffrey, to \n     whom we extend every good wish for the rehabilitation of her \n     career. Now that a fair reading of the evidence has finally \n     been rendered, no one could possibly doubt her complete \n     professional integrity and basic human decency. Clearly, she \n     is no Nazi sympathizer or crank racist, and it is regrettable \n     that her reputation has had to endure such calumny.\n       It is just as clear, however, that this entire incident \n     should never have occurred. When in 1986 Professor Jeffrey \n     was invited by the US Department of Education to evaluate\n\n[[Page S12008]]\n\n     grant proposals for various projects, she was assured that \n     such consultations--because of the candor essential to the \n     process--were held in strict confidentiality. But in 1988, \n     one of her reviews was leaked to the press and quickly found \n     its way to a congressional committee where she was pilloried \n     as anti-Semitic, based on a selective reading of private \n     comments removed from their proper context. She was \n     subsequently vindicated, although the unfortunate affair \n     proved not to be at an end. After her appointment as House \n     Historian last year, these false and preposterous changes \n     were resurrected in Congress and the major media made a \n     particularly unseemly rush to judgment based on her presumed \n     guilt. Not surprisingly, her summary dismissal followed, \n     based on nothing more than hearsay and a complete misreading \n     of the original incident in 1988. Those in the Congress and \n     the media responsible for circulating these distortions owe \n     Dr. Jeffrey a profound apology.\n       We are gratified, once again, that Professor Jeffrey has \n     finally received some justice. The lessons to be drawn for \n     the future, however, seem obvious: if scholars working in \n     government service are guaranteed anonymity--an essential \n     component in many professions--this must be respected by \n     political leaders and journalists. Otherwise, given the sad \n     experience of Mrs. Jeffrey, many academics will be \n     understandably chary of accepting similar opportunities for \n     public service lest the same fate befall them.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Anti-Defamation League,\n\n                                    New York, NY, August 22, 1995.\n     Prof. Christina Jeffrey,\n     Department of Political Science and International Affairs, \n         Marietta, GA.\n       Dear Professor Jeffrey: Thank you for your letter. I, too, \n     found our meeting in Atlanta rewarding. I understand and \n     appreciate your explanation--and remorse--for what we both \n     agree were ill-considered, poorly chosen remarks.\n       I want to assure you that, after examining the facts and \n     circumstances of the controversy involving the ``Facing \n     History and Ourselves'' Holocaust curriculum, ADL is \n     satisfied that any characterization of you as anti-Semitic or \n     sympathetic to Nazism is entirely unfounded and unfair.\n       Your clear repudiation of any form of Holocaust denial and \n     your advocacy of Holocaust education demonstrate that the \n     ``Facing History'' incident reflected neither an inclination \n     to deny the reality of Nazi persecution of Jews nor anti-\n     Semitism, but was simply a regrettable mistake.\n       I welcome your very useful suggestion for a conference on \n     Holocaust education at Kennesaw State College, perhaps \n     involving other colleges in the area. ADL would be pleased to \n     act as a co-sponsor and to offer our resource materials and \n     guidance for such a worthy proposal.\n       I commend your effort to set the record straight and your \n     appreciation of the need for historical accuracy and for \n     teaching the lessons of the Holocaust. I hope this \n     communication will help you to put the unfortunate \n     controversy behind you and allow you to move ahead with your \n     important educational work.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Abraham H. Foxman,\n     National Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 Out of Spotlight, Reputation Restored\n\n                           (By Dick Williams)\n\n       For Newt Gingrich and his staff, the issue of Dr. Christina \n     Jeffrey was one of damage control. For the press, it was a \n     one-day story. For the cynical, it was the allotted 15 \n     minutes of fame for Jeffrey, an associate professor of \n     history at Kennesaw State College.\n       For Jeffrey, her professor husband, Robert, and their \n     children, it was personal. The events of January scarred her \n     and damaged the family reputation and finances. Today she is \n     asking--to use the words of former Labor Secretary Ray \n     Donovan--``Where do I go to get my reputation back?''\n       It will be an uphill battle.\n       Jeffrey has been on a roller coaster. In the excitement of \n     Gingrich's accession to speaker of the House, she was named \n     House historian early this year. It was a plum, a career-\n     maker, for someone at a commuter college. Then came the \n     accusation that changed her life. In 1986, while consulting \n     for the U.S. Department of Education, she criticized a junior \n     high school course on the Holocaust.\n       ``The program,'' she wrote then, ``gives no evidence of \n     balance or objectivity. The Nazi point of view, however \n     unpopular, is still a point of view and is not presented, nor \n     is that of the Ku Klux Klan.''\n       In the shorthand of the press, that sentence became her \n     assertion that ``the Nazi point of view'' wasn't presented. \n     If she had it to do over again, you can bet she would phrase \n     her objections differently. To properly understand Nazism and \n     the origins of the Klan, students should understand the \n     forces that spawned them, the economy, the resentments and \n     the paranoia. To understand how they came to be is to \n     understand how such perverse movements can be prevented.\n       But Jeffrey's text and context were lost to the shorthand \n     and the headlines. Major Jewish groups were quick to condemn \n     her, and Gingrich was lightning quick in firing her. She \n     didn't land in the U.S. Capitol; she arrived in a revolving \n     door that sent her spinning back toward Georgia--her \n     reputation shredded in one day's headlines around the nation.\n       Fortunately, both Jeffreys were able to regain the jobs \n     they had quit to go to Washington. They lost a good deal of \n     money in the relocation, but they are on the mend. And this \n     week came vindication, though you had to look hard to find \n     it.\n       Abraham Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League of \n     B'nai B'rith wrote to exonerate her. When she was dismissed, \n     the Anti-Defamation League had praised Gingrich, saying \n     Jeffrey's views were ``misguided and profoundly offensive.''\n       Now Foxman says he agrees with Jeffrey that her remarks \n     were ill-considered and poorly chosen, but he told The \n     Washington Post that if Gingrich gives her a job again, the \n     Anti-Defamation League would say, ``God bless.''\n       ``I want to assure you,'' he said, ``that after examining \n     the facts and circumstances of the controversy involving the \n     `Facing History and Ourselves' Holocaust curriculum, [the \n     Anti-Defamation League] is satisfied that any \n     characterization of you as anti-Semitic or sympathetic to \n     Nazism is entirely unfounded and unfair.''\n       In a perfect world, such a letter would right the good ship \n     Jeffrey. But the story was lost to the trial of Mark Fuhrman, \n     air attacks in Bosnia and Hillary Rodham Clinton's stern and \n     stirring speech in China.\n       The story received no national play. The truth is, the \n     corrections never catch up with the headlines, unless one has \n     the resources of Philip Morris.\n       Still, for Christina Jeffrey, her academic reputation has \n     been restored, even if the views of the broader public will \n     take longer to change. She speaks now of ``peace of mind,'' \n     and--of course--a book. If she is successful, she might get \n     even in a lot of ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12007-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TAX-FREE LIQUIDATION LEGISLATION FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATIONS\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to be an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 2141 introduced Friday by Senator Feinstein. \nThis legislation will expand charitable giving by families and \nbusinesses by permitting the tax-free liquidation of closely-held \ncorporations into tax-exempt charities and foundations.\n  Voluntarism and charity are concepts deeply imbedded in my personal \nphilosophy. At a time of shrinking Federal discretionary dollars, \ngovernments on all levels, Federal, State, and local, are forced to \nreduce spending throughout their budgets. With the general decline in \nFederal services, an increasing burden is being shouldered by nonprofit \norganizations and private citizens. During this critical stage in \nrestructuring Government and returning flexibility to our local \ncommunities, Congress should do all that it can to encourage private \nphilanthropic efforts. By supporting legislation like S. 2141, \nGovernment can assist charities in helping those in need without \nincreasing Federal spending and contributing further to our enormous \ndeficit.\n  It is also important to note that many organizations from the State \nof Oregon and across the country are supporters of the concept of this \nlegislation. In the State of Oregon alone, the Boys & Girls Clubs of \nPortland, the Portland Art Museum, the Oregon Health Sciences \nUniversity, the Meyer Memorial Trust, and the Catholic Charities of \nPortland have all promoted this type of legislation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12008-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12008-S12009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SALLIE MAE PRIVATIZATION IN OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the omnibus \nappropriations bill includes provisions in title VI that would \nprivatize the Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae. \nThis is the first time that a major government-sponsored enterprise has \nbeen cut loose from its Federal moorings, and that is an important \nprecedent.\n  I began calling for Sallie Mae's privatization in 1991, when I \nquestioned the high salaries it was paying its executives, and I raised \nconcerns about the organization's intense and often-deceptive lobbying \nagainst student loan reforms. That did not seem appropriate for a \ngovernment-created entity.\n  This is not the privatization bill that I would have written. Untying \nthe company's ties to Federal taxpayers may take years, longer than I \nbelieve is necessary. Sallie Mae is not being required to repay any \nsignificant amount to taxpayers. It is true that a fee was imposed in \n1993, but the company has found a loophole to avoid paying a large part \nof that fee, and the privatization bill fails to close that loophole.\n  But despite these flaws, this is an important development, \nparticularly in\n\n[[Page S12009]]\n\nthe larger context of improving government. We can learn from this \neffort, and I hope that my colleagues, in future Congresses, will take \na close look at a bill I introduced with Senator Pryor recently, S. \n2095, which promotes a more rational and consistent approach to \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises and government corporations.\n  Mr. President, the Sallie Mae privatization provisions include \nimportant language designed to ensure that all students have access to \nloans. The Higher Education Act already requires that student loan \nsecondary markets using tax-exempt bonds may not make lending or loan-\npurchasing decisions based on the borrower's race, sex, color, \nreligion, national origin, age, handicapped status, income, attendance \nat a particular institution, length of the borrower's educational \nprogram, or the borrower's academic year. The purpose of this rule is \nto ensure that secondary markets do not use such factors as excuses for \nnot effectively performing the supportive functions for which the \nmarkets have been allowed to participate in the Federal student loan \nprogram. Section 604 of the omnibus appropriations bill amends the \nHigher Education Act to impose on Sallie Mae the same service \nrequirement that apply under current law for tax-exempt secondary \nmarkets. This is a important element of the privatization \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12008-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH NOYCE\n\nMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, a bright light of optimism and \nbenevolence in Maine has been extinguished. I rise to express my deep \nsadness and profound sympathies to the family of Elizabeth Noyce, a \ngreat Mainer and close friend who has left an indelible mark on our \nstate and all those whose lives she touched.\n  Elizabeth Noyce had achieved an almost legendary status in Maine--a \ngoal which ironically would have been the furthest from her mind. She \nwas an incredible and unique woman whose tremendous loss is being felt \nthroughout the State. I take the floor today to honor the memory of \nthis woman who gave so much to the place she loved and asked so little \nin return.\n  What makes Betty Noyce special, what endeared her to the people of \nMaine was her humble, unassuming style and unwavering commitment to a \nbetter future. Her generosity was born not of a quest for notoriety, \nbut from a deep and genuine devotion to our State. A close friend said \nit simply and said it best: ``Maine was her passion.''\n  Elizabeth Noyce did not grow up in Maine--nor did she grow up in \nluxury. But as so often happens during life's long journey, turns in \nthe road brought her to Maine--and Betty's love affair with the State \nkept her there. And although she came to acquire money, she never lost \nsight of the things that are really important--family, friends, and a \ncommitment to leaving the world a better place for having lived in it.\n  Betty Noyce has left our world, but her incredible legacy will be \nforever. She donated millions of dollars to Maine hospitals, museums, \nand colleges--but for Betty, simply writing a check was little payment \non what she felt she owed to her adopted home. She also provided energy \nand leadership to a host of civic, cultural, and State organizations--\nbut even more importantly, she gave us pride in our place and hope for \na better future. Her enthusiasm was contagious--she made you believe in \na project and believe in yourself. Betty invested more than money--she \ninvested her time and her spirit and her energy. She was never a \ndistant figure behind wrought iron gates-- instead, she was a figure at \nthe local diner, just an ordinary person taking a break from performing \nextraordinary deeds.\n  Indeed, practically every aspect of Maine's society--from business, \nto health care, education, arts and culture--was touched and enriched \nby her generosity. Consider what she has given just within the past \ncouple of years: $3 million toward the Barbara Bush Children's Hospital \nat Maine Medical Center. $10,000 to help finance a gun buyback program \nconducted by the Portland Police Department. $1.3 million to the \nCumberland County Civic Center to fund improvements and preserve its \npublic name. $5 million to the University of Maine; and exceptional art \nworks to the Portland Museum of Art.\n\n  Most importantly, she worked to create jobs, burnish the economies of \nPortland and the entire State, and make Maine a better place to live, \nwork, and raise a family.\n  In recent years, Betty increasingly turned to what she called \ncatalytic philanthropy. She measured the potential success of a project \nin terms of how many jobs would result and how much Maine would be \nimproved. She knew that Mainers--proud and fiercely independent--want \nmost of all to work and have the sense of self-worth and self-\nsufficiency that come with an honest day's effort.\n  Some of her projects that put people to work include: Starting a bank \ndedicated to local investors and savers; buying struggling office \nbuildings; purchasing a local bakery--Nissen Baking--that employed over \n300 workers; announcing plans for 24,000-square-foot public market in \nunderprivileged area of Portland; unveiling plans for L.L. Bean to open \nfactory store in a former 5-and-10 building downtown.\n  One of the most remarkable things about Betty Noyce--for all of her \nwealth, for all the things she had seen and done--was that she never \nbecame cynical, never became jaded. It was the simple things that gave \nher pleasure--a good book, a walk on the beach, or time spent next to \nthe fireplace in the face of a good old-fashioned nor'easter. Perhaps \nit was because she was so comfortable with herself and what she wanted \nfrom life that she shunned notoriety. Betty Noyce never wanted her name \non a building. She knew she was making a difference in the lives of \nMainers, and that's all the gratification Betty ever needed.\n  Most of us in politics are here because we think we can improve the \nhuman condition, and we hope to leave a better America for the next \ngeneration. While Betty Noyce never held public office, I think we \nwould do well to take a page from her book. At the memorial, Owen \nWells, Betty's attorney and friend, said: ``To be given a fortune and \naccept it not as a stroke of luck but a mission, as she did, represents \na kind of moral fiber that is extraordinary.'' Indeed, she has set an \nexample for compassion and generosity of spirit, and reminds all of us \nthat we have an obligation to make use of whatever gifts we have to \ngive.\n  I will always feel tremendous appreciation and deep affection for \nBetty and I will miss her very much. We will never forget her kindness, \nher enthusiasm, and the exemplary way in which she lived her \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12009-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TELAMON ELECTRONICS MAKING A DIFFERENCE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

I am particularly concerned with the manner in \nwhich the bill's conference committee report resolves the question of \nASHA funding. With the support of the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Vermont, my amendment to earmark $15 million for this \nprogram in fiscal year 1997 was included in the final version of the \nSenate bill. The House, however, did not include a similar provision in \nits bill. The conference committee also did not choose to include the \nearmark in the bill. But the conference committee did insert strongly \nworded language in the conference report which refers to ASHA funding.\n  I understand that during conference deliberation on this matter the \nmanagers of both the House and Senate agreed to two specific \nprinciples. First, it was agreed to that AID should not phase out ASHA. \nSecond, the managers insisted that the ASHA Program be funded at an \namount at least equal to that in fiscal year 1996. I would like to ask \nthe Chairman for clarification as to the actual funding level \ncontemplated by this language.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky knows, on September 6, 1996 AID formally \nnotified Congress that grants made through ASHA in fiscal year 1996 \nwould total $17.6 million. Based on this figure, it would be my \ninterpretation of the report language that AID should award ASHA grants \ntotalling at least $17.6 million for fiscal year 1997. In other words, \nin referring to the fiscal year 1996 funding level, the conference \ncommittee had in mind the ASHA funding level for the most recent year; \nit was not concerned with the fiscal year in which allocated funds were \nactually appropriated. Could the Senator from Kentucky tell me if my \ninterpretation is correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his kind words. \nI am pleased to say that his interpretation is correct. The Conference \nCommittee intentions were to make clear to AID that it strongly \ndisagrees with the agency's proposal to phase out ASHA over the next 2 \nfiscal years. There is broad agreement in both the Senate and the House \nthat this program should be continued at levels close to those of the \nrecent past. As for the fiscal year 1997 grant cycle in particular, we \nexpect AID to make grants of at least $17.6 million. So, although the \nconferees did not retain the specific language of the amendment by the \nSenator from Michigan, we certainly concur with its spirit.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for that \nclarification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12009-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12010-S12011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A PLACE TO STAY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President there is a publication in Chicago called \nStreetwise that is sold by homeless people. They sell it for $1.00 \neach, and my guess is that most of that money goes to the person who \nsells it.\n  In an issue that I bought the other day from someone on Michigan \nAvenue, who appeared to be homeless, is a brief analysis about who the \nhomeless are and why they are homeless.\n  It gives as a source for this the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless.\n  They also have a story written by Jeff Mason about a man named Mike \nwho tells about his 24 hour experience as a homeless person.\n  This takes place at the Pacific Garden Mission, which I've had the \nopportunity to visit on several occasions. It is a religious \norganization where people are obviously committed to living their faith \nand helping those who are less fortunate.\n  Mr. President, I ask that both items from Streetwise be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                  [From Streetwise, Sept. 16-30, 1996]\n\n                            A Place to Stay\n\n                            (By Jeff Mason)\n\n       7 p.m. It's a summer Wednesday night in Chicago. The sky is \n     getting dark as people hustle to their cars, trains and \n     buses. Everyone has some place to go, it seems. Everyone, \n     that is, except Chicago's homeless. They remain on the \n     streets or go to a shelter, looking for a place to stay.\n       Like any other night during the year, guests at the Pacific \n     Garden Mission, located at 646 S. State St., are sitting on \n     folding chairs in the assembly room waiting for church to \n     begin. The room is large, easily accommodating the more than \n     400 men and women the shelter serves every night. Rectangular \n     signs hang from the walls with Bible verses proclaiming the \n     wonders of salvation. Men dressed in suit coats and ties \n     patrol the aisles, telling the guests not to lean against the \n     walls and not to wander around the room.\n       Some of those seated in the chairs are dressed in shabby, \n     dated clothing. Many men have overgrown beards and messy \n     hair; others are better groomed and wear newer clothes. To \n     stay the night, the guests must attend the church service. So \n     they sit, they wait and, eventually, they worship.\n       ``You either feel like you're in the military or you feel \n     like you're in jail,'' says ``Mike,'' a 35-year-old homeless \n     man staying in the shelter. ``They treat you like a child--\n     like you don't have common sense. I guess they have to do it \n     like that. Otherwise, it would be total chaos.''\n       Mike, who declined to give his real name, has been homeless \n     since his basement apartment flooded earlier this year. \n     Pacific Garden Mission is his first shelter. He can't live at \n     home because of a falling out with his family. In fact, his \n     family and most of his friends don't even know he's staying \n     here.\n       According to the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, \n     approximately 15,000 people are homeless like Mike on any \n     given night in Chicago. The Chicago Department of Human \n     Services reports that there are approximately 5,500 shelter \n     beds available in the winter. Some shelters close during the \n     summer, though, making the search for overnight housing even \n     harder.\n       Michael Stoops, Director of Field Organizing for the \n     National Coalition for the Homeless, recognizes that shelters \n     meet a gaping social need but criticizes the way homeless \n     people are treated in them.\n       ``The regimentation is abominable,'' Stoops says. ``They \n     treat people who are adults like children.''\n       High numbers force shelters like Pacific Garden, which is \n     open all year, to enforce strict rules on the people who stay \n     there.\n       ``The reason it has to be so regimented is for the safety \n     of everyone involved,'' says Pastor Phil Kwiatkowski, \n     director of the men's division at Pacific Garden. ``We want \n     this to be a safe haven.''\n       Father Jim Hoffman, director of the Franciscan House of \n     Mary and Joseph, a shelter located at 2715 W. Harrison St., \n     agrees. ``We've been at 99 percent occupancy for the last two \n     years,'' Hoffman says. ``If procedures are followed, people \n     feel safe here.''\n       8 p.m. The church service at Pacific Garden has started. A \n     college student opens the service with a prayer for those who \n     haven't been saved. A chorus of junior high girls sings. A \n     preacher delivers his sermon. ``First-timers'' are ushered \n     into a small hallway adjacent to the meeting room to await \n     counseling with one of the staff. After the service, the men \n     and women are separated. Then, sandwiches and fruit are \n     served and the guests get in line to go upstairs for bed.\n       ``When you're hungry, you go to the shelter,'' Mike says. \n     ``When you want to sleep, you go to the shelter. When you \n     want to take a shower, you go to the shelter. Without the \n     shelter where would you get these things? What would you do? \n     Where would you go?''\n       Some wouldn't go to a shelter at all. ``I would always want \n     to stay on the street instead of a shelter,'' says Joel \n     Alfassa, Street Wise vendor # 267, who was homeless for \n     almost two years. ``I'm a very independent person. I don't \n     like to be regimented, and that [freedom] is what the street \n     offered.''\n       9:30 p.m. The men stand in line for mandatory showers. \n     Belongings are left in a locked room downstairs and each man \n     is frisked before walking up to the second floor. The men are \n     given hangers and told to strip in a communal dressing room \n     next to the showers. Each man hands his hanger of clothing to \n     an attendant and takes a timed two-minute maximum shower. A \n     staff member walks in the room where the men are undressing \n     and sprays the floor with an aerosol can. The men shout their \n     approval; the spray masks the smell.\n       ``This is home for a lot of individuals,'' Kwiatkowski \n     says. ``When you're living in a communal environment, \n     everyone has to be clean.''\n       A small towel and a thin hospital gown are issued after the \n     showers and the dripping men plod their way to a bunk bed or \n     a place on the floor. The mission has approximately 250 beds, \n     but Kwiatkowski says they serve anywhere from 400 to 550 \n     people a night.\n       ``Unless you get there early to get a bed, or you're a \n     first-timer, you'll be sleeping on the hard, stone floor. \n     Unless you're exhausted, your first night in a shelter, you \n     can't sleep,'' Mike says. ``You have to be sure you're in a \n     safe area. You have to hide your things. With so many people, \n     it tends to be overcrowded; tempers flow easily. So, you've \n     got your guard up on that.''\n       ``It could be a night in hell for you,'' Mike says.\n       11 p.m. The lights are dimmed. The room is filled with the \n     sounds of snoring and farting--sounds of men going to sleep. \n     Though all the men have bathed, the room still smells of \n     sweat and body ordor. Talking is prohibited, but the noises \n     of communal living keep some like Mike from getting a good \n     night's sleep.\n       ``Man, these guys snore like crazy. A lot of people may \n     think that's not a big deal. But, let's say you're one of the \n     fortunate people that does have a job--you don't get enough \n     rest to go to work.''\n\n[[Page S12011]]\n\n       Mike works as a telemarketer for a company in Chicago. \n     Beyond being tired, the stigma of living in a shelter hangs \n     over him in the workplace. He has told no one where he lives \n     for fear of getting fired.\n       ``I would be a fool to say that I was staying in a \n     mission,'' he says. In most people's eyes being homeless \n     means you're a drunk, an addict or a criminal. Mike fears \n     that reputation--a reputation he says does not fit him.\n       ``If people knew that you are homeless or are a transient, \n     that would lessen your opportunities to advance yourself or \n     get yourself back on track,'' he says. ``In order for you to \n     advance yourself, to pull yourself out of the situation that \n     you're in, in a way you have to don a disguise.\n       But the trappings of homelessness are hard to hide. People \n     can spot it just by the grocery bags some carry. ``Who's \n     gonna go in that interview area with a bunch of bags and all \n     your clothes and try to be taken seriously?'' Mike asks. \n     ``People are dressed to the nines and here you are--you're \n     lucky to have a shirt and tie. Do you think you're gonna get \n     that job? You have to have a hell of an amount of character \n     to rise above that situation.''\n       Though the shelter gives bag lunches to those who are \n     employed during the day, Mike says it is not as helpful as it \n     could be for people who have jobs. ``You only get a change of \n     clean clothes once a week,'' he says. ``How are you are going \n     to feel comfortable going to a job wearing the same clothes \n     every day?''\n       In addition, the shelter staff often refuses to store \n     things for residents who have job interviews. ``You have a \n     hell of a time trying to convince them to let you leave your \n     clothes there for an hour without throwing them out,'' Mike \n     says. ``It seems like if you're trying to help yourself, they \n     really don't want you there.''\n       Kwiatkowski says the shelter will help guests with special \n     needs such as storage on an individual basis. Mike says the \n     clothes he stored at Pacific Garden were thrown away. Now \n     Mike stashes his clothes in a closet where he works, but says \n     he doesn't know what he'll do if someone finds them there.\n       1 a.m. Most of the residents at Pacific Garden are asleep. \n     Those who can't sleep--especially first timers--are awake \n     with their thoughts.\n       ``You've got all of this stuff on your mind,'' Mike says. \n     ``Where am I going to go in the morning? Do I smell okay? \n     What does my appearance look like? Am I presentable? Nine \n     times out of 10 I'm not because I'm wearing the same clothes \n     I was wearing yesterday.''\n       4:30 a.m. The lights go on. Residents are awakened for the \n     morning church service. Like the night before, attendance is \n     required to eat. ``All we ask is that they sit through the \n     service,'' Kwiatkowski says. ``I believe you shortchange an \n     individual if you give them a bowl of beans and a suit of \n     clothes and you shove them out the door.''\n       Not everyone likes it, though. ``It's forever in your face. \n     I mean, forever in your face when you're there,'' Mike says. \n     ``It makes you not want to go to church sometimes.''\n       Not all shelters in Chicago have the same religious \n     requirements Pacific Garden has. Not all shelters allow \n     people to keep coming back, either. ``There is no limited \n     length of stay here,'' Kwiatkowski says.\n       At Hilda's Place, a homeless shelter in Evanston, Ill., men \n     and women have three days to establish goals or they are not \n     permitted to return. ``We will not let people stay on unless \n     they are willing to work with the case managers and with the \n     staff on goals,'' says Carolyn Ellis, the shelter's director. \n     Hilda's Place does not have any religious requirements. \n     However, Ellis says mandatory showers are handled on a \n     ``case-by-case basis'' for those who need them.\n       5:30 a.m. The men are quiet as they collect their clothes. \n     Those with their own soap clean up for the day. The rest go \n     downstairs to get their bags and go to the service. Many fall \n     asleep again until they are dismissed for breakfast. \n     Breakfast consists of grits, eggs, a hard bagel and a glass \n     of water or coffee. ``The food is one of the better things,'' \n     Mike says.\n       7 a.m. When they finish eating, the men leave the shelter, \n     re-entering street life for another day. Mike's job doesn't \n     start until late afternoon, so he heads for a park bench to \n     sit for awhile.\n       ``You have nowhere to go in the morning. You're wearing the \n     same clothes. If it's raining, you're out here in the rain. \n     If it's freezing, you're out here in the cold.''\n       The stigma of homelessness follows him out of the shelter \n     and on to the streets. ``Just hanging out here in the park--\n     people act as if you're invisible,'' he says. ``Time moves \n     very slowly sitting on a bench waiting for a place to open \n     up. I wish I had enough money to go hang in McDonald's or \n     White Hen.''\n       Mike says he wishes the shelter would let people stay there \n     longer during the day. According to Kwiatkowski, the shelter \n     stays open all day during the winter but not the summer so \n     guests can use the time to look for jobs.\n       ``I don't even know of a job that's interviewing at seven \n     o'clock in the morning,'' Mike says.\n       Les Brown of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless sees a \n     larger problem than how long shelters stay open. ``The \n     biggest danger with shelters is we've begun to, as a society, \n     accept shelters as a normal way of housing people,'' he says. \n     ``It's becoming an institution--an institutionalized way of \n     helping people who really need jobs and housing.''\n       8 a.m. ``It is now eight o'clock,'' Mike says. ``Where am I \n     gonna go? '' Mike has to kill time until his job starts at \n     1:30 p.m.\n       ``For me, this is just temporary,'' he says. ``I need to \n     get the hell away from here. I want something out of my \n     life.''\n       Until he has more money, though, Mike will continue going \n     to the shelter at night. It's not a home, but at least it's a \n     place to stay.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                         who are the homeless?\n\n       In Chicago, 80,000 are homeless during the course of one \n     year.\n       42% are single men.\n       40% are families with children: The fastest growing segment \n     of the homeless population is women with children.

Mr. President, the Senate's passage of the \nProfessional Boxing Safety Act marks a red letter day for what is often \ncalled the red light district of sports. For this Senator, it also \nmarks the culmination of nearly 5 years of working to make professional \nboxing a safer sport for our young people who choose to enter the ring. \nOne of those young men, in particular, is largely responsible for \nachieving this milestone. I believe it is important that we recognize \nand acknowledge the contribution of this boxer, from my home State of \nDelaware--Dave Tiberi.\n  It was through Dave Tiberi's misfortune and subsequent hard work that \nI focused my attention up close and personal on the problems currently \nfacing professional boxing. On February 8, 1992, in a nationally \ntelevised world title fight, Dave Tiberi, an unheralded challenger, \nlost a controversial split decision to the International Boxing \nFederation's middleweight champion, James Toney. The ABC-TV announcer \nproclaimed it as ``the most disgusting decision I have ever seen.''\n  As a result of that fight, I directed that the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations undertake a comprehensive investigation of \nprofessional boxing, the first in the Senate in more than 30 years. \nUnfortunately, that investigation revealed what many of us had \nsuspected--that the problems plaguing the sport remained much as \nSenator Kefauver found them when the Senate last investigated this \nissue three decades earlier.\n  First and foremost among all the problems facing the sport today, is \nprotecting the health and safety of professional boxers. During the \nOlympics in Atlanta, we saw the great lengths to which we go to protect \nour amateur boxers. Yet, when these and other young men graduate to the \nprofessional ranks, we fail to provide even the most basic health and \nsafety protections through minimum uniform national standards. Instead, \nwe leave professional boxers at the mercy of a patchwork system of \nhealth and safety regulations that vary widely State by\n\n[[Page S12012]]\n\nState, both by rule and enforcement. In this day and age, that is not \nacceptable.\n  That is why I have worked, along with my colleague Senator Dorgan, to \nensure this legislation remedies these inequities by establishing, for \nthe first time, minimum uniform national health and safety standards. \nThese provisions will ensure that every professional boxing match in \nthe United States is conducted under these standards. Every \nprofessional boxer will know that, no matter where they fight, there \nwill be a doctor at ringside; an ambulance available; and health \ninsurance provided.\n  I also want to commend our colleagues in the House who significantly \nstrengthened this legislation by adopting a provision I have previously \nproposed--prohibiting conflicts of interest on the part of boxing \nregulators. My investigation highlighted conflicts of interest to be \namong the major problems facing boxing today, always to the detriment \nof the boxers. Dealing with this problem is essential if we are to \neffect meaningful boxing reform.\n  Dave Tiberi has never fought again, despite numerous lucrative \noffers. Instead he has dedicated his efforts to working with young \npeople in Delaware and reforming boxing. If there has ever been a role \nmodel in boxing for our young people, his name is Dave Tiberi. Although \nhe never got his world title, knowing that his hard work will protect \nfuture boxers is his big payday; and that is why Dave Tiberi will \nalways be a champion.\n  Boxing reform is not a marquee issue that appeals to a large \nconstituency. As such, it could be easily pushed aside and lost among \nall the other issues clamoring for attention in the final days of this \nCongress. Yet, professional boxing is important, not only to its \nmillions of fans, but primarily because the sport creates opportunities \nfor many young men for whom such opportunities are rare. We owe these \nyoung men a system outside the ring that works as hard to protect them \nas they do inside the ring. That is why I have worked to reform \nprofessional boxing. While it does not go far enough, I believe this \nlegislation is a significant step toward achieving that goal. I commend \nand thank my colleagues for adopting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12011-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      H.R. 3118, VETERANS' HEALTH CARE ELIGIBILITY REFORM ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. \n3118, the Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, as \namended by the committee substitute. I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of the substitute amendment, which provides for greater \nuniformity and flexibility in veterans' health care eligibility, enacts \nsignificant improvements in health care programs, and authorizes major \nconstruction projects.\n  I am especially pleased with sections of the bill that make \nimprovements in the Readjustment Counseling Service [RCS] program. As \nmy colleagues know, RCS operates over 200 community-based vet centers \naround the Nation, each of which provides a variety of services \ndesigned to help returned veterans adjust to civilian life. These \ninclude services relating to post-traumatic stress disorder, \nhomelessness, disaster assistance, sexual trauma, alcohol and substance \nabuse, suicide prevention, the physically disabled, and minority \nveterans. To date, vet centers have successfully assisted well over 1 \nmillion veterans.\n  The RCS improvements in this bill include: making World War II and \nKorea theater veterans eligible for vet center services for the first \ntime; directing VA to study the desirability of collocating vet centers \nwith outpatient clinics; directing VA to report on the feasibility of \nproviding limited, primary health care services at vet centers; making \nthe Advisory Committee on Readjustment of Veterans a permanent, \nstatutory entity; and clarifying and enhancing the status of the \nDirector of RCS, which will guarantee a degree of administrative \nautonomy for the program.\n  Mr. President, these provision are derived from S. 403, the \nReadjustment Counseling Service Amendments of 1995, which was \ncosponsored by Senators Daschle, Wellstone, Inouye, and Jeffords. S. \n403 in turn was derived from legislation I originally offered in the \n103d Congress which twice passed the Senate. I am disappointed that \nsome of the provision of S. 403 were not included in this compromise \nmeasure. These include provisions that would have: made RCS a statutory \nagency within VA, required congressional notification of proposed \nchanges to the administrative or organizational structure of RCS, \nrequired a specific RCS operating budget to be identified in VA's \nannual budget submission, and authorized vet centers to offer \nbereavement counseling to the families of service persons killed in \nservice. Nevertheless, I am deeply appreciative that many of the goals \nof that legislation have been achieved in the pending measure.\n  Mr. President, many people deserve to be recognized for their efforts \nin making possible the RCS provisions in this bill. First, I would like \nto thank Senators Simpson and Rockefeller and their respective staffs, \nnotably Chris Yoder and Bill Brew, for putting together this \ncompromise.\n  Second, I wish to recognize Al Batres, Susan Angell, Stephen Molnar, \nand other RCS employees, whose testimony before the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee in 1993 provided the original justification for my \nlegislation. Steve Molnar, Director of the Honolulu Vet Center, has \nbeen, and continues to be, a source of inspiration for his untiring \ndedication to the Aloha State's veterans.\n  Last, I wish to acknowledge the contributions of Gerry Kifer, a \nformer Congressional Fellow with my office, whose insights and hard \nwork led to the drafting of my original RCS legislation. Gerry provided \nthe focus and energy that made today's legislation possible.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I hope my colleagues can support the RCS \nprovisions contained in H.R. 3118, as amended. I urge swift enactment \nof the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12012-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S 85TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, almost 4 years ago I made a series of \nspeeches about our men and women in uniform who won the cold war.\n  I asked my colleagues to remember their sacrifice as we undertook the \nunprecedented drawdown of our All Volunteer Force.\n  I asked that we ensure that the drawdown was accomplished in a way \nthat preserved the legacy of national security which that force had \nbuilt.\n  And I called on the Congress to see that people leaving military \nservice were given a helping hand as they moved into civilian life, \nbecause we owed it to them and because the Nation needed their skills.\n  When I made those remarks, the post-cold-war drawdown was mostly in \nfront of us. Although it had started in 1987, the downsizing moved \nslowly at first and then halted completely for Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm.\n  Today, as I rise to review what has happened in the intervening 3 \nyears, the downsizing is over 90 percent complete, and next year it \nwill essentially be complete.\n  Let me begin by looking at the drawdown and how we did at meeting \nthis enormous challenge. In the late 1980's, after the disintegration \nof the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, it became clear that we could \nmake significant reductions in the size of our Armed Forces. It was \ndecided by the Bush administration and the Congress to reduce military \npersonnel by approximately one-third over a period of 5 years.\n  As a nation, we had experience with large demobilizations after World \nWar\n\n[[Page S12013]]\n\nI, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. This drawdown, however, was to be \ndifferent. The United States had never before sought to downsize an \nall-volunteer force.\n  In those earlier reductions, our conscripted soldiers were more than \nhappy to return to civilian life. In contrast, the men and women who \nhad won the cold war had all chosen a military career and expected to \nbe able to remain in uniform as long as they performed their duties \nwell.\n  Under these circumstances, nobody in the Congress or in the Defense \nDepartment knew how the downsizing would turn out, and many were \nskeptical that it would turn out well.\n  A drawdown of this magnitude could easily have caused bitterness, \nskill gaps, stalled promotion opportunities, morale problems and could \nhave created a hostile attitude toward the military across the society.\n\n  As we began to reduce the size of the force, some predicted that the \nbest and the brightest would take the opportunity to get out of the \nservice, leaving us with a less than ready military.\n  But Congress, two administrations, and the military leadership worked \ntogether to ensure that through the drawdown the force was carefully \nshaped to maintain quality and readiness.\n  We in the Congress provided creative tools, like early retirement and \nspecial separation benefits, which allowed the Pentagon to carefully \nshape the force and to address emerging problems as they occurred.\n  In this regard, each of the military services--and especially the \nArmy--did a tremendous job in balancing the needs of current and future \nreadiness with the imperative of easing in every way possible the \ntransition to civilian life of those who would be leaving the service \nas a direct result of the drawdown.\n  Mr. President, the results are impressive:\n  The quality of our force is higher than at the start of the drawdown. \nThe proportion of active duty enlisted personnel in the upper aptitude \ncategories has increased from 56 percent in 1987 to 66 percent in 1995. \nThose in the lowest acceptable aptitude category dropped from 11 \npercent of the force in 1987 to just 6 percent in 1995.\n  Our force is more experienced, as measured by age and length of \nservice. For example, the average age increased 1.4 years from 1987 to \n1995 (to 28.7) and there are 45 percent fewer enlisted service members \nunder age 22.\n  And, despite warnings that the drawdown would sacrifice the \nmilitary's hard won gains for women and minorities, their \nrepresentation has actually increased. The percentage of women in \nactive service has increased from 10 percent to 13 percent. Total \nminority representation in the active force has increased from 27.4 \npercent to 30.5 percent. Minority field grade officers showed an even \nlarger increase: from 7 percent of the total to 12 percent.\n  As we achieved these impressive results, we maintained our obligation \nto be fair to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Only a very \nsmall number of service members were involuntarily separated to achieve \nour downsizing goals.\n  Let me repeat that, although over 1 million people have left the \nmilitary during the drawdown, fewer than 2,000 service members were \ninvoluntarily separated. The Pentagon used tools such as the special \nseparation benefit, provided by the Congress, to perform this miracle.\n\n  The Nation will be reaping the benefits of that accomplishment in \nrecruitment and public good will for years to come.\n  We also took special care with the service members who had dedicated \ntheir professional lives to the military. In order to maintain an \norderly flow through the ranks, we had to thin at all experience \nlevels, including those with 15 to 19 years in the service.\n  Service members with this many years in uniform had made a long-term \ncommitment to military, but had not yet reached the 20 years necessary \nfor retirement benefits. In many cases their decisions to stay in the \nArmed Forces were predicated on being able to make it to 20 years to be \neligible for retirement.\n  An easy approach would have been simply to dismiss these people--but \nthat would have been short-sighted and, I believe, morally \nindefensible. However, using the early retirement program which I \ncalled for in 1992 and which became law in fiscal year 1993, we were \nable to keep faith with these patriots and save taxpayer money, too, by \noffering early retirement. Over 34,000 men and women have availed \nthemselves to the early retirement option.\n  By shaping the force thoughtfully, we also maintained promotion \nopportunities that helped us keep the highly skilled and experienced \nservice members we needed to retain.\n  In sum, the drawdown has been a real success. The credit for that \nsuccess goes to those who administered this effort, to my colleagues \nand former colleagues in the Congress, to the leadership of the \nmilitary services, and to the rank and file service members who have \nperformed so brilliantly during this time of turbulence.\n  The second part of my call in January 1992, was to see that those \ndeparting the service were helped in their transition to the civilian \neconomy. It would have been wasteful and wrong to send these people out \ninto the job market with no guidance or support.\n  I am pleased to report that the military has used the programs \ncreated by the Congress to benefit departing service members on an \nunprecedented scale.\n  The effort begins 3 months before a service member leaves the \nmilitary, when they are offered preseparation counseling. This includes \ninformation concerning relocation, employment issues, financial \nassistance, education and training benefits, health and life insurance \nrules, veterans benefits and assistance in developing individual \ntransition plans.\n\n  The next step in preparing for the civilian job market is the \ntransition assistance program workshop. Working in coordination with \nthe Departments of Labor and Veterans Affairs, the Department of \nDefense has implemented transition assistance programs at some 200 \nsites in the United States, and more overseas.\n  Staffed by outplacement and employment experts, 330 transition sites \nworldwide provide intensive individual counseling to departing service \nmembers and their families. These programs teach resume writing and \ninterviewing, provide information on the current job market and help \nthe attendees understand how best to translate their military skills \ninto skills needed in the civilian work force. The courses have also \nbeen put on video to accommodate the special needs of sailors deployed \nat sea for their last tour and those service members stationed at \nremote duty locations.\n  The rewards of this program can be seen with people like Jerry Sack. \nAs Jerry was getting out of the Marine Corps in California, he had two \ndreams, to be a fireman and to move to Georgia, where his wife had \ngrown up.\n  He said at the outset that he thought these twin goals were nearly \nimpossible. But the transition assistance people worked intensively \nwith Jerry on his resume, interviewing techniques, and job search \nstrategies.\n  Then they gave him a lead on a civilian fire chief's job at the \nMarine Corps logistics base in Albany, GA. With the tap team's \nguidance, he hit the books to prepare for the interview. The team heard \nthat Jerry got his dream job when he wrote back saying:\n\n       Because of your staff, and only because of your staff, I \n     was able to prepare myself personally and on paper to be \n     selected for this position as fire chief.\n\n  The Department of Defense has also created an automated job matching \nsystem. Departing service members enter their resumes, skills, and job \ncriteria and they can be matched with private employers who use the \nservice free of charge. This system and a transition bulletin board \nmaintained by DOD, is a great example of how the information super \nhighway can be used to help veterans.\n  Here are just a few examples of the results of this system: a number \nof individuals have been placed with Infotec Corp. in Virginia helping \nto track down missing children; a dozen more are working as managers \nand line officers at the Indiana Department of Corrections; three were \nhired by Metropolitan Life Insurance; and the new engineering \ncoordinator at Telspan International was hired through this system. And \nthere are many more who\n\n[[Page S12014]]\n\nhave been hired as computer programmers, stockbrokers, and supervisors.\n\n  One satisfied employer who used this high-technology service wrote \nback saying, ``the guys coming out of the military are our best \nworkers.''\n  That comes as no surprise to anyone here, but it is good to know the \nword is getting out to employers nationwide.\n  All of this has led to a much friendlier transition for many \nthousands of military families.\n  The best indicator of our success is that thousands of employers who \nhire veterans come back to hire more through the automated systems and \njob fairs. A healthy economy is certainly helping, but the transition \nprograms are ensuring that people leaving the military can match their \nskill to high quality civilian jobs.\n  The heart of my challenge 3 years ago was to help departing service \nmembers use their skill and leadership abilities to address some of our \nNation's pressing needs. The problems I talked about then are, \nunfortunately, still with us today including violence in the streets \nand a need for discipline and role models in our schools.\n  In the fiscal year 1994 Defense Authorization Act, we created a \nprogram within the temporary early retirement authority which \nencouraged retiring service members to enter public and community \nservice employment.\n  Under this program, if an early-retiree takes a job in a critically \nneeded skill area, he or she can accrue additional military retirement \ncredit up to the 20-year mark.\n  Today almost 9,000 individuals who chose early retirement are working \nin public and community service positions and, as such, are earning \nadditional credits toward their military retirement. This program has \nencouraged many of our former service members to use their talents to \nimprove their communities.\n  There has been a big push lately for the Federal Government to help \nStates and localities cope with crime. But in many ways, the quality of \nlaw enforcement will never be better than the quality of the front line \npolice officers patrolling the street. That's why I suggested that \nservice people, with their training to think on their feet and handle \ncomplex and dangerous situations, be encouraged to pursue a law \nenforcement career.\n\n  To this end, we authorized the Troops to Cops Program. A combined \neffort of the Departments of Defense and Justice, Troops to Cops will \nprovide funds to local law enforcement agencies to offset the initial \ncost of hiring former service members as police officers. We may never \nhave statistics on the number of crimes prevented or how much safer \npeople feel as a result of having these highly-trained professionals on \ntheir local police force, but America will certainly be the better for \nit.\n  Perhaps the most successful community service initiative we \nestablished for people leaving the service is the troops to teachers \nprogram. This program provides stipends to assist people leaving the \nmilitary in obtaining certification as elementary and secondary school \nteachers or teachers' aides.\n  In addition, it helps disadvantaged local schools that have a \nshortage of teachers and teachers' aides to hire program participants. \nThis program helps bring together one of our greatest national needs, \ntough but inspiring teachers for tough schools, with one of our \ngreatest national assets the men and women trained and molded by the \nArmed Forces.\n  Departing service members placed in the troops to teachers program \neverywhere from South Carolina to New York are writing back to the \nDepartment of Defense, raving about the support they've gotten.\n  To date, 4,337 departing service members have been selected for the \ntroops to teachers program; 1,482 are now in training programs leading \ntoward the necessary certification. And over 800 former soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines are already in classrooms helping America's \nkids. This is a success story of the first order.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the post-cold war drawdown of our forces and \nthe transition programs for departing service members are a case of \ngovernment doing a job well. The Congress, the executive branch, and \nthe uniformed military each did their part, and we all had the \nreadiness of the force and the well-being of the service members in \nmind as we created and executed these policies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12012-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NAZI WAR CRIMES DISCLOSURE\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my strong \nsupport to H.R. 1281. This sense of the Congress measure is intended to \nact as a first step to urge several Federal agencies through the \nFreedom of Information Act, to open their files that contain \ninformation about individuals that are believed to have participated in \nNazi war crimes.\n  This sense of the Congress measure stems from the efforts of \nRepresentative Maloney of my home State of New York. Representative \nMaloney propose H.R. 1281, a bill that would have amended the National \nSecurity Act of 1947, and required Federal agencies to make public \nunder the Freedom of Information Act, all information regarding \nindividuals who participated in Nazi War Crimes during World War II.\n  Mr. President, it is very important that we make a strong statement \nin this body that all the facts relating to the Holocaust be brought to \nlight. I believe that it is our duty to never forget the millions of \npeople who died in the Holocaust. Further, I believe we also have a \nduty to the survivors and victim's families to pursue every answer into \nthis terrible period in the history of man. Yet, over 50 years have \npassed since the end of World War II and we still have many unanswered \nquestions. Some of these questions can be answered with the cooperation \nof our own Federal agencies, but, some agencies have inexplicably \nblocked access to files and information that could help to shed light \non the Holocaust and Nazi war criminals. These answers could help to \nprovide piece of mind to millions of people around our country and \naround the world. Further, the release of these Nazi war crime files \ncould provide historians with a more clear view of these horrible \nevents over half a century ago, thus helping to ensure the despicable \nacts of the Holocaust are never repeated.\n  The survivors and victim's families have waited too long. The time to \nopen the files is now, there can be no more excuses. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort and ask for their support on this \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12014-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12014-S12015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE 1996 OLYMPICS GAMES\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this year marked the 100th \nanniversary of the Olympic games. As with any Olympiad, hard work, \nblood, sweat, and tears culminated in 2 weeks' worth of contested \ninternational sportsmanship. The best of America, and the world, \ncompeted for the thrill of victory again on American soil in Atlanta, \nGA. There, over 10,000 athletes from 197 countries were brought \ntogether--with the world watching--to witness 17 days worth of \ncomradery, expectation, determination, triumph, and defeat.\n  I am proud that West Virginia played a key role in allowing the 1996 \nOlympic summer games to proceed. Two historical cities of my State, \nWheeling and Martinsburg, hosted separate Olympic time-trial qualifying \nevents for cycling. This was a first. West Virginia had never hosted an \nOlympic trials event. But our role contributed to the selection of the \nmost superior men and women cyclists ever to represent the United \nStates. For cycling enthusiasts, the eyes of the Nation were focused on \nthese world-class riders. But they also witnessed the best attributes \nof my State--the beautiful outdoors, friendly people, culture, \ncommunities, and spirit that defines the proud residents of Appalachia.\n  The 1996 Olympic games, America's Games, began on July 19 when the \nOlympic torch entered Olympic Stadium. The torch carried a flame that \nhad traveled from Athens, Greece, on an 84-day voyage to the United \nStates host city. The flame represented both an ending and a beginning.\n  It symbolized an ending to the first 100 years of the modern Olympic \ngames. Since 1896, we have seen our world savaged by wars, famines, \nDepression, and conflict. At times, it seemed unlikely that not much \nmore than the spirit of the games would survive. But it did. Each and \nevery time, the flame was relit--its message of hope and strength \nbrought the world\n\n[[Page S12015]]\n\ntogether through the efforts, the joys, and the sorrows of individual \nathletes.\n  We shall celebrate the almost miraculous accomplishments of American \nsprinter Jesse Owens, setting record after record in Nazi Germany while \nthe crowds cheered him to victory. And the tenacity of the Philadelphia \nbutcher's apprentice, Smokin' Joe Frazier, who struck heavyweight gold \nin Tokyo even though he had a broken right hand. How about American Bob \nBeamon's incredible 29-foot 2\\1/2\\-inch. performance in the long jump \nin Mexico City, the longest Olympic record to ever stand. Swimmer Mark \nSpitz, who owned the press of the first half of the Munich games by \ndominating seven events. A personal memory I will always have concerns \nthe perfect gymnastic performances of Mary Lou Retton, a Fairmont, WV, \nnative, who in Los Angeles won the women's all-around. I will also \nnever forget one of the most touching images of will and determination \never to occur at the games. This was showcased in Barcelona when \nDerrick Readman of Great Britain fell in the 400 meter competition \nafter severely pulling a hamstring and finished the race leaning on his \nfather. These are all old, but cherished memories.\n\n  The torch also symbolized a beginning, the beginning of the next \ncentennial in Olympic history. The challenge is set in the new \ncentennial to rekindle the two basic values that are at the core of the \nOlympic movement. One is the competitive fire that spurs individuals to \npursue excellence in their sport and demand the best of themselves. The \nother is the cooperative spirit that tempers individual competition \nthrough teamwork, harmony, and understanding.\n  I think the 1996 Atlanta games has led us into the next centennial \nquite well. As host, the city translated its confidence in itself into \nrespected internationalism. It helped guide us all once again across \nevery barrier of race, creed, language, and culture to seek a common \nground of understanding sportsmanship. This was not without cost, but \nthe city and Olympic officials responded to the needs of athletes, \ncoaches, spectators, tourists, and residents with swift action. They \nalso continued to profile veteran competitors and fresh faces who \nembody the Olympic motto of Citius, Altius, Fortius--swifter, higher, \nstronger--and the epitome of excellence. People such as Michael \nJohnson, Kerri Shrug, members of the dream team, Dan O'Brien, Janet \nEvans, Tom Dolan, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, West Virginian Randy Barnes, \nCarl Lewis, Mia Hamm, and Gwen Torrence immediately spring to mind. \nThey proudly represented the strong heritage and the competitive nature \nencompassed in the Olympic spirit, and I commend them and every other \nOlympian who has ever dared to follow a dream to be the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12014-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12015-S12017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT AND THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Defense of Marriage \nAct and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, voted on a few weeks \nago. The former passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate \nand the latter was rejected in the Senate and not voted on in the \nHouse. I voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and against the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act. I would like to explain why I did \nso, and why I believe passage of DOMA and the failure of ENDA were \nproper.\n  In enacting Federal legislation, I believe our first consideration \nshould always be whether a Federal solution both legitimate and \nnecessary. Legitimate; that is, under our Constitution's allocation of \npowers between the national government and the States. Necessary in the \nsense that the States cannot solve a particular problem on their own.\n  Using these criteria, the Defense of Marriage Act is a limited, \nlegitimate, and needed Federal intervention to protect the States' \nability to set their own policies regarding single-sex marriage. By \ncontrast, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act would have imposed a \none-size-fits-all solution governing employment discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation without any clear and convincing showing \nthat there is a national problem in this area. In addition, ENDA would \nhave adopted measures far too sweeping even on the hypothesis that some \nnational legislation was needed.\n  Consider first the Defense of Marriage Act, which dealt with whether \nthe States' have an obligation under Federal law to recognize single-\nsex marriages. Not, it is important to understand, whether States may \nrecognize such marriages under their own laws. DOMA leaves the States \nentirely free to do so or not as they may please. In fact, it leaves \nthe States entirely free, through their legislatures or their courts, \nto define marriage in any way they choose.\n  DOMA deals only with the following issue: If State A decides to allow \npeople of the same sex to marry, does Federal law require State B to \ntreat these individuals as married as well if they decide to move to \nState B? DOMA answers that question in the negative: No, Federal law \ndoes not require State B to treat them as married just because State A \nchooses to do so.\n  This is not merely a hypothetical question. In fact, the Supreme \nCourt of Hawaii has already strongly hinted that in its view the Hawaii \nConstitution requires recognition of same-sex marriages, with a final \nruling to that effect from a lower Hawaii court expected any day now.\n  The extraterritorial effect such a ruling must receive is a \nquintessentially Federal matter. Indeed, even if Congress had done \nnothing, whether the other 49 States would have to treat individuals of \nthe same sex married in Hawaii as married outside of Hawaii would still \nhave been decided by Federal law. Although no State has yet recognized \nsame sex marriages, all 50 States generally recognize marriages \nperformed in another State, largely on account of Federal conflict of \nlaw rules and the Federal Full Faith and Credit Clause. Without any \ncongressional legislation, whether the States would also be required to \nrecognize same-sex marriages contracted out-of-state would likewise \nhave turned on these Federal laws, and therefore, only Federal \nlegislation can assure the States will be permitted to decide this \nissue for themselves.\n  Additionally, some States, including my own home State of Michigan, \nhave recently enacted laws explicitly refusing to recognize same-sex \nmarriages contracted in other States. Whether these laws would be \nallowed to stand likewise would have been a Federal issue even in the \nabsence of any action by Congress. The courts, including, ultimately, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, would have either enforced these exceptions as \nbeing consistent with the Federal Constitution's Full Faith and Credit \nClause or would have struck them down pursuant to that Clause.\n  Thus it is very hard to see how congressional action to make clear \nthat other States need not recognize a same-sex marriage simply because \nit was recognized in Hawaii can possibly be cast as an illegitimate \nintervention by the national government. The national government \nnecessarily has to choose sides, either to say that the Hawaii view \nshall prevail in all 50 States, or that it need not do so, or that it \nshall do so in some instances. How it chooses sides is the only open \nquestion. The Federal government will either resolve this issue by \nmeans of a statute adopted by a Congress elected by the people of the \nStates and signed into law by the popularly elected President or by \nmeans of a U.S. Supreme Court decision applying existing Federal \nconflict-of-law principles and the Federal Constitution's Full Faith \nand Credit clause as best it can. But in any event, the Federal \nGovernment will be resolving what effect these marriages will have \noutside of Hawaii.\n  That being the case, it is clear to me that there is no reason to \nprefer that this decision be made by the Federal courts than by the \ndemocratically elected components of the Federal Government. Rather, it \nis better for this choice to be made by the democratically elected \nbranches--that is, by Congress and the President.\n  Having established that the decision at issue--the extraterritorial \neffects of Hawaii's laws--is inevitably one that must be made by the \nnational Government, and one that should be made by that Government's \nelected rather than life-tenured officials, the question that remains \nto be decided is the bottom line: should other States be required by\n\n[[Page S12016]]\n\nFederal law to recognize single-sex marriages if one State decides to \ndo so, or shouldn't they? It is clear to me that the choice most \nconsistent with principles of federalism is to specify that the other \n49 States will not be required to follow Hawaii's lead. That again is \nwhat DOMA does. My colleagues who have argued that federalism counsels \nagainst congressional action are missing the obvious. The virtues of a \nfederalist system--permitting experimentation among the States, and \nrecognizing differing values and standards in different communities--\nare plainly best served by making clear that the other States need not \nrecognize same-sex marriages entered into out of State. It is \nCongress's failure to act to make this clear that could well result in \nsignificant Federal intrusion into this State matter by allowing the \nFederal courts to impose Hawaii's answer on the other 49 States. By \nenacting DOMA, this Congress left each of these States free to decide \nfor themselves whether to recognize such marriages or not.\n\n  Some DOMA opponents argue that such a congressional resolution of \nthis matter is unconstitutional because it violates the Full Faith and \nCredit Clause. They are wrong. That Clause expressly permits the \nCongress to specify whether and to what extent particular State \nstatutes and judgments shall receive extra-territorial effect. The Full \nFaith and Credit Clause states, in full:\n\n       Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the \n     public Acts, Records, and Judicial Proceedings of every other \n     State; And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the \n     Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be \n     proved, and the Effect thereof.\n\n  The Full Faith and Credit Clause explicitly gives this Congress the \nauthority to prescribe the ``effect'' of a State's public acts, \nrecords, and judgments. As Prof. Michael McConnell of the University of \nChicago Law School, has persuasively argued, this includes the \nauthority to prescribe no extraterritorial effect to a particular \ncategory of a State's public acts, records, and judgments. This also \nserves what is often said is the purpose of the Full Faith and Credit \nClause--above all--to preserve harmony among the States. By allowing \nthe States to make their own judgments about same-sex marriages, DOMA \ndoes just that. Indeed, the courts have found that the States have some \nretained authority along these lines under the public policy exception \nto the Full Faith and Credit Clause--even in the absence of an Act of \nCongress. Congress surely has the power to reinforce the court-created \npublic policy exception to the Full Faith And Credit Clause.\n  And that is all the Defense of Marriage Act does, by providing that:\n\n       No State, territory, or possession shall be required to \n     give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding \n     of another State, territory, or possession respecting a \n     relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated \n     as a marriage.\n\n  In short, DOMA does not prohibit States from adopting laws permitting \nsame-sex marriages; it does not require them to do so. Hawaii remains \nentirely free to continue on its own path, as does Michigan. The only \neffect DOMA will have on the States is to prevent what the courts might \notherwise find to be the possibly constitutionally-compelled result \nthat every State recognize same-sex marriages contracted in another \nState, where such unions are permitted. By simply stating that the \nFederal Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require the States to \nrecognize same-sex marriages, DOMA leaves the States free to recognize \nthem or not recognize them as they see fit.\n\n  This is completely different from the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct, to which I will now turn.\n  Right now, the States are free to have or not have their own laws \nprohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual \norientation and their own means of enforcing these laws. Nine States \nhave them, forty-one do not.\n  If this Congress had adopted ENDA, we would have ended State \nexperimentation and forced one uniform solution--punitive damages and \nall--onto every State. Rejecting ENDA is the choice that leaves the \nStates free to adopt whatever policies they choose. Thus, from a \nfederalism perspective, ENDA was an intrusion on the States' ability to \nmake choices, whereas DOMA was a device for facilitating State-choice.\n  That is not to say that ENDA would necessarily be wrong for that \nreason. Sometimes national solutions are precisely what are called for \nto address a problem the States cannot solve on their own. But that is \nnot the case here. The need for a national law such as ENDA has yet to \nbe demonstrated. I am not suggesting that there are not problems--I \ndon't know if there are. But neither do my colleagues. There have been \nno hearings, no testimony, no reports on the reason for national \nlegislation on this matter.\n  According to estimates published in Harpers magazine and the \nPersonnel Journal, the average annual income for gays and lesbians is \nabout $36,000, compared to about $18,000 for the population at large. \nThe average household income for gays and lesbians is estimated at \n$47,000, also substantially above the average household income for the \ngeneral population. The study reported on in the Personnel Journal also \nfound that gays and lesbians are more than twice as likely to hold \nmanagerial or professional positions than heterosexuals.\n  Does this prove that there is no discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation in the work force? Of course not. There may be a \nserious problem here--but we just don't know. Moreover, if there is, a \nnumber of States have adopted antidiscrimination laws. I would like to \nknow what gave rise to them, what they provide, how they compare to \nwhat is being proposed here, and if they are leading to less employment \ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation in the States that have them \nthan exists in the States that do not.\n  It also ought to be noted that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act \nwould have effected a major change in this country's civil rights laws. \nFor the first time, a characteristic strongly related to an \nindividual's behavior would effectively have the legal status of a \ncharacteristic like an individual's race or gender. This is an enormous \nand unprecedented expansion of the civil rights laws. Arguing against \ngays in the military, Colin Powell said:\n\n       Skin color is a benign, non-behavioral characteristic. \n     Sexual orientation is perhaps the most profound of human \n     behavioral characteristics. Comparison of the two is a \n     convenient but invalid argument.\n\n  We need to think much harder than we have about this before embarking \non a change of this magnitude.\n  Finally, even if I were persuaded that we needed a national law on \nthis matter, ENDA went much, much too far. In particular, it would have \nforced organizations charged with the care of children to hire, retain, \nand promote individuals without regard to sexual orientation. It would \nhave imposed the same obligation on many religious organizations, \nirrespective of their religious convictions. I think even many who \nbelieve we should pass some kind of law in this area would rightly be \nhesitant to cover entities of these types with the first national law \nadopted on this subject.\n  First, as to organizations that work with children. ENDA would have \nforbidden discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual \norientation by any employer with 15 or more employees. This would \ninclude not only large corporations that sell their products to adults, \nbut also public schools, private schools, day camps, child care and \nfoster care centers, baby sitting agencies, and a large number of other \ninstitutions. There is not even a weak argument to the contrary since \ndespite the protestations of the bill's proponents, ENDA contained no \nprivate organization exception.\n  ENDA also would have applied to the hiring decisions of the Boy \nScouts, the Girl Scouts, and other, similarly-situated organizations. \nProponents of the act claimed otherwise, relying on ENDA's exception \nfor bona fide private membership clubs. The Boy Scouts and the Girl \nScouts, however, are extremely unlikely to qualify--the same private \nclub language in other statutes has generally been interpreted to mean \ntruly small and exclusive societies. Even some exclusive, members-only \nclubs with secret membership committees have been sued by the EEOC as \nfalling outside the exception. The only contrary authority is a Federal \ncourt decision whose holding is that the Boy Scouts do not constitute a \nplace of\n\n[[Page S12017]]\n\npublic accommodation under Title II of the Civil Rights act--in other \nwords, the cited case really stands only for the proposition that the \nBoy Scouts are not a restaurant.\n  In addition to covering a variety of children's organizations, the \nAct would also have applied to a large number of religious \norganizations. While the bill appeared to include an exception for \nthem, it defined the term ``religious organization'' so narrowly as to \nexclude a wide array of religious organizations and activities. \n``Religious Organization'' was defined to mean only:\n  A religious corporation, association or society; or\n  A religious school if the school is owned, controlled, managed, or \nsupported by a religious corporation, association or society--or the \nschool's curriculum is directed toward the propagation of a particular \nreligion.''\n  Even then--the religious organization's for-profit activities would \nhave been subject to the bill's prohibitions.\n  Under this definition, the hiring decisions of religious radio \nstations and bookstores--which are not religious corporations--\nreligious pre-schools--which are not religious schools--and religiously \naffiliated colleges that are not divinity schools and are not \ncontrolled or supported by a religious corporation would have been \ncovered. Even churches' and religious schools' decisions to hire \nindividuals to sell books or church or school memorabilia would have \nbeen covered if those activities were conducted for profit. This, of \ncourse, on top of the fact that as I explained earlier, the hiring \ndecisions of non-religious entities involving kindergarten teachers, \ncamp counsellors, Little League coaches, Day Care Centers, or Boys Town \ncounsellors would have been covered by the Act.\n  Given the novelty of any kind of prohibition of discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation, it seems to me that the bill's coverage \nsurely should have been significantly narrower.\n  Finally, even if these problems could have been solved, there is a \nserious risk that covered entities would be subject to harassing \nlawsuits under this bill by any individual dissatisfied with an \nemployment decision. Since sexual orientation isn't subject to easy \nproof, being a state of mind--unlike gender or race--ENDA would have \nallowed anyone with a job where 15 or more people are employed--or \napplying for such a job--to sue for perceived employment discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation. Even employers found innocent of \neither knowing or caring what an employee's sexual orientation is, \nwould potentially be saddled with expensive and time-consuming lawsuits \ndefending themselves. Thus--irrespective of its necessity--the specific \nlegislation at issue was overly-broad in scope and virtually impossible \nto apply as intended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12015-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED STATES POLICY TO EGYPT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have visited Egypt and other \nnations in the Middle East several times. Egypt is playing a key role \nin the peace process. As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \nsaid, ``Without Egypt, there is no war, without Syria, there is no \npeace.'' A strong and healthy Egypt that has an open and peaceful \nrelationship with Israel and its neighbors is a key to ensuring \nstability in the Middle East.\n  Former President Anwar Sadat and the current President, Hosni \nMubarak, have helped develop a vibrant and growing Egypt and secure an \nenduring stable peace with Israel. Under President Sadat, Egypt became \nthe first Arab nation to make peace with Israel. Making that peace \nallowed Egypt to concentrate on other domestic priorities and Israel's \nother neighbors to become accustomed to the notion of peace with \nIsrael. And, even after his death, President Sadat's dream of an \nexpanded peace in a more stable Middle East began to take greater \nshape.\n  President Mubarak continued Sadat's rapprochement with Israel and \nhelped contribute to plans for establishing a Palestinian homeland. He \nalso worked for greater dialog with Israel and other Arab nations that \nremained technically, at war with Israel. In light of Egypt's \nprecarious position, though, President Mubarak has been under immense \npressure from domestic as well as international forces.\n  Since 1992, the Government has been under attack from an Islamic \nguerrilla group that has committed several acts of terrorism. In \nresponse, the Egyptian Government has for the past 4 years resorted to \nmilitary tribunals, whose methods and procedures are often unfair, to \ntry Islamic militants, as well as moderate political opposition \nmembers. Egyptians have also been illegally detained and allegedly \ntortured while in police and military custody. While Egypt's human \nrights record is not as bad as most nations in the region, I am still \nconcerned.\n  I am also concerned that too much of U.S. foreign aid to Egypt goes \nto the military. Egypt's unemployment rate is over 17 percent, almost \n50 percent of its people live at or below the poverty line, and \npollution remains an intractable problem. The United States can help \nEgypt more effectively by putting less emphasis on military aid, and \nmore on economic aid so that Egypt can invest in its infrastructure, \nworker training, and education.\n  Egypt, as a leader in the Arab world, sets an example for other \nnations to follow. It cannot remain a stabilizing force if its military \ngrows, while its economy suffers and its own citizens are mistreated \nand jailed without trial or thorough investigation. Fighting terrorism \ndoes not have to lead to abrogation of civil liberties. As I approach \nmy return to academia, I will continue to encourage ways for the United \nStates Egypt partnership to achieve greater peace and stability in the \nMiddle East.\n  Mr. President, we must recognize that a stable and secure Egypt is \ngood for peace in the Middle East. It is in the United States best \ninterst to see a democratic Egypt with human rights observed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12017-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SCOTT CORWIN\n\n Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, as I look back over my years of \nservice here in the Senate, I am struck by how much international \nrelations have changed and how much they have stayed the same. In just \nthe last few years, we have witnessed the dramatic end of the cold war \nand a wave of democracy spreading around the globe from the Republic of \nChina on Taiwan to the newly established countries in Eastern Europe. \nAdvances in technology have opened new channels of communication \nbetween people of different cultures and languages. Economic \ndevelopment, investment and trade have become major factors in \nbilateral relationships. And in unprecedented fashion, the \ninternational community has reached consensus on the need to reduce \nnuclear weapons, to protect the environment, and to promote \ninternational peace and security.\n  Yes some things have not changed since my arrival in the U.S. Senate. \nThe world is still plagued with civil wars. Children continue to lack \naccess to basic health care and immunizations. And despite the lessons \nlearned from the horrible atrocities that took place under the Nazi \nregime in World War II, we have failed to stop genocide and ethnic \ncleansing from occurring once again. In wars that have ravaged both the \nformer Yugoslavia and Rwanda, aggressors have flown in the face of \ninternational law and committed the gravest crimes against humanity. If \nwe in the international community are determined to learn the lesson \nthis time,\n\n[[Page S12018]]\n\nwe must support the work of the International War Crimes Tribunals. The \nwork of these tribunals is critical in the effort to establish genuine \nand long-lasting peace in war-torn areas around the globe.\n  Created by the United Nations Security Council, the current two war \ncrimes tribunals seek to find justice for the victims of genocide and \nother war crimes that took place in the former Yugoslavia and in \nRwanda. After witnessing the brutality of the wars in these two \nregions, the international community seized the opportunity to once \nagain publicly prosecute and punish the planners and executioners of \nthe genocide. The tribunals at Nuremberg after World War II have served \nas an important precedence for the current tribunals. The trials at \nNuremberg were the first time that the international community \nrecognized some crimes as so heinous that all states have the right and \nresponsibility to prosecute the offenders. I am proud to say that my \nfather, the late Herbert C. Pell, a former congressman from New York \nCity, was President Franklin Roosevelt's representative to the U.N. War \nCrimes Commission which established the Nuremberg Tribunals. It is a \ntragedy that today there is once again a need for these tribunals to \npunish those who commit atrocities and other crimes against humanity.\n  The task confronting the two war crimes tribunals is immense and \ncomplex. In both the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, U.N. \ninvestigators are struggling to collect documentation and eyewitness \naccounts of the murder, rape, ethnic cleansing, and other horrible \ncrimes that were committed during those violent conflicts. But despite \nthe difficulties encountered in trying to amass evidence and to arrest \nthe accused, the international community has recognized that the work \nof the tribunals is critical to finding a long-term solution to the \nconflicts in both Bosnia and Rwanda. Unless the perpetrators of the \ngenocide are held accountable for their actions, the cycle of violence \nwill not be broken and could start once again in either country. \nEqually alarming, unless the international community decisively \ncondemns these crimes, others may be encouraged to commit similar acts \nwithout fear of retribution.\n  The significance of the war crimes tribunals has been emphasized \nmost compellingly by the head prosecutor of the tribunals, Justice \nRichard Goldstone. In a recent statement to the Canadian Bar \nAssociation at the eleventh Commonwealth Law Conference, Justice \nGoldstone noted that:\n\n       Without meaningful justice, there cannot be enduring peace \n     in either the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda . . . it is surely \n     unrealistic to expect the survivors to forget and forgive--to \n     accept blanket amnesties and impunity for those most \n     responsible . . . Accountability is essential if the hated is \n     finally to come to an end.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit a copy of Justice Goldstone's \naddress for the Record.\n  As the head prosecutor for both tribunals, Justice Goldstone has \nplaced an indelible mark on the course of international human rights \nlaw. Under his tenure, the Yugoslav tribunal has indicated 76 persons, \nand the Rwandan tribunal has indicted 19. Despite constant frustrations \ncaused by insufficient resources and communications problems, the \ntribunals are setting important legal precedence for prosecuting those \nwho commit appalling atrocities in the name of conventional warfare. It \nis truly a testament to the legal, diplomatic, and political skills of \nJustice Goldstone that so much progress has been made. With this in \nmind, I would like to note my own deep regret that Justice Goldstone \nwill be leaving the tribunals at the end of this month to return to \nSouth Africa and a seat on its constitutional court. Over the last few \nyears, I have had the privilege of meeting with Justice Goldstone on \nseveral occasions, and I found him to be an eloquent and influential \nspokesperson for the tribunals. He will be sorely missed, but I will \njoin with many others in expressing my high expectations for his \nsuccessor, Louise Arbour. We look forward to seeing the work of the \ntribunals continue with the same high caliber of leadership set by \nJustice Goldstone.\n  Clearly this is a critical time for the war crimes tribunals. Now \nmore than ever, the international community must renew its commitment \nto the tribunals so that the progress accomplished thus far is not \nlost. The hard work of Justice Goldstone, and of the prosecutors, \njustices, and staff, certainly merits greater financial and political \nsupport from all U.N. member states. The victims who have survived the \ngenocide and other horrible crimes are looking to the tribunal to see \njustice handed down. We must ensure that the tribunals are given the \nresources and political will to achieve their mandates. That is why I \nstrongly supported the Clinton administration's efforts to establish \nthe Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals through the United Nations. And this \nyear, I joined my colleagues in supporting a provision of the fiscal \nyear 1997 foreign operations appropriations bill to provide $25 million \nof U.S. financial support to the tribunals. Of course, U.S. support \nalone is not enough. But through the contributions and cooperation of \nall states, the international war crimes tribunals will work to ensure \nthat the human rights of all people are protected under international \nlaw.\n  Justice Goldstone's address follows:\n\n                       Prosecuting War Criminals\n\n       Almost a year ago, in Ottowa I was invited to address the \n     Conference of Commonwealth Chief Justices and International \n     Appellate Judges on the work of the UN International War \n     Crimes Tribunals. It was extremely encouraging that the \n     subject of the prosecution of war crimes found a place on the \n     agenda. It is no less encouraging that almost a year later, \n     at this important Conference, the subject is again receiving \n     attention.\n       Before the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials, the prosecution of \n     war criminals would universally have been considered to be of \n     national and not international concern. Victims of war crimes \n     had recourse only to national courts which had jurisdiction \n     over the perpetrators. States whose forces were responsible \n     for the crimes seldom, if ever, prosecuted their own \n     combatants. That state of affairs was changed by the Nazi \n     Holocaust. It was that affront to human dignity which led to \n     the internationalisation of humanitarian law. The recognition \n     by the international community of the concept of a crime \n     against humanity was the essential key to international \n     jurisdiction. There were crimes so evil and so over-reaching \n     that it was the right and the duty of all of humankind to \n     try, and if found guilty, punish the perpetrators. There was, \n     in short, universal jurisdiction. It was that recognition \n     that provided the moral and legal underpinning for the \n     conferment of jurisdiction to punish perpetrators outside the \n     country where the crimes were committed or where the accused \n     happened to be found.\n       At the time of the establishment of the United Nations, it \n     was widely assumed that an international criminal court would \n     be set up. Indeed, there was an express reference to such a \n     court in the 1948 Genocide Convention. But it was not to be. \n     States were too jealous of their own sovereignty even to \n     allow their citizens to be surrendered to an international \n     jurisdiction even for the most serious war crimes. Alas, \n     there was no court before which Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein and \n     other post-World War II genocidal leaders could be \n     prosecuted.\n       The establishment by the Security Council of the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n     came as a surprise. It was generally accepted by the experts \n     that an international criminal court would have to be \n     established by treaty. It had never been seriously \n     contemplated that such a court would be established as a \n     measure which could assist in the re-establishment of \n     international peace and security. It was that determination, \n     under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, that gave the Security \n     Council the power to take that step. It was that act and the \n     subsequent establishment of the Rwanda Tribunal that have \n     drawn wide attention to the global dimensions of justice. In \n     the case of both tribunals, the Security Council made a \n     determination that the widespread and systematic atrocities \n     perpetrated in both countries constituted a threat to \n     international peace and security. That, in itself, was \n     significant, because it was the first time that the linkage \n     had ever been made by that body. Even more significant was \n     the consequential decision that bringing to justice the \n     individuals responsible for those violations was an \n     appropriate response to that threat. The linkage between \n     justice and peace in the international arena was born.\n       Notwithstanding that action by the Security Council, there \n     have been serious challenges to the concept that peace and \n     justice not be in opposition to each other. There were, and \n     still are, those who argue that the establishment of the \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia would derail any nascent \n     peace process. Just recently, an anonymous article appeared \n     in the 1996 Human Rights Quarterly published by The Johns \n     Hopkins University Press, in which the author wrote:\n\n       ``Targeting violators of human rights and bringing them to \n     justice is essential. Accusation, however, comes more easily \n     than making peace. The quest for justice for yesterday's \n     victims of atrocities should not be pursued in such a manner \n     that it makes today's living the dead of tomorrow. That, for \n     the human rights community, is one of the lessons of the \n     former Yugoslavia. Thousands of people are dead who should \n     have been alive--\n\n[[Page S12019]]\n\n     because moralists were in quest of the perfect peace. \n     Unfortunately, a perfect peace can rarely be attained in the \n     aftermath of a bloody conflict. The pursuit of criminals is \n     one thing. Making peace is another.''\n       This debate over the potential of the Tribunal to \n     destabilise the peace process was particularly intense just \n     before the negotiations at Dayton. More particularly, there \n     were those who argued that it would be impossible to \n     negotiate a peace agreement in circumstances where the \n     leaders of a principal party were under indictment for war \n     crimes. Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic were, of course, at \n     the centre of that concern. The implication was that peace \n     would require the sacrifice of the laudable but unrealistic \n     objective of pursuing justice. Happily the cynics have been \n     proven wrong. Notwithstanding the indictment twice over both \n     Karadzic and Mladic, the peace agreement was signed in Paris \n     and its military objectives have been successfully carried \n     out by IFOR. I have no doubt that it those alleged war \n     criminals had been present at Dayton no agreement would have \n     been reached. And, if they had been allowed to stand for \n     election next month that election would not take place. \n     Certainly, the Muslim leaders would not consider \n     participation.\n       The position with the Rwanda Tribunal is somewhat \n     different. In the first place, it was established by the \n     Security Council at the request of the Government of Rwanda--\n     the Government whose forces brought an end to the genocide of \n     mid-1994. The leaders who were responsible for the \n     organisation of the atrocities leading to the murder of about \n     one million people had fled the country. They are not amongst \n     the estimated 70,000 people who are today being kept in \n     atrocious prison conditions in Rwandese prisons. They have \n     moved to other countries in Africa, Europe and North America. \n     Some of them took much of wealth of Rwanda with them. For \n     these reasons, in particular, it is appropriate that there is \n     an international tribunal. Few countries are likely to be \n     willing to extradite persons to Rwanda before that country's \n     criminal justice system has been re-established and it has \n     reasonably acceptable prison conditions.\n       The Rwanda Tribunal was established at the end of 1994. It \n     took many months to staff an office in very difficult \n     conditions in Kigali. It took the UN Headquarters eleven \n     months to appoint a Registrar for the Tribunal at its seat in \n     Arusha in Northern Tanzania. The first cells there were only \n     completed two months ago. At the time of writing this address \n     seven indictments have been issued. Three of those indicted \n     have been transferred from Zambia to the Tribunal in Arusha. \n     They have made their initial appearances and the first trial \n     is about to begin. Apart from the persons already indicted, \n     provisional charges have been brought against four persons \n     held in The Cameroons. They are expected to be transferred to \n     Arusha in the coming days. They include Colonel Theoneste \n     Bagasora, against whom we have evidence that, as chief of the \n     Cabinet of the Ministry of Defense at the time the genocide \n     began, he was one of the central persons responsible for the \n     atrocities which followed. Another was one of the senior \n     directors of the radio station, Radio Milles Collines, that \n     spewed out hateful propaganda which was so important a weapon \n     in the hands of the perpetrators.\n       I have no doubt that without meaningful justice, there \n     cannot be enduring peace in either the former Yugoslavia or \n     Rwanda. Where peoples have witnessed and suffered mass \n     systematic murder, rape, torture and other unspeakable \n     atrocities, and where millions have been displaced, it is \n     surely unrealistic to expect the survivors to forget and \n     forgive-to accept blanket amnesties and impunity for those \n     most responsible. Such a policy would inevitably \n     perpetuate the cycles of violence which have marked the \n     recent histories of both Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. \n     Accountability is essential if the hatred is finally to \n     come to an end-there is no substitute for avoiding \n     collective guilt upon which genocide feeds. In short, \n     without effective justice, there is little hope for an \n     enduring peace in societies suffering the aftermath of \n     gross human rights violations.\n       Unfortunately, notwithstanding the remarkable and \n     praiseworthy efforts of the Security Council, we are still a \n     long way from effective international criminal justice. The \n     failure by the Implementation Force (IFOR) to go out and \n     arrest those indicted by the Yugoslav Tribunal is a matter \n     for deep regret. The 60,000 strong force undoubtedly has the \n     capability to do so, Under the Dayton Agreement it has the \n     legal right to do so. The fault lies not with the IFOR \n     commanders but with their political bosses. Their policy is \n     not to risk the lives of members of IFOR. But what are there \n     for. As their name proclaims, they are there to implement the \n     Dayton Agreement-but in this important respect they are being \n     precluded for doing so. As is well known, the policy of the \n     North Atlantic Council is that only those who literally fall \n     into the hands of the IFOR soldiers will be arrested. It \n     should come as no surprise that not one arrest has taken \n     place since the IFOR troops first entered Bosnia Herzegovina \n     at the end of last year. And, if the policy is not changed \n     none is likely to be made. Far from endangering what may be a \n     fragile peace in Bosnia, the arrest of some of the leading \n     Serb and Croat indicated war criminals would have avoided \n     many of the recent difficulties of Mr. Carl Bildt and the \n     OSCE election organizers. It would have avoided the \n     unfortunate spectacle of Mr. Karadzic making fools of some \n     international leaders. That policy is also calculated to \n     undermine the credibility not only of the international \n     community but also of the Tribunal and international justice \n     itself in the long term, this could create a disastrous \n     precedent for the future exercise of international criminal \n     jurisdiction.\n       The establishment of the two ad hoc tribunals for the \n     former Yugoslavia and Rwanda has to be understood in a \n     broader context. Even their most ardent supporters would not \n     suggest that the response by the Security Council to two \n     specific instances of humanitarian law violations is a \n     satisfactory solution to the problem of world-wide massive \n     war crimes. Many people question, with justification, why we \n     are investigating and prosecuting violations in the former \n     Yugolslavia and Rwanda and not similar shocking conduct in \n     other parts of the world. It is disciminatory, and worse, the \n     decision as to where such atrocities should be prosecuted is \n     a political one taken by a political body-the Security \n     Council. It is hardly fair or just that, by definition, war \n     crimes committed by a permanent member of the Security \n     Council, or by a country protected by such a member, would \n     never be the subject of the exercise of that power. That \n     notwithstanding, the establishment of the two tribunals is a \n     significant step in the direction of having a permanent and \n     independent international criminal court To the extent that \n     they are successful, they will hasten that development. And, \n     if we are unsuccessful in The Hague and Kigali, we will \n     retard that process. It is for that reason that those of us \n     involved in this process are so concerned when the \n     international community fails adequately to support and \n     protect a judicial body created by it.\n       On the more positive side, we have accomplished far more \n     than many informed observers anticipated when the two \n     tribunals were established. The Yugoslav Tribunal has issued \n     16 indictments in which some 76 defendants have been named. \n     One of them, Erdemovic, a former member of the Bosnian \n     Serb Army, recently pleaded guilty to crimes against \n     humanity. He was involved in the murder of innocent Muslim \n     civilians in the vicinity of Srebrenica in July 1995. He \n     accepted responsibility for shooting at least seventy of \n     the many hundreds who were killed. At this time he has not \n     yet been sentenced by the trial chamber. Apart from \n     Karadzic and Mladic, other leaders indicted Dario Kordic, \n     the former vice-president of the self-proclaimed Croatian \n     Republic of Herceg-Bosnia and Milan Martic, the \n     ``President'' of another self-proclaimed Serb \n     Administration in Knin prior to its destruction last year \n     by the Croatian Army. The most recent indictment relates \n     to the town of Foca in Bosnia Herzegovina. The charges \n     arise out of the systematic rapes and sexual assaults \n     perpetrated against the female population of that town by \n     members of the Bosnian Serb Army. At present we have seven \n     of the indictees in our custody, but alas, none of the \n     leaders to whom I have just referred.\n       The trial of Dusko Tadic, which began many weeks ago, is \n     likely to be followed by that of Tibotil Blaskic, a Croatian \n     general, who voluntarily surrendered himself to the Tribunal \n     to stand trial. He is the former regional commander of the \n     Croatian Defense Council in the Lasva River Valley area of \n     Bosnia Herzegovina, and was subsequently promoted to the \n     Chief of Staff of the Mostar Headquarters of the HVO. He has \n     been indicted on charges of crimes against humanity and grave \n     breaches of the Geneva Conventions.\n       We have also brought a number of reconfirmation hearings \n     where indicted persons have not been arrested and surrendered \n     to the Tribunal. In these proceedings, the Prosecutor is able \n     to present, in public, some of the evidence in support of the \n     indictments. This is not a trial in absentia but a proceeding \n     designed to enable a trial chamber to issue an international \n     arrest warrant. The most recent proceeding of kind was that \n     against Karadzic and Mladic and resulted in the issue of such \n     warrants against both of them. Having regard to the evidence \n     led it is even more difficult to accept the supine policy of \n     the leading western nations with regard to their apprehension \n     and surrender to the Tribunal.\n       This is an important time in the lives of both tribunals. \n     The financial crisis of the United Nations has made our \n     progress very difficult. We have constantly been under-\n     resourced. Without the generosity of a number of governments, \n     and particularly the United States and The Netherlands, we \n     would not be at the trial stage in either The Hague or \n     Arusha. I have already referred to some of the credibility \n     problems facing the Yugoslav Tribunal. If the people we \n     indict are not brought to trial then we will not be able to \n     fulfil our mandate. In particular, we will be seen to have \n     failed by the victims themselves. The Security Council \n     undoubtedly raised their expectations in establishing the \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and endowing it with \n     peremptory powers under the UN Charter. It sent a message to \n     those victims that the international community had taken \n     notice of what they had suffered and that message carried \n     with it the promise that some justice would be afforded them. \n     Their expectations were again raised when, from time to time, \n     the Tribunal issued indictments. Imagine their frustration \n     when they heard and read that IFOR would not be permitted to \n     take the risk of seeking to arrest those indicted. Imagine \n     their frustration\n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\n     when Karadzic and Mladic continue to flaunt the terms of the \n     Dayton Agreement. Whether the elections are able to take \n     place in a reasonably free and fair atmosphere still remains \n     to be seen.\n       In Rwanda the problems are different and no less serious. \n     Two years after that country was destroyed by its then \n     genocidal rulers, its criminal courts are still not \n     functioning. The frustration of the members of its present \n     government cannot be exaggerated. Not the least of their \n     frustrations is what they understandably regard as an \n     unacceptable delay in the International Tribunal becoming \n     operational. Then, there is the unfortunate imbalance by \n     reason of the Rwandan Law recognizing death sentence while \n     the International Tribunal has no such power. Add to this the \n     recent wish of the Rwandese Government wishing to try leading \n     members of the former government in Kigali and the clash \n     between that wish and the Tribunal legitimately exercising \n     its right of primacy and insisting on the leaders being tried \n     in Arusha. Finally, there is the disturbing fact that the \n     Rwanda Tribunal has increasingly become forgotten by the \n     Western media. This may change when the trials are under way.\n       I hope that I have said sufficient to bring to your \n     attention some of the positive and some of the negative \n     features which have emerged in consequence of the \n     establishment of the two tribunals. Without strong public \n     pressure in a number of countries they would certainly not \n     have come into being. Without continued pressure they will \n     not succeed. It is for that reason, in particular, that I am \n     grateful for this opportunity to bring to your attention some \n     of the important issues relating to the future of the \n     tribunals. Not only are they important for the victims. If \n     they succeed they can also provide a powerful deterrent for \n     the future. Your support for the work of the tribunals and \n     for a permanent international criminal court is of cardinal \n     importance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12017-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BARBARA SHEFFIELD\n\n Mr. BOND.

It is a great pleasure to recognize Ms. \nSheffield for her many years of loyal service to the General Services \nAdministration [GSA], Heartland Region. Many Missourians have truly \nbenefitted from her life-long dedication as a Federal employee.\n  Barbara Sheffield joined the GSA on January 23, 1963, as a GS-3 card \npunch operator with the Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital in \nKansas City. Distinguished by her cheerful and efficient demeanor, she \nwas quickly promoted, and eventually moved into a GS-7 position as \ninventory management specialist for the Veterans' Administration.\n  In 1976, Ms. Sheffield took a short break from her career, and in \nDecember of the same year, she resumed her employment with GSA as a \ntemporary GS-4 clerk typist. Starting over did not deter her, and Ms. \nSheffield's commitment to serving others carried her through an ensuing \n20 years with GSA. Since 1979, she has worked as a GS-12, Congressional \nLiaison Specialist, working with congressional clients, setting up \ndisaster field offices and maintaining a host of other special \nprojects.\n  Ms. Sheffield's inestimable contributions and respected professional \nexperience will be sorely missed when she retires from GSA on January \n3, 1997.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Frank M. \nGrazioso, who has been selected by the Connecticut Grand Lodge Order \nSons of Italy of America to be the recipient of the ``Good Citizen of \nthe Year Award.'' Mr. Grazioso will be honored at a ceremony on Sunday, \nOctober 20, 1996, in North Haven, CT. I would like to take this time to \nbriefly acknowledge a few of Mr. Grazioso's contributions to the \ncommunity throughout his career.\n  Mr. Grazioso has served the community in a number of public offices. \nHe has been a New Haven city alderman, a corporation counsel, and \nmember of the Civil Service Commission, as well as a member of the \noriginal board of the Shubert Performing Arts Commission and a member \nof the Board of Harbor Commissioners. Mr. Grazioso has also chaired \nmany activities in my home State of Connecticut including the Columbus \nDay celebration and the State of Connecticut Columbus 500th \nAnniversary. He currently serves as vice-president of the Italian-\nAmerican Historical Society and has recently been elected general \ncounsel and national officer of the national Italian American \nFoundation.\n  Through his work with the Order Sons of Italy in America, Mr. \nGrazioso has participated in national and international charitable \ndonations and has helped in raising over $500,000 dollars for academic \nscholarships annually. Mr. Grazioso has worked closely with the Italian \nGovernment on wide range of educational and philanthropic activities. \nIn 1991, Mr. Grazioso was honored by the Italian Government for his \nrelief efforts on behalf of Italian earthquake victims. His work has \nbeen consistently outstanding and his commitment to helping his fellow \ncitizens is much appreciated.\n  I salute Mr. Frank M. Grazioso for his continued dedication to \nserving his community and I congratulate him on his being named the \n``Good Citizen of the Year.''

Mr. President, I would like to take one last opportunity \nin this Congress to discuss on the floor of the Senate a matter that is \nof high priority to me: reform of the Federal Food and Drug \nAdministration. As I have stated many times, FDA reform is critical if \nthe United States is going to continue to be the world leader in the \nfield of medical technology, and I, for one, plan to pick up the mantle \nthat was dropped in relation to this legislation this year.\n  And I believe the amendments that I offered that were adopted during \nconsideration of Senator Kassebaum's bill by the Labor Committee \nrepresent some important principles on which we will need to build a \nnew reform bill in the 105th Congress. One of these amendments dealt \nwith the dissemination of new information relating to health \ndiscoveries uncovered by other authoritative Government agencies, such \nas the National Institutes of Health or the National Academy of \nSciences. I believe the American public has the right to be as informed \nas possible about the nutritional value--or even the scientific \npotential value--of the food they eat.\n  Another amendment adopted would allow a system of national uniformity \nfor the regulation, labeling, and marketing of nonprescription drugs. \nThis is an important, pro-consumer provision. It would put an end to \nthe confusing requirements that various States and localities choose to \nimpose on these common products, ensure more efficient interstate \ncommerce of these products, and will not force manufacturers to bear \nthe cost of such mandates which are generally passed on to purchasers. \nThis amendment also contributes to a higher standard of safety by \nexempting compelling State or local requirements, and creating a \nmechanism to make truly worthy requirements national.\n  Mr. President, I was especially pleased to see report language \nincluded by the committee acknowledging that other FDA-regulated \nproducts, ``may also lend themselves to such a comprehensive system.'' \nI would hope that the starting point of this provision next year will \ninclude cosmetics, prescription drugs, and biologics along with \nnonprescription products. The value of governing these products by a \nsingle, nationwide system is potentially vast. And, Mr. President, I \nthink that discussion of such a comprehensive system for the regulation \nof food and food additives should be part of the debate.\n  This provision also dovetails nicely with another amendment that was \naccepted by the Labor Committee. For example, there is a global trend \nof international harmonization for products such as cosmetics: The \ncountries in the European Union, Latin American, and various Asian \ncountries are working toward regulatory cooperation. The Labor \nCommittee, recognizing the significance of mutual recognition \nagreements [MRA] and the on-going negotiations the U.S. Commerce \nDepartment and others are involved in, accepted my amendment urging the \ncontinuation and completion of such MRA's.\n  I am concerned by reports that many times, when the folks negotiating \nthese agreements are very close, it is the FDA that throws a wrench \ninto the works. I hope that the agency will take\n\n[[Page S12021]]\n\nthe instruction passed as part of the Labor Committee bill seriously in \nregard to these international agreements. We need to see them \ndemonstrate a greater willingness to recognize the standards used in \nother countries. As I have stated many times, the Food and Drug \nAdministration in this country does not have a corner on the ability to \nregulate well.\n  These are the sort of FDA reforms that I believe will promote a more \nefficient, higher quality regulatory process at the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I look forward to revisiting these issues, and all of \nthe other aspects of FDA reform, early in the 105th Congress. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12020-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REACH-BACK TAX RELIEF\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nCochran in sponsoring this reach-back tax relief bill, S. 2135, to \nalleviate some of the unintended and inequitable hardships inflicted on \ncertain companies by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of \n1992. Our bill would provide substantial relief to numerous small \ncompanies. It would also use a small portion of the existing surplus of \nmore than $120 million in the combined health benefit fund created by \nthe act to allow a 2-year moratorium on the reach-back premiums. This \n2-year period will give the Congress adequate time to study the current \noperations of the act and to remedy the inequities of the current law.\n  In the past, I have said that the Coal Act produced several major \nachievements. First, it assured retired coal miners and their \ndependents that their health benefits were permanently secure. The act \nprovided a statutory foundation to carry out the commitment of all of \nus to see that these benefits are paid. It also provided a necessary \nlegal mechanism to transfer excess pension funds into the health funds. \nIn addition, the act required certain cost-containment measures that \ngreatly increased the cost effectiveness of retirees' health benefit \nprograms.\n  Despite its significant accomplishments, one feature of the Coal \nAct--its reach-back funding mechanism--has engendered great hardship \nand controversy. Many companies, who long ago had withdrawn from the \nBituminous Coal Operators Association [BCOA] believing that they had \nmet all of their legal obligations to fund retiree health benefits, \nfound themselves, in 1992, subject to a draconian reach-back premium \ntax that they could not have foreseen and for which they could not have \nplanned. This retroactive tax enforced by the full power of the \nInternal Revenue Service and the threat of dramatically compounding \npenalties has produced severe hardship for many companies subject to \nit. Some of them are trying to pay it by depleting their assets and \nhence their ability to generate income. Others have tried to ignore it \nand are now being subjected to collection suits by the Combined Fund.\n  The 102d Congress was persuaded that the Bituminous Coal Operators \nAssociation could no longer afford to fund retired miners' health \nbenefits on a current basis as it had for the previous 25 years. The \nCongress was told that miner's health benefits faced a crisis of \nskyrocketing costs that would bankrupt the miners' benefits fund if the \nCongress did not act. The Congress was given a choice of either an \nindustrywide tax or the reach-back tax to fund health benefits. The \npassage of the Coal Act saves members of the BCOA more than $100 \nmillion a year over its prior annual benefit payments.\n  Fortunately the skyrocketing costs predicted by the BCOA have simply \nnot occurred. The cost containment measures contained in the act and \nthe decline in population of retirees and dependents served by the fund \nare largely offsetting the inflation in health care costs. Thus, the \nreach-back tax is simply injuring companies who cannot afford to pay it \nwhile giving members of the BCOA a windfall benefit which they do not \nwant to give up.\n  Mr. President, the problems being caused by the reach-back tax are \njust beginning. Many original supporters of the Coal Act recognize that \nit needs some fine tuning. The Cochran-Conrad bill would provide for a \nGAO study of current operations and a 2-year respite from the reach-\nback tax, while assuring that the overriding goal of providing health \ncare benefits of retired miners is preserved. I hope that my colleagues \non the Senate Finance Committee will give this legislation the early \nconsideration it deserves in the new Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12021-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12021-S12022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AUTHORIZING HUD TO REGULATE PROPERTY INSURANCE PRACTICES\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development [HUD] is aggressively pursuing regulation of property \ninsurance practices, supposedly because of the Federal Fair Housing Act \n[FHA]. HUD takes the position that the FHA, which prohibits \ndiscrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, \nand other similar factors, authorizes HUD to regulate property \ninsurance practices that purportedly affect the availability of \nhousing. I strongly disagree with this interpretation by the FHA. I do \nnot believe that HUD has the authority to regulate the insurance \nindustry, let alone have any recognizable expertise in this area.\n  HUD's insurance-related activities are directly contrary to the \nlongstanding position of Congress that the States should be primarily \nresponsible for regulating insurance. In the McCarran-Ferguson Act of \n1945, Congress expressly provided that, unless a Federal law \nspecifically relates to the business of insurance, that law shall not \ninterfere with State insurance regulation. The FHA, while expressly \ngoverning home sales and rentals and the services that home sellers, \nlandlords, mortgage lenders, and real estate brokers provide, makes no \nmention whatsoever of the service of providing property insurance. \nMoreover, a review of the legislative history shows that Congress \nspecifically chose not to include the sale or underwriting of insurance \nwithin the purview of the FHA.\n  HUD's assertion of authority regarding property insurance is a major \nthreat to State insurance regulation. In August 1994, HUD announced \nthat it was undertaking a new rulemaking that would prescribe use of \nthe disparate impact theory in determining property insurer's \ncompliance with the FHA. Although HUD has stalled on the promulgation \nof such disparate impact rules, it remains firm in its position that \nthe disparate impact test applies under the FHA, and that the FHA \napplies to insurance.\n  Under the disparate impact theory, statistics showing that a practice \nhas a disparate impact on a particular protected group may suffice to \nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination, without any showing of \ndiscriminatory intent. The use of this theory may be appropriate in \ncertain contexts, but in the area of insurance, it is wholly \ninappropriate and, in fact, potentially harmful.\n  The disparate impact theory assumes unlawful discrimination based \nsolely on statistical data. Thus, under a disparate impact approach, \nstatistics showing differences in insurance coverages by geographic \narea, wholly attributable to different risks in those areas, could be \nassumed to reflect racial bias merely because of a correlation between \nrace and geographical locations.\n  The application of the disparate impact test to property insurance \npractices could undermine the ability of State regulators to ensure, as \nthey are required by law to do, that the companies under their \njurisdiction remain solvent. If insurers accept loss exposures to \nprotect themselves against charges of disparate impact, or if they \nclassify risky loss exposures as lower-risk exposures for this purpose, \nthey may incur financial problems, because premiums collected may be \nfar lower than the amount needed to cover losses incurred, and policy \nholders' surplus will have to be used to pay claims. If an insurer \nengages frequently in such improper underwriting, its surplus can be \ndrained to the point of insolvency.\n\n  It is precisely for the purpose of preventing insolvencies while \nproviding a means to make insurance more available that the States have \nadopted Fair Access to Insurance Requirements [FAIR] plans. HUD's \ndisparate impact approach is flatly inconsistent with these \ncongressionally authorized plans. Generally, the FAIR plans make \nproperty insurance available to applicants who have been rejected by \nthe voluntary insurance market so that higher risks may be allocated \nequitably among insurers operating in a State. The FAIR plans thus help \nto prevent\n\n[[Page S12022]]\n\nindividual insurer insolvencies by providing for risks to be spread \namong all property and casualty insurers.\n  HUD's disparate impact approach fails to take account of the careful \nbalancing of objectives reflected in the FAIR plans. Indeed, HUD's \napproach completely ignores the key difference between unfair \ndiscrimination and sound insurance underwriting practices that take the \nactual condition of the property into consideration. Clearly, it is \nunfair to discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nfamilial status, national origin, or handicap. But what HUD fails to \nrecognize is that it is not unfair--indeed it is legally required by \nthe States--for an insurer to evaluate the condition of the property \nand determine the risk. State insurance statutes not only deem these \nrisk assessments to be legal, but indeed require them to prevent \nunfairness.\n  States and the District of Columbia have laws and regulations \naddressing unfair discrimination in property insurance. The State \nlegislatures have debated and enacted a wide variety of \nantidiscrimination provisions to ensure that an insurer does not use \nrace or other improper factors in determining whether to provide a \ncitizen property insurance. The States are actively investigating and \naddressing discrimination where it is found to occur. In light of these \ncomprehensive protections against discrimination, HUD's insurance-\nrelated activities are yet another example of unnecessary and \nduplicative Federal bureaucracy.\n  Let HUD enforce FAIR, and let the States regulate the insurance \nindustry. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12021-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDWARD McGAFFIGAN, JR.\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, when the Senate convenes in \nJanuary, lots of familiar faces will be gone for one reason or another, \nand those of us returning will take up our work without the company and \nhelp of so many who are important to us and to this institution.\n  Because the Senate acted so quickly and responsibly on one matter \nbefore the August recess, one of my staff members is already gone, off \nto what is sure to be another outstanding period in an already \ndistinguished career. Late in August, Ed McGaffigan was sworn in as a \nCommissioner on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Many of my \ncolleagues and their staffs are well acquainted with Ed, and hold him \nin high regard, as do all of us in my office who have valued his \ncompany and counsel over the years.\n  Ed was among the first people I hired when I came to the Senate in \n1983. Recommended to me by Joe Nye, Ed was then the assistant director \nof the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Prior to \nhis work in the White House, he had been in the Foreign Service for 7 \nyears, 2 of which were spent as science attache at the American Embassy \nin Moscow.\n  From February 1983 until August 1996, Ed handled defense, national \nsecurity, technology, and foreign policy issues in my office, as well \nas nonproliferation and export control policy, and personnel and \nacquisition reform. Early on, he was recognized by staff and \nconstituents alike as a high-minded individual of bedrock honesty and \ngreat intelligence. I once heard our former colleague, Lloyd Bentsen, \nsay that there is a special bond forged between a new Senator and the \npeople who help him or her get started. Setting up an office, sorting \nout the priorities, and learning to say ``yes'' or ``no'' at the proper \ntime on this floor take a certain devotion and effort of will on the \npart of all concerned. Ed McGaffigan was one of those who helped me get \nstarted here, and I could not have guessed that how valuable this \nintense, brilliant man would become to me, the people of New Mexico, \nand, indeed, the people of this country because of his service to the \nSenate. I could not have known how much we would all come to depend on \nhis intellect, his great curiosity, and his unswerving commitment to \ntruth.\n  Emerson, who was a student at the Boston Latin School more than 100 \nyears ahead of Ed, anticipated him and knew his value in his essay on \n``Power,'' when he wrote: ``Concentration is the secret strength in \npolitics, in war, in trade in short in all management of human affairs \n* * *. A man who has that presence of mind which can bring to him on \nthe instant all he knows, is worth for action a dozen men who know as \nmuch but can only bring it to light slowly.''\n  Mr. President, Ed McGaffigan has concentrated his career on public \nservice. We are fortunate that this is so, and fortunate, too, that we \nhave in him not just a superb public official, but a true \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12022-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IMPORTANCE OF OPEN LANDS NEAR TETON NATIONAL PARK\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few \nmoments on an issue that is so very dear to the hearts of every citizen \nin my State--indeed most citizens of our Nation: I speak of the \nimportance of open spaces.\n  Now, I believe it is safe to say that some of us take our open spaces \nfor granted--a charge that applies--especially so --to those of us \ninhabiting our Nation's western regions. Most of us, upon taking an \nobjective look at our Western States, conclude the dire \nenvironmentalist warnings of imminent coast to coast asphalt are \nshrill, exaggerated and foundationless. And yet, as with any other \nhysterical manifestation, there is a kernel of truth hidden beneath the \nhyperbole.\n  My State is blessed with many spectacular vistas, but perhaps none \nmore so than the stunning Grand Teton mountains. Unless you have seen \nthem yourself, you simply cannot appreciate their visual impact. They \nseem to come rearing up out of the prairie to tower high above our \nheads before plunging straight back down into the prairie again. In the \nvalley beneath them lies the city of Jackson Hole. This is a city that \nhas experienced booming growth in recent years as people from all over \nthe Nation search for places to raise their families and make their \nfortunes that are not overtaxed, overregulated, or crime or pollution \nridden. It has been both Wyoming's blessing and its curse to fit this \nbill so perfectly, and nowhere is this troubling dichotomy better \nexemplified than in the city of Jackson Hole.\n  Traditionally a ranching area, that town has now become a tourist \nmecca. But as pleased as environmentalists are to see land use \nindustries give way to tourism, this same phenomenon has resulted in \nthe destruction of heretofore open ranchlands which have been sold off \nbit by bit to the developers. It is an unfortunate and oh-so slippery \nslope. For the more development which takes place in the valley at the \nbase of the Tetons, the higher the land values--and their accompanying \nproperty taxes--climb. The higher the property and estate taxes climb, \nthe more difficult it is for these generations old ranching families to \nstay in business. This represents a far more serious situation than \nmany eastern Members of this body can possibly realize. Cattlemen have \nlong been the hapless holders of one of the most razor thin profit \nmargins of any industry in this Nation. Today, they are going out of \nbusiness left, right and center, Mr President, and the last thing they \ndo before they turn out the lights for good, is to sell off their \nproperty bit by bit to real estate developers who then build expensive \nhomes that only the wealthy can afford--we call them ``log cabins on \nsteroids.''. The view of those mountains is spectacular and these \ndevelopers and real estate agents charge for it accordingly.\n  Mr. President, the critical importance of preserving these incredible \nviews--euphemistically referred to as ``view sheds'' by the land \nmanagers--available to all is of no small import to my State or the \nNation. We need to be more business friendly. We need to keep our tax \nappetites under control. We absolutely need to reduce contrived \nregulation on our cattle industry and we need to ensure its access to \nFederal and State grazing lands and reasonable grazing fees. Above all, \nwe must work to keep our ranchers ranching and our open lands open, in \norder to prevent the developers from overrunning this fragile and \nmagnificent part of our Earth. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12022-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12022-S12023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SCOTT CORWIN\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I noted earlier, committee \nstaff have been working night and day all throughout this month to \nproduce an acceptable omnibus appropriations bill. This has been a real \nhardship on the staff, but most of all on one of our majority staff on \nthe Commerce, Justice,\n\n[[Page S12023]]\n\nand State Subcommittee. I say this because Scott Corwin was married in \nPortland, OR, on August 24. His bride, Kristen, has been out in Oregon \nsince that time, waiting for Congress to conclude the people's business \nand recess sine die.\n  So, I note that while we are very sorry to hear that Scott Corwin is \nleaving our CJS Subcommittee and Washington, DC to return and live in \nOregon--I'm sure that he is happy and we should be happy for him.\n  Getting right to the point, Scott Corwin is the consummate \nprofessional. He is a graduate of Dartmouth College in Senator Gregg's \nhome State, and a graduate of the University of Washington Law School. \nEven though his roots are in the Northwest, Scott came to Washington, \nDC to work for Ambassador Bob Strauss' law firm in 1987. Since 1991, he \nhas served our distinguished chairman, Mark O. Hatfield. Since February \n1995, Scott has served on our State, Justice, and Commerce \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, Scott Corwin is the type of dedicated public servant \nwho is so essential to our legislative system. He was assigned a number \nof appropriation accounts ranging from the U.S. attorneys to the \nSupreme Court to the Maritime Administration. Scott is a quick study \nand he dug into the details and specifics of these agency programs and \nbudget requests. He soon mastered the details and became a real \nappropriator.\n  It became obvious to me and other Members that Scott came to truly \ncare about the agencies that were under his review on behalf of Senator \nGregg and the majority. Scott was the first to ferret out soft dollars \nthat are unnecessary. But, he also stood up for programs that deserved \nour support. He was especially tenacious in his defense of small agency \nprograms, like the Marine Mammal Commission--which the House of \nRepresentatives has proposed to cut significantly. In the case of \nagencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we \nwere fortunate to have someone so knowledgeable in earth sciences, \nfisheries, and oceanic research.\n  Scott Corwin will be missed on both sides of the aisle. It will be \nhard, if not impossible, to find such a talented individual to take his \nplace. We wish him all the best as he returns to Oregon along with my \nfriend, Senator Mark Hatfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12022-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12023-S12024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDICAL PROCEDURES PATENTS\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the omnibus \nappropriations bill being considered today includes S. 2105, \nlegislation I introduced regarding the enforcement of patents for pure \nmedical procedures. I greatly appreciate Senator Gregg's efforts to \ninclude this provision.\n  Patent law has been a cornerstone of both law and economics since the \nfounding of our Nation. The issuance of patents was one of the few \npowers expressly granted to the Federal Government by the Constitution.\n  Patents allow inventors to recoup their investment and thereby \nencourage continuous innovation. Without the protection of patents, \nindividuals, and businesses would be reluctant to invest their time, \nmoney, and energy into developing new technologies.\n  While the appropriateness of patents in general has long been \nestablished, it has been somewhat controversial with respect to health \ncare. Initially, the medical community took a dim view of the \npatentability of therapeutic drugs or devices. Many felt that it was \nmorally wrong to profit from improvements in medical care. For \ninstance, the first application for a patent on aspirin was denounced \nas an attempt to blackmail human suffering.\n  In time, however, the medical community and others came to realize \nthat, without the benefit of patent law, many improvements in medical \ncare would never materialize.\n  As in other areas of human endeavor, improvements in health care \noften require significant investments of time and money. Without the \nability to recoup these investments through patents, critical research, \nand development would never get off the ground.\n  The appropriateness and importance of allowing patents for \npharmaceuticals and medical devices is now well-established. But the \nappropriateness of patenting medical innovations that do not involve \ndrugs or devices but are simply improvements in surgical or medical \ntechniques remains highly controversial. I think for good reason.\n  Unlike innovations in medical drugs and devices, innovations in pure \nprocedures--such as discovering a better way to suture a wound or set a \nbroken bone--are constantly being made without the need of significant \nresearch investments.\n  Allowing a doctor to enforce a patent on such improvements would have \ndisastrous effects. Furthermore, innovations in surgical and medical \nprocedures do not require the midwifery of patent law. They will occur \nanyway as they have throughout history.\n  My legislation would prevent the enforcement of so-called pure \nmedical procedure patents against health professionals. It would in no \nway, however, change patent law with respect to biotechnology, medical \ndevices, drugs. or their methods of use. As a result, this narrowly \ntailored legislation would in no way discourage the important research \nbeing done in these areas of medicine.\n  I intended to offer my legislation as an amendment to the Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill because a related amendment was \noffered by Congressman Ganske when the House considered this bill. That \namendment--which passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 295-128--took a \nvery broad brush approach. It would have prohibited the Patent Office \nfrom issuing any medical procedure patents.\n  Because the scope of the Ganske amendment was not clearly defined, it \ncould have impacted many worthwhile patents in biotechnology and \npharmacology. Accordingly, representatives of these industries came to \nme after the passage of the Ganske amendment to express their interest \nin crafting an alternative approach. The legislation included in this \nbill is the result of that effort.\n  Because the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill was never \nconsidered on the Senate floor, I did not have the opportunity to offer \nmy legislation as an amendment. I am pleased, however, that this \nlegislation was nonetheless included in this omnibus bill as an \nalternative to the Ganske language.\n  My legislation enjoys the support of the American Medical Association \nas well as numerous medical specialty groups that are very concerned \nabout this matter. And, while the biotech and pharmaceutical industries \nopposed the Ganske amendment, they were instrumental in crafting this \nnarrower approach.\n  The need for this legislation stems from the recent case of Pallin \nversus Singer. The facts of this case are very compelling. In \nperforming cataract surgery, an ophthalmologist by the name of Dr. \nPallin chose not to stitch the cataract incision because the patient \nwas experiencing heart problems.\n  When Dr. Pallin later discovered that the incision healed better \nwithout the stitch, he sought and was awarded a patent for ``no \nstitch'' cataract surgery. Dr. Pallin subsequently sought to license \nthis procedure for a fee of $4 per operation. Although the no-stitch \nprocedure was widely used, few surgeons were willing to meet Dr. \nPallin's demands.\n  In 1994, Dr. Pallin brought a patent infringement suit against \nanother eye surgeon and his affiliated hospital. After incurring nearly \n$500,000 in legal defense costs, a settlement was finally reached. The \nsettlement, however, does not foreclose the prospect of future lawsuits \nof this kind.\n  There is legitimate concern that Pallin represents the future unless \nwe nip it in the bud.\n  My legislation is very narrow in scope. It would simply prevent the \nenforcement of patents against health professional or their affiliated \nfacilities for pure procedure patents such as Dr. Pallin's. It does not \nimpact in any way the patentability of medical devices, drugs, or their \nmethods of use.\n  This change in law is essential. Allowing health professionals to be \nsued for using innovations in pure medical or surgical procedures would \nhave four disastrous consequences.\n  First, health care costs would explode if doctors charged licensing \nfees for every new surgical or medical techniques they developed. There \nare thousands of new medical and surgical techniques developed every \nyear.\n\n[[Page S12024]]\n\n  Permitting innovative doctors to charge a fee every time their new \ntechnique was used would be a windfall for the doctor but a huge and \ncostly burden for the patient community. Because these innovations \nwould occur anyway, these additional costs would be wholly unnecessary.\n  Second, it would greatly jeopardize patients' right to privacy. In \norder to know if a patent was infringed upon, patent holders could \ndemand access to surgical notes and other detailed medical records to \nknow precisely what kinds of procedures were used. Not only would this \nraise serious privacy concerns, but providing all of these records \nwould be an administrative nightmare.\n  Third, allowing pure procedure patents would undermine the medical \ncommunity's tradition--and ethical duty--of freely exchanging \ninformation for the benefit of patients. As a surgeon, I know first \nhand that medical training involves a very important social contract \nbetween health professionals. Making improvements in surgical or \nmedical care and sharing those innovations with others is a critical \npart of the medical profession's commitment to advancing its art.\n  I was fortunate enough to innovate in my capacity as a heart \ntransplant surgeon, but I always understood that my innovations were \npossible because I stood on the shoulders of giants.\n  I was able to advance the science of heart transplants because I had \nthe benefit of superb teachers who themselves were great innovators. \nFor me to have sought patents on new surgical techniques would have \nviolated this social contract.\n  Fourth, it will open the door to FDA regulation of all aspects of \nmedical practice.\n  While the FDA regulates medical devises and pharmaceuticals, it has \nno authority to regulate the general practice of medicine. The response \nto those who have advocated comprehensive FDA regulation of medical \npractice has been that checks and balances already exist to assure that \npatients receive appropriate care. One of those checks is the peer \nreview process. If we undermine the peer review process but injecting \npatent-seeking into the heart of the practice of medicine, we will have \nopened the door for proponents of more expansive FDA regulation.\n  If we accept the argument that innovations in pure procedures should \nbe treated no differently than innovations in drugs or devices for \npurposed of patent law, we open ourselves up to the argument that they \nshould be treated no differently for other purposes as well--including \nFDA regulation.\n  Not only would pure procedure patents have disastrous effects on \nhealth care, they are unnecessary to encourage innovation.\n  It is important that we not lose sight of the underlying purpose of \npatent law. Its function is not to reward innovations after the fact. \nIts purpose is to encourage innovation that would not occur otherwise. \nThis rationale does not apply to innovations in pure medical and \nsurgical procedures because such innovations have and will continue to \noccur without the benefit of patent law.\n  Further, unlike innovations in medical devices or drugs, pure-\nprocedure innovations do not require huge investments of capital. As \nDr. Pallin's no stitch cataract surgery indicates, most breakthroughs \nare discovered in the course of treatment. This is partly why the AMA's \nCode of Medical Ethics holds pure-procedure patents to be unethical.\n  Doctors have an ethical duty to seek the best care for their \npatients. This includes the duty to innovate when necessary. Also, \nrecognition among one's peers for innovation and excellence is a \ntremendous incentive for doctors. Every doctor wants the cachet of \npublishing an article in a medical journal detailing their innovation. \nFinally, to augment these private motivations to innovate, millions of \ndollars in public and private grants are available each year to advance \npure-procedure technology further.\n  As a result, not only would allowing pure procedure patents to be \nenforced against doctors be detrimental to health care, it would not \nserve the underlying purpose of patent law which is to encourage \ninnovation.\n  In closing, I want to thank Congressman Ganske with whom I have been \nworking for the past year on this important subject. His amendment \nprovided the impetus to address this important matter in the waning \ndays of this Congress.\n  I also want to thank Senator Gregg and his staff for their strong \nsupport. Without Senator Gregg's commitment, this legislation would not \nhave been possible.\n  Finally, I want to assure opponents of my legislation that I take \nseriously their concerns and will be the first to join them in \nrevisiting this issue if its unwitting effect is to chill medical \ninnovation. While I do not believe this will be the effect, I agree \nthat it warrants a watchful eye.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12023-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12024-S12025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MEDICARE BENEFICIARY SHARES CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEW DOLE PLAN\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, a number of my \nDemocratic colleagues and I held a forum on how former Senator Dole's \neconomic plan would affect the Medicare Program and the 37 million \npeople who rely on it for their health care needs. Unfortunately, there \nhave been no formal congressional hearings to examine the consequences \nof this mammoth plan on the lives of the American people, or in \nparticular, on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Our forum heard from highly respected economic and health care \nexperts who warned us that the Dole plan would require deep cuts in \nMedicare, which would force major changes in the program, cuts in \npayments to the professionals and institutions that provide Medicare \nservices, and reductions in the quality of the medical care provided to \nMedicare beneficiaries. In my view, this is one of the most obvious and \ncompelling reasons to do everything possible to prevent the Dole \neconomic plan from ever becoming reality. It astounds me that we are \nseeing this revival of a supply-side proposal that once again puts \nMedicare on the chopping block in order to pay for tax relief for the \nwealthy.\n  We also were privileged to hear from an extraordinary senior citizen \nand Medicare beneficiary, Betty Miller. Betty Miller told us that the \nMedicare cuts required to pay for Dole's tax cut plan would seriously \nthreaten her health care security. Betty was a powerful witness and I \nthink she truly represents what the majority of Medicare beneficiaries \nwould tell us if they had the chance to share their views about the \nDole plan's harsh Medicare cuts.\n  I want all my colleagues to be able to listen to Betty's comments \nabout Medicare. I submit Betty's testimony for the Record, and urge \neach of my colleagues to take the time to read what a real Medicare \nbeneficiary cares and worries about when candidates propose financing \ntax breaks with their Medicare Program. Again, I thank Betty for taking \nthe time to tell us about her health care worries, and about what \nMedicare means to her.\n  This testimony underscores, I submit, the reasons to protect Medicare \nfrom being raided for anything but the future of this crucial health \ncare program. A promise was made to Betty Miller that she could \nexperience her retirement years with the peace of mind of health care \nsecurity. And a promise was made to future retirees, who are now \nworking hard to pay into the Medicare Trust Fund, so they can count on \nthe same health security. The Dole plan threatens this promised health \ncare security, and should be rejected.\n  The testimony follows:\n       My name is Betty Miller. I am 77 years old and in good \n     health, fortunately.\n       Nine years ago my husband died of emphysema and \n     complications, amassing bills of one quarter of a million \n     dollars. I would be impoverished today, and so would my \n     children, if it were not for Medicare.\n       Since then I have cost Medicare less than one hundred \n     dollars ($82.24) for the total nine years. My pension \n     deductions for Medicare amount to $510 annually. I have \n     worked since I was 17 years old. In the years before my \n     retirement ten years ago my Health Insurance tax was deducted \n     from every salary check.\n       I like the Medicare program. It gives me peace of mind. I \n     can sleep at night knowing that I may not become a financial \n     burden to my children. My four children are fine, upstanding \n     citizens gainfully employed, but they are not wealthy. They \n     could not face the burden of a major health expense for me. A \n     burden which might rob my six grandchildren of a higher \n     education or other economic requirements.\n       This is why we are so concerned with Republican proposals, \n     the proposal you have\n\n[[Page S12025]]\n\n     just heard about which my Representative and her Republican \n     colleagues support. A 15% tax cut at my income level would be \n     peanuts compared to my possible medical bills.\n       At my age I do not worry about dying, but without Medicare \n     I would worry about surviving. Many of my friends are in the \n     same position.\n       We need Medicare for ourselves and our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12024-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SAID FREIHA\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the life \nof Mr. Said Freiha, a past chairman of the influential Arab publishing \nhouse, Dar Assayad, and the founder of Assayad, a weekly newsmagazine.\n  Born in Lebanon in 1912, Mr. Said Freiha rose from humble beginnings \ncommitted to the belief that a strong society full of freedom, pride \nand dignity could only be achieved through free enterprise and \ndemocracy. In 1970, Mr. Freiha established the Said Freiha Foundation \nfor Welfare and Scientific Services. The foundation has been \ninstrumental in providing financial, medical and professional aid to \nmembers of the Arab media and their families.\n  Under this leadership, Dar Assayad became one of the top three \nprinting and publishing houses in the Arab world. When Mr. Freiha died \nin March 1978, he left behind a press empire now producing 12 \npublications.\n  Said Freiha's memory will remain as a beacon in the Arab world. \nReaders from across the Arab world will continue to benefit from the \nliterary treasures he left behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12025-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TREASURY, POSTAL SERVICE AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and \nranking member for working together to report this bill. I will \ncertainly support final passage.\n  One of the most important budget items in this bill to me and my \nSeattle area constituents is funding for the new Federal courthouse. \nThis courthouse has been needed, and in the works, for almost a decade. \nAs Congress has expanded the role of Federal courts in crime fighting \nand other areas, our judges have gotten more and more squeezed. There \nis no doubt a new courthouse is needed.\n  At this time, the General Services Administration, working with the \ncity of Seattle, has tentatively selected the main library for the city \nas the site for the new courthouse. The library is in sore need of \nreplacement or major restoration. The library is a cherished public \nasset. The people in and near Seattle check out books at a rate of 1 \nmillion per year. They bring their children to story hour, attend the \ndiverse programs, and conduct tremendous amounts of personal and \nprofessional research.\n  The city of Seattle recognizes the need for expansion of the Federal \ncourthouse and is committed to working energetically in partnership \nwith the GSA to make this a reality. Seattle has offered to relocate \nits library to expedite expansion of the courthouse. I am pleased the \ncity and GSA intend to work together, as quickly as possible, to find a \nmutually agreeable resolution of the cost and timing questions.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the chairman and ranking member for \ndoing their part to move this courthouse toward completion. The need \nfor the courthouse and a smooth, cost-efficient transition to a new \nlibrary cannot be overstated. I look forward to working with you \nfurther in the coming years of this project to ensure the Federal \njustice system is poised to meet the growing needs of the region, and \nthat Seattle's central library is kept whole in the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12025-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FOREIGN DIFFERENTIAL EXPORT TAX SCHEMES\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last month when we were \nconsidering legislation to extend the Generalized System of Preferences \n[GSP], I raised an issue involving an unfair trade practice that has \nbeen of great concern to U.S. growers and processors of soybeans. I \ndescribed a tax policy employed by certain countries, including some \nwho are major beneficiaries of the GSP program, to give their \nprocessors and exporters of agricultural products an unfair competitive \nadvantage in world markets. This policy is used particularly to benefit \nforeign soybean meal and oil processors and exporters.\n  This tax policy, known as a differential export tax scheme [DET], in \neffect operates as an indirect subsidy for exports of soybean meal and \noil, permitting oilseed processors in those countries to underprice \ntheir competitors and obtain greater market shares for these products. \nAs a consequence, the United States share of the world export market \nfor soybean products has declined significantly, while the countries \nthat engage in these trade-distorting practices, such as Brazil and \nArgentina, continue to experience tremendous export growth in these \nsame products. Moreover, these tax schemes have had the effect of \ncreating artificial downward pressure on world price levels for these \nproducts, which has severely reduced U.S. soybean industry revenues.\n  In my statement last month, I cited the tax structure utilized by the \nState of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil as a particularly egregious case \nin point. At that time, I noted the commitment of the Brazilian Federal \nGovernment to reforming that system. I am pleased to report that \nearlier this month, the Government of Brazil enacted reform legislation \nthat eliminates these taxes on exports of raw materials and semi-\nmanufactured goods. I want to publicly congratulate the Government of \nBrazil for this major accomplishment. I hope the example of leadership \nthat Brazil has set in taking this important step will encourage other \ncountries that continue to utilize these tax schemes to take similar \nsteps toward free and fair trade. I will continue to carefully monitor \nthese developments and, as I noted in my previous statement, I am \nprepared to consider appropriate measures to encourage further progress \nin this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12025-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12025-S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES-JAPAN INSURANCE AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I would like to call to \nthis Chamber's attention the continuing failure of the Government of \nJapan to honor the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement. My \ncolleagues will recall that I offered a resolution on this issue on \nJuly 25 during our consideration of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill. That resolution was adopted unanimously by the \nSenate.\n  It way my hope at the time that the Government of Japan would soon \nbegin to implement the obligations it undertook in the insurance \nagreement signed in 1994. Regrettably, not only has Japan not fulfilled \nits obligation to open its insurance market, as called for under the \nagreement, it is now poised to commit a grave violation of it. Such a \nviolation would undermine Japanese credibility and could cost American \ncompanies millions of dollars of hard earned business. Rather than \nleading to a more open market, this agreement and Japan's new insurance \nbusiness law, are being implemented by the Ministry of Finance in ways \nthat could lead to substantially reduced American market share.\n  Our well-respected Ambassador to Japan, Walter Mondale, told the \nNational Press Club earlier this month that it appears possible that \nthe Ministry of Finance [MOF] ``is going to permit these huge insurance \ncompanies to develop subsidiaries to go into the third sector and swamp \nthe third sector with the army of insurance agents they have, without \nopening the primary sector. . . . And I think many of [the foreign \ninsurance companies] would be driven out.'' For the benefit of those \nMembers unfamiliar with the insurance market, the so-called ``third \nsector'' includes such niche products as personal accident and long-\nterm disability insurance, and it is the only sector where foreign \nfirms currently can compete.\n  Since Ambassador Mondale made that statement, the possibility of a \nviolation has grown. Just last week USTR met again with the MOF to take \nstock of our respective positions. What this meant in fact was the \nJapanese Government withdrew--in response to domestic industry \npressure--all the concessions offered at earlier negotiations in \nVancouver.\n  Rather than making progress, the negotiations are back to where they \nhad been in March and April. And I believe we are now at a brink. \nAmbassador\n\n[[Page S12026]]\n\nBarshesfsky has said publicly that if the MOF allows entry into the so-\ncalled ``third sector,'' or in any other way prejudices the U.S. \nposition, we will take appropriate actions.\n  Mr. President, I call on my colleagues today to support Ambassador \nBarshesfsky in her negotiations. We should do so unanimously. Japan \nmust understand that the Congress' seriousness of resolve on this \nmatter is no less than that of USTR.\n  Japan must honor its agreements. This may be a complicated issue, but \nit comes down to a simple matter--will Japan live up to its word. As \nAmbassador Mondale has said, ``We have an agreement and that must mean \nsomething.''\n  Mr. President, we have reached a day of reckoning. The Ministry of \nFinance must decide if it will permit violations of the agreement. If, \non the other hand, the MOF does not permit violations, cooler heads may \nyet prevail.\n  Last week, a U.S. official said, ``In its action on October 1, the \nJapanese government should not take action which prejudices the \nnegotiations, which invalidates the U.S. position or unilaterally \nadopts the Japanese position.'' I agree. The proper and appropriate \naction by the MOF at this time would be a continuation of the freeze \nwhich has prevailed for a number of months. That is what we expect from \nthe MOF, and nothing less. I hope our friends in Japan do not \nmiscalculate, but if they do, we must leave no doubt that they have \nmade a mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12025-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REAUTHORIZING THE NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES ACT\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senator \nStevens and Senator Kerry for their work in bringing this bill to \npassage. By reauthorizing the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, we \nreaffirm our commitment to the preservation and protection of marine \nresources and areas of great biological significance in the marine and \ncoastal ecosystem.\n  This bill also amends the Hawaiian Islands National Marine Sanctuary \nAct to reflect some of the concerns raised during the sanctuary review \nprocess. Most importantly, the Hawaii provisions of the bill prohibit \nthe imposition of user fees in the sanctuary. The measure also \nincorporates amendments requested by the Kahoolawe Island Reserve \nCommission (KIRC) regarding any future efforts to include the island of \nKahoolawe in the sanctuary. The bill provides the KIRC with the \nauthority to request that Kahoolawe be included in the sanctuary. If \nthe KIRC does not make this request, Kahoolawe will not be included.\n  This bill represents bipartisan cooperation on an issue of great \nimportance; the protection of the marine environment. I would like to \nthank the staff of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, especially Lila Helms, for their role in making this \nreauthorization a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12026-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     200TH BIRTHDAY OF LIBERTY HALL\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my \ncolleagues and all Americans to join me in paying tribute to Liberty \nHall in Frankfort, KY. This historic home will celebrate its 200th \nbirthday on October 2, 1996.\n  Liberty Hall is one of Kentucky's finest 18th-century homes. It \nserved as the residence of Kentucky's first U.S. Senator, John Brown, \nand four generations of his family. Senator Brown held office from 1792 \nto 1805. Brown married Margaretta Mason on February 21, 1799; after \ntheir wedding they returned to Frankfort and his home, Liberty Hall, \nwhich he began building in 1796.\n  Senator Brown was known as a strong advocate and voice for the \ndeveloping lands west of the Allegheny Mountains. Brown was one of the \nfirst trustees of Harrodsburg. He also was a founding member of the \nDanville Political Club and a member of the Kentucky Manufacturing \nSociety. At the time of his death he had the distinction of being the \nlast living member of the Continental Congress.\n  Since 1937, Liberty Hall has served as a house museum. The historic \nhome is a sterling example of the preservation movement in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I ask you to join me in celebrating Liberty Hall's \n200th birthday. This historic site is a Kentucky landmark, and I hope \nall that travel to Kentucky's capital will take time to stop by and see \nwhy we Kentuckians are so proud of this historic mansion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12026-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMEMORATING SAM VOLPENTEST'S 92D BIRTHDAY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to issue a birthday \nwish to one of the most remarkable people I have had the pleasure to \nwork with in these first 4 years of my term: my almost-92-year-old \nfriend and mentor, Sam Volpentest.\n  For more than three decades, Sam has been working to ensure the \neconomic stability of the communities surrounding the Department of \nEnergy's Hanford Site in southeast Washington. As a representative of \nthe Tri-City Industrial Development Council, he worked closely with \nSenators Magnuson and Jackson to secure funding and projects for \nHanford as the site has transitioned through various incarnations, from \nhelping to win the cold war to cleaning up a nuclear mess to moving \nonto a healthy, stable future. And although these two illustrious \nleaders have passed on, Sam has not let up. He has advised and educated \na whole new generation of elected leaders about priorities and the \nimportance of the Tri-Cities.\n  Sam is tireless. He has more energy and enthusiasm than almost \nanybody. People who are half his age would be happy with his energy \nlevel--I know I would. He puts that energy to good work for Hanford and \nfor the numerous charities and organizations he supports. I can think \nof no person who has contributed more time or energy to Hanford's \nworkers and communities than Sam Volpentest.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell one story to illustrate Sam's dogged \ndetermination to do the right thing. Early in my Senate tenure, Sam \nshared with me an exciting new venture for Hanford, dubbed HAMMER--the \nHazardous Materials Management and Emergency Response facility. HAMMER \nwas an excellent idea, but a costly one--especially in this budget-\ncutting climate. However, with Sam at the helm of the project, this \nimportant inter-agency, cooperative emergency response program had a \nchance to make the transition from dream to reality.\n  In 1994, Sam got word that HAMMER funding was threatened. He called \nmy office late one evening and explained how important it was to \ncontact Senator Exon, who would be instrumental in saving HAMMER. Sam \narrived at 7 a.m. and camped on my doorstep, and believe me, anyone who \nhas had Sam camp out on their doorstep knows this man can camp. He \nhelped me develop a strategy for winning and we worked every hour of \nthe day to implement that strategy. In the end, we saved HAMMER.\n  Just last year, we broke ground for the extensive HAMMER training \ncourse. Today, HAMMER--Sam's mission and one of his many dreams--is \nalmost constructed. The people not only in his community but across the \nNation will benefit for years to come for Sam's tenacity and devotion \nto ``camping'' on doorsteps.\n  Today, on September 30, Sam Volpentest celebrates his 92d birthday. \nOn that day, The Tri-City Herald will publish a list of contributors \nwho have given to ``Sam's 92d Birthday Celebration for Charity.'' \nContributors can give $9.20, $92, $920 or more to the organizing \ncommittee who will then pass the money on to the Blue Mountain Council \nof the Boy Scouts of America, the Tri-Cities Cancer Center, and \nWashington State University Tri-Cities. This is an excellent way to \ncelebrate Sam's continuing charity to his friends and community, and \nwill certainly demonstrate the love and affection so many people have \nfor this remarkable man.\n  Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues are blessed with people so \ntirelessly devoted to their communities as the people of the Tri-Cities \nand I have in Sam Volpentest. I hope those of you who have the \nprivilege of knowing Sam will join me in wishing him a very happy 92d \nbirthday, with many more to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12026-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12026-S12031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REPORT ON TRIP TO INDONESIA, VIETNAM, AND HONG KONG\n\n Mr. COCHARN.

Trent Lott,\n     The Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: I am pleased to submit this report on my trip \n     to Indonesia, Vietnam and\n\n[[Page S12027]]\n\n     Hong Kong from June 28 through July 8, 1996. I undertook this \n     mission to engage senior officials in the region in \n     discussions of political and economic changes in Asia, the \n     impact of U.S. policy on those developments and the outlook \n     for bilateral and multilateral relationships, particularly \n     with regard to U.S. security and trade policy.\n       In Indonesia, we met with Hartarto Sastrosoenarto, Minister \n     for Production and Distribution and Dr. Beddu Amang, Chairman \n     of the Agency for National Logistics Administration.\n       In Vietnam, we met with Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan, \n     Deputy Minister of Defense Nguyen Thoi Bung, Minister of \n     Trade Le Van Triet, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, \n     National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh, and members of the \n     American Chamber of Commerce.\n       In Hong Kong, we met with Governor Christopher Patten, \n     members of the American Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong \n     legislative Council members, Preparatory Committee members, \n     business and academic leaders. Mr. Martin Lee, Chairman of \n     the Democratic Party, and Mr. Robert Ng, Trustee of the \n     better Hong Kong Foundation.\n       The trip emphasized the importance the United States places \n     on its relations with the countries visited. We gained \n     valuable insights regarding United States defense and trade \n     policies and issues confronting the countries visited. I \n     believe the trip will enhance United States relations in the \n     area and lead to a better understanding of the issues that \n     confront us.\n       We received excellent assistance from Ambassador J. \n     Stapleton Roy and the Embassy staff in Jakarta; Charge \n     d'Affaires Desaix Anderson and the Embassy staff in Hanoi; \n     and Consul General Richard Mueller and the staff in Hong \n     Kong.\n       Colonel Terry Paul, USMC, served as our military escort on \n     the trip. His assistance ensured a productive trip.\n       Thank you for authorizing me to represent the leadership of \n     the United States Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Thad Cochran,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n                                  \n\n      Report of the Mission of Senator Thad Cochran to Asia June \n                            28-July 8, 1996\n\n\n                                 purpose\n\n       Senator Cochran welcomed the Republican Leader's \n     authorization to visit Indonesia, Vietnam, and the colony of \n     Hong Kong. His delegation was officially hosted by the \n     respective American embassies and consulates and met with \n     senior officials in each of these locations.\n       Enroute to Indonesia Senator Cochran had the opportunity to \n     meet with the U.S. Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Pacific \n     Command, Admiral Joseph Prueher, and the Commander of the \n     Third Marine Expeditionary Force, Major General Rollings, for \n     briefings on Asian Security issues.\n       During the July 2-3 stay in Indonesia, the delegation \n     discussed security and trade issues concerning Indonesia and \n     Asia. Senator Cochran was honored at a reception for \n     Indonesian participants in the Cochran Fellowship program, \n     administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office \n     of International Cooperation and Development.\n       In Vietnam from July 3-5, the Senator met with \n     representatives of Vietnam's government to discuss the \n     renewed bilateral relations and defense and trade issues \n     concerning Vietnam and Asia. In addition, Senator Cochran \n     represented the Senate at the American Community Celebration, \n     a gathering commemorating the Fourth of July. This was the \n     first such celebration since the normalization of relations \n     between the two countries.\n       The July 5-7 talks in Hong Kong focused on regional issues \n     and the coming transition of sovereignty of the colony from \n     the United Kingdom of Great Britain to the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       Enroute to Washington, D.C., Senator Cochran met at Fort \n     Lewis, Washington, with Lieutenant General C.G. Marsh, \n     Commander of the U.S. Army I. Corps.\n\n\n            commander-in-chief, u.s. pacific command briefing\n\n       Senator Cochran was briefed on June 29, 1996, by Admiral \n     Joseph Prueher, Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Pacific Command. \n     The area of responsibility for Pacific Command comprises 100 \n     million square miles spanning fourteen time zones. The vast \n     geography of the region compounds the ever-present challenge \n     facing our military of trying to forecast where the next \n     problem will be before it occurs.\n       Approximately 100,000 U.S. service personnel are forward \n     deployed in the Asia-Pacific region, most of which are in \n     Japan and South Korea. The security brokered in the region by \n     the United States since the end of World War II has played a \n     pivotal role in creating the conditions necessary for \n     economic prosperity in the region. This prosperity has a \n     direct effect on the United States, as 37% of U.S. exports \n     are to Asia and the Pacific.\n       The U.S. strategy in the region is one of ``cooperative \n     engagement,'' and our regional strategic objectives flow from \n     this strategy: to maintain U.S. influence in the region; \n     promote an environment of trust and cooperation; deny \n     hegemonic control of the region; guarantee lines of \n     communications; deter armed conflict in the region; and, \n     enhance interoperability with our allies in Asia and the \n     Pacific. Admiral Prueher underscored the fact that our \n     strategy, and our strategic objectives, can only be \n     satisfied if the U.S. military retains a credible \n     warfighting capability in the region and around the world.\n       There are several sources of instability in the region that \n     are of concern to Admiral Prueher: the prospect of regional \n     conflict, such as in Korea or between India and Pakistan; the \n     many issues surrounding the future of the People's Republic \n     of China, to include questions on the future status of Hong \n     Kong, the PRC's relationship with the Republic of China, and \n     the PRC's continued participation in the proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery \n     systems, this proliferation by itself being one of Admiral \n     Prueher's chief concerns; religious and ethnic conflict; drug \n     trafficking; and territorial disputes, such as the Spratley \n     Islands issue.\n       With particular regard to one aspect of the proliferation \n     problem in the region, Admiral Prueher noted that there is \n     ``almost overwhelming evidence'' that the PRC has supplied \n     missiles to Pakistan.\n       Admiral Prueher gave an insightful analysis of the \n     recently-concluded PRC ``missile tests'' around the Republic \n     of China just prior to the election of President Lee Teng-\n     Hui. While the United States was not seeking overt \n     confrontation with the PRC, but to have a ``measured \n     response,'' American actions were designed to signal China \n     that it was prepared to stand by its commitment to the \n     Republic of China and to signal our allies in the region that \n     the U.S. security commitment to the entire region remains \n     strong.\n       In responding to a question, Admiral Prueher said that the \n     Chinese ballistic missiles performed as expected, and that \n     these ``missile tests'' underscored the need for rapid \n     deployment of highly effective theater missile defense \n     systems, such as the THAAD and Navy Upper Tier systems.\n       Admiral Prueher is hopeful that the U.S. Navy will be able \n     to continue to use Hong Kong as it currently does after July \n     1, 1997, and believes that full IMET for Indonesia would be \n     very helpful in both maintaining our relationship with \n     Indonesia and improving the lives of Indonesians. Placing \n     restrictions on IMET for Indonesia makes it more difficult to \n     influence the future direction of the Indonesian military.\n\n\n                                okinawa\n\n       The delegation made a brief stop in Okinawa and had the \n     opportunity to meet with Marine Corps Major General Wayne \n     Rollings, Commander the Third Marine Expeditionary Force, Air \n     Force Brigadier General Hobbins, and Consul General O'Neill. \n     The delegation's visit occurred in the wake of Secretary of \n     Defense Perry's negotiations with Japan to reduce the U.S. \n     force presence on Okinawa, to include reducing the number of \n     bases there. General Rollings, III MEF Commander, discussed \n     the need for access to larger training areas to keep the \n     Marines of III MEF properly trained. He also explained the \n     ongoing coordination that occurs with CINCPAC to ensure that \n     U.S. forces in the region are prepared to respond as \n     necessary to any forseeable contingency.\n\n\n                               indonesia\n\n       Indonesia has had steady growth in its economy for the last \n     thirty years, increasing its per capita income from $60-$70 \n     in the mid-1960's to approximately $1,000 today. The \n     Indonesian economy has a growth rate of 7%-8% per year, and \n     is projected to be the fifth largest economy in the world by \n     2020. Indonesia, in terms of population, is currently the \n     world's fourth largest nation and is the world's most \n     populous Islamic nation.\n       The United States is the largest foreign investor in \n     Indonesia, though if oil and natural gas investments are \n     removed, both Japan and Europe invest more. The Japanese \n     government is doing a great deal to help its businesses gain \n     market share there, providing approximately $2 billion per \n     year in soft loans to Indonesia and to Japanese businesses \n     that invest here.\n       Indonesia is a large importer of a wide range of \n     agricultural commodities. It is currently America's 14th \n     largest agricultural export market, with the dollar value of \n     U.S. agrciutlural exports having tripled in the last five \n     years. U.S. cotton imports have increased by 58% in just the \n     last year, Indonesia is the second largest foreign market for \n     Washington State apples, and Indonesians are willing to pay \n     more for U.S. beef. Indonesians like American products.\n       Indonesia is a country in transition. Half of its \n     population has been born since President Suharto ascended to \n     the leadership of Indonesia, and, while the country's economy \n     is growing strongly, the political expectations of the \n     burgeoning middle class have not yet been met. The human \n     rights situation, particularly in East Timor, though \n     improving, is not satisfactory. However, the human rights \n     violations that have occurred have not, by and large, been \n     committed by military officers trained in the United States. \n     In fact, it is the American-trained officers that American \n     embassy officials are able to go to in seeking to find out \n     the facts when there is a human rights problem involving the \n     military.\n       It was because of human rights violations that Indonesia's \n     participation in the International Military Education and \n     Training (IMET) program has been reduced, albeit under the \n     curious name of ``expanded'' IMET. Of the 109 countries \n     participating in IMET in FY '95, only Indonesia's \n     participation was curtailed. During the delegation's visit \n     U.S. Ambassador Stapleton Roy expressed a strong desire for \n     restoring full IMET to Indonesia, telling Senator Cochran \n     that singling Indonesia out for special treatment could \n     ultimately mean the difference between friendly and a hostile \n     regime. This consideration is particularly important in light \n     of the fact that, in times of heightened tensions or crisis \n     ranging from the Mediterranean to the Pacific, American naval \n     forces must transit Indonesia's water when traveling between \n     the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\n        Minister for Production and Distribution Sastrosoenarto\n\n       The delegation's first meeting with an Indonesian official \n     was with Hartarto Sastrosoenarto, Minister for Production and \n     Distribution.\n       Minister Sastrosoenarto stated that imports are surging in \n     wheat and noodles. Indonesia is interested in becoming self-\n     supporting in other agricultural commodities, such as corn, \n     sugar, and rice. However, particularly with regard to rice, \n     Indonesian farmers\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\n     are having a difficult time growing enough to satisfy demand, \n     despite the fact that noodles have become such a popular \n     staple.\n       While Indonesia imports cotton from the United States, \n     Minister Sastrosoenarto mentioned that his importers have \n     recently begun to complain that some American cotton has been \n     shipped to Indonesia with a fungus.\n       To help transition to a free market, the government is \n     actively involved in a step by step removal of subsidies in \n     the distribution sector. Minister Sastrosoenarto went on to \n     state the importance of continuing to reform the economy to \n     help generate a larger middle class and enhance social \n     stability. As part of the transition to a free market, he \n     went on to say that the government would be privatizing large \n     portions of the national infrastructure, such as power \n     generation, telecommunications, and harbors.\n       Minister Sastrosoenarto commented that the legal system is \n     weak and must be improved to create a strong legal framework \n     emphasizing support for private property as an incentive for \n     continued growth.\n       Finally, the Minister expressed his hope that at some point \n     in the future ASEAN and NAFTA can be formally linked \n     together.\n\n          Agency for National Logistics Administration (BULOG)\n\n       The delegation next met with Dr. Beddu Amang, Chairman of \n     the Agency for National Logistics Administration (BULOG).\n       Dr. Amang mentioned that trade in agricultural commodities \n     with the United States is continuing to grow, citing soybeans \n     as an example of a commodity which is completely imported \n     from abroad, 90% of which comes from the United States.\n       While four million tons of wheat per year is imported by \n     Indonesia, almost 50% of that wheat comes from Australia \n     while just over 10% comes from the United States. In response \n     to a question from Senator Cochran, Dr. Amang attributed \n     Indonesia's low imports of U.S. wheat to high levels of dust \n     that have been found on imported American wheat (also a \n     problem with U.S. soybeans, though not as widespread) and the \n     higher shipping costs (relative to Australia) from the United \n     States. Wheat that only takes six days to be shipped from \n     Australia takes on average 23 days to come from the United \n     States.\n       Dr. Amang mentioned that Indonesia makes extensive use of \n     GSM-102 credits, particularly for soybeans and corn, though \n     the bank charges are expensive and the repayment period \n     (three years) is too short. Despite these problems with the \n     GSM-102 credits, and despite the fact that Indonesia would \n     like to become self-sufficient in growing corn, corn imports \n     for feed are increasing every year.\n       Dr. Amang expressed the hope that U.S. investment in \n     Indonesian agriculture would increase, to which Senator \n     Cochran stressed the importance of Indonesia's continuing to \n     enhance its legal system to protect the sancity of contracts, \n     as well as the need to continue to decentralize the \n     Indonesian distribution system.\n     Other meetings\n       The delegation was pleased to have the opportunity to meet \n     with graduates of the Cochran Fellows program and listen to \n     their stories of how they've taken the lessons learned from \n     their exposure to the American marketplace back to Indonesia \n     to build prosperous careers and businesses. The delegation \n     met with a cross section of Indonesians involved in \n     government, the military, private business, and think tanks \n     at an informal dinner hosted by Ambassador and Mrs. Roy. The \n     delegation also had a productive breakfast with \n     representatives from the American Chamber of Commerce in \n     Jakarta.\n\n\n                     socialist republic of vietnam\n\n       After years of contentious relations, including Vietnam's \n     invasion and occupation of Cambodia, on July 11, 1995, \n     President Clinton announced his decision to establish \n     ambassadorial-level relations with Vietnam. In recent years \n     Vietnam has improved its political and economic relations \n     abroad, while bettering its economic situation \n     domestically. Vietnam has worked to complete a Cambodian \n     settlement, and appears to have made progress on the \n     prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/MIA) and other \n     issues of great interest to the United States.\n       Vietnam moved to become a new member of the Association of \n     Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) in 1995. Since that time, \n     Vietnam has indicated its desire to join the Asia Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation (APEC) group and the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO).\n       Now in their tenth year, economic reforms in Vietnam \n     continue to make progress toward a more open market. The \n     delegation observed the beginnings of a growing, vibrant \n     economy based on family-owned small businesses.\n       At the time of Senator Cochran's visit, the Communist Party \n     of Vietnam had just completed its Eighth Congress. The \n     Congress conducted a review of its policies, focusing in \n     particular on domestic economic reforms. While changes in the \n     top three leadership positions were expected, no changes took \n     place. The Party Congress determined that the country would \n     continue on its present course of economic reform.\n       Upon arrival in Hanoi on Wednesday, July 3, the delegation \n     met with Embassy staff for a briefing. Embassy staff provided \n     a thorough briefing on all relevant issues, including an \n     excellent presentation on the status of operations to resolve \n     outstanding cases of POW/MIAs.\n       During each of his meetings, Senator Cochran stressed the \n     importance of a full accounting of the POW/MIA question as a \n     necessary precondition to continuing to improve relations \n     between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the United \n     States.\n\n                    Deputy Foreign Minister Vo Khoan\n\n       Senator Cochran was the guest of honor at a July 3, dinner \n     hosted by Deputy Foreign Minister Vo Khoan. The Deputy \n     Foreign Minister stated that he had a chance to welcome \n     several delegations from the United States over the last \n     year, and that he was pleased with the improved relations \n     between the two countries. He looked forward to the arrival \n     of a new ambassador and the completion of negotiations over a \n     bilateral trade agreement.\n       Deputy Foreign Minister Khoan discussed the open foreign \n     policy Vietnam is pursuing. He noted the recent admission of \n     Vietnam to ASEAN and its application to join APEC. He added \n     that Vietnam was paying increasing attention to the Asia-\n     Pacific region and to improving relations with its neighbors, \n     China, Cambodia and Laos.\n       On the domestic side, he stressed that Vietnam had overcome \n     economic and social problems and was entering a new era of \n     development, which will focus on industrialization. He stated \n     that the Vietnamese government wants to encourage the \n     creation of small-and medium-sized businesses. In addition, \n     at the recently completed Eighth Congress of the Communist \n     Party, the government resolved to continue economic and \n     political reform. He also mentioned that the President of \n     China, Li Peng, came to Vietnam and addressed the Party \n     Congress. President Li Peng's visit was a last minute \n     surprise, and was the first time China had sent such a high \n     ranking delegation to Vietnam.\n       Senator Cochran and Deputy Foreign Minister Khoan also \n     discussed issues concerning POW/MIAs. The Deputy Foreign \n     Minister explained that there had been good efforts by both \n     sides on this issue, and that he expected continued \n     cooperation.\n       On the issue of the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees \n     from abroad, the Deputy Foreign Minister indicated that there \n     is no problem for these individuals returning to Vietnam. One \n     the problems in the South China Sea, the Deputy Foreign \n     Minister recognized it as an important issue. He stated that \n     all countries have agreed to resolve problems through \n     negotiations, but the negotiations are difficult.\n\n        Breakfast with the American Chamber of Commerce Chapter\n\n       In Hanoi on Thursday morning, July 4, Senator Cochran was a \n     breakfast guest of the American Chamber of Commerce. There \n     are over 400 registered American companies in Vietnam, an \n     increase of over 100 since January, 1996.\n       Senator Cochran stated that he was anxious to see how he \n     could be helpful in continuing to develop relations between \n     the two countries. While the POW/MIA issue is still the \n     preeminent concern of U.S. policy, he said that the United \n     States must begin also to focus on opening markets in \n     Vietnam, for American firms.\n       Several members of the Chamber emphasized the need for \n     services of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation \n     (OPIC) and the Export-Import Bank. If American firms are \n     going to compete in the burgeoning Vietnam market, the \n     services and programs administered by these agencies are \n     critical to success.\n       The members of the Chamber strongly complimented American \n     Charge d' Affaires Desaix Anderson and the Embassy staff for \n     the excellent job they had done in promoting economic issues \n     and American businesses in Vietnam.\n\n              Deputy Minister of Defense Nguyen Thoi Bung\n\n       The delegation next visited with Deputy Minister of Defense \n     Nguyen Thio Bung and several other members of the Vietnamese \n     military.\n       Deputy Minister of Defense Bung described the work of the \n     Vietnamese government to account for American POW/MIAs. He \n     emphasized that the Vietnamese government had conducted a \n     large number of unilateral investigations of cases before the \n     1988 POW/MIA agreement were reached with the United States. \n     Between 1988 and 1992, over forty joint excavations for \n     remains were conducted by the United States and Vietnam. From \n     1992 to the present the joint efforts have been even greater. \n     The focus of the upcoming excavations will be on the central \n     highlands of Vietnam. He stated that the Vietnamese have \n     shown good will by taking American teams into his country's \n     most sensitive areas, including Cam Ranh Bay and several \n     military depots.\n       He emphasized that the Vietnamese treat the POW/MIA issue \n     as a humanitarian issue and want to successfully resolve this \n     issue. Hopefully, the successful resolution of this issue \n     will help bring the countries together by closing the past so \n     the people can look to the future. He also mentioned that \n     Vietnam still has over 300,000 MIA cases of its own.\n       He declared that Vietnam has joined ASEAN to build peace, \n     stability, security and prosperity in Asia. As for military \n     relations with the United States, he indicated that the \n     Vietnamese government was pleased with the appointment of a \n     military attache to the American embassy. He was confident \n     that such an appointment would promote friendship between the \n     two countries' armed forces.\n       In responding to Senator Cochran's question about his views \n     on what the biggest security threat is to the region's \n     stability, the\n\n[[Page S12029]]\n\n     Deputy Minister responded that international strategists see \n     the Asia-Pacific region as the most stable in the world, but \n     that there is some concern over the South China Sea. He \n     explained that there are some disputes over sovereignty of \n     the Spratleys, but that there is regional agreement that the \n     disputes should be resolved through negotiations. He also \n     stated that there continue to be potentially unstable \n     elements in Korea and Cambodia.\n       On the issue of the recent actions taken by the People's \n     Republic of China against Taiwan, the Deputy Minister \n     indicated that it was an internal affair between China and \n     Taiwan. He said that if they could not settle it, it could \n     affect the stability and security of the region.\n\n                     Minister of Trade Le Can Triet\n\n       The delegation next met with Minister of Trade Le Can Triet \n     and discussed several bilateral trade issues, including the \n     ongoing negotiations over a bilateral trade agreement, and \n     human rights issues.\n       Senator Cochran indicated that the United States Trade \n     Representative had provided a blueprint to the Vietnamese \n     government concerning some of the issues to be negotiated in \n     order to reach a bilateral trade agreement. He asked if there \n     was a likelihood that the United States would receive a \n     response to its blueprint in the near future.\n       Minister Triet explained that the Vietnamese are looking \n     through a list of many questions on the issues that have been \n     discussed. He stated that during the May meeting Vietnam \n     raised several questions to be further negotiated. Currently, \n     the two sides are studying the draft. He indicated that the \n     discussions had been frank, with good will on both sides, and \n     that both sides are patiently listening and working through \n     issues. The Trade Minister stated that while any agreement \n     must reflect mutual benefits, the countries cannot avoid \n     differences and that it will take time to fit different \n     systems together.\n       The Trade Minister also discussed Vietnam's application for \n     membership in APEC and WTO. He stated that Vietnam wanted to \n     prove its willingness to move toward freer trade. Vietnam \n     wants to become more deeply involved in the world community \n     and the world economy.\n\n           Reception at American Charge d'Affaires Residence\n\n       This was a formal reception for much of the diplomatic \n     community in Vietnam celebrating the 4th of July. Charge \n     d'Affaires Anderson, the Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister, \n     Senator Cochran, and Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma all \n     spoke to the assembled audience, which included the \n     diplomatic corps, military representatives from many \n     countries and representatives from the international business \n     community.\n\n              Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh Cam\n\n       The delegation next met with Foreign Affairs Minister \n     Nguyen Manh Cam. The Foreign Minister stated that world \n     opinion could be reassured concerning the outcome of the \n     recent Communist Party Congress. Vietnam intends to maintain \n     its current course of development by continuing policies of \n     openness, diversification and modernization.\n       In foreign relations, Minister Cam recounted Vietnam's \n     tradition of having good relations with its neighbors and \n     friends, and stated that Vietnam's foreign policy \n     is consistent with global and regional integration. The \n     Foreign Minister stressed the importance of moving \n     relations between the United States and Vietnam forward, \n     saying that it is important to make up for lost time and \n     to work to overcome past animosities. He was pleased at \n     the progress in relations since normalization.\n       The Foreign Minister was very pleased with Secretary \n     Christopher's visit in August, 1995, when the United States \n     and Vietnam agreed to boost economic development and make \n     trade a top priority. Since 1994-95, there has been a four-\n     fold increase in trade between Vietnam and the United States, \n     which was done in the absence of Most Favored Nation (MFN) \n     status. He also indicated that if Export-Import Bank \n     financing, OPIC loan guarantees and MFN status were granted, \n     the United States could become Vietnam's largest trading \n     partner. The Foreign Minister emphasized the need for and \n     importance of granting a Jackson-Vanik waiver.\n       With regard to the trade agreement talks, the Foreign \n     Minister stated that the signing of a trade agreement is of \n     great importance, but that it will take some time. The \n     current negotiations were brought about through very \n     intensive talks in October and November. The Foreign Minister \n     urged Senator Cochran to help move the process forward. With \n     regard to the POW/MIA issues, Foreign Minister Cam stated \n     that Vietnam had fully cooperated, is cooperating, and will \n     continue to cooperate.\n       Senator Cochran asked for the Foreign Minister's assistance \n     in resolving the current impasse over the establishment of \n     the American ambassador's residence. The Foreign Minister \n     said that it was a concern, but said that the United States \n     enjoys the best technical facilities in Vietnam in comparison \n     to other countries. He indicated that the Vietnamese \n     government would continue to work with the United States to \n     find a suitable location and that he would try his best to \n     get the most appropriate location for the residence.\n       The Foreign Minister also discussed the appointment of a \n     new ambassador to Vietnam. He stated that the appointment of \n     an ambassador is a way to ensure the continued development of \n     normalization. He said that the nominee, United States \n     Representative Pete Peterson, would make a strong \n     contribution to bilateral relations.\n       At the close of the meeting, Senator Cochran presented to \n     the Foreign Minister a statement Senator Claiborne Pell \n     entered into the Congressional Record on June 20, 1996. The \n     statement commended the life of Deputy Foreign Minister, Le \n     Mai, who has recently passed away.\n\n                National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh\n\n       The delegation's last official meeting in Vietnam was with \n     National Assembly Chairman Manh. The Chairman discussed the \n     recently concluded Party Congress and stated that the \n     Congress presented a good opportunity to review Vietnam's \n     Policy of Renewal. He stated that the Congress had many \n     discussions on moving Vietnam into the 21st century.\n       In the area of foreign affairs, the Chairman indicated that \n     Vietnam has broadened its approach and was pursuing an open \n     foreign policy. He contended it was his strong desire to \n     increase ties between the United States Senate and the \n     Vietnamese Parliament.\n       Responding to Senator Cochran's question about how the \n     recent Party Congress affected the National Assembly and if \n     the National Assembly would play a larger role in Vietnam, \n     Chairman Manh stated that the Congress plays an important \n     role in the process of renewal. He explained that from now on \n     Vietnam would work to move their national industrialization \n     to a higher level. He further stated Vietnam's intention \n     to continue to build its country based on the rule of law \n     and enhancing the role of the judiciary and other \n     institutions.\n       On improving the legal system, Chairman Manh states that \n     Vietnam had changed its laws to create a more favorable \n     investment environment. Laws to improve the economy, laws \n     related to foreign investment and the commercial code are in \n     the process of being drafted and will be subject to debate in \n     October.\n\n                     American Community Celebration\n\n       Senator Cochran joined with over 500 people at a picnic to \n     celebrate the Fourth of July. Charge d'Affaires Anderson, \n     Senator Cochran and Governor Keating all addressed an \n     enthusiastic crowd.\n\n\n                               Hong kong\n\n       Codel Cochran arrived in Hong Kong on July 7 and departed \n     July 9. While in Hong Kong the delegation was briefed by the \n     U.S. Embassy Country Team and held meetings with Governor \n     Christopher Patten, the American Chamber of Commerce, and \n     Democratic Party Chairman Martin Lee. The delegation also met \n     informally with Preparatory Committee members Paul Cheng and \n     Frederick Fung, the Better Hong Kong Foundation, academics, \n     civil servants and representatives of the U.S. business \n     community.\n       There are several issues of direct interest to the United \n     States related to Hong Kong's transfer to the People's \n     Republic of China on July 1, 1997. The principal security \n     issue concerns the question of whether the U.S. Navy will be \n     able to continue to use Hong Kong as a frequent port of call \n     in Asia.\n       The U.S. Consul General's staff is unaware of any official \n     response by the PRC on the question of whether the U.S. Navy \n     will be able to continue to use Hong Kong as it currently \n     does. Unofficial contacts on the matter have received \n     favorable responses from PRC military officials; however, \n     there has been no response from the political leadership. The \n     lack of military piers in Hong Kong means U.S. ships would \n     have to tie up at commercial moorings. The Chinese Navy is \n     building a base, but it is unclear whether the U.S. would be \n     allowed to use it. Hong Kong's importance to the U.S. Navy \n     for ship visits is underscored by its location. Hong Kong is \n     the closest to deployment tracks of U.S. Navy vessels. Other, \n     such as Australia, Japan and Thailand are far off the \n     deployment track. Approximately 70 U.S. Navy ships currently \n     visit Hong Kong each year.\n       The ship visits issue relates to the general issue of \n     continuity--something sought by people of Hong Kong. The U.S. \n     hopes Beijing realizes that changing the practice on visits \n     by U.S. Navy ships would send the wrong signal and undermine \n     confidence in the territory.\n       The strategy for U.S. diplomacy on Hong Kong over the past \n     year and a half has been to speak more publicly on commerce, \n     law enforcement, ship visits, consular issues and to let \n     Governor Patten speak on Hong Kong's unique qualities, such \n     as the high degree of civil liberties and the rule of law. \n     The Consulate has tried to raise the level of attention paid \n     to these issues and encourage attention to be paid in and by \n     official Washington, including visits by Members of Congress \n     to Hong Kong and to Beijing, and hearings on Capitol Hill.\n       Few problems are anticipated in connection with the \n     continuance in force of various U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral \n     agreements. Several are pending, including a civil aviation \n     agreement and an extradition treaty; a bilateral investment \n     treaty needs to be negotiated as does a mutual legal \n     assistance treaty. All are part of the policy, expressed in \n     the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act, to maintain a direct U.S.-Hong \n     Kong relationship. The Act is the blueprint for this policy.\n       Another major issue confronting the U.S. is the status of \n     the Consulate General and\n\n[[Page S12030]]\n\n     whether, after the People's Republic takes over Hong Kong on \n     July 1, 1997, the consulate will be subordinated to the U.S. \n     embassy in Beijing. Hong Kong is a very valuable post for the \n     U.S. Fifteen U.S. government agencies are represented. Law \n     enforcement is a particularly important function of the \n     Consulate General. Several agencies are represented because \n     Hong Kong is strategically located for gathering information \n     on nuclear proliferation, weapons of mass destruction and \n     narcotics. The Consulate General also plays an important role \n     in promotion of U.S. business.\n\n                            Governor Patten\n\n       Governor Patten noted the dramatic changes that had taken \n     place in Hong Kong's infrastructure since his arrival in \n     1992, including progress on the new airport on Lamma Island, \n     new bridges and reclamation in Victoria Harbor, and a new \n     convention center.\n       Governor Patten called Hong Kong's situation astonishing in \n     light of the fact that Britain's colonial governance usually \n     ends with independence and self-governance for the former \n     colony. Hong Kong's situation is different, he said, due to \n     its history, alluding to the late 19th century Opium Wars and \n     the concessions and leases through which Great Britain \n     acquired Hong Kong island, Kowloon peninsula and the New \n     Territories. The Governor said he had been criticized for \n     admitting to having a ``certain moral queasiness'' over \n     handing a free city over to a country with a different idea \n     of freedom. Britain had attempted to solve its moral dilemma \n     by negotiating a detailed arrangement for Hong Kong in the \n     1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong \n     Kong which reflects the ``one country, two systems'' approach \n     to Hong Kong's future under PRC sovereignty. Both the Joint \n     Declaration and the Basic Law, the so-called ``mini-\n     constitution,'' promulgated by the National People's Congress \n     in Beijing, spell out a detailed prescription for preserving \n     Hong Kong's free and pluralistic society.\n       While the Joint Declaration is very specific, the trick, \n     according to the Governor, is making it work. Beijing doesn't \n     get the best advice on making the system work. And the \n     influence of Tiananmen was profound. Some in Beijing choose \n     to blame Tiananmen on outside interference from places like \n     Hong Kong. Ultimately, the influence of Tiananmen was greater \n     on Beijing than on it was Hong Kong. The reaction to the \n     events of Tiananmen in Beijing created problems in Sino-\n     British relationship on Hong Kong including, financing the \n     airport, passports for Hong Kongers, the Bill of Rights and \n     arrangements for democratic elections. The Governor said the \n     reason for negotiations over electoral reforms broke down was \n     not Patten's desire to move more quickly, but the PRC's \n     insistence that Great Britain cooperate in rigging the \n     elections.\n       Nevertheless, in spite of difficulties, the transition, \n     according to Patten, has gone very well. The economy is \n     strong, particularly the currency as measured against the \n     U.S. dollar. Reserves are large. Exports and investments are \n     good. Unemployment is at 3.1%. Jobs are growing at 4%. There \n     hasn't been any capital flight--though some offshore \n     arrangements are being made. Exceptions to the pattern of \n     confidence are the domiciling of companies in other British \n     colonies, and the acquisition by up to 600,000 Hong \n     Kongers of foreign passports.\n       The Governor rejected arguments that Hong Kong people don't \n     care about human rights and democracy. Many of Hong Kong's \n     people fled from repression in mainland China and know the \n     difference between a society based on the rule of law and \n     protection from arbitrary government. The very high number of \n     newspapers in Hong Kong is another indication of the interest \n     of Hong Kong's people in political matters affecting them. \n     Another indication of what Hong Kong people care about is \n     demonstrated by the polls done by Michael DeGolyer of the \n     Hong Kong Transition Project. These polls indicate most \n     anxieties related to the future and the transition are about \n     freedoms of the press and association and whether these will \n     exist after 1997. The polls also reflect a correlation \n     between demographic groups and attitudes about the future. \n     Women are more worried than men. Better educated are more \n     worried than the less educated. Younger people are more \n     worried than older people, and the most worried are those \n     who, because of their education, age, or other \n     characteristics, are able to emigrate.\n       In response to questions, the Governor said that Great \n     Britain couldn't fix the inconsistencies between the Basic \n     Law and the Joint Declaration, but was focusing on reforming \n     Hong Kong's laws to make them consistent with the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The \n     Hong Kong government's law reform project is 80% done. \n     Difficulties remain in the areas of official secrets and \n     telephone surveillance. The Governor said his government is \n     determined not to leave behind laws which could be abused by \n     the PRC after 1997.\n       Other issues of concern include corruption. Hong Kong's \n     police and Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) \n     make Hong Kong the ``cleanest city in Asia after Singapore. \n     Any effort to take over and control the police would be a \n     violation of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The \n     possibility of influence directed at Hong Kong's institutions \n     by Beijing underscores the importance of a strong Chief \n     Executive selected on the basis of merit.\n       Governor Patten said the PRC is serious about its threat to \n     dismantle the Legislative Council (Legco), particularly \n     because of the membership in the Legco of so many democrats. \n     Here Patten said that the real reason for the collapse of \n     talks over constitutional reform was not the specifics of his \n     proposals but the PRC's demands that Great Britain be \n     complicit in the abolition of the Legco and exclusion of \n     certain democratic legislators unacceptable to Beijing. The \n     PRC also demanded 2 member constituencies which would have \n     had the effect of cutting in half the number of democrats \n     elected. If the elections were conducted on one-man, one-vote \n     geographical basis, Patten said, pro-democracy candidates \n     would win 70% of the vote. Patten described Hong Kong's \n     complicated system of election to the Legco based on 20 \n     functional constituencies or electorates tied to workplace \n     and professional associations, 10 electoral committee seats \n     and 20 one-man, one-vote geographical constituencies.\n       Governor Patten said he was ``very grateful'' to the U.S. \n     Senate for passing S. Res. 217 on June 28 supporting \n     implementation of the Joint Declaration and expressing the \n     position that it would regard establishment of an appointed \n     legislature in Hong Kong as a violation of the Joint \n     Declaration. The Governor said attention by other countries \n     is very helpful to Hong Kong and that the U.S. matters the \n     most of all to China. Since 1992 China has recognized that \n     Hong Kong is an international city implicating international \n     interests. Patten noted that the recent raising of Hong Kong \n     by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in a meeting with \n     Secretary of State Christopher wouldn't have happened a few \n     years ago.\n       Governor Patten related an anecdote concerning Qiao Shi, \n     the head of the National People's Congress. Qiao Shi, a \n     rising figure in China, has said there is a huge amount of \n     ``face'' involved in the PRC's handling of Hong Kong and that \n     interest in Hong Kong by the U.S. has an impact on Beijing. \n     The Governor said the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act provides the \n     proper focus for U.S. interest in Hong Kong and it would be \n     ``very sad'' if the U.S. stopped speaking out or stopped \n     sending visitors.\n       In response to Senator Cochran's expression of concern \n     about a textiles transshipment issue dividing the U.S. and \n     Great Britain, Governor Patten reported that his government \n     feels the U.S. has not worked within the rules of the WTO and \n     that Great Britain is sensitive to IPR and strategic trade \n     issues. The Governor asserted that the border between Hong \n     Kong and the PRC and the integrity of Hong Kong must be \n     demonstrated on textiles, IPR, and strategic trade.\n       Governor Patten said visits by U.S. Navy ships were very \n     important financially and otherwise to Hong Kong, presented \n     no significant problems from the sailors, and should continue \n     after 1997.\n\n                  Democratic Party Chairman Martin Lee\n\n       Mr. Lee observed that Hong Kong's future will be determined \n     by China's current leadership situation which leads it to act \n     confidently outside of China, but with weakness inside China. \n     As examples, Mr. Lee gave the rearrest of and imprisonment \n     for 14 years of Wei Jingsheng at the same time that Beijing \n     is gathering up valuable contracts with Air France. The PRC \n     is confident that the U.S. government won't react to its \n     treatment of Wei. Yet, trade and human rights don't have to \n     be mutually exclusive. Mr. Lee gave the example of the \n     Canadian trade minister for Asia, Raymond Chan, who raised \n     human rights on a trade mission to China.\n       The Taiwan elections were a very important day for Lee \n     since they were the first democratic Chinese elections in \n     5,000 years. China's intimidation tactics both succeeded and \n     failed. The show of force pleased the aging generals and \n     possible the Chinese people, so internally it was a success. \n     However, externally, the show of force was a disaster. \n     Turning away a delegation of Hong Kong democrats who wanted \n     to present a petition opposing the appointment of a \n     provisional legislature in Hong Kong was also a public \n     relations defeat. Beijing could have handled both differently \n     but felt internal pressure not to appear weak.\n       On the question of whether Beijing will follow through on \n     its threat to abolish the elected Legco, Mr. Lee said it \n     depended on the type of opposition this threat draws. If only \n     the Democrats oppose the move, Beijing will go ahead. \n     However, support from others inside and outside Hong Kong for \n     the elected legislature and its right to serve out its term \n     could made a big difference in how Beijing proceeds. \n     Recently, the details of the 17 rounds of negotiations \n     between Great Britain and China became known. The Governor \n     refused to acquiesce in PRC demands that Great Britain set up \n     electoral laws which would disadvantage democrats and agree \n     to provisions allowing China to exclude certain individuals \n     from the legislature. The PRC also wants to retain repressive \n     colonial laws that were rarely used by the British, and wants \n     to get rid of the Bill of Rights, which is based on the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and \n     confers power on the courts to strike down unconstitutional \n     laws. The PRC also wants to resurrect old versions of \n     colonial laws which allow the government greater control over \n     freedoms of expression and association. For example, an old \n     law on assembling to march was amended to only require notice \n     to the police. The PRC wants to change the law back so \n     that approval for a procession of more than 20 people has \n     to be secured in advance. The power\n\n[[Page S12031]]\n\n     to define what kinds of gatherings require approval would \n     be up to the PRC.\n       Mr. Lee said Senate Resolution 271 reiterating the Senate's \n     support for the Joint Declaration and stating that an \n     appointed legislature would violate the Joint Declaration was \n     extremely important. Mr. Lee said that other countries need \n     to act as well--but that someone has to lead. Mr. Lee said \n     that in the past he had favored a quiet, behind-closed-doors \n     approach, but that China's failure to abide by its \n     commitments in the Joint Declaration has shown that approach \n     to be ineffective.\n       On the question of selection of the Chief Executive, Mr. \n     Lee said that China itself acknowledges the selection process \n     is not democratic. The selection will be made by the \n     Preparatory Committee, a Beijing-appointed body which \n     includes key officials of the PRC, such as Foreign Minister \n     Qian Qichen. The Preparatory Committee will select 400 Hong \n     Kong people to select the Chief Executive. Three candidates \n     have been identified so far--C.H. Tung, a shipping magnate \n     and former member of the Governor's Executive Council \n     considered close to the PRC, Anson Chan, the Chief Secretary \n     of the Hong Kong Government, and T.S. Lo, a solicitor and PRC \n     advisor.\n       On the question of what U.S. policy should be, Mr. Lee said \n     it is a matter for the U.S. to decide but Mr. Lee added that \n     the development of democracy and the rule of law anywhere in \n     the world is beneficial to the U.S. The violation of \n     international agreements by China or other countries is not \n     in the U.S.'s interest and would create a bad precedent. \n     Above all, however, consistency is most important. The U.S. \n     should make a policy and stick with it.\n\n                             Other Meetings\n\n       The delegation also met informally with members of the \n     Preparatory Committee, Paul Cheng and Frederick Fung, the \n     Better Hong Kong Foundation, academics, civil servants and \n     representatives of the U.S. business community to hear their \n     concerns and recommendations for U.S. policy.\n\n\n             fort lewis/mcchord air force base, washington\n\n       Shortly after arriving from Hong Kong the delegation had \n     the opportunity to tour both McChord Air Force Base and the \n     Army's Fort Lewis in Washington state. After the tour Senator \n     Cochran and other members of the delegation had an informal \n     dinner with Lieutenant General C.G. Marsh, Commander of the \n     U.S. Army's I Corps. General Marsh, who has responsibility \n     for the deployment of I Corps units in the Asia-Pacific \n     region, commented that, having recently commanded U.S. forces \n     in Korea, he is concerned about the volatility in the region. \n     The situation is fluid and could erupt overnight, and the \n     U.S. must be prepared to take action in Korea. General Marsh \n     went on to state he has a close working relationship with \n     others the delegation met with during the trip, such as \n     Admiral Prueher (CINCPAC) and General Rollings (Commander, \n     III MEF), and that their frequent interaction is a key aspect \n     of the U.S. military's being prepared to act in the Asia-\n     Pacific region, if necessary.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The Asia-Pacific region will dominate many aspects of \n     American policy--foreign, security, trade--in the coming \n     century. It is a region with stark contrasts: North \n     Koreans reading recipes for cooking grass in \n     ``newspapers'', starving in the cities and countryside, \n     while their government spends money buying, building, and \n     selling missiles and weapons of mass destruction; the \n     Politburo of the People's Republic of China, allowing a \n     market economy to run free in the south of the country \n     while at the same time attempting to harness and repress \n     the individual rights of its citizens to think and act \n     freely, all the while increasing the size of its \n     military--for example, building a ``blue water'' navy, \n     building new classes of intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles, to include the PRC's first land-based mobile \n     ICBM--beyond any conceivable needs for self-defense; the \n     Socialist Republic of Vietnam, on the one hand proclaiming \n     itself to be dedicated to the principles of communism yet, \n     on the other hand, encouraging private business and freely \n     allowing information into the country; and, the economic \n     miracle that is most of Asia, where growth rates are the \n     staggering envy of the rest of the world. This is a region \n     that cannot be the afterthought of American policy in the \n     21st century.\n       American policy toward the region must take into account \n     the differences within the region. In Indonesia, the United \n     States must work with the government to improve its record of \n     human rights while, at the same time, recognizing that \n     Indonesia is a force for peace and stability in the region \n     and has to be treated with respect. Restricting IMET \n     participation for Indonesia is counterproductive.\n       In Vietnam, the United States must continue to insist on a \n     full accounting of those American service members who are \n     still missing or presumed dead. While there is every \n     indication that the Vietnamese government is finally starting \n     to cooperative fully with the United States on this problem, \n     that cooperation must be sustained over a lengthy period of \n     time to create the conditions for closer cooperation between \n     our countries. During this period the United States should be \n     doing everything possible to encourage the development of as \n     open and free a market as possible; during the delegation's \n     visit, it was clear that the Vietnamese government recognizes \n     that its future financial prosperity depends upon allowing \n     private ownership to take place and information flowing \n     freely into the country. This is a country where eventual \n     political reform will most likely be the by-product of an \n     emerging market economy.\n       In Hong Kong, the United States must insist that the \n     freedoms guaranteed by the Sino-British Joint Declaration are \n     implemented by the People's Republic of China when Hong Kong \n     reverts to PRC sovereignty on July 1, 1997. China has already \n     made troubling assertions that it will not abide by parts of \n     this Joint Declaration; these assertions can only be \n     translated into reality if the government of the United \n     States ignores its obligations under U.S. law.\n       Economic growth has accrued more than financial benefits to \n     many of the citizens of the Asia-Pacific region. Free markets \n     have blazed a path for free people, as the examples of \n     elections in both the Republic of China and South Korea \n     demonstrate. In Japan, our close friend and ally for the last \n     half-century, we also see the political change that has come \n     with the free market. Many other nations in the region are \n     also taking a more serious attitude toward individual \n     freedom, and it is clear that this change in attitude has \n     almost always been preceded by a free, or freer, market.\n       America is the glue that binds the region together. Enmity \n     is not quickly forgotten in Asia, and it is the American \n     military presence in the presence in the region that has \n     allowed to countries in the area to concentrate on economic \n     growth rather than military expansion. The reassuring \n     presence of an American carrier battle group--or the \n     knowledge that one is often just over the horizon--has \n     resulted in a stable environment that has been conducive to \n     economic growth for many in the region.\n       The United States must remember that this is a region in \n     which our ability to trade cannot be separated from our \n     ability to defend our interests and, if need be, protect our \n     friends. Our security guarantees must be credible. By \n     allowing terrorist states like North Korea to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction and ballistic missile delivery systems, \n     some of our friends in the region have not-so-privately begun \n     to worry about the credibility of the American security \n     guarantee, particularly given the at best half-hearted effort \n     by the Clinton Administration to build quickly effective \n     defenses against ballistic missiles. American vulnerability \n     to coercion is not missed in Asia; unless the vulnerability \n     if redressed, the credibility of the American security \n     guarantee will evaporate, leading states that are now in an \n     economic race into the invisible arms race. This can only \n     work against American interest.\n       The United States will continue to succeed in the region, \n     our trade will continue to grow, if we remember that military \n     strength is respected, and it is upon this strength that \n     American credibility is based. Our military must remain \n     strong and visible in the region, and our security assurances \n     to our allies must be carried out with the spirit, and not \n     just the letter, of our arrangements in mind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12026-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12031-S12033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE PRESIDENT AT 50\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a \nrecent piece of journalism that I believe has captured the true essence \nof political reporting. On August 1, 1996, an article was published in \nthe Wall Street Journal by Trude B. Feldman in which she relayed \nexcerpts from her exclusive one-on-one interview with President Bill \nClinton a few days before his 50th birthday. In a time when civility \nand respect are often pushed aside by personal attacks and rumor and \ninnuendo, Ms. Feldman has proven herself to be a journalist who has \nretained an exemplary style of reporting. Her article, entitled ``The \nPresident at 50'', sheds light on the President's personality in novel \nways. Ms. Feldman presents an articulate and important account of the \nPresident, drawing from him new insights into the policies and politics \nof our day. In the end, Ms. Feldman produces a proud piece of \njournalistic work.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n\n                          the president at 50\n\n                         (by Trude B. Feldman)\n\n       This month marks the 50th anniversary of the birth of the \n     president of the United States. And today is the 50th \n     anniversary of the Fulbright Scholarship Program, initiated \n     by William Jefferson Clinton's mentor, who inspired the \n     president to make a genuine contribution to global \n     understanding. Eighteen days after President Truman signed \n     Sen. J. William Fulbright's legislation into law, the boy who \n     would become the 42nd U.S. President was born, one month \n     ahead of schedule, by Caesarean section.\n       In an exclusive interview for his 50th birthday, President \n     Clinton spoke of the two milestones, recalling what he had \n     learned from his first political role model.\n       ``Senator Fulbright had a profound impact on the way I now \n     view the world,'' the President told me. ``He taught that \n     education is\n\n[[Page S12032]]\n\n     the solution to most of the problems of mankind; and he also \n     cautioned against the arrogance of power.\n       ``It was two weeks after Hiroshima when he sponsored the \n     international education program that has affected the \n     direction of policy in country after country. He changed our \n     world forever, and for the better. And my goal is to continue \n     on the path that he envisioned.''\n       Sitting in the oval office for the one-on-one interview, \n     the president was pensive as he expounded on the legacy of \n     Fulbright's vision for the baby boomer generation. Mr. \n     Clinton also spoke of his spiritual journey as well as his \n     achievements, goals, and regrets. He addressed the character \n     issue; explained his views on the economy; poignantly \n     recalled the death of Vincent Foster; and reflected on what \n     stirs within him as he reaches his half-century.\n       Excerpts from the hour-long interview follow:\n       Ms. Feldman: Is this milestone a turning point for you?\n       President Clinton: Yes, in many ways. I feel grateful to \n     reach my 50th anniversary on Earth, to have my health, my \n     family and this job at the time when I feel most able--\n     mentally, physically, and emotionally--to do it. But I feel a \n     sort of sea change. Being 50 gives me more yesterdays than \n     tomorrows, and I'll now begin to think more about the long-\n     term implications as well as the consequences of what I do. \n     Since I've been president, I've become steadily more \n     philosophical, but not less optimistic.\n       Q. Is there anything about yourself that you'd like to \n     change as you turn 50?\n       A. Oh sure, lots of things. I'd like to develop more of \n     what my wife calls the ``discipline of gratitude.'' I'd like \n     to be able to roll with the punches more. I've become much \n     calmer in the face of buffeting events in the last few years, \n     and I hope this continues so the highs and lows of events \n     don't throw me off course.\n       Everybody has some regrets, but I've been so fortunate that \n     I feel I've gotten a better deal in life than I deserved.\n       Q. What is your most significant accomplishment in the past \n     50 years; and in the last four years?\n       A. The most significant accomplishment in my life was \n     convincing Hillary Rodham to marry me. It changed everything. \n     There is no question about that.\n       The most significant accomplishment in the last four years \n     is that I have largely succeeded in changing the way we think \n     about ourselves and our future. By doing this, I helped to \n     make it possible to make substantive changes. That's more \n     important than any specific bill I passed.\n       Q. This is the third anniversary of Vincent Foster's death, \n     so may I ask if you ever think about whether you could have \n     helped avoid that tragedy by talking out his problems with \n     him?\n       A. Absolutely, I think about that. We knew each other since \n     I was four years old. Vince worked daily with Hillary [in a \n     law firm] in Little Rock. But he was always so quiet and \n     unassuming . . . that months would go by when we wouldn't \n     have any contact. So his persona made it more difficult to \n     see that he was profoundly depressed. When he worked here [as \n     White House deputy counsel] I knew he had been under a lot of \n     stress. I called him the night before he killed himself and \n     asked if he wanted to come back and watch a movie. He said he \n     was already at home and didn't want to leave his wife and \n     return to the White House.\n       Then, he said, `` I want to talk to you about something.'' \n     And I said, ``I want to talk to you about some things.''\n       That was Monday. I told him I was busy on Tuesday and asked \n     to meet him on Wednesday. He said, ``Sure,'' and sounded very \n     calm. I don't know whether, at that time, he had already \n     decided to kill himself. And I don't know whether I could \n     have helped.\n       I hated that I was insufficiently aware that he was going \n     through that kind of pain, and I feel very bad that I missed \n     it. You know, at that time, [ July 1993] we were all getting \n     beat up very badly. Everybody was sort of bruised and also \n     amazed that the press coverage was the way it was. Still, I \n     showed up everyday for work and I thought that's what Vince \n     was doing. We thought we would work our way through it.\n       I still remember the last time I saw Vince. He was standing \n     with his hands folded, over there at the back, to the right \n     [Mr. Clinton pointed to the Rose Garden] during the ceremony \n     when I nominated Louis Freeh as FBI director. Vince was \n     pleased about the selection. He thought it would be well-\n     received in the country and in Congress. [That was on Tuesday \n     morning, July 20. He was found dead that evening.]\n       Q. Do you agree with Vince Foster's alleged suicide note, \n     in which he scribbled that ruining people is considered sport \n     in Washington, D.C.\n       A. Well, Vince was a proud person. He was a successful \n     lawyer and everyone who knew him respected him. He was a good \n     and highly ethical person, whether or not you agreed with his \n     politics. And to get the kind of licking from the editorial \n     pages of one newspaper bewildered him.\n       In retrospect, I didn't handle it well. I told him the \n     attacks should not worry him so, but he must have been taking \n     them more seriously than I knew.\n       Apparently, this is what happened to Adm. [Jerry M.] \n     Boorda. There are other victims of smear campaigns who would \n     not go that far. But they are still left with lifetime scars \n     because of mean-spirited attacks.\n       It is particularly painful because they know many of these \n     attacks register with the public even though the attackers \n     often have no reason to attack. The smear campaigns have \n     gotten too personal.\n       You know, if I win re-election, I hope to find ways to \n     minimize the destruction and the unfair, subtle personal \n     attacks because our country needs more civility.\n       Q. How concerned are you about the decline in civility in \n     the nation today?\n       A. Very much so and I'm constantly trying to do something \n     about this loss of civility and the impact it has--dividing \n     us one against the other. Too often the debate goes, ``If you \n     disagree with me, you must be no good.'' Or,''If you can't \n     prove yourself innocent of whatever I decide to charge you \n     with today, you must be guilty.''\n       Q. Given the relentless attempts at character \n     assassination, why do you want a second term here in the Oval \n     Office?\n       A. Because I can divorce those attempts from this job. They \n     are called character assassination. There is nothing any \n     person can say or do that can affect my character one bit. My \n     character will be judged by what I do and will be judged \n     ultimately by my God, not by any of these people who \n     criticize me. They may assassinate my reputation, but they \n     can't lay a hand on my character. Whether it's good or bad or \n     somewhere in between, their ability to influence it or impact \n     on it is nil.\n       Q. How has your presidency influenced your spiritual life?\n       A. It has tested my spiritual life. But at times the \n     presidency has been good for my spiritual life because I \n     realize I was not smart enough to make a lot of these \n     decisions on my own. I realize that no matter how hard I work \n     or what kind of brain God gave me, I cannot think my way \n     through or calculate entirely some of these decisions. I have \n     to feel what is the right thing to do and do it. And to do \n     that, I have to be spiritually grounded. If I go through a \n     week when I neglect my spiritual life, I can feel it. Little \n     alarms go off and I try to get back in my groove.\n       I also spend a lot of time thinking about the relationship \n     of personal morality to public purpose and public life. When \n     I was younger I read Reinhold Niebuhr's `` Moral Man and \n     Immoral Society'' and Max Weber's ``Politics as a Vocation.'' \n     They both had a profound impact on my feel for the moral, \n     spiritual challenges to people involved in politics.\n       Q. Turning to the economy, is the 2.5% growth of the GNP \n     enough to satisfy the needs of the American people?\n       A. We would be better off if we could grow a little faster. \n     If we grow at 2.8% to 3%, for a period of three or four \n     years, perhaps we could bring more private sector growth and \n     job opportunities to isolated inner city areas and rural \n     areas; and we could see genuine increases in incomes for all \n     groups. Then we wouldn't have this continuing inequality of \n     income that we've seen in the last few years.\n       But the truth is, no one knows what the optimum rate of \n     economic growth without inflation is. The only thing I tried \n     to do in dealing with the Federal Reserve was to show that I \n     would be responsible in getting the deficit down, but I \n     didn't want them to get in the way of economic growth. \n     What I hoped we could do is develop a relationship where I \n     did not interfere with the Fed's decisions, that they \n     would be governed by a philosophy that basically would \n     move on the evidence, and not on some old theory about how \n     the economy operates. With so much global competition and \n     technological change, it's possible you can grow faster \n     today without inflation than you could 30 years ago. We \n     just do not know and we need to find out.\n       Q. Can you explain why you were unable to keep you 1992 \n     campaign commitment for a middle class tax cut?\n       A. First, it's important to make the point that we made a \n     serious down payment on it. We gave 15 million families a big \n     tax cut through the Earned Income Tax Credit, which today is \n     worth about $1,000 in lower taxes to a family of four with an \n     income of $28,000 or less.\n       We stopped there because, frankly, after I won the \n     presidency it was obvious to me that the deficit was bigger \n     than I thought it was going to be, that getting it down would \n     be tougher and that we had to get a hold of it. I believed \n     that if I could cut the deficit enough, we would get interest \n     rates down and middle class people would be better off \n     because more jobs would be created and they could then \n     refinance their homes and get cheaper car payments and better \n     interest rates on their credit card payments.\n       In fact, that's true. Since I've been president, eight \n     million Americans have refinanced their home mortgages at \n     lower rates. So I think I made the right decision. But it was \n     a difficult one because I wanted to do even more. Now, for \n     the last year I've been pushing for a targeted middle class \n     tax cut dedicated primarily to education--the $1,500 credit \n     for people to go to community colleges for two years; a \n     $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition; an IRA for \n     people that would permit them to withdraw without penalty for \n     the cost of a college education, a first-time home or a \n     family medical emergency.\n       I hope these middle class tax initiatives with be adopted \n     by Congress, and I believe they will--either before or after \n     the election. Then, we'll have a fairer tax system, but we'll \n     also have a much more healthy economy than if I had \n     sacrificed deficit reduction in 1993 to cut taxes more.\n\n[[Page S12033]]\n\n       Q. If you are re-elected, do you expect any tax cuts?\n       A. Yes, the ones I just mentioned--unless we get them done \n     before Election Day. If we get them done this term, in the \n     context of the balanced budget, I would not expect \n     significant tax cuts in the next term because we must \n     continue until we balance the budget. But we already have \n     enough savings identified to balance the budget and have a \n     middle class tax cut targeted to education and child-rearing.\n       Q. Your reply indicates you expect to be re-elected. Do \n     you?\n       A. I'm hopeful about winning the election, but I'm not \n     overconfident by any means. As we do this interview the polls \n     look good, but it is forever until the election. I am working \n     hard as president, and also to be ready for the campaign, but \n     I'm not overconfident. I believe we'll be successful because \n     of our emphasis on the future.\n       Q. Speaking of the campaign, how do you compare your style \n     with Bob Dole's?\n       A. Bob Dole is not like me; we're very different. Also, he \n     has never lost an election in Kansas and I lost two [in \n     Arkansas.]\n       Q. In your estimation, what are his strengths and his \n     weaknesses as a campaigner?\n       A. I think Sen. Dole is a good campaigner, a very tough and \n     effective one, and I expect him to do rather well. I'm also \n     impressed with his patriotism. He was severely wounded in \n     World War Two and could have become indifferent and bitter \n     but he became a fine senator and public servant. You know, I \n     think it's healthy to say positive things about competitors. \n     I don't mind Senator Dole saying anything he wants to about \n     how he thinks I was wrong on the budget or the Brady Bill or \n     about any issue on which he disagrees with me. I look forward \n     to a vigorous debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12031-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY AND HONOR OF HART T. MANKIN\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ndedication, public service, and patriotism that personified the life of \nJudge Hart T. Mankin. Hart T. Mankin, an associate judge on the Federal \nAppellate Court of Veterans Appeals, passed away on May 28. I knew Hart \nwell, having worked closely with him at the Pentagon during the \nturbulent years of the Vietnam war.\n  Hart served as the General Counsel to the Department of the Navy from \n1971 to 1973. It was my privilege to first serve as Under Secretary of \nthe Navy, and then Secretary of the Navy during this same time period. \nI remember Hart as a hard working, dedicated man, who gave his time, \ntalent, and efforts to the service of his country.\n  Judge Mankin is survived by his wife Ruth, to whom he was married for \n42 years, and three children--Margaret Mankin Barton, Theodore Mankin, \nand Susan Mankin Benzel. He was also a grandfather to four lovely \ngranddaughters.\n  Hart's son, Ted, delivered the eulogy at his father's funeral \nservice. I believe the words he used to honor his father's memory are \nvery touching, and I ask that they be inserted in the Record.\n\n                       Reflections of H.T. Mankin\n\n       The great jazz musician Count Basie once said, ``To make \n     great music, it is not the notes you play, but the notes you \n     don't play.'' I would like to think that my father made his \n     music or lived his life the same way.\n       Dad's quiet strength and confidence affected everyone and \n     everything he touched.\n       As a child growing up, whenever the we wondered how Dad \n     could accomplish a certain feat, he would respond ``Clean \n     living.'' And you know what He was right.\n       While never claiming sainthood or looking for credit or \n     attention. Dad's humility contributed to the strength other \n     derived from him.\n       Dad could have been considered unemotional at times, but he \n     was quite the contrary.\n       Always centered and anchored, Dad's emotions weren't \n     symptomatic or reactionary, but honest and heartfelt.\n       At work, his calm transcended the litigious. At home, his \n     calm transcended partisan politics.\n       His methodical thorough approach to life helped us all look \n     before we leapt.\n\n\n                                 listen\n\n       That was one of Dad's secret. Whether it was personal, \n     work, or any other kind of problem, Dad listened. He might \n     help you find your path, but would never push or force you \n     into any decisions. But once your decision was final, he \n     would support you to the end.\n       To Dad, the philosophical, the intellectual, the \n     theological or spiritual were inextricably one. Any one \n     movement to one side of the triangle affected the other two \n     sides.\n       And Dad constantly pursued the truth, and at times defined \n     it legally; and at other times left the truth open ended. The \n     gray areas intrigued Dad, making him hungry for more \n     interpretations.\n       Not that Dad didn't have his light side as well. Anyone who \n     knew Dad, knew his dry sense of humor was clever yet playful. \n     We all appreciate the time Dad spent doing his small part to \n     save Delaware's Mountains.\n       Which brings us back to strength, this time strength of \n     convictions. In our family, to get a word in edgewise is a \n     feat in and of itself. But Dad, always choosing his words \n     carefully, spoke softly and always above the fray.\n       Every word he spoke was very deliberate, well thought out, \n     and almost always correct. One did not guess or take shots in \n     the dark with Dad. Come prepared before you make your point. \n     What some men say in 200 words, Dad could say in 20 words.\n       On the other hand, Dad did not wear blinders, and always \n     listened to every point of view. Because of his rare gift to \n     carefully consider every vantage point, he gradually was \n     recognized outside of his immediate family and peers as \n     someone who might really possess the truth. Some may consider \n     this blasphemous, but to many of us right here, he was the \n     truth.\n       To Dad, humanity was the coexistence of all through the \n     truth. Humanity didn't just mean kindness or tranquility, it \n     meant everyone striving for the truth and how it applied to \n     their own particular life.\n       Dad taught from legal and religious texts, but what most \n     learned from Dad came from the discipline in his demeanor.\n       We learned from my Dad, Hart Mankin, that truth and beauty \n     can be found in Maritime law, Milton, or a Texas Straw Hat.\n       God will help Dad uncover the truth, and we will continue \n     his journey. Dad we love you and miss you already.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12033-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12033-S12034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   U.S. CAPITOL HISTORICAL SOCIETY DINNER HONORING THE SENATE ARMED \n                           SERVICES COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on September 17 the U.S. Capitol Historical \nSociety hosted a wonderful dinner honoring the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee as the Committee celebrates our 180th anniversary. For those \nwho may not be familiar with the history of the Senate committees, the \nSenate established the Committee on Military Affairs and the Committee \non Naval Affairs in 1816, and these two committees were replaced by the \nArmed Services Committee in 1946.\n  Under the leadership of former Congressman Clarence Brown, the \nCapitol Historical Society does an outstanding job of preserving the \nhistory of the Congress and promoting and encouraging the public's \ninterest in this great institution. I want to express my appreciation \nto Congressman Brown and the staff of the Capitol Historical Society \nfor the delightful evening honoring the committee.\n  Mr. President, the featured speaker at this dinner was Dr. James \nSchlesinger, a man who has made an enormous contribution to our \nnational security.\n  I have know and worked with Jim Schlesinger since I came to the \nSenate in 1973. Over the years he has testified numerous times before \nthe Armed Services Committee--both as a cabinet official and as a \nprivate citizen whose advice and counsel the committee has repeatedly \nsought on most of the difficult national security issues we have faced \nover the years. All of the members of the Armed Services Committee--\nboth Democrats and Republicans --regard Jim Schlesinger as one of the \npillars of this Nation's security.\n  In my remarks at the dinner, Mr. President, I recalled a Senate \nresolution which the Armed Services Committee and the full Senate \nadopted in 1975 and which I coauthored with our late colleague Senator \nScoop Jackson. It was Senate Resolution 303, and it read:\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States commends \n     Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger for his excellence \n     in office, his intellectual honesty and personal integrity, \n     and for his courage and independence. The Senate believes \n     that our country and the free world owe a great debt of \n     gratitude to Secretary Schlesinger for his untiring efforts \n     to improve the efficiency of our armed forces, the \n     cohesiveness of our alliances, the wisdom of our strategic \n     policies and doctrine, and for his determination to convey to \n     the American people the truth as he saw it and the sense of \n     the future he so deeply believed they must understand.\n\n  Mr. President, those comments about Jim Schlesinger are as true today \nas they were when the Senate passed this resolution in 1975. As I end \nmy Senate career, I want to thank Jim Schlesinger for his tremendous \ncontributions to U.S. national security and foreign policy and to me \npersonnally.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Schlesinger's remarks to the Capitol\n\n[[Page S12034]]\n\nHistorical Society dinner honoring the 180th anniversary of the Armed \nServices Committee be included in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I also want to note for my colleagues that the Center \nfor Legislative Archives of the National Archives will soon be \npublishing a history of the Armed Services Committee by historian \nRichard McCulley. All of us on the Armed Services Committee are very \nexcited about this project and eagerly look forward to its completion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12033-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12034-S12035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n Remarks of the Honorable James R. Schlesinger, United States Capitol \nHistorical Society Dinner Honoring the 180th Anniversary of the Senate \n              Armed Services Committee, September 17, 1996\n\n       I want to join Bud Brown in welcoming you to this evening's \n     festivities run by the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, \n     chartered by Congress with the uphill responsibilities of \n     preserving American history.\n       Why are we here this evening? We are here this evening to \n     celebrate the 180th anniversary of the founding of the \n     predecessors of the Senate Armed Services Committee and to \n     honor the committee for its exemplary service to the nation. \n     Actually, the Senate Armed Services Committee is only 50 \n     years old--created as a result of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946, which Bud Brown's father was \n     instrumental in bringing about to create the Hoover \n     Commission.\n       As all of you know, the Preamble to the Constitution--``We \n     the People''--Article I of the Constitution assigns to the \n     Congress the responsibility to raise and support armies and \n     to provide and maintain the Navy. In turn, that \n     responsibility is entrusted by both Houses to their Armed \n     Services Committees.\n       As I said, this is the 50th Anniversary of this committee. \n     Its predecessors trace back to 1816, back even to the \n     Continental Congress itself which maintained such close daily \n     supervision over General Washington. That close daily \n     supervision is increasingly emulated by the current Congress.\n       Founded in 1947, the Congress preceded the Pentagon in \n     achieving unification of the Armed Forces. Indeed the \n     chairman of the Armed Services Committee is senior to the \n     Secretary of Defense. In fact, the committee provides a \n     channel for communications. It is sometimes difficult to \n     communicate to one another. As you know, this difficulty in \n     communication is reflected in the fact that different \n     services do not use words in the same way. Take for example \n     that simple English verb--secure. It has different meanings \n     for each of the services. To the U.S. Navy, secure as in \n     ``secure a building'' simply means to turn out the lights and \n     lock the door. To the U.S. Army, secure means seize and hold. \n     To the U.S. Marine Corps, it means attack and destroy. And, \n     to the U.S. Air Force, secure means a three-year lease with \n     option to buy.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I shall pass over such sensitive \n     issues from the past as the committee hearing on General \n     Custer's actions at the Battle of Little Bighorn, the Civil \n     War (sometimes referred to as the Late Unpleasantness), Billy \n     Mitchell, or the firing of Douglas MacArthur. Those last \n     hearings, I believe, took place in this Senate Caucus Room.\n       I turn to two subjects. The first--the characteristics of \n     the Committee. And secondly, its substantive activity.\n       As you know, the existence of the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee more or less coincides with the Cold War. As a \n     consequence, the Armed Services Committee has attracted the \n     giants of the Senate. Richard Russell himself after whom this \n     building is named, was actually the second to chair the \n     Committee. John Stennis, who died last year, and who declared \n     in his 1947 race, ``I want to plow a straight furrow right \n     down to the end of my row.'' And that he did. Both Russell \n     and Stennis served as Chairmen of the Armed Services \n     Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee--a practice now \n     prohibited because it looks as if it is an inside operation.\n       But there are other giants--Scoop Jackson, Barry Goldwater, \n     Leverett Saltonstall, John Tower, not to mention our co-host \n     of the evening--Strom Thurmond, the present chairman. You may \n     not believe this, but Strom and I both received our degrees \n     from the University of South Carolina on the very same day. \n     Sam Nunn--the ranking Democrat--has been an illustrious \n     chairman for so many years and my trusted friend for this \n     past quarter century. I have not mentioned some of the 35 \n     members of the Committee I have known over the years.\n       The second characteristic of the Committee is that it is \n     heavily Southern, as you may have known from the Chairman. My \n     calculation of the 50 years this Committee has been in \n     existence --42 have had Southern chairmen. The South, as you \n     know, is the only part of this country with a historic memory \n     of being subjected to military occupation. In the South, it \n     has been determined that fate would not come to this nation \n     as a whole. Georgia, South Carolina--I liked to believe that \n     the last and best service performed by the late great William \n     Sherman was to create the tradition of Southern dedication to \n     national security. I know many of you will appreciate that, \n     but our friend from Ohio won't.\n       The third element in this Committee's history is its \n     bipartisan tradition. Strom Thurmond exemplifies that \n     tradition in an exceptional way. The first six years he was \n     on this Committee, he was a Democrat. The last 30 years he \n     has been a Republican. That bipartisan tradition may reflect \n     the affinity that Southern Democrats had for the Grand Old \n     Party.\n       Senator Nunn, during the recent ceremony at the Pentagon, \n     thanking him for his service, in his invocation commented \n     that, in his experience, nothing is accomplished in Congress \n     unless it is on a bipartisan basis. During the period of \n     Republican dominance during the early 1980s, he was the \n     driving force in creating this more integrated Pentagon.\n       My first connection with this Committee was with Scoop \n     Jackson. When I was still at the RAND Corporation, Scoop \n     Jackson asked me for an assessment of systems analysis as it \n     was practiced at the Pentagon under Secretary McNamara. Scoop \n     tended to be harder on Democratic Administrations than on \n     Republican Administrations.\n       The fourth characteristic of this Committee is that it's \n     conservative. The Democrats score lower than other Democrats \n     on the ADA scale of liberalism. Republicans score lower on \n     that ADA scale than do other Republicans. And it's on that \n     conservatism that I had to rely, in those years that we \n     needed support, those happy days, Vietnam and the aftermath \n     of Vietnam.\n       But this Committee is conservative in a different and \n     special sense. It recognizes that there are no free rides. \n     The Committee knows that international engagement is not \n     free--that one needs careful preparation. This Committee has \n     learned through this bitter experience. It needs a more than \n     adequate structure. It needs modernization, training and \n     above all readiness, so that the United States is not put \n     through the embarrassment it was put through at the start of \n     World War II.\n       Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a public \n     tendency to treat American leadership in the world as just \n     another entitlement. It is not. American leadership requires \n     more than rhetoric; it requires continued effort and \n     sacrifice.\n       The final characteristic of this Committee is that it is \n     the protector of the military services. It is historically \n     wary of Defense Secretaries who might neglect or abuse the \n     institutional requirements of the services.\n       Let me turn for a few moments to the substantive activities \n     of this Committee.\n       Foresight. We must go back to the 1930s, before the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee existed in its present form. There \n     was Carl Vinson--the Chairman of the Committee on Naval \n     Affairs. When the great uncle of Sam Nunn, who in the late \n     1930s managed to pass the Vinson-Trammell Act. The Act \n     authorized ship construction monies despite the ample federal \n     deficit. And as a result of the Act, the carriers that were \n     created included the Yorktown, which was launched in 1937; \n     the Enterprise in 1938; and the Hornet in 1941--all before \n     Pearl Harbor. Those are the three carriers that won the \n     battle of Midway. Without that legislation, we would have \n     lost the battle of Midway. The Japanese could have cruised \n     along the Pacific coast of the U.S. That would have made it \n     difficult for the U.S. to win that war.\n       We mention this although today it is fashionable to object \n     to deficit spending in all of its forms. If we would have had \n     an annually balanced budget then, we might have lost World \n     War II. An annually balanced budget may be a high \n     priority, but it is not the first priority of this nation.\n       When our conventional strength was eroding, during the \n     period when the President was negotiating the Salt II \n     agreement, this Committee, on a historical and bi-partisan \n     basis, asked the administration to increase defense \n     expenditures for conventional forces and to rebuild our \n     stockpiles of conventional ammunition, on the penalty of the \n     loss of support on a bipartisan basis for SALT II. That is \n     followed by the Reagan build-up and those actions paid \n     substantial dividends during the Gulf War. The inventories \n     were full, and we were ready. Fully mission capable rates for \n     the U.S. Air Force for all aircraft during that war was 90 \n     percent. By contrast in World War II, the mission capable \n     rates were no higher than 50 percent for any length in \n     period, and in the Carter years, for the B-52s. The rate was \n     40 percent for fighter aircraft.\n       The Senate Armed Services Committee has not always been \n     triumphant. In the 1950s, they repeatedly tried to force the \n     B-70 bomber on the Eisenhower Administration. The Committee \n     failed in its effort, but of course not every President is an \n     allied member in Europe, conqueror of Hitler, a 5-star \n     general and chief of staff of the Army. The Committee has \n     been more persuasive with other presidents. And I'm happy to \n     say that the B-52s are doing alright.\n       Let me close with some additional observations. These are \n     comments about the present and the future. At the end of the \n     Cold War, there has been a massive shift of power within the \n     U.S. as Congress is reasserting its prerogatives--and a \n     resurgence of power toward the Congress. Constitutional \n     limits that were ignored are being restored. From the time at \n     Pearl Harbor until roughly the time of the Tet Offensive in \n     1967, the Congress regularly deferred to the President; that \n     pure deference is now over. Congress must resist the \n     temptation by any Congressional majority to embarrass the \n     President. There is danger these days that everything becomes \n     final for politics.\n       Second, the U.S. is a rather odd country to serve as a \n     world leader. It is not as ruthless\n\n[[Page S12035]]\n\n     as some of the former imperial powers including France, as \n     well as Germany and Japan. The U.S. was ideally suited for \n     the task of the Cold War in which there was a long-term \n     military threat, unchanging year after year that the public \n     would focus on. Now there are numerous but petty threats--\n     clashes of nationalism--clashes of ethnic origin. The rest of \n     the world does not understand the U.S. Constitution, does not \n     understand separation of powers and does not understand that \n     in this country to conduct foreign policy, we need to have a \n     consensus. We need to have public acquiescence in that \n     foreign policy. It makes the U.S. as the great ruling power \n     of the world somewhat different from anything in the past. \n     Leadership is not an entitlement; it must be earned each \n     year, each decade. And leadership can be costly. As long as \n     offense and expenditures are being maintained in this \n     country, other nations and other groups will be driven to \n     terrorism as the only way to strike at the United States. \n     Terrorism may be unpleasant, but it is less unpleasant than \n     war.\n       Leadership implies choices--choices that we must avoid \n     being over committed. We have spread forces in recent years; \n     Saddam Hussein had noticed this recently. We have spread our \n     political capital even thinner. Why do I say that? One must \n     not overload the American public with international \n     obligations, for the public will no longer accept it. \n     Whatever we may say, whatever we may proclaim that we're not \n     going to be the world's policemen, too frequently we become \n     the world's policeman. As Sullivan proclaimed it, ``A \n     policeman's lot is not a happy one.''\n       We accommodate dependents. And we cannot afford to \n     accumulate dependents. We develop public hatred for them. We \n     cannot come to any accommodations for them. We must shed \n     both. Being the world leader is difficult. We must retain a \n     technological edge. The American public is not eager to \n     sustain high casualties for what appear to be petty purposes. \n     And therefore, in order to hold casualties down it is \n     essential for us to maintain a technological edge. The \n     problem, though, is that we tend to reveal our technologies. \n     We reveal all, as we did during the Gulf War. We showcase our \n     technologies. Everybody now understands the global position \n     that existed. that is the price that must be paid when \n     American forces go to war. We can never rest from our past \n     accomplishments. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, once again, \n     as always, eternal vigilance remains the price of \n     freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12034-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ROMANIAN-HUNGARIAN BILATERAL TREATY\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to draw the attention of the \nSenate to the signing by the Governments of Hungary and Romania of a \nbasic bilateral treaty intended to normalize relations and resolve \nlongstanding border disputes and ethnic rivalries between the two \ncountries.\n  The Prime Ministers of Hungary and Romania signed the bilateral \ntreaty on September 16 marking an important step toward insuring peace \nand stability in Central Europe. Their signing represents the \nculmination of several years of difficult negotiations and, when \nratified by both countries, will help ease centuries of conflict and \ntension between these neighbors.\n  The treaty obligates both countries to respect the basic civil rights \nand cultural identities of minorities in each country. Educational and \nlinguistic guarantees and other communal protections are enshrined in \nthe treaty. When ratified and faithfully implemented, the resolution of \nborder disputes and respect for the rights of minorities that are \nembodied in the treaty will be an important model for other countries \nwith comparable ethnic and nationality problems. Further, the treaty \nwill move each country closer to satisfying requirements set for \nsuccessful integration into western institutions, including membership \nin the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  As Romania and Hungary continue to strengthen their democratic \ninstitutions, develop free-market economies, and ensure respect for \nhuman rights, their governments and the political parties supporting \nthis process are to be commended for taking the political risk required \nto reach an agreement on this treaty. It is a significant example of \ntwo nations putting the best interests of regional stability ahead of \ndomestic political interests.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I want to congratulate the governments and \npeoples of Hungary and Romania for successfully reaching agreement on \nthis historic bilateral treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12035-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12035-S12036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DAVID ABSHIRE\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as this Congress and my own career in \nthe U.S. Senate come to an end, I want to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished American who has been of great assistance to me, to the \nSenate, and to our Nation, Ambassador David Abshire.\n  During my career in the Senate, David Abshire has been one of the \nleading figures in the national security field in the United States. \nAlthough he is probably best known for his service as our Ambassador to \nNATO and as the founder and president of the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies [CSIS], these are just two examples from his \ncareer of service to our Nation.\n  David Abshire was born in Chattanooga, TN in 1926. He graduated from \nWest Point in 1951 and served with distinction in the Korean war, as a \nplatoon leader, company commander and division assistant intelligence \nofficer. His decorations for service as a front line commander included \nthe Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster with V for Valor.\n  In 1959 he received a Ph.D. in history from Georgetown University, \nwhere he returned to serve as an adjunct professor for many years.\n  In the early 1970's, he served as Assistant Secretary of State and \nlater as chairman of the U.S. Board for International Broadcasting. He \nwas a member of the Murphy Commission on the Organization of the \nGovernment, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, and \nheaded President Reagan's National Security transition team.\n  During the Reagan administration he served with distinction as the \nU.S. Ambassador to NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Dr. \nAbshire served in this position during a very challenging period when \nthe Soviet deployment of SS-20 missiles led to NATO's deployment of the \ncruise missiles and the Pershing missile. Ambassador Abshire's efforts \nbore fruit when the U.S. deployment led to the first major arms \nreduction treaty, the INF treaty. For his service as Ambassador he was \nawarded the Defense Department's highest civilian award, the \nDistinguished Public Service Medal.\n  I had the opportunity of working with David Abshire during his tenure \nas Ambassador on several important issues, including my amendment to \nforce our NATO allies to contribute their fair share to our common \ndefense, and on the NATO Cooperative Research and Development program.\n  In 1987, after finishing his service as Ambassador, he served as \nSpecial Counsellor to President Reagan. It is not surprising that a man \nto whom so many of us have turned for wise counsel and advice should be \ncalled on by the President of the United States as a Special \nCounsellor.\n\n  David Abshire's contributions to the national security field are not \nlimited to his Government service. In recent years Dr. Abshire and CSIS \nhave continued to stimulate debate and discussion on important foreign \npolicy issues such as our policies toward Bosnia and China.\n  Dr. Abshire's talents have extended beyond Government service and \nacademia to benefit our Nation in other areas as well. He is a member \nof the Council on Competitiveness, the Council on Foreign Relations and \nthe International Institute for Strategic Studies, to name but a few of \nthe organizations who have sought out his talents.\n  Dr. Abshire is also an author, and I want to call special attention \nto his most recent book, ``Putting America's House in Order.'' This \nbook demonstrates Dr. Abshire's keen grasp not just of matters of \nnational security, but of the whole range of issues from deficit \nreduction to investments in, and reforms of, our education and training \npolicies, that are necessary to put our Nation's house in order.\n  In 1991, under Dr. Abshire's leadership, CSIS created the \nStrengthening of America Commission to address these issues. I was \nhonored that Dr. Abshire asked me and my friend and colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Pete Domenici, to serve as co-chairs of this \ncommission. I am very proud of the Strengthening of America report that \nour commission released in September of 1992 and am grateful to David \nAbshire for his leadership in creating this commission and seeing it \nthrough to a successful conclusion.\n  The work of the CSIS Strengthening of America Commission exemplified \nthe best of David Abshire--long-term thinking and a keen insight into \nthe\n\n[[Page S12036]]\n\nfundamental issues facing our Nation. Our report challenged not just \nGovernment but our schools, our businesses and our parents to take the \nsteps needed to secure a prosperous future for our Nation. We laid out \na plan of action to get our fiscal house in order; to raise our level \nof national savings and our level of public and private investment in \nboth physical and human capital; and to improve the way Washington \nworks.\n  It is with great pleasure that I end my Senate career with a public \nthank you to a man who has contributed so much to U.S. national \nsecurity and foreign policy and to me personally, David Abshire. I wish \nDavid, his wife Carolyn, and his family all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12035-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GRAZING OPERATIONS IN GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to express my desire to work \nwith the National Park Service to address the issue of open space in \nthe Teton Valley and its interrelationship with grazing in Grand Teton \nNational Park. Since establishment of the park in 1950, a limited \nnumber of local ranchers, who had grazing privileges within the \nboundaries of Grand Teton Park before its establishment, have been \nallowed to continue to graze within the area. These grazing permits \nwere given for the life of the designated heirs of the permit holders \nwho were local ranchers that required the summer range to maintain \ntheir ranches.\n  This arrangement has not only benefitted the ranch families involved, \nbut helped support the ecology in the park and preserved open space in \nJackson Valley for visitors to this unique region. Unfortunately, in \nthe past few years, both of the designed heirs to these grazing permits \nhave died. Although both families have expressed their interest in \ncontinuing to ranch in Jackson Valley, the Park Service may be forced \nto terminate these grazing permits unless a reasonable solution can be \nfound. Without the summer range available in the park, these ranchers \nmay be forced to end their operations and sell their ranches. If these \nranches are sold, they would be immediately subdivided and developed \nand the open space provided by these areas would be gone forever.\n  It is an imperative environmental issue that we work to ensure that \nopen space is preserved in and around Grand Teton National Park. This \nregion is truly unique and it is vital for both the wildlife living in \nand around the park and the environment throughout the region that open \nspace is protected. Unless the ranchers are allowed to continue grazing \nin the park, the region will be threatened with development that will \nharm the wildlife and the ecology in and around the park.\n  In the coming months, the Wyoming congressional delegation plans to \nwork with the National Park Service, the ranch families, the \nenvironmental community and local citizens to develop a solution to \nthis situation. By working together, I am hopeful we can continue to \nprotect the open space in this magnificent region and continue an \nactivity that has been monitored and managed by the Park Service for \nover 45 years. Make no mistake about it, ending grazing operations in \nGrand Teton National Park will be harmful to park resources, wildlife \nin the area and will destroy open space for visitors to this \noutstanding region. I look forward to working with the National Park \nService in the coming months to address this critical matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12036-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12036-S12037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MILITARY QUALITY OF LIFE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue \nthat has troubled me greatly over the years and has recently become an \neven greater problem as our Nation strives toward a balanced budget. \nThis is the issue of the quality of life of our service men and women.\n  As a former enlisted sailor in the Navy, a commissioned officer in \nthe Marine Corps, and Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, I have \na particular empathy for our men and women in uniform. These men and \nwomen make sacrifices every day, throughout their careers, in defense \nof our nation. However, the pay and benefits that they receive, which \nin some cases are woefully inadequate, are constantly under attack by \npeople and organizations that are too focused on the bottom-line and \nnot on the morale and readiness of our Armed Forces. It is for this \nreason that I, as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, \nsleep with one eye open in order to protect the benefits which our \nservice members and veterans have earned through loyal and patriotic \nservice to our Nation.\n  I have worked hard, together with my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee, to provide increased funding to improve the quality of life \nof our Armed Forces. In particular, we have been concerned about the \nlack of adequate funding for the maintenance of military housing. Many \nof our service members and their families are forced to live in \nsubstandard housing. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee \nthis year, Department of Defense officials testified that a full 80 \npercent of military housing falls below Department of Defense \nstandards. The result of years of diverting maintenance funds to other \nrequirements is military housing units with leaky plumbing, flaking \npaint and broken appliances. Our service members deserve better!\n  That is why I was so concerned to see two articles in the most recent \neditions of the Navy and Army Times which describe further inequities \nfor our service members in the area of military housing. I ask \nunanimous consent that these articles be printed in the Record.\n  The first article concerns a report by the General Accounting Office, \ndated September 17, 1996, which recommends that military families \nshould begin paying rent for living in Government quarters. The report \nsuggests that the rental payments are not primarily to raise money from \nmilitary families, but to treat all service members equally whether \nthey live on or off base. It is unfortunate that GAO's recommended \nsolution to fix what they perceive to be an inequity is to raise the \nout-of-pocket expenses of the families living on-base, rather than \nincrease the housing allowances to an adequate level for those living \noff-base. GAO's first response is to cut benefits to our Armed Forces.\n  I was pleased to see that the Pentagon opposes this idea. I will work \nwith my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to ensure that this \nGAO recommendation is not adopted.\n  The second article concerns a recent ruling by the General Accounting \nOffice that a service member who is required to move because of \nrenovation or construction of their base housing, is not eligible for a \ndislocation allowance to cover the expenses of that move. This is an \nissue of basic fairness. How can the Government, in good conscience, \norder a military service member to uproot and move his or her family \nand all of their possessions, but not pay the expenses of that move? \nThis is another example of the constant attack on the benefits of our \nservice members.\n  I will work with the Pentagon to try to find a solution to this \nproblem. It is my understanding that the Pentagon had been paying \nservice members a dislocation allowance for these moves prior to the \nGAO ruling. I am hopeful that a quick solution can be found so that \nservice members will not have to bear the cost of these moves. If \nnecessary, I will introduce legislation next year to correct this \nunfair practice.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we end this continuous assault on the \nquality of life of our Armed Forces. It is a question of fairness and \nrespect for those that so selflessly serve our nation and defend the \nfreedom that we all hold dear.\n\n                 [From the Navy Times, Sept. 30, 1996]\n\n       Paying Rent on Base? Government Report Says All Should Pay\n\n                             (By Rick Maze)\n\n       Military families should begin paying a modest rent for \n     living in government quarters, according to a new \n     congressional report.\n       The rental payments are being suggested not so much to \n     raise money from military families as they are to treat all \n     service members equally, whether they live on or off base.\n       But the underlying reason is that the rental payments would \n     eliminate the attraction of living on base for many military \n     members, and that would result in huge savings for the \n     government\n       The ``rent'' would vary by rank and location, but would \n     average $2,016 a year, according to the Sept. 17 General \n     Accounting Office report. That is the same amount as the \n     average out-of-pocket cost for service members with families \n     living off base, whose housing\n\n[[Page S12037]]\n\n     allowances are set to fall roughly 18.5 percent short of \n     covering the full cost of lodging and utilities.\n\n\n                        no rent checks just yet\n\n       Rent checks won't be required any time soon, because the \n     report was delivered to the Senate Armed Services personnel \n     subcommittee just weeks before Congress was scheduled to \n     adjourn.\n       But the recommendations will play a part in the debate next \n     year over both the planned overhaul of the military housing \n     allowances and the Pentagon's continued push to improve \n     housing conditions, both on and off base.\n       In recommending the on-base rents, auditors from the \n     bipartisan congressional office said it isn't fair that \n     people living off base must pay out of their own pockets for \n     housing while people in the government quarters live rent-\n     free.\n       But the real reason the bipartisan office is pushing the \n     idea is the belief that charging even a modest amount for \n     living in military family housing could save money. That's \n     because rent-free living is one of the major attractions of \n     living in government quarters.\n       If there is no financial difference between living on or \n     off base, the government might be able to reduce its housing \n     inventory. That would save money, the report says, because it \n     costs the government an average of $4,957 more per year for \n     each family living in government quarters than it costs to \n     subsidize families living off base.\n\n\n                            dod says ``no''\n\n       The Defense Department opposes the idea, saying the rent \n     would have ``potentially severe consequences for military \n     retention and readiness, a sit would equate to a reduction in \n     benefits for those personnel.''\n       In an official response included in the GAO report, defense \n     officials said the ``only viable alternative'' is increasing \n     housing allowances to eliminate unreimbursed expenses for \n     those living off base.\n       But that is not likely.\n       It would take about $1.4 billion a year to raise housing \n     allowances by enough to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for \n     people living off base, defense officials said. It would cost \n     $322 million a year to reduce average unreimbursed housing \n     expenses to 15 percent, the goal of the current allowance \n     system.\n       The point of the GAO report is that the services could and \n     should rely more on the private sector to provide housing and \n     eliminate some family quarters. The one exception, according \n     to the report, is that more on-base housing should be \n     dedicated to junior enlisted members with families, who have \n     the greatest difficulty finding affordable off-base housing.\n       Defense officials said they will leave decisions about who \n     gets on-base housing to installation commanders. In some \n     cases, junior enlisted personnel get priority. But in most \n     places, career service members whom the services want to \n     retain are given on-base housing ahead of junior members, \n     defense officials said.\n       There are some locations with more on-base housing than \n     necessary, defense officials said.\n       Construction plans have been modified to prevent \n     overbuilding, but any existing housing that can be \n     economically maintained will be kept open.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Army Times, Sept. 30, 1996]\n\n Military Won't Pay for You To Move Out of Way--You'll Pick Up Tab for \n                Relocating for Base Housing Renovations\n\n                          (By Andrew Compart)\n\n       The good news: The military is fixing the housing at your \n     base.\n       The bad news: Although the military is forcing you to move \n     because of renovations or new construction, it cannot pay you \n     a dislocation allowance to cover your expenses, the General \n     Accounting Office ruled Sept. 11.\n       The dislocation allowance, designed to help military people \n     offset the costs of forced moves, is only intended for use \n     when a move is required because of a permanent change of \n     station or an evacuation, the GAO Comptroller General's \n     Office said in its decision.\n       The military can use other funds, such as money designated \n     for operations and maintenance, to help people pay for \n     ``mandatory'' items, such as charges for hooking up the \n     telephone and other utilities, the ruling said. But even that \n     money cannot be used to help offset the cost of ``personal'' \n     items, such as drapes or rugs.\n\n\n                  couldn't afford ``anything decent''\n\n       The GAO ruling came in a case involving Air Force SSgt. \n     Daren Pierce at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, after \n     the financial services officer for the base's 366th \n     Comptroller Squadron asked for a decision on the issue.\n       Pierce said he was one of many people to complain when they \n     found out they couldn't get the dislocation allowance, which \n     is a lump-sum payment equal to a person's basic allowance for \n     quarters for two months. He spent $150 to $200 for blinds at \n     his previous home, and though he could scarcely afford it, he \n     spent $120 on the cheapest blinds he could find for the new \n     home.\n       Pierce said he would have been satisfied with a partial \n     dislocation allowance. ``I'm not out there to get a bunch of \n     money. But I feel we should be reimbursed for what our \n     expenses were,'' he said, adding that he believes the housing \n     construction is necessary for people at the base.\n       Mountain Home is replacing 52 of 612 1950s-era family \n     housing units with two-bedroom homes for junior enlisted \n     people, a project that began in mid-February. Eventually all \n     units will be replaced, said Senior Airman Sonja Whittington, \n     a base spokeswoman.\n       The base left some homes empty in anticipation of the \n     reconstruction, and it met with the other families in ``town \n     meetings'' to answer questions about their impending moves. \n     The base paid for movers and expenses such as telephone and \n     cable television connections.\n       Initially the base also paid the dislocation allowance to \n     12 of the families, Whittington said. But within a week the \n     base was told by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n     that it had made a mistake, according to Whittington and the \n     GAO summary of the case, and the base had to ask the families \n     to give the money back.\n       ``It's unfortunate there was an error, but getting brand \n     new housing is a nice thing,'' Whittington said. ``We tried \n     to make it as easy on our people as we could within the \n     guidelines.''\n       It is not known how often complaints about unreimbursed \n     expenses arise. Richard Hentz, in charge of programming for \n     Army family housing construction projects, said the issue \n     never has been raised with him.\n       At Fort Knox, Ky., where housing renovations are scheduled \n     to begin Nov. 1, officials stopped moving people into homes \n     that are to be renovated. But even still, more than 400 \n     families are being affected, said Peter Andrysiak, chief of \n     the base's housing division.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12036-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12037-S12038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MICHIGAN'S UPPER PENINSULA FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, in preparation for renewed \nconsideration of adding countries to the NAFTA and of fast-track \nlegislation for this purpose, it is imperative, in my view, that action \nbe taken to resolve a serious problem with the NAFTA: The NAFTA Chapter \n19 dispute settlement system for antidumping duty and countervailing \nduty appeals.\n  In August of last year, nine of my Senate colleagues, including the \nformer majority leader and the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee of \nthe Committee on Finance, expressed serious concerns about Chapter 19 \nin a letter to then-U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I wish to emphasize that I share the \nconcerns of the authors of this letter and believe that addressing this \nfailed system must be a priority for U.S. trade policy. Under Chapter \n19, appeals of determinations that imports are subsidized or dumped \ninto the U.S. market were, for NAFTA countries, transferred from \ndomestic courts to panels of private individuals, which include foreign \nnationals. The system was introduced in 1988 as a provisional \ncompromise for the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Although \nserious reservations were expressed about Chapter 19 at that time, it \nwas accepted on an interim basis with Canada only until disciplines \nagainst Canadian subsidies and dumping could be negotiated. Although no \nsuch unfair trade disciplines were agreed to, Chapter 19 was, \nunfortunately, extended to the NAFTA. Its inclusion was a key reason \nfor my vote against that agreement.\n  Chapter 19's infirmities are several. As the Justice Department \nindicated in 1988, there are major constitutional problems with giving \nprivate panelists--sometimes a majority of whom are foreign nationals--\nthe authority to issue decisions about U.S. domestic law that have the \nbinding force of law. These panelists, coming from different legal and \ncultural disciplines and serving on an ad hoc basis, do not necessarily \nhave the interest that unbiased U.S. courts do in maintaining the \nefficacy of the laws as Congress wrote them. Moreover, the ad hoc, \nfragmented nature of Chapter 19 decision-making can lead to \ncontradictory outcomes, even with regard to a single instance of \nalleged unfair trade.\n  In practice, Chapter 19 has revealed itself to be unacceptable. A \nforemost example is the Chapter 19 review of a 1992 United States \ncountervailing duty finding that Canadian lumber imports benefit from \nenormous subsidies. Three Canadian panelists outvoted two leading \nUnited States legal experts to eliminate the countervailing duty based \non patently erroneous interpretations of United States law--\ninterpretations that Congress had expressly rejected only months \nbefore. Two of the Canadian panelists served despite egregious, \nundisclosed conflicts of interest. The matter then was argued before a \nChapter 19 appeals committee, and the two Canadian committee members \noutvoted the one United States member to once again insulate the \nCanadian subsidies from United States law.\n  The U.S. committee member was Malcolm Wilkey, the former Chief Judge \nof the Federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and one of the \nUnited States' most distinguished jurists. In his opinion, Judge Wilkey \nwrote that the lumber panel decision ``may violate more principles of \nappellate review of agency action than any opinion by a reviewing body \nwhich I have ever read.'' Judge Wilkey and former Judge Charles \nRenfrew--also a Chapter 19 appeals committee member--have since \nexpressed serious constitutional reservations about the system. While \nsome have claimed that Chapter 19 decides many cases well, its \ninability to resolve appropriately large disputes, and its \nconstitutional infirmity, demand a remedy.\n  Like my colleagues who wrote to Ambassador Kantor, I believe that \nsomething must be done about Chapter 19. I support returning appellate \njurisdiction to the U.S. judiciary where it had long rested and still \nrests for non-NAFTA countries. Alternatively, Chapter 19 perhaps could \nbe reformed to eliminate its constitutional and practical infirmities. \nIt should, at minimum, be clear to executive branch officials that \nChapter 19 cannot be extended to any additional country in its current \nform, be it Chile or any other NAFTA prospect. I look forward to \nworking diligently in the upcoming Congress to correct this serious \nproblem.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                  August 21, 1995.\n     Ambassador Michael Kantor,\n     Trade Representative, Executive Office of the President, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: In light of the advent of the new \n     trade and dispute settlement rules in the agreements \n     establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), we are \n     writing to express our concern with the current system for \n     reviewing antidumping and countervailing duty cases under the \n     NAFTA.\n       As you know, the original intent regarding Chapter 19 was \n     that: 1) it would be limited to Canada and quickly phased \n     out; 2) panelist conflict-of-interest rules would be strictly \n     enforced; and 3) panels reviewing U.S. determinations would \n     be bound, like the U.S. Court of International Trade, by U.S. \n     law and its deferential standard of review.\n       It is clear that these conditions have not been met. \n     Despite earlier assurances to the contrary, the system was \n     extended to Mexico and effectively made ``permanent'' with \n     respect to Canada and Mexico in the NAFTA. Moreover, the \n     U.S.-Canada softwood lumber case demonstrated serious \n     inadequacies and problems with conflicts of interest and \n     standards of review under the Chapter 19 system.\n       We believe that because of the intended temporary nature of \n     Chapter 19 and the great controversy it has engendered, the \n     Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism should not be \n     extended in future trade agreements to any other country, \n     including the present NAFTA accession negotiations with \n     Chile. This belief is without regard to whether such \n     agreements should be concluded.\n       Under Chapter 19, ad hoc panels of private individuals rule \n     in place of judges on whether antidumping and countervailing \n     duties have been imposed consistent with the domestic law of \n     the importing country. This requires Chapter 19 panels to \n     interpret and apply national law itself, rather than \n     resolving disputes over the interpretation of international \n     agreements as would normally occur in international dispute \n     settlement like the WTO. These panel decisions are \n     automatically implemented without judicial or political \n     review of accountable government officials.\n       In light of the WTO's new binding international dispute \n     settlement process, and the Uruguay Round's new agreements on \n     subsidies and dumping, we question the need for a special \n     NAFTA trade remedy. It is our belief, especially in light of \n     past experience, that disputes about U.S. law are best left \n     to the U.S. Court system.\n       Absent an outright elimination of Chapter 19, which we \n     would certainly consider in a favorable light, substantial \n     attention should be given to reforming Chapter 19 with \n     respect to the current NAFTA. The United States should not \n     agree to extend this fundamentally flawed system to any other \n     country. We trust that you will consider our suggestion in \n     your ongoing negotiations with Chile, and urge increased \n     consultation with the Congress during the process.\n       We appreciate your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Max Baucus, David Pryor, John Rockefeller, John Breaux, \n           Kent Conrad, Chuck Grassley, Bob Dole, Orrin Hatch, \n           Alfonse D'Amato.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12038-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12038-S12039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SHERRY KOHLENBERG\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, exactly 2 weeks ago on September 16, I was \nprivileged to join with Virginia's First\n\n[[Page S12039]]\n\nLady, Mrs. Susan Allen, in the opening of the Face of Breast Cancer \nexhibit at the Regency Square Mall in Richmond, VA. This dramatic \nexhibition displays the photographs and life stories of 84 American \nwomen who have tragically become the victims of breast cancer. Of those \nportrayed, four were Virginians: Marianne Thatcher of Arlington, \nLorraine M. Smusz of Buchanan, Kyong Ja Kim Pearce of Herndon, and \nSharon Helen ``Sherry'' Kohlenberg of Richmond.\n  At the opening of the exhibit, the Virginia Breast Cancer Foundation, \nwhich together with the National Breast Cancer Coalition sponsored the \nexhibit, presented the 1996 Sharon H. Kohlenberg Healthcare Service \nAward to two outstanding individuals for their exceptional \ncontributions in the fight against breast cancer. Those honored were \nDr. Claire Carman, a surgeon from Tidewater, VA; and Katharine Spiegel, \na nurse from the Medical College of Virginia.\n  Presenting the awards was Mr. Larry Goldman, husband of Sherry \nKohlenberg, and their son, Sammy. In memory of Sherry, Mr. Goldman gave \none of the most moving tributes which I have ever heard, and with his \npermission, I am today submitting it for the Congressional Record, not \nonly to share with my Senate colleagues but indeed all of those who \nhave loved ones or are themselves battling the scourge of breast \ncancer.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n       Sherry didn't want to be a ``Face of Breast Cancer.'' When \n     I met her, she was nineteen, I was twenty-one and we were \n     students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, she only \n     wanted to be Sherry--happy, independent thinking, caring, \n     life loving Sherry. She loved to just hang out with our \n     friends, share a bottle wine, talk and laugh the night away.\n       School was important to her. Her interest and ability to \n     master Romantic languages, and her interest in social justice \n     led to her major in Iberio-American Studies. She also liked \n     to get A's and would definitely stand up to a professor who \n     had evaluated her work unfairly.\n       For her artistic outlet, Sherry was a photographer. She \n     spent hours taking and developing photos that showed her \n     perspective of herself and life. Each finished photograph had \n     to have the perfect gradations of blacks and whites before it \n     was matted as a finished work of art. These are a few of \n     them. The hand-colored photo won first prize in the \n     University of Wisconsin student art show.\n       Later in her life, Sherry saw a need and had a desire to \n     enter what was at that time very male-dominated world of \n     health administration. She decided to concentrate in the \n     field of Risk Management, setting up policies that kept the \n     costs of health care down so that no one in our society would \n     ever be denied the health care that they needed. At the \n     Medical College of Virginia, she defined the structure and \n     policies of the Risk Management Department. Her warm, caring \n     personality and sharp, quick intelligence made her the \n     perfect person to balance complex issues between patients, \n     doctors and more than once, lawyers. She understood, she \n     cared and she was always fair.\n       Bright, artistic, professional, Sherry was also, of course, \n     Sammy's mommy and my wife. We bought what was supposed to be \n     our first house over in Lakeside, thinking we would keep it \n     for five years and move to another school district when Sammy \n     was ready for first grade. Sam was suppose to be the first of \n     three children. Sherry had the good job while I wrote, and \n     took care of Sam but we had plans for Sherry to take some \n     time off to spend with the children at some future date. \n     Sherry had plans for a lifetime and when breast cancer \n     started shattering her plans, she simply made more plans.\n       Sherry was never a victim of breast cancer. She was always \n     a fighter and an advocate. She fought so that the fight \n     against breast cancer would get the funding and attention \n     that it deserved. She fought against policies that harmed \n     women, against policies and attitudes that didn't go far \n     enough in this war. When Sherry realized that the cancer was \n     stealing her life, she didn't stop fighting. She fought for \n     Sam, for me, for every person and family that was and will be \n     forever battered by this horrible disease. She gave me the \n     support I needed to finish my Masters and become a teacher. \n     With her concern that she create strong memories for Sammy \n     and that he would always know how much she loved him, Sherry \n     contacted her friend, Hillary Clinton, and arranged a White \n     House visit where Sammy met the President and Mrs. Clinton, \n     and made sure that Sammy and I continued to be part of the \n     ``Faces of Hope'' family. Sherry didn't even let the cancer \n     stop her from taking a trip to Disney World and what she \n     called ``that smutzy Disney World'' King's Dominion where \n     Sammy remembers getting stuck in smurf mountain with his \n     Mommy. Sherry made sure that the White House had the name and \n     phone number of her close friend Mary Jo Kahn who she knew \n     was an valuable resource in forming breast cancer policy. She \n     cared and worried about all of us, not herself.\n       Sherry never wanted to be ``A Face of Breast Cancer'' and \n     she wouldn't have wanted to have an award named after her, \n     she wanted to live, but she would have been honored and proud \n     of both. As a part of the ``Faces of Breast Cancer'' Sherry \n     will continue being the advocate for breast health. And with \n     this wonderful ``Sherry Kohlenberg Healthcare Service Award'' \n     given by the Virginia Breast Cancer Foundation, Sherry will \n     always be honoring those who continue the fight, and she \n     would have been especially pleased when close friends like \n     Kathy Spiegle, and those she would have wanted to know like \n     Dr. Claire Carman, are honored. With these honors, Sherry is \n     with us, her voice is heard, her strength supports us, her \n     love is felt, as it always will be until this war against \n     breast cancer is won. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12038-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12039-S12040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TWIN CITIES-UPPER MIDWEST HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN AWARDS\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I recently had the honor of \nattending the annual Twin Cities-Upper Midwest Human Rights Campaign \nAwards Dinner honoring Ruth and David Waterbury of Minneapolis, and the \nNorthern States Power Co. The work of the Human Rights Campaign, which \nis dedicated to combatting discrimination, ensuring equal protection \nfor all under our laws, and advancing the interests of gay and lesbian \npersons in the United States, is one of the most effective \norganizations of its kind.\n  The Brian Coyle Leadership Awards, presented to the Waterburys and \nNorthern States Power, are dedicated to the memory of Minneapolis City \nCouncil Member Brian Coyle, a community activist and inspiration to \nmany, including to me. He was a friend of mine, and his work to end \ndiscrimination is a lasting legacy to the gay and lesbian community in \nmy State, and across the Nation. As a long-time social and political \nactivist myself, I was humbled that night to be in the presence of so \nmany individuals who stand on principle, often in the face of terrific \nodds and in the face of anger, misunderstanding, bias and even, in some \nextreme cases, violence against themselves or their loved ones.\n  Ruth and David Waterbury are two such people. They have contributed \nmuch to our community, both as a couple and as individuals. As I have \ncome to know this wonderful family over the years, I continue to be \namazed at their tireless and selfless work on behalf of others. Both \nwere board members of the Minneapolis-St. Paul chapter of Parents and \nFriends of Lesbians and Gays, and Ruth was president for the year just \nended. David was chair of the Governor's Task Force on Gay and Lesbian \nMinnesotans. Ruth is a current board member of District 202. Each has \nbeen instrumental in establishing scholarship funds for gay and lesbian \nstudents at their respective alma maters, Yale and Carleton.\n\n  The Waterburys have also been involved in the good work of the \nNational Gay and Lesbian Task Force, It's Time Minnesota, Plymouth \nCongregational Church, Interfaith Coming Out Celebration, Minnesota \nGLBT Education Fund, and the Human Rights Campaign. Additionally, in \npart due to their great efforts, my State of Minnesota enacted an \ninclusive civil rights law that is a model for other States to follow. \nTogether they have been visible and effective advocates on behalf of \nthe gay and lesbian community in our State.\n  If I might, let me include an excerpt from Ruth and David's biography \nthat speaks to their commitment not only to the campaign for human \nrights, but to each other as well. ``Ruth and David Waterbury have been \nadvancing the civil rights of gays and lesbians since shortly after \ntheir daughter came out to them. Margery gave them literature to read \nand expressed hope that they would eventually be glad she was a \nlesbian. Ten years later, they have now fulfilled her hope and feel \nprivileged to have taken the journey.''\n  For many parents, it is sometimes difficult to accept differences in \ntheir children that they did not foresee or wish for. For many others, \nit is not easy to accept people who are different from themselves--\nwhether it be because of their gender, race, religion or sexual \norientation. But the Waterburys chose a path of acknowledging their \ndaughter's orientation, embracing it, and working to help other parents \nconfronted by the same issues. Because of people like them, there is \nmuch hope, and even reason for joy. Because of the actions of those \nlike the Waterburys,\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\nwilling to fight to ensure that the most basic guarantee of our \nConstitution--equal protection under the law--is secure, there are role \nmodels for others to follow, from which others might take the torch and \nlead. I wanted to publicly salute them today here in the Senate, and \nthank them for their tireless efforts on behalf of their daughter, and \non behalf of gay and lesbian people in my State and throughout the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12039-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO LORI MOONEY, RETIRING CLERK OF ATLANTIC COUNTY, NEW JERSEY\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \npublic career of a very special woman. The Honorable Lori Mooney will \nthis month retire from public service having completed 19 years of \nfaithful and distinguished service as the first publicly elected clerk \nof Atlantic County.\n  Having been elected in 1977 as the first woman to serve in the \nposition of county clerk, Lori Mooney made one promise at that time to \nthe people of the county--to bring the operations of the office of the \nclerk into the 20th Century. To that end, she can take great pride in \nher achievements. She has managed, with the help of a highly \nprofessional, service-oriented staff, to raise the professional \nstandards of the office from hand-written entries to the complete \ncomputerization of all records. She has consistently worked to meet the \ngrowing and changing needs of her county by recognizing the importance \nof easy, accessible service to the general public. From being the first \nto provide a satellite office in Atlantic City to her forward-looking \nefforts today in establishing a World Wide Web site and a ``County \nConnection'' at the Hamilton Mall, Lori has instinctively understood \nthe dynamic of citizen contact and public outreach. She has truly \nincorporated and made real her own motto, ``Always At Your Service.''\n  Mr. President, as important as her work as county clerk has been, so \ntoo has Lori distinguished herself as a professional businesswoman \nhaving been the first woman appointed to the National Small Business \nCouncil for New Jersey by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966. And \nfinally, her love and her energy on behalf of Democratic candidates \nboth local and national make her one of the very few Democrats in the \nState to have been a delegate to the party's national convention six \ntimes.\n  Mr. President, I offer my warmest and most sincere congratulations to \none of New Jersey's most beloved public servants whose public career \nshould stand as an inspiration to all who respect honesty, unquestioned \nintegrity and sound judgement in public office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12040-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE JAPAN-AMERICA STUDENT CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I would like to salute the \nefforts of a distinguished student organization that has been at the \nforefront of enhanced United States-Japanese cultural dialogue and \nunderstanding since 1934. I refer to the Japan-America Student \nConference [JASC], which was founded 63 years ago by a group of \nconscientious Japanese and American students concerned about the \ncultural misunderstanding plaguing their countries' relations. The JASC \ncontinues to play a significant role in facilitating exchanges between \nAmerican and Japanese university students.\n  Over the years, the annual JASC student exchanges have produced a \nremarkable collection of American and Japanese leaders in business, \ngovernment, journalism, and academia, leaders whose familiarity with \ntheir counterparts' culture has been instrumental to their professional \nsuccess. This year, as we celebrate the 63rd anniversary of student \nexchanges under the auspices of the Japan-America Student Conference, I \ncommend its leadership and all its participants for their dedication to \nthe cause of cultural enlightenment and enrichment in United States-\nJapanese relations.\n  As a completely student-designed and student-implemented program, \nJASC organizes an annual conference to promote its mission of \n``Pursuing World Peace through Education, Cooperation, and Personal \nCommitment.'' Conference locations alternate between Japan and America \nand typically involve 30 to 40 university students from each country \nwho come together for a full month to live, travel, work, debate, \nstudy, and socialize in the host country. Intensive round-table \ndiscussions on topics of fundamental importance to Japanese-American \nrelations complement field studies in which delegates meet with \ngovernment officials, educators, business executives, journalists, and \nother prominent citizens of the host country. Homestays with local \nfamilies allow visiting students insight into the customs of the host \ncountry, while Japanese-American sharing of rooms in dormitories \nensures intimate cross-cultural links.\n  Following its tradition of consistently hosting outstanding Japanese \nand American students, this year's conference will focus on ``Exploring \nOur Roles in the Emerging Asia-Pacific Community.'' Students will \nexplore issues in culture, trade, philosophy, science, diplomacy, \nhistory, and politics in an attempt to understand the fundamental \nchanges forming Japanese-American relations on the verge of the 21st \ncentury. Because 1996's Conference took place in the United States, the \nJapanese cities of Tokyo and Kyoto will host next year's JASC from July \n20 to August 19.\n  In accordance with JASC's standard practice, this year's participants \nwere chosen by the organization's American and Japanese student \nexecutive committees consisting of students from each country elected \nby their peers. Although the respective Japanese and American Executive \nCommittees receive guidance and financial assistance from the Boards of \nDirectors of JASC in Washington and the International Education Center \nin Tokyo, students in the two committees independently plan and manage \nthe conferences.\n  Mr. President, JASC represents an effective and efficient means to \naddress the intellectual deficit in Japan-United States relations. \nAlthough roughly 43,000 Japanese students are currently enrolled in \nAmerican universities, less than 2,000 Americans are studying at \ninstitutions of higher learning in Japan. This gap must be reduced \nbecause we have as much to learn from the Japanese as they do from us. \nTherefore, I want to commend the Japan-America Student Conference for \nlong dedication to improving ties between Japan and the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12040-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12040-S12041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF LINDA COLLINS HERTZ\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to recognize \nthe retirement of Linda Collins Hertz, a Federal prosecutor from \nFlorida and a native of Georgia.\n  A graduate of Shorter College in Rome, GA, Ms. Hertz received her law \ndegree from the University of Miami cum laude in 1973. After 6 years as \nan assistant attorney general for the State of Florida, she joined the \nU.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of Florida. In her 15-\nyear tenure as the chief of the appellate division in that U.S. \nAttorney's Office, Ms. Hertz has overseen the filing of in excess of \n3,000 briefs in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. I have been told \nby her former colleagues that the judges of that court frequently \ncomment that the briefs filed under Ms. Hertz' supervision can be \ncounted upon to reflect the highest standards of appellate advocacy, \nand bear the mark of her commitment to candor, forthrightness and \nvigorous, but always fair, argument. Ms. Hertz' efforts to ensure that \nthe positions of the United States are argued in a manner consistent \nwith the highest ethical standards serve as a testament to her own high \nstandards. Her coworkers further advise me that Ms. Hertz has \nconsistently provided support to other assistant U.S. attorneys in \nsouth Florida and elsewhere, and her counsel is regularly sought on \nmatters of great import and complexity. Ms. Hertz has been recognized \nby her colleagues and the Department of Justice for her extraordinary \nwork through numerous awards like the Justice Department's John \nMarshall Award for the Handling of Appeals, and the U.S. Attorney's \nVince Antle Award.\n  In sum, Mr. President, based on the record and based on the testimony \nof those who know her best I believe Linda Collins Hertz of Rome, GA, \nand\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\nMiami, FL, deserves our gratitude for her dedication and service on \nbehalf of the citizens of Florida and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12040-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12041-S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, in the waning days of any Congress, the \nfull range of emotions are not far from the surface in each one of us. \nWe feel the thrill of success as we see our legislative initiatives \nbecome law and the disappointment of knowing that some of our \npriorities must await a new year. As I leave the Senate after thirty \nyears of service, I leave next year's challenges to others.\n  Among the bills that did not become law this year is S.1897, a bill \nto revitalize the National Institutes of Health. This bill is the fine \nwork of my friend and colleague Senator Nancy Kassebaum. Once the \nSenate passed the bill last Thursday, Senator Kassebaum worked \ntirelessly to try to achieve an agreement with the House to pass the \nbill. Unfortunately, an accommodation could not be reached and as a \nresult, many fine legislative provisions that would dramatically \nimprove the work of the NIH, fall to the wayside this year. This is all \nthe more frustrating given the fact that the House hasn't held one \nhearing on NIH this year and essentially stopped the bill because they \nhadn't had a chance to give input.\n  Mr. President, I have a passion for medical research. It provides the \nsole hope for an improved quality of life for so many who suffer. \nCongress has recognized the importance of biomedical research by \nproviding a 6.5-percent increase for the National Institutes of Health \nthis year. We provided a 5.7-percent increase last year--all told an \nincrease of 12.2 percent over a 2 year period. I can think of few \ndomestic discretionary programs which have received this kind of \nattention in this Congress and none with greater merit. In terms of \nreturn on our Federal investment, there is no program which brings \ngreater return in terms of improving quality of life in this country.\n  I have four pieces of my own legislation attached to S. 1897, all of \nwhich I believe will be enacted over time. While not accomplished on my \nwatch, I am hopeful that others in the Senate will take on these \ninitiatives and insure their passage. Senate bill 184 codifies the \nOffice for Rare Disease Research at the NIH. This office has been \ncreated in the appropriations process to coordinate the research on \nover 5,000 rare diseases--diseases that affect only a small portion of \nthe population and frequently have no research project or registry. I \nhave been attempting for 2 years to have the office codified in law and \nwhile the Senate has passed this bill twice, it has not become law.\n  The NIH bill also includes S.684, the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's \nResearch Assistance and Education Act of 1995. Mr. President, this bill \nhas over 62 cosponsors in the Senate and over 100 in the House. It \nestablishes Parkinson's Disease research centers across this country \nand signals the NIH that Congress is not satisfied with the $30 \nmillion. that NIH currently spends on this disease--my bill calls for \nan $80 million investment to cure this disease. I would like to \ncompliment that Parkinson's community, and particularly Joan Samuelson \nof the Parkinson's Action Network, for the work they did to propel this \nbill forward. The Parkinson's community has my deepest respect for \ntheir advocacy.\n\n  The bill also includes S. 1251, a bill that Senator Harkin and I have \nlong championed to establish a National Fund for Health Research. The \nversion included in Senator Kassebaum's bill established the shell of \nthe fund, and left the financing mechanism to a future Congress. My \npreference is a tobacco tax and a Federal income tax kickoff, but a \nrange of options exist. The important point is that a trust fund \nrecognizes the fact that the appropriations process will never yield \nadequate resources to fund the promise of scientific research which \nexists today. We need to do more and the American public, in opinion \npoll after opinion poll, has indicated they support us doing so.\n  Finally, the NIH bill includes a new initiative of mine, the Clinical \nResearch Enhancement Act, S. 1534. This bill will increase funding for \nclinical research, improve training for persons planning clinical \nresearch careers, and modify the focus of the NIH to make it more \nreceptive to clinical research proposals.\n  There is no question that NIH needs more resources to fund all \nresearch. However, as we seek to find these funds, we must also look \nwithin NIH to ensure that the environment is supportive for clinical \nresearch applications. A recent report from the Institute of Medicine \npresents some alarming trends: the number of young investigators \napplying for grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993, the \nnumber of federally funded grants awarded to persons under the age of \n36 has decreased 70 percent in this period, and at the same time, young \ninvestigators are racking up average debt loads of $63,000. If not \nrectified, these trends will result in a stunning lack of human \ninfrastructure to deliver a knowledge base that has applicability to or \nutility for the benefit of patients. It is not an understatement to \nassert that clinical research is in a state of crisis. Such a crisis \nmay lead to a serious deficiency of clinical expertise, a paucity of \neffective clinical interventions, an increase in human suffering, and \nultimately, an increase in the cost of medical care.\n  All of these initiatives deserve our support. I am pleased that the \nSenate has endorsed them and I hope that the new Congress will begin \nwhere we ended this year and include these provisions as a starting \npoint on the new version of the NIH revitalization bill.\n  Before I conclude Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record \na report by Washington Fax of a hearing that I chaired with Senator \nCohen on September 26, 1996. This was a significant hearing and I hope \nmy colleagues will take the opportunity to review its content.\n  The report follows:\n\n     Extraordinary Hearing Grips Senators, Witnesses, and Observers\n\n       No one noticed when, but at some point ego and arrogance \n     got up and left the Senate hearing room.\n       It may have been when the witnesses began to talk:\n       Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf, relating a sad commentary on the \n     American male acting like an ostrich when it comes to \n     prostrate cancer and other maladies;\n       Joan Samuelson, a 46-year-old lawyer diagnosed with \n     Parkinson's disease nine years ago, relating how almost \n     immediately things dear to her--playing the piano, running, \n     backpacking--were taken from her, and then essential \n     functions began to be stripped away;\n       Rod Carew, a Baseball Hall of Famer introducing us to his \n     daughter, Michelle, via video tape--recalling her smile in \n     the final days of her 18-year life.\n       And then there was Travis Roy of Yarmouth, ME, a 21-year-\n     old quadriplegic who recalled his life's dream lasting 20 \n     seconds on the hockey ice, and now he must wants to hug his \n     mother and his girlfriend.\n       Then, at first haltingly, almost embarrassingly, the room \n     began to fill with emotion--honest straight-from-the-heart \n     emotion, rising from the experience of one human being \n     listening to another and hearing.\n       The scene was a special joint hearing Thursday by the \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations and Aging called to \n     gather testimony on the benefits of biomedical research and \n     the human cost of injury and disease.\n       As the first panel of witnesses spoke, the hubbub and noise \n     of self-importance and pressing tasks, always a part of a \n     congressional hearing, slowly stopped. The audience breathed \n     ever so lightly; the door from the room stood unused.\n       Distances began to disappear. None remained between the \n     dias, where Sens. Connie Mack, R-FL; Robert Bennett, R--UT; \n     Conrad Burns, R-MT; William Cohen, R-ME; Mark Hatfield, R-OR; \n     David Pryor, D-AR; John Glenn, D-OH; and Herb Kohl, D-WI, \n     were seated, and the witness table.\n       The trappings of a hearing were dropped. It was like \n     sitting around a supper table, where friends who know each \n     other warts and all open themselves, trusting their \n     companions to share thoughts, to understand, to help, to \n     reach out and touch where it hurts.\n       Carew, Samuelson and Roy with great dignity opened their \n     souls, because they want to help stop the pain--not only \n     theirs--but the pain of others too. Hatfield and Cohen, the \n     good hosts, allowed the mood to reign.\n       At one point, Mack, at Hatfield's gentle nudge, began to \n     speak, but knowing he couldn't trust his voice, sat quietly \n     waiting. There was no embarrassment for him, only great \n     feelings of empathy. The wave of emotion passed, and he \n     talked of the death from cancer of the brother he loved so \n     much. There was a path of empathy from Mack to Carew.\n       Pryor spoke up. ``Talking about one's personal hurts is \n     hard,'' he said frankly. But he went on to relate how his \n     son, a lawyer, thought he had injured an Achilles tendon \n     playing racket ball. When the surgeon got inside my son's \n     leg, they discovered a rare\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\n     form of malignant tumor on the tendon, said Pryor. If it had \n     been only a few years earlier, my son would have lost his \n     whole leg, and a short time before that, he would have been \n     doomed, he said.\n       When Hatfield called upon Bennett, the Utah Senator didn't \n     respond. He obviously wanted to speak, but his grief was so \n     cutting that it took a bit to pass. He directed his remarks \n     to a young researcher who was on one of the witness panels. \n     She had described in her testimony watching the president of \n     Brigham Young University, Rex Lee, loose his battle with \n     cancer. Bennett revealed that Lee was his best friend.\n       There was a lull in the conversation, and someone recalled \n     the discussion earlier, when Samuelson described how her day \n     goes. ``From the moment I am awake, I wonder, `how will my \n     body react today?' '' she said. ``Initially it is always \n     stiff and sluggish and unpredictable until it adjusts to \n     medication. For the first hour or two, I cope with a sudden \n     sharp tremor in one or both hands, or one leg suddenly \n     freezing up or contorting in a way that prevents walking. \n     Crawling around the house is sometimes the only way to keep \n     getting ready as I wait for the drugs to begin to work.''\n       Then Mack, with an edge to his voice, questioned aloud, \n     ``When are we going to do something about this? To provide \n     what is needed?''\n       Hatfield warned that funding for biomedical research is not \n     going to continue to increase and may not even hold stable, \n     because in 1999, 2000 and through 2002 there isn't the money \n     to carry out deficit reductions. ``We are trying to balance \n     the budget by taking money from only 18% of the budget,'' he \n     emphasized. ``And that isn't enough to do the job.''\n       This was the last hearing that will be chaired jointly by \n     Cohen and Hatfield. It was probably the most honest hearing \n     on the Hill in a lot of years. Senators came face to face \n     with why research is important. The witnesses now know these \n     Senators as kindred souls who hurt as they do, a new reason \n     to fight on through the pain and the grief.\n       Egos and arrogance left the room and honesty, caring and \n     empathy remained. No heros, just folks trying to figure out \n     how to help each other.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12041-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DELAWARE COMPANY HONORED AS FAMILY-FRIENDLY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in this time of two worker \nhouseholds, working parents are increasingly faced with the difficult \ntask of balancing work and family.\n  Every day in this country, families must find a way to meet the \nchallenges that await them at home after a long day on the job. Some \ndays it seems impossible to maintain a career while trying to figure \nout a way to get the shopping done, put dinner on the table and pick up \nthe kids at soccer practice.\n  That is why today, Mr. President, I am proud to stand here to \nannounce that Delaware companies are taking the lead and making it \neasier for working parents to balance their careers and families.\n  One particular company, MBNA America, which is based in Wilmington, \nDE, was recently honored as one of the top 10 family-friendly companies \nby Working Mother magazine.\n  This is the second straight year that MBNA has been named as one of \nthe top ten companies for working mothers and the fifth straight year \nthat it has been named in the top 100.\n  Also, in the September 16 issue of Business Week, MBNA was named as \none of the top 10 businesses in terms of their work and family \nstrategies. This is the first time that Business Week has rated \ncompanies for their family friendly practices, and it shows that \nbusinesses are most successful if they take their work and family \nstrategies seriously.\n  Speaking about MBNA, Business Week stated that ``the bank won the \nhighest grades from employees, who cited strong programs and job \nflexibility.''\n  MBNA is to be commended for instituting policies and programs that \nare sensitive to the realities of two income families.\n  For example, MBNA offers three on-site day care centers that serve \nMBNA employees. I have had the opportunity to visit one of the two \ncenters that are in Delaware, and I cannot stress enough what a benefit \nit is for workers to be able to take advantage of these day care \ncenters. In Delaware, these centers give the parents of around 400 \nchildren the peace of mind that their child is in good hands.\n  Also last year, 109 men and 264 women took advantage of childbirth \nleave of absences that averaged 13 weeks. This is a wonderful \nopportunity for parents to be there for those precious first weeks of \ntheir child's life.\n  Another important benefit that is offered by the company is adoption \nassistance of up to $5,000. This allows employees to provide a stable \nhome and family to a child who needs that love and stability so badly. \nJust another way that companies can help build strong families.\n  Employees can take advantage of $849,000 in company-sponsored college \nscholarships that allow those who wish to better themselves the \nopportunity to do so. After all, education is the greatest investment \nthis country can make.\n  Working Mother magazine also applauded MBNA for having flexible work \nhours by utilizing job-sharing strategies and compressed work weeks.\n  And, the study showed that women account for a high percentage of \nexecutive positions at MBNA. Women make up 39 percent of vice \npresidents at MBNA and 16 percent of all senior executives are women.\n  Besides MBNA, two other Delaware companies were honored recently as \nfamily friendly companies. DuPont and DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical were \nnamed as two of the top one hundred companies by Working Mother \nmagazine for their leadership in creating job strategies that are \nsensitive toward families. DuPont was also named in Business Week's \ntop10n list, and other companies with facilities in Delaware, such as \nHewlett-Packard and Nations Bank, have been praised for their family \noriented policies.\n  Mr. President, these work strategies that take into account everyday \nfamily life do not just benefit the employees, but also the employer. \nThere is little doubt that recruitment, retention, morale, and \ntherefore productivity all increase when companies implement family-\nfriendly policies.\n  I am proud that MBNA and other Delaware companies have emerged as \nleaders in creating family work strategies, and I hope that this trend \ncontinues throughout Delaware and throughout the country. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12042-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12042-S12043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERNET CENSORSHIP AND CHINA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, almost 1 year to the day after \nthe Senate approved the Communications Decency Act [CDA], the Federal \nDistrict Court in Philadelphia concluded that congressional approval of \nthe CDA was ``unquestionably a decision that placed the CDA in serious \nconflict with our most cherished protection--the right to choose the \nmaterial to which we would have access.''\n  Mr. President, this fall the Supreme Court will consider an appeal of \nthat Federal District Court decision, issued in June 1996, which found \nthe CDA to be unconstitutionally vague and a violation of free speech. \nThe action by the Supreme Court will, without doubt, be one which \ndetermines whether the Congress will continue to encroach upon one of \nour most fundamental rights.\n  The Communications Decency Act was badly flawed in a number of ways--\nand I have spoken of those flaws often and in great detail on the floor \nof this Senate--but its most serious flaw was that it criminalized \nspeech transmitted via the Internet which the Supreme Court has ruled \nis protected by the first amendment--so-called indecent speech. While \nits proponents claimed to be most concerned about sexually explicit and \nobscene materials on the Net--the transmission of which is already a \nviolation of criminal law--the CDA swept more broadly, effectively \nprohibiting speech which is perfectly legal if it appears in a \nnewspaper, magazine, or book.\n  Mr. President, when I and other Senators pointed out the great danger \nof the act's overly broad prohibitions of on-line speech, we were told \nthat we were overreacting. We were told that this minor erosion on \nspeech rights will not lead to greater restrictions on the rights of \nAmericans.\n  But, Mr. President, what danger could be greater than a Congress \nwilling to subjugate speech rights to the political needs of the day? \nWhile indecency may have been the target of Congressional disapproval \nin 1995, when the Communications Decency Act was first considered, the \ntarget of our current political climate appeared to be violence in \nmedia. The Senate Commerce Committee has considered and reported \nlegislation that puts the Federal Government in the business of \ndetermining\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\nwhat violent television programming is acceptable and what is not. In \nthe name of protecting children, this Congress has edged closer and \ncloser to Federal content regulation of speech in mass media. It is an \nunfortunate but true fact, that the propensity is high for Congress to \njeopardize speech rights for the sake of political expediency.\n  That the United States Congress has taken the same path of countries \nwhich do not hold free speech as one of their most cherished rights--\nsuch as China and Singapore--should be of great concern to the American \npeople.\n  For example, earlier this year, China passed a law allowing use of \nthe Internet, but prohibited so-called harmful information on the \nInternet. According to media reports, as of September 10, Chinese \nofficials had blocked access of China's 120,000 Internet users to more \nthan 100 different sites on the World Wide Web. China considers \n``harmful information'' to include sexual material, political material, \nand other types of news information that might somehow be harmful to \nChina's people. China has blocked access to Web sites operated by \nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well as to foreign \nmedia sites such as the Washington Post, Cable News Network, and the \nWall Street Journal.\n\n  China also requires Internet providers to use government phone lines \nwhich allow information to be routed to government choke points where \naccess can be blocked. And Internet users are required to register with \nthe government. Media reports indicate, however, that the censors are \nalready missing some sites such as the Swedish-Tibet Network and that \nmany computer users have found ways to circumvent the ban.\n  Why are China's actions so significant? The Chinese Government has \nshown us three things. First, they have shown how fear of a new form of \nelectronic communications leads to excessive regulation and censorship. \nWhile censorship is acceptable in China, it is repugnant and \nunacceptable to most citizens of the United States.\n  Second, they have shown us that once certain types of speech are \nprohibited by a government, the ban must be enforced. The regulations \nimposed by China to enforce their ban--the required use of government \nphone lines and the registration of users with the Government--has led \nto even greater erosion of civil liberties of the Chinese people. And \nthird, they have shown us that speech and access prohibitions are \nineffective when broadly applied to this new form of electronic \ncommunication. China's ban on certain types of speech is being \ncircumvented. Their misguided efforts to protect the public from \nforeign sources of information and other sites are not likely to be \neffective.\n  Surely, the actions of the 104th Congress in approving the CDA are \nsubstantially different from the Chinese Government's actions. \nNevertheless, Mr. President, there are some striking similarities.\n  China reacted to the freedom of the Internet by applying the same \ntype of controls they have used for centuries to control information--a \nban on speech and prohibition on access. Similarly, Congress reacted to \nthe presence of objectionable and offensive materials on the Internet \nby imposing the same types of speech restrictions that have been used \nin broadcasting. Both governments reacted in fear to a new and poorly \nunderstood technology by imposing overly restrictive controls that do \nnot take into account the unique nature of the Internet. The difference \nis that China has a centuries-old tradition of restricting speech while \nAmericans hold their first amendment rights among their most cherished \nfreedoms. Governments with such vastly different values should not be \nfollowing the same path on speech restrictions.\n  Senator Leahy and I urged this body to take the time to study how we \nmight more effectively protect children on the Internet without \njeopardizing free speech rights. There are less restrictive and more \neffective means of protecting children on the Internet than the \nunconstitutional Communications Decency Act. Instead, like China, \ncongressional fear of the unknown led this body down the perilous path \nof censorship.\n  Some in this body might find China's methods of enforcing the ban \ncompletely inapplicable to the Communications Decency Act. Surely, the \nUnited States would never require adults to register to use the \nInternet. However, the Department of Justice hasn't yet determined \nquite how the CDA would be effectively enforced. They have suggested \ncredit card verification, which may not yet be viable. They have also \nsuggested adult identification cards and tagging systems. Some involved \nin the debate of the CDA last year suggested that users be required to \nget an information superhighway drivers' license. That sounds \nremarkably like the registration requirements employed by the Chinese.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that the only way to effectively enforce \nthe CDA is to dramatically restrict the constitutional rights of adult \nAmericans. And that is simply unacceptable.\n  Congressional passage of the Communications Decency Act was a \nmisguided attempt to reach an honorable goal--protecting children from \nthose who seek to harm them on the Internet. While we should continue \nour efforts to protect children, we must seek more effective and \nconstitutional means to achieve that goal.\n  The 104th Congress failed to honor its obligation to uphold the \nConstitution when it passed the Communications Decency Act.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nmany accomplishments of an exceptional institution of higher education \nin my own State of Maryland.\n  This year Montgomery College celebrates its 50th anniversary of \nproviding quality higher and continuing education to the men and women \nof Montgomery County and the entire State of Maryland.\n  Since it began educating the men and women of Maryland 50 years ago, \nMontgomery College has experienced remarkable growth. From its modest \nbeginnings with 186 students in borrowed classrooms at a local high \nschool, Montgomery College's enrollment has increased to over 22,000 \nstudents who study at three campuses across the county in Germantown, \nRockville, and Takoma Park. Over the years, half a million students \nhave benefited from a Montgomery College education, preparing \nthemselves for enrollment in a 4 year college and for direct entry into \nan increasingly high-technology workplace.\n  The rapid pace of technological development and the increasing \ncomplexity of our economy has created a new set of challenges for our \nNation's institutions of higher education. Montgomery College has \nproven to be a national leader in responding to these challenges, \ndeveloping a new state-of-the-art high technology and science center to \nbe dedicated on October 10, 1996. This innovative project--a joint \neffort of State and local government--encompasses advanced technologies \nto further the educational opportunities for Maryland students and \nimprove the economic competitiveness of our State.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that offering students the opportunity \nfor a true education and helping them to develop their potential for \nsuccess in our sophisticated and complex society are among the most \nimportant challenges facing our Nation. Montgomery College has risen to \nmeet these challenges and is to be commended for its ambitious views of \nthe future as well as its open-door admission policy, which makes that \nfuture accessible to all the citizens of Montgomery County and of \nMaryland.\n  Fifty years ago, Montgomery College was viewed as a ``great \nexperiment in higher education.'' It is clear from the accomplishments \nof the past half century that this experiment has been eminently \nsuccessful in providing lifelong learning and enhanced opportunities \nfor thousands of Marylanders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12043-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, from previous information, that \nwould be this side. I am told by the distinguished Democratic leader \nthere will be no Democratic lunch tomorrow. But we will stand in recess \nuntil 2:15 in order for the Republican Party caucus to meet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the Inter-\nAmerican Convention on Serving Criminal Sentences Abroad, (Treaty \nDocument No. 104-35), transmitted to the Senate by the President on \nSeptember 30, 1996; and ask that the treaty be considered as having \nbeen read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying \npapers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be \nprinted; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  It is my understanding this has been cleared with the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Inter-American Convention on \nServing Criminal Sentences Abroad, drawn up by the Committee on \nJuridical and Political Affairs within the Permanent Council of the \nOrganization of American States (OAS) and composed of representatives \nof the Member States. The Convention was adopted and opened for \nsignature at the twenty-third regular session of the General Assembly \nmeeting in Managua, Nicaragua, on June 9, 1993, and signed on behalf of \nthe United States at the OAS Headquarters in Washington on January 10, \n1995. The provisions of the Convention are explained in the report of \nthe Department of State that accompanies this message.\n  Although the United States is already a party to the multilateral \nCouncil of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, \nwhich entered into force for the United States, following Senate advice \nand consent to ratification, on July 1, 1985, only two other OAS Member \nStates have become parties to that Convention. Ratification of the \nInter-American Convention on Serving Criminal Sentences Abroad would \nhelp fill a void by providing a mechanism for the reciprocal transfer \nof persons incarcerated in prisons in OAS Member States, to permit \nthose individuals to serve their sentences in their home countries. A \nmultilateral prisoner transfer convention for the Americas would also \nreduce, if not eliminate, the need for the United States to negotiate \nadditional bilateral prisoner transfer treaties with countries in the \nhemisphere.\n  I recommend that the Senate promptly give its advice and consent to \nthe ratification of this Convention, subject to an understanding and a \nreservation that are described in the accompanying State Department \nreport.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 30, 1996.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the morning hour will be deemed expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12044-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2161\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand that S. 2161, introduced \ntoday by Senator Simon, is at the desk. I ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2161) reauthorizing programs of the Federal \n     Aviation Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I now ask for the second reading, and I object to my own \nrequest on behalf of Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know the hour is late. I certainly \nrespect Senator Simon's views on this issue, and I know that Senator \nSimon feels very strongly. I also know that Senator Simon is committed \nto the entirety of the bill. However, on both sides of the aisle, there \nare objections to S. 2161 introduced by Senator Simon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/30/senate-section/article/S12044-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
