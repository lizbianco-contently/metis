Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now move to consideration of the conference report, House \nReport 104-612, accompanying House Concurrent Resolution 178, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment to the bill (H. Con. Res. 178), a \n     concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget \n     for the United States Government for fiscal year 1997 and \n     setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years \n     1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, having met, after full and \n     free conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 7, 1996.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided between the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Exon.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. Exon, who controls the time \non this side, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It will not be \n30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am convinced that if this budget \nresolution conference agreement is fully implemented over the next 6 \nyears, it will lead the Nation into far more serious fiscal difficulty \nthan we are in today. It follows the familiar supply-side policies of \nthe Reagan administration, which, as we all recall, promised to balance \nthe Federal budget while at the same time enacting massive tax cuts, it \ncalls for increases in defense spending even when the Pentagon says it \ndoes not need the money, and cuts in entitlements--which never came to \npass under the Reagan administration. President Reagan's policies did \nnot result in the economy growing itself out of deficits or in \nbalancing the budget. I voted with the President, Mr. Reagan, in \nsupport of his massive tax cuts and I also supported his buildup of a \nbloated defense budget. Instead, what did we see? We saw a massive \nincrease in the national debt, which rose from under $1 trillion in the \nprevious 200 years of the Nation to over $2.6 trillion on January\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n20, 1989, the day President Reagan left office.\n  Astoundingly to me, the fiscal blueprint contained in this budget \nresolution conference agreement is remarkably similar to those failed \nReagan policies which nearly bankrupted the Nation, and from which we \nare still suffering, and which are still placing us in desperate \nstraits with respect to our fiscal situation. For example, unlike the \nSenate-passed budget resolution, which allowed a tax cut to occur in a \nthird reconciliation measure only after enactment into law of the first \ntwo reconciliation measures which contained deficit reduction, this \nconference agreement moves the tax cuts forward to the first \nreconciliation bill. The instructions for that first reconciliation \nbill call for the relevant Senate committees to report their proposals \nby June 21. Those instructions go to those committees with jurisdiction \nover welfare, Medicaid, and tax breaks.\n  So what we see then is that this first reconciliation bill will \npresumably cut Medicaid spending, cut welfare spending, and use those \nsavings to finance a massive tax cut. That first reconciliation bill, I \nam advised, will reduce the deficit by a mere $2 billion over the \nentire 6 years, because the savings from welfare reform and Medicaid \nwill be used to finance a huge tax cut.\n  I think it is utter folly to be talking about a tax cut at this time \nin our fiscal history. I say that with respect not only to the \nRepublican tax cut, but also to the tax cut that is proposed by the \nClinton administration. I was the one Democrat who voted against the \nPresident's budget, so I think I come into court here with fairly clean \nhands. I voted against that budget for two reasons: One, it cut taxes; \nand, two, it cut discretionary funding a great deal.\n  So if that were not enough, this conference agreement also allows for \nfurther tax breaks in the third reconciliation bill. Presumably, the \npurpose for this process is to allow the majority in the Congress to \nhave another bite at the apple, should the President veto the first \ntax-break bill, or, if the majority finds that they did not do enough \ntax cutting in the first measure, even if the President signs it, they \nwill have the opportunity to provide more tax cuts in the third \nreconciliation bill.\n  I do not try to second-guess the leadership or the other party in \nthis matter. I have tremendous respect for Senator Domenici and Senator \nExon. They provide a great service to the people of this country and to \nthe Senate, and the Senate is in their debt. I respect them for their \nsincere judgments. But to those of us--I am one--who participated in \nthe river boat gamble. So I come into court with unclean hands. I voted \nfor the massive tax cuts over a 3-year period. I voted for them, \nalthough I did offer an amendment to provide that the tax cut for the \nthird year, I believe, would not go into effect until such time as we \ncould see what the impact of the tax cuts in the first 2 years would be \non our budgetary and fiscal situation. But I voted for those. So I \nparticipated in that river boat gamble of tax cuts and a defense \nbuildup first. I supported those two things as strongly as did the \nRepublicans in this body. So I am not a Johnny-come-lately after the \nfact complaining about what the Republicans did on that occasion. I \nvoted with them. I have been sorry for it.\n\n  To those of us who participated in the river boat gamble of tax cuts \nand spending cuts later as proposed by President Reagan, this \nconference agreement's proposed tax cuts now and spending cuts later is \nall too familiar to us. Have we not learned our lesson? It is all too \neasy to enact tax cuts and save the pain for later. I have voted for a \ngood many tax cuts in my 50 years of politics, and I have voted against \nthem. I said to the administration people that it is folly to talk \nabout cutting taxes now with the colossal deficits that we have and the \ncolossal debt that we have; the colossal payments of interest that we \nhave to make on that colossal debt. If we follow the policies proposed \nin this budget resolution, we are about to do it again. What will keep \nthe results from being the same at the end of this 7-year period as \nthey were when we followed the policies proposed by the Reagan \nadministration?\n  This budget resolution calls for $11 billion more in defense spending \njust in fiscal year 1997 alone than has been proposed by the President. \nIt proposes tax cuts ranging from $100 to $200 billion or more. It \nproposes terrible devastation on the domestic discretionary part of the \nbudget. I have been a member of the Appropriations Committee longer \nthan anybody else in this body. I have been chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for 6 years, and I have been a member of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee for quite a long time. So I view \nthese reductions in discretionary funding of exceedingly important \nprograms to our people and to our country with a great deal of regret. \nIt proposes, as I say, a terrible devastation on the domestic \ndiscretionary part of the budget--that portion which funds our \ninvestment in our Nation's education, environmental cleanup, clean air \nand water, highways, bridges and airports, flood prevention, crime \ncontrol, war against drugs, plus the operations of the entire Federal \nbudget. For that portion of the budget, this agreement, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office in a table provided to me just last \nevening, proposes real cuts in domestic discretionary budget authority \nof $254.9 billion below inflation over the period of fiscal years 1997-\n2002--$254.9 billion below inflation for domestic discretionary budget \nauthority.\n  The people of this country are going to wake up one day, and they are \ngoing to say, ``We are tired of having our domestic discretionary \nprograms cut to the bone.'' It is already into the marrow of the bone, \nand discretionary spending has taken it on the nose for several years. \nDiscretionary funding of domestic programs has borne the brunt of the \nbudget cuts and will continue to bear the brunt of those cuts under \nthis measure that is before us. One day the American people will say, \n``Where have you been? What is happening to our infrastructure--\nour highways, our sewage and water projects?'' We need more money in \nWest Virginia and in other rural areas to update our sewerage and water \nsystems, and in some instances to install systems for the first time.\n\n  I am sure West Virginia is not alone in this. Why cannot we help our \npeople? That is pretty important business--having clean water to drink. \nI offered an amendment twice here just in the last few days to provide \nfor additional funding for States and for communities that need help \nwith respect to their water and sewerage problems. Those amendments \nwere defeated. Everything is being sacrificed here on the altar of a \nbalanced budget. I do not decry the need to work toward our balancing \nthe budget. But the way we are doing it, the way we are going about it, \nI object to.\n  Under this budget resolution, we will be able to purchase nearly $255 \nbillion less in the year 2002 for domestic discretionary investments \nthan we can today. The needs will be greater. The funding will be less \nthan today.\n  I would point out that this budget resolution conference agreement \ncuts domestic discretionary budget authority below a freeze by $33 \nbillion. That is a real cut. That is a cut from which the American \npeople suffer, and they are going to be asking some questions down the \nroad. They will be shaken out of their lethargy when they wake up one \nday and see that we are continuing to cut funding for domestic programs \nthat mean so much for the health and well-being of the American people \nthemselves. It is an outrage. It is a disgrace for American communities \nin this day and time not to have modern water systems. They need them \nin those rural areas to have pure water. Not to have clean water to \ndrink--what is more important than that? In other words, under this \nbudget resolution, $33 billion less will be available than would be \nrequired to fund the investments contained in the domestic \ndiscretionary portion of the budget at a hard freeze level over the \nnext 6 years.\n  For fiscal year 1997 alone, Dr. Rivlin, the Director of OMB, points \nout in her letter to the chairman of the Budget Committee dated June \n11, 1996, nondefense discretionary spending is cut by more than $15 \nbillion below the President's request. The President's request was not \nanything to boast about. I can tell you that. The President's request \nwas too low. The President's budget over the 6 years is $230 billion \nbelow inflation. So that is why I voted against them. It was not \nanything to beat one's chest over when it came to discretionary \nprograms by President Clinton.\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\n  Furthermore, there is a peculiar section in this agreement as it \nrelates to discretionary outlays for fiscal year 1997. According to \npage 28 of this conference report, section 307 is entitled ``Government \nShutdown Prevention Allowance.'' That section will hold in reserve \n$1,337,000,000 in nondefense discretionary outlays which will only be \nmade available in the Senate pursuant to section 307(b). That paragraph \nreads as follows:\n\n       (b) Revised Allocations.--In the Senate, upon the \n     consideration of a motion to proceed or an agreement to \n     proceed to a resolution making continuing appropriations for \n     fiscal year 1997, or in the House of Representatives, upon \n     the filing of a conference report thereon, that complies with \n     the fiscal year 1997 discretionary limit on nondefense budget \n     authority, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the \n     appropriate House may submit a revised outlay allocation for \n     such committee and appropriately revised aggregates and \n     limits to carry out this section.\n\n  In other words, if I understand it correctly, this section will allow \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee to provide additional nondefense \noutlays of up to $1,337,000,000 to the Appropriations Committee ``upon \nthe consideration of a motion to proceed or an agreement to proceed to \na resolution making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 1997.''\n  This is getting curiouser and curiouser. Section 307 virtually \nensures that there will be at least one continuing resolution for 1997. \nHow else can the Appropriations Committee receive the $1.3 billion in \noutlays? What is this? This is an attempt by the majority to bludgeon \nthe President into signing appropriation bills which will contain $15 \nbillion less than he has requested for public investments in education, \nenvironmental cleanup, clean air and water, crime fighting, and a host \nof other programs. We faced this same problem in fiscal year 1996 and \nthe President refused to accept cuts of this magnitude, and we ended up \nwith total gridlock, Government shutdowns, and a record-setting 13 \ncontinuing resolutions to keep the Government functioning.\n  What we have in this agreement, it appears to me, is a blatant \nattempt to bypass the regular appropriations process even before it \nbegins. Anyone can see that the President will not agree to sign \nregular 1997 appropriation bills when he is assured of getting $1.337 \nbillion more in outlays if he waits for a continuing resolution. So the \nRepublican majority has thrown up its hands and given up before it even \nbegins to fight for the enactment of the 13 regular appropriation \nbills. They have tried to save themselves by creating a ``Government \nShutdown Prevention Allowance.''\n  This just will not wash. Does the majority think that the President \nwill just roll over and play dead on his budget priorities this year--\nwith cuts of $15 billion as this resolution requires? Do they think \nthat I and others who oppose such devastation in domestic investments \nwill be satisfied with such cuts simply because we have a new \nGovernment shutdown prevention allowance? Well, let the majority \nproceed with their proposals and we will meet them one at a time and \nsee how it turns out.\n  I can tell every Senator with complete confidence that this Nation \ncannot sustain the levels of cuts to the domestic discretionary portion \nof the budget over this 6-year period that are contained in this budget \nresolution without destroying the hopes of the American people for the \nbetterment of their children and grandchildren. The money will not be \nthere for increased investments in education. The money will not be \nthere for an adequate transportation system to move our goods to market \nand our people to and from work in an efficient manner. The money will \nnot be there for the safety and increased capacity of our national \nairport system, for improvement in flood prevention, cleaning up the \nenvironment, better water and sewage treatment for communities \nthroughout the Nation. These will not be possible. There will be no \nimprovement to these infrastructure systems, which are already in a \nstate of serious deterioration.\n\n  Mr. President, like other budget resolutions before this which \nclaimed to balance the Federal budget, several of which were put before \nthe Senate by the present chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. \nDomenici, this conference agreement contains no enforcement mechanism \nfor any area of the budget except discretionary spending. We have \noperated under enforceable caps with across-the-board sequester \nmechanisms for a number of years. So that Senators can be sure that the \ndevastation proposed by the cuts proposed in this budget resolution to \nthe domestic discretionary portion of the budget will occur. \nEnforcement mechanisms make that a virtual certainty.\n  But, like all of its predecessors, this budget resolution conference \nagreement contains no such enforcement mechanisms for entitlement \nspending or for revenues. In other words, there is no assurance that \nthe spending cuts proposed in any reconciliation measure that may be \nenacted into law pursuant to this budget resolution will actually \nresult in the savings claimed. Traditionally, those savings have been \nfar less than predicted. Similarly, any revenue increase measures that \nmay occur in any of these reconciliation bills may not achieve the \nlevels projected and the tax cuts may actually cost more than is being \nprojected. If so, there is no method in this resolution to make certain \nthat the revenue projections are, in fact, achieved or that the \nentitlement savings are, in fact, achieved.\n  There is no sequester mechanism or automatic tax-surcharge mechanism \nso that we may be certain that the entitlement spending cuts or any \nrevenue increases will be achieved, or that any tax cuts will cost no \nmore than is projected. So to all Senators who support this budget \nresolution today, I ask where will you be when the numbers go south in \nthe future years as they did in the Reagan budgets? Where will you be? \nThere is nothing here to ensure that these deficit projections will be \nreached. The only sure achievements will be the devastation in \ndiscretionary spending--that is a sure achievement--because of the caps \nfor each of the next 6 years.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in closing let me point out that, despite all \nthe rhetoric to the contrary, this budget resolution conference \nagreement does not result in a balanced budget in the year 2002. To \nconfirm this fact one simply needs to turn to pages 3 and 4 of the \nconference report. At the bottom of page 3 one will see under Section \n101(4) a heading entitled, deficits.\n\n       For purposes of the enforcement of this resolution, the \n     amounts of the deficits are as follows:\n       fiscal year 1997: $227,283,000,000.\n       fiscal year 1998: $224,399,000,000.\n       fiscal year 1999: $206,405,000,000.\n       fiscal year 2000: $185,315,000,000.\n       fiscal year 2001: $141,762,000,000.\n       fiscal year 2002: $103,854,000,000.\n\n  So, apparently, there will still be a deficit of over $100 billion in \nfiscal year 2002 under this conference agreement.\n  No matter how hard this thing tries to impress by sticking out its \nchest and spreading its tail feathers, it is still a turkey and it will \nnot fly.\n  I say this again to emphasize, with great respect to all of the \nSenators who have had a part in developing this conference agreement. \nWe sometimes do the best we can, and then we are not able to do enough. \nI was not entitled to sit in on the conference. I do not know what \narguments were made and what arguments were made and lost. I am simply \nlooking at the agreement as I find it here today and making my own \npersonal judgment concerning it.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 29 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I kept my word.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, I purposely came \nto the floor so I could hear his remarks, and I was here for all of \nthem. I cannot respond right now, because the call of duty has me going \nsomewhere else. But four or five of the points the Senator makes, I \nwill state our versions of them, which I think are different than your \nassumptions.\n  I share some concerns. It is clear that if I were producing a budget \nand I were the king and all I had to do was do it myself, while I might \ncome and confer with you, it would not be this budget. But we have to \nget a majority of the Senators to vote to reduce this deficit.\n  Frankly, I believe it is a pretty good plan. I think your analysis of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\ntaxes, the tax cuts--I think we have an explanation that is slightly \ndifferent, maybe in some respects greatly different, than you assume.\n  I would say one thing with reference to the appropriated accounts--\nwell, let me say two things. It is most interesting, you have properly \nstated how much the President cuts discretionary programs. You would \nthen, I am sure, agree that if we took the triggered part of his \nbudget, it even cuts it more. That is the one that is on par--or did \nyou use the triggered numbers? It would be more.\n  Mr. BYRD. I already took that into account in my numbers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are two budgets, one which uses the Congressional \nBudget Office assumptions and one which uses the President's own \nassumptions. In each instance, the amount of the cuts are different.\n  But I would say one answer to your concern might be that you might \nadopt some of the President's Cabinet's approach to out-year \nappropriated accounts, for they come around and testify they are \nmeaningless; it goes 1 year at a time, and not to worry about it. \nFrankly, we have not done that because we figure we need some of the \nsavings. But when you put a budget down, you have to stand by it. You \ncannot find excuses and say it really is not real.\n  The second point is, we are fully aware that it would be grossly \nunfair, and probably not good for the country, to not get the \nentitlement cuts and insist on all of the discretionary. You would have \nsome things out of proportion, and you probably would not get a \nbalance. If you read the report and the resolution, it says if, in \n1998, the entitlement savings have not occurred, then the caps are off \ndiscretionary accounts. That is not of great help, but it does at least \nmake the point that we are fully aware that to get the balance, you \nhave to have the entitlement savings; you cannot just do the \ndiscretionary accounts.\n  I will return and have a few additional comments. I yield the floor \nat this point.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is on the floor, I would \nlike to ask him a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nI have the floor, I may ask a question of another Senator without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am really going to be in a meeting. I will come back \nand answer any questions the Senator has within the next 30 or 40 \nminutes. I am supposed to be in Representative Armey's office at this \nmoment, but I will come back, if the Senator has some questions.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime will be charged to both sides equally.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have noted with interest over the last \nseveral weeks that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nrepeatedly spoken of the need for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. They have talked repeatedly about the need for deficit \nreduction.\n  I believe we do need to balance the budget. I believe we do need \nsignificant deficit reduction, because we face a demographic time bomb \nin this country. That demographic time bomb is the baby boom \ngeneration. When they begin to retire, they will double, in very short \norder, the number of people eligible for Social Security and Medicare, \nand that is going to put severe pressure on the finances of the United \nStates. So it is critically important that we get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  Mr. President, given all the rhetoric that has come from the \nRepublican side of the aisle about the need to balance the budget, \nabout the need for deficit reduction, I looked with anticipation at \ntheir budget proposal that is, after all, the work that they now \ncontrol. They control the House of Representatives. They control the \nU.S. Senate. As everyone in this Chamber knows, and everyone knows in \nthe other House, the President is not involved with the budget \nresolution. He cannot veto it. He plays no role in it. This is \ncompletely a creature of the two Chambers, the House and the Senate, \ncontrolled by the Republican Party.\n  So I think, given the rhetoric, one would anticipate that if you look \nat the budget proposal, the Republicans would be reducing the deficit. \nWhat a shock it is to look at the budget proposal before us and find \nout that our Republican friends, instead of reducing the deficit, are \nincreasing the deficit.\n  Let me repeat that, because I am certain a lot of people will find \nthat hard to believe. After all of the rhetoric, after all of the \ndiscussion that said we are going to reduce the deficit, that that is \nthe priority, if you look at the plan before us, it does not reduce the \ndeficit, it increases the deficit.\n  Mr. President, this year the deficit is going to come in at $130 to \n$140 billion. Next year under this plan, the deficit will not go down, \nwill not be decreased, will not be cut, the deficit will go up. The \ndeficit will go up to $153 billion. The next year it will be $147 \nbillion, both higher than the deficit we have now.\n  Sometimes I think the popular image is the Democrats are less in \nfavor of deficit reduction than our friends on the other side of the \naisle, but if one looks at the record, one finds quite a different \nresult.\n  When President Clinton came into office, he inherited a deficit of \n$290 billion. That was the deficit in 1992. In 1993, we passed a plan \nthat not a single Republican supported, and that plan led to a \nreduction in the deficit the next year of $255 billion. The next year \nit was further reduced to $203 billion. The next year it was reduced to \n$164 billion, and now this year, $130 to $140 billion--4 years of \ndeficit reduction, the first time since the administration of Benjamin \nHarrison.\n  I think in fairness, one has to say the Democratic record of deficit \nreduction in the Clinton administration has been a good one. And I must \nsay, I am disappointed our friends on the other side of the aisle, when \nthey have a chance to exercise control over the budget, come in with a \nproposal that, instead of reducing the deficit, raises the deficit. \nThat is not the direction we ought to be going.\n  I am still hopeful that we will go back to an approach of a \nbipartisan attempt to do what we all know must be done, which is to put \nthis country on a path to fiscal responsibility. Not just rhetoric, but \nthe reality.\n  I must say, I read in the paper this morning that some House \nRepublicans were in revolt, because they did not come here to raise the \ndeficit, but that is precisely what their plan does. Mr. President, I \nintend to vote against that plan. I hope other of my colleagues will \nvote against that plan as well, because not only does it raise the \ndeficit, but it contains a set of priorities that are virtually the \nsame set of priorities that we were confronted with last year which the \nAmerican people soundly rejected--soundly rejected.\n\n  We should not go on that path again this year, and we certainly \nshould not be voting for a plan that raises the deficit.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if my colleague will stay just for a \nmoment, I would like to engage in a colloquy with him about a point the \nSenator from West Virginia made.\n  I have been listening to part of the debate and participating in part \nof the debate. I found the representation both\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\non the floor of the Senate and even in the newspaper this morning very \ninteresting. It says ``House Narrowly Passes Balanced Budget Plan,'' \nwhich is the plan we are talking about here. This is the plan the House \nnarrowly passed yesterday, described as a ``balanced budget plan.''\n  This piece of paper is on every Senate desk. It is laying here on \nmine, but every Senate desk has it, and this is the actual conference \nreport. On page 4 of the actual conference report, it says, \n``Deficits,'' and then in the year 2002, it says, ``$103 billion in \ndeficits.''\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, has spoken on this \nbefore as well, but it seems to me what this does is technically comply \nwith the law, because the law says that you cannot use Social Security \ntrust funds to portray in a piece of legislation like this that you \nhave balanced the budget. But with the exception of this notation on \npage 4 that the deficit is going to be $103 billion in 2002, with the \nexception of that one notation, every other piece of information given \non the floor of the Senate, every speech given by the majority that \nbrings this to the floor alleges this is a balanced budget.\n  Is it just out of step, I guess, with common practice to be able to \nignore what you put in the legislation and claim something different? \nCan Senator Conrad answer that question? I guess the question I would \nask is, what is the circumstance that allows this kind of hoax to \ncontinue?\n  Mr. CONRAD. In answer, Mr. President, I might just say it is perhaps \none of the most perplexing stories in this town, because this is not a \nbalanced budget plan. I mean, honestly stated, to take the retirement \nfunds of the people of the United States and throw those into the pot \nand call it a balanced budget, frankly, borders on laughable. There is \na $103 billion deficit by the year 2002 under this plan.\n  Sometimes I think the media just do not get it. They are reporting on \nwhat we call the unified budget. The unified budget is when you put \neverything into the same pot and then you see whether you have balance \nor not. The problem with that, of course, is that includes Social \nSecurity, all of the receipts and all of the expenditures. Social \nSecurity is not contributing to the deficit, as the Senator from North \nDakota knows, Social Security is in surplus, substantial surplus. And \nthat is going to continue. In fact, those surpluses are going to grow, \nand the reason we put a plan in place to have Social Security surpluses \ngrow is because we are getting ready for when the baby boom generation \nretires.\n  But, of course, we are not getting ready; we are spending every dime. \nAs a result, to call these balanced budgets is not accurate. It is \nmisleading.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, on the same page it \nsays, ``Social Security revenues,'' and they are anticipating how much \nin revenues will come in to the Social Security Program during the next \n6 years.\n  During the 6 years, the revenues from Social Security, which is the \npayroll tax everyone pays from their paycheck while they are working, \nwill increase by $100 billion over the 6 years. It will go from $385 to \n$487 billion. In other words, this contemplates that from the payroll \ntaxes, which are regressive taxes, will rise by $100 billion. People \ntalk about flat taxes. These are the flat taxes. This is totally flat. \nEvery worker, no matter what their income is, pays the identical \npercentage of payroll tax. That payroll tax will increase the proceeds \nto the Federal Government by $100 billion in the 6 years.\n\n  The solemn promise that has been made in law is that increase in the \nregressive payroll tax is designed to be put in a trust fund to be \nsaved for when it is needed when the Social Security System will \nexhibit some strains when the war babies retire. It is interesting to \nme that the $100 billion increase in the regressive payroll tax is \nclearly not going to be saved, if you listen to the other side claim \nthey now have balanced the budget, because they clearly are taking that \n$100 billion on the bottom of page 4 and saying, ``Well, we don't care \nwhat the promise is with respect to taking that from workers and \nputting it in the trust fund, we intend to use it to balance the \nbudget.''\n  At the same time they want to construct a budget they say needs \nbalancing, they want to reduce taxes. Yes, they want to cut the \nalternative minimum tax for corporations, they want to make it easier \nto move your plant overseas by giving a tax break, they want to enact a \nwhole series of tax cuts. Most of those tax cuts will benefit upper \nincome people.\n  They want to bring, next, to the floor of the Senate a proposal to \nbuild up to a $60 billion star wars program. There is an unending \nappetite to spend money on the part of even those who claim they are \nbalancing the budget, but are not balancing the budget in this \nproposal.\n  I ask Senator Conrad about the $100 billion increase in Social \nSecurity revenues that are anticipated in this budget. Does it not \nappear as if those are the revenues that they would then use to claim \nthey have balanced the budget, when in fact they have not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. In fact, if you take the amount of money over the 6 \nyears, it is $525 billion of Social Security surpluses that are going \nto be used to say that the budget has been balanced. So $525 billion of \nSocial Security surpluses are going to be looted or raided, or whatever \nterminology one wants to apply in order to claim a balanced budget.\n  This is not a balanced budget. In fairness, I think one ought to say \nthe President's plan is also not a balanced budget. Even the plan that \nI was part of, part of the centrist coalition, was not truly a balanced \nbudget. None of these plans are truly balanced budgets.\n  In fact, the only plan that we have had a chance to vote on in the \nlast 2 years that was truly a balanced budget was the one I offered \nlast year, and the Senator from North Dakota supported it, the fair \nshare balanced budget plan. That did balance without counting Social \nSecurity surpluses. It is the only budget that has been voted on on the \nfloor on the Senate that was a true balanced budget plan. That got 39 \nvotes here in the U.S. Senate. Obviously, 39 votes does not prevail.\n  I just say, the media, when they report, ought to tell the people \naccurately and honestly what has happened. Because to take retirement \nfunds and throw those into the pot and call it a balanced budget, if we \nwere doing that in the private sector, if in any company you took the \nretirement funds of employees, threw those into the pot, and said you \nwere balancing the budget, you would be headed for a Federal \ninstitution. It would not be the U.S. Congress. It would be a Federal \nfacility, a law enforcement facility. You would be headed for Federal \nprison because that is a violation of Federal law.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one additional comment.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Nebraska wishes to contribute \non these subjects. But the Senator from North Dakota says something I \nsaid yesterday. The President's budget also is not in balance, nor was \nthe bipartisan budget in balance. I have never claimed they were. But \nthose who bring this to the floor who claim they are in balance are \nwrong. This is not a balanced budget.\n  I only make the point that the Senator from Nebraska has been on the \nfloor talking about this budget issue. I read his statement yesterday. \nI did not hear his statement when he made it, but I read it in the \nCongressional Record. He makes the point that I think is very \nimportant.\n  We ought not be talking about tax cuts. I know that might be popular. \nWe ought to set the issue of tax cuts aside, talk seriously about how \ndo you honestly and really balance the budget, do that job, finish that \njob, then come back to the question of how do you construct a tax \nsystem that eliminates or reduces some of the burden on middle-income \npeople? That is what we ought to do.\n  But instead of that, we have a bunch of folks out here who wave their \narms and flail around on the floor of the Senate and claim they have a \nbalanced budget, which is not in balance; and then in the next breath \nsay, ``We not only have a balanced budget''--that is not in balance--\n``but we want to cut taxes and increase spending.''\n  What on Earth kind of priorities are those? That does not make any \nsense. I could understand if there was a consistent approach, even if \nit was wrong. I can understand consistency. But to be consistently \ninappropriate in the way you approach this issue just makes no sense.\n  How can you be for a balanced budget and then come to the floor with \nthis\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nand be consistent about wanting to do the things that reach a balanced \nbudget? This is not advertising. I mean, this is not some marketing \ngame we are playing. The issue is, are we going to solve this problem?\n  This document is a remarkable document, not only for what it says, \nbut for what it does not say. What it says is, ``There they go again.'' \nThat is what it says. That is what the Senator from Nebraska said. It \nis the same tired, old set of priorities. ``Let's take money from the \nhealth care for the elderly and give it for tax breaks for upper income \nfolks.'' There they go again; the same set of priorities.\n  But even more important than that, the inconsistency here is stark, \nthe inconsistency of saying we want a balanced budget, then proposing \none that is not in balance and then in the same breath saying let us \nreduce revenue by giving tax cuts to those, especially those at the \nupper end, who do not need it. And then let us spend more money \nespecially on things like star wars and other defense boondoggles that \ncost tens and tens of billions of dollars. The inconsistency is \nincomprehensible. Senator Conrad made that point and Senator Exon has \nmade the point as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 13 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. EXON. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have three other speakers who wanted 5 \nminutes each, including the leader.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from West \nVirginia for the kind remarks that he made about this individual with \nregard to the budget. He is a real stalwart. I have enjoyed working \nvery much with Senator Byrd over the years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the \nRepublican budget, prepared by the Democratic staff of the Senate \nBudget Committee, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Analysis of the Republican Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 1997 \nBudget Resolution Prepared by the Democratic Staff of the Senate Budget \n                               Committee\n\n\n                              INTRODUCTION\n\n       With the filing of this conference report, all of the \n     efforts of the Republican majority to portray their budget as \n     moderate are in vain. The Republican majority have done a \n     superb job to airbrush their budget, but the American people \n     can see the real thing--warts and all.\n       It retains the same unflattering profile as its \n     predecessor: unnecessary reductions in Medicare and Medicaid \n     paying for tax breaks for the wealthy. This is in fact the \n     Newt Gingrich Budget. And as Senator Dole leaves Capitol Hill \n     for the campaign trail, he leaves whatever is left of his \n     budget to the tender mercies of the extreme right. They will \n     give it their full attention.\n       This rehashed budget is part and parcel of the Republican \n     strategy of no-work and all-political-play. They wanted to \n     ram through their failed and stale political agenda and \n     confront the President at every turn of this crooked \n     legislative road. Worst of all, two of the three baby \n     reconciliation bills the conference report creates will be \n     devoted largely to cutting taxes--an act that will worsen the \n     deficit.\n       The House is already working its voodoo in this conference \n     report. At least the Senate language required that all the \n     entitlement spending reductions be enacted into law before we \n     considered the tax breaks. The House shamelessly tossed that \n     requirement out the window and the Senate concurred.\n       The first reconciliation bill contains Medicaid, welfare, \n     and tax breaks. So much for performing deficit reduction \n     before doling out the tax breaks. So much for fiscal \n     conservatism. The first reconciliation bill will reduce the \n     deficit by just $2 billion, if it reduces the deficit at all. \n     This is as plain as the light of day. The majority now want \n     to eliminate the Medicaid guarantee of meaningful health care \n     benefits for 18 million children, 6 million disabled \n     Americans, millions of nursing home residents, 36 million \n     people in all, to fund their tax breaks.\n       The conferees assume a net tax cut of $122 billion, yet \n     Chairman Kasich maintains that the cuts will be as large as \n     $180 billion. There is not a single specific mention of \n     closing tax loopholes or of ending corporate tax giveaways. \n     The same budget that eagerly reduces funding for our Medicare \n     and Medicaid programs cannot find the courage to call upon \n     the special interests to assume any of the burden of \n     balancing the budget.\n       The Republicans cling to the tax breaks--the tax breaks \n     that fuel the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid and divide \n     our great Nation. That is why they and this budget will \n     ultimately fail. And that is not only a tragedy for the \n     departing Majority Leader but for the American people as \n     well.\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n       The reduction in projected spending for Medicare is still \n     too large. The Republican budget reduces Medicare spending by \n     $168 billion and proposes $10 billion in new spending for a \n     graduate medical education trust fund. Under these \n     assumptions, Medicare spending per beneficiary falls \n     dramatically below comparable private sector growth rates, \n     reducing quality and access to health care for millions of \n     middle-class Americans. Private health care costs are \n     expected to increase by 7.1 percent per beneficiary compared \n     to a 4.7 percent per-person rate in the Republican plan--a 34 \n     percent difference. The GOP plan will dramatically cut the \n     purchasing power that seniors have for health care.\n       The plan also includes a premium increase for high-income \n     beneficiaries and a $123 billion reduction in Part A. Details \n     on the premium increase are not available. The American \n     Academy of Physicians, the American Hospital Association, and \n     the American Association of Retired Persons concur, however, \n     that the proposal contains deeps cuts in payments to \n     hospitals, which could result in cost-shifting, undermine \n     quality, and threaten the finance viability of many rural and \n     urban hospitals.\n       Damaging structural changes proposed by the Republicans \n     will risk turning Medicare into a second-class system for \n     seniors who cannot afford to opt out of traditional Medicare \n     through Medical Savings Accounts. These changes would \n     segregate the sickest and least affluent beneficiaries into \n     in a severely weakened fee-for-service program.\n       The President proved you can balance the budget with far \n     less Medicare savings while keeping Medicare solvent and \n     protecting seniors from new costs. The President's budget \n     cuts Medicare by $50 billion less than the Republican plan \n     but maintains solvency for 10 years. The President's budget \n     shows that premium hikes, deep reductions, and damaging \n     structural changes are not necessary to balance the budget \n     and guarantee the life of the Medicare trust fund. By \n     preserving cuts in corporate subsidies for tax cuts for the \n     rich, the Republicans are forced to reduce the growth of \n     programs for middle-class Americans far deeper than the \n     President's plan.\n\n\n                  REDUCTIONS FROM LOW-INCOME PROGRAMS\n\n       Although the Republican budget does not identify all of the \n     assumptions behind cuts in mandatory programs, more than 42 \n     percent of these savings come from programs that help low-\n     income Americans.\n\n\n                                Medicaid\n\n       The Republican budget includes $72 billion in Medicaid \n     cuts. This could translate into total cuts of more than $250 \n     billion if states spend only the minimum required to \n     receive their full allocations. If this occurs, spending \n     growth per person would be reduced to a level below the \n     general rate of inflation.\n       Recently introduced Republican legislation shows that they \n     have not backed down from their proposal to block grant \n     Medicaid and to eliminate health care guarantees for the \n     elderly, disabled, and pregnant women and children. The \n     Republican bill distributes more than 96 percent of the \n     funding in exactly the same way as last year's Medigrant \n     proposal.\n       As the Democratic Governors have pointed out, these \n     Medicaid provisions do not reflect the bipartisan National \n     Governors' Association proposal, because the NGA agreed that \n     States must be protected from unanticipated program costs \n     resulting from economic fluctuations in the business cycle, \n     changing demographics, and natural disasters. The umbrella \n     fund included in the new Republican proposal is not \n     sufficient to achieve that goal.\n       Under this proposal, 36 million people will lose their \n     guaranteed access to health care. Those who do receive \n     coverage will no longer be guaranteed a basic level of \n     benefits. States could be forced to deny coverage to millions \n     of children and people with disabilities, and to older \n     Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home and \n     long-term care.\n\n                                Welfare\n\n       The Republicans claim to adopt the National Governors' \n     Association's welfare reform recommendations. The Republican \n     budget cuts $53 billion from welfare programs, however, \n     significantly more than the $43 billion in savings attributed \n     to the bipartisan NGA proposal. Recently introduced \n     Republican welfare reform legislation does include several \n     provisions requested by the Governors. But, as the Democratic \n     Governors have pointed out, the Republican plan cuts food \n     stamps more than the NGA proposal, rejects the NGA's work \n     requirements, and includes a 20-percent cut in the Social \n     Services Block Grant, which will undermine states' efforts to \n     make sure that adequate child care will be available. The \n     Republican bill also eliminates the provision supported by \n     the NGA that States maintain their current level of effort in \n     order to receive Federal foster care funding.\n       The Republican Medicaid and welfare bill was crafted with \n     no Democratic input. It\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\n     would appear that the Republicans would rather play election-\n     year politics than work toward real, bipartisan reforms that \n     could be signed into law.\n\n                        Earned Income Tax Credit\n\n       The Republican plan includes $18.5 billion in cuts to the \n     Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC helps low-income \n     working families stay off welfare and out of poverty. The \n     conference report does indicate that the tax credit would end \n     for 4 million childless workers, and states that the EITC \n     would be ``coordinated'' with the $500-per-child tax credit. \n     Most families who receive the EITC, however, would be \n     ineligible for much, if not all, of the child tax credit. The \n     same claims were made last year, but analysis of the final \n     proposal indicated that more than 7 million working \n     households would have had their taxes increased under the \n     EITC provisions in the vetoed reconciliation conference \n     report.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n              No Real Investment in Education and Training\n\n       The $1.3 billion by which the Republicans increase \n     education funding from 1996 to 1997 is wholly insufficient to \n     maintain the levels agreed to in the 1996 omnibus \n     appropriations bill. In fact, over 6 years, the conference \n     report is below a CBO 1996 freeze by $11 billion for Function \n     500 (Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services) \n     discretionary spending. It is clear that the Republicans have \n     still not learned that the American people, a majority of \n     Congress, and the President believe that adequate funding for \n     education programs is essential.\n       The trivial increase included in the conference report of \n     $2.6 billion over 6 years over the Republicans baseline for \n     Function 500 discretionary spending is shameful given how \n     important education and training is to our Nation. The \n     President's budget, by contrast, invests $59.4 billion more \n     than the Republican budget. In real terms, the conference \n     report reduces education and training spending by $25 billion \n     over 6 years.\n\n                Capping the Direct Student Loan Program\n\n       The conference report proposes capping the Federal direct \n     student loan program, crippling this successful program. (The \n     conference report does not provide a volume amount at which \n     this cap would be set. The House-passed budget resolution \n     eliminated the program, while the Senate capped it at 20 \n     percent.) Since schools participating in the direct loan \n     program currently handle nearly 40 percent of loan volume, \n     hundreds of schools will be forced out of the program. This \n     will lead to disruptions and disarray for colleges and \n     universities and considerable headache and uncertainty for \n     students. The Republican majority does not believe that \n     competition and choice belong in the student loan market; \n     they want to assure banks and guarantee agencies continued \n     access to Federal subsidies.\n       Even though the Republicans claim outlays savings of $3.7 \n     billion over 6 years from their cap on direct lending, their \n     proposal would cost, not save billions, if it were scored \n     under the existing rules of the Credit Reform Act. The \n     Republicans add $5.8 billion in outlays to the deficit \n     through a ``baseline adjustment'' directing the Congressional \n     Budget Office to override the Credit Reform Act in its \n     scoring of student loan programs.\n\n\n                            THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n       Over the next 6 years, the Republican budget cuts $3.8 \n     billion from essential environmental and natural resources \n     programs, a 17 percent cut below the President's level by the \n     year 2002, including a 23 percent reduction for the EPA's \n     enforcement and operations activities and a 36 percent \n     reduction for the energy conservation programs. The \n     Republican plan uses these reductions to let polluters off \n     the hook, to the tune of $5.4 billion, by financing taxpayer \n     spending for Superfund cleanups rather than requiring \n     responsible parties to pay the cost.\n       The Republican budget plan also assumes a $1 billion of \n     savings will be achieved from the opening of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas development, \n     putting at risk one of our national treasures. The Republican \n     plan would weaken EPA's ability to protect public health and \n     the environment and lead to further deterioration of the \n     National Parks. The Republican plan jeopardizes \n     administration priorities such as the environmental cops on \n     the beat program, the Partnership for a new Generation of \n     Vehicles, and the Climate Change Action plan.\n\n\n                           CRIME AND JUSTICE\n\n       The Republican budget, as approved by the conferees, \n     actually decreases the funding level from both the House and \n     Senate budgets for the Administration of Justice function \n     (Function 750). The proposed funding level is $20.9 billion, \n     and is well below the House level of $22.1 billion and the \n     Senate resolution of $21.7 billion, and considerably below \n     the $23.5 billion requested by the President.\n       The Violent Crime Reduction Fund (VCRTF) would be funded at \n     only $4.7 billion, which is $300 million below the $5 billion \n     authorized level. The President requested that the Trust Fund \n     be funded at the full $5 billion level. In addition, funding \n     for the VCRTF is not included for the years 2000 and 2001. \n     The President's budget assumes continued funding for the \n     Trust Fund in those years. It is unlikely that our need to \n     commit adequate resources to fighting crime will end after \n     the year 2000.\n       At a time when Americans continue to express concerns about \n     the level of violent crime and the need to continue an \n     aggressive war on drugs, this Republican budget would \n     actually spend less money ($20.924 billion) in 1997 than was \n     allocated in 1996 ($20.969 billion).\n       The Republicans continually depict the President as soft on \n     crime and not aggressively pursuing the drug war. This \n     Republican budget at $2.6 billion below the President's \n     request, however, clearly demonstrates that Congress, not the \n     President, is placing a low priority on fighting crime and \n     achieving justice in America.\n\n\n                               TAX BREAKS\n\n       No one should be fooled into believing that the Republicans \n     intend to limit their tax breaks to $122.4 billion, as \n     claimed by the conferees. The Republicans try to hide the \n     size of their tax breaks by not including in their baseline \n     the extension of three expired excise taxes dedicated to \n     trust funds and by counting the cuts over 6 years as opposed \n     to last year's 7 years. The Republicans are not backing off \n     of their huge tax breaks; they are merely disguising them \n     with clever gimmicks. Simply extending the excise taxes will \n     raise the tax cut to $155 billion. House Budget Committee \n     Chairman Kasich claims that the tax breaks will be in the \n     range of $180 billion.\n       On its face, this budget does not even pay for the one tax \n     cut it endorses, as the child tax credit costs about $137 \n     billion. Unlike the cost of the child tax credit that grows \n     incrementally each year, the Republican tax cut in 2002 is \n     reduced to $16.6 billion from a 2001 level of $22.6 billion. \n     If the child tax credit is indeed the only assumed tax cut, \n     then it must be sunsetted or triggered-off in some way in \n     2002, perhaps by lowering the size of the credit.\n       The Republican budget does not call upon special interests \n     to assume any of the burden of balancing our budget. While \n     President Clinton has proposed that $40 billion be raised \n     from corporate reforms and loophole closing legislation, the \n     Republican budget lists no savings from those categories.\n       The Republican budget allows for a ``deficit neutral'' tax \n     relief bill that will most likely include capital gains tax \n     breaks and other tax cuts. Chairman Domenici has repeatedly \n     asserted that tax increases can be used by the Finance \n     Committee to offset additional tax decreases. If the past is \n     any guide, the Republicans will soon be proposing to raid \n     pension funds for working families as a way to pay for tax \n     cuts that benefit primarily our wealthiest citizens. As many \n     of the other corporate reform provisions in the Balanced \n     Budget Act have already been promised to pay for other \n     legislation before the Senate, it remains unclear what will \n     be used to offset the costs of any additional tax breaks.\n       Experience tells us to be very wary of Republican promises \n     of who will benefit from their tax breaks. Last year's vetoed \n     Republican reconciliation bill devoted 47 percent of its tax \n     cuts to people making more than $100,000. Chairman Kasich has \n     already promised that this year's tax breaks will likely be \n     more of the same.\n\n\n               NATIONAL DEFENSE AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\n\n       For 1997, the Republican conferees adopt the Senate \n     position and increased defense spending over the Pentagon's \n     1997 request by $11.3 billion. In 1998-2002, the conferees \n     more or less split the difference between the House and the \n     Senate resolutions. This $11.3 billion increase in 1997 tops \n     last year's Republican budget, which increased spending over \n     the Pentagon's request by $6.9 billion. As demonstrated by \n     recent action in the House and Senate authorizing committees, \n     much of this increase will go toward wasteful programs that \n     the Defense Department does no want and did not request. \n     In 1998-2002, the conferees allow the defense budget to \n     grow at a rate slower than inflation, yielding spending \n     levels that are well below the President's request for \n     2001 and 2002. In comparison to last year's budget \n     resolution, this year's effort provides defense with $7.7 \n     billion more in real purchasing power.\n       For International Affairs, the conference report provides \n     $18.2 billion for 1997, which exceeds what was recommended in \n     both the House and Senate resolutions. Despite this relative \n     increase in funding, this allocation is still $1.0 billion \n     less than the President requested and $260 million less than \n     appropriated last year. For the period 1997 through 2002, the \n     Republican budget provides over $18 billion less than the \n     President requested for International Affairs. These \n     reductions will undermine our global leadership \n     responsibilities and compromise our ability to advance core \n     national interests. Republicans once again talk the talk of \n     being a global superpower, but then refuse to walk the walk \n     by allocating the funds necessary to act like one.\n\n\n                    PROCESS IN THE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n       The Republican budget contains instructions for three \n     different reconciliation bills to try to maximize Republican \n     exposure during this election year.\n       The first reconciliation bill addresses welfare, Medicaid, \n     and tax breaks. The resolution moves the tax breaks up into \n     the first bill, which will barely reduce the deficit, if it \n     does at all. The House committee reporting date is this \n     coming Thursday, June 13, and the Senate committee reporting \n     date is June 21. The Senate committees instructed are \n     Agriculture and Finance (both direct spending and revenue \n     reductions).\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\n       The second reconciliation bill is devoted solely to \n     Medicare. The House committee reporting date is July 18, and \n     the Senate committee reporting date is July 24. The only \n     Senate committee instructed is the Finance Committee, and for \n     only direct spending.\n       The third reconciliation bill addresses miscellaneous \n     direct spending and, once again, tax breaks. This way, if the \n     President vetoes the first tax break bill, Congress can send \n     him another. The House committee reporting date is September \n     6, and the Senate committee reporting date is September 18, \n     not even a month and a half before the election! Senate \n     committees instructed for this bill include Agriculture, \n     Armed Services, Banking, Commerce, Energy, Environment, \n     Finance (both direct spending and revenue reductions), \n     Governmental Affairs, Judiciary, Labor, Veterans. Reporting \n     is no longer contingent on passage of the prior two \n     reconciliation bills, as it was in the Senate-passed \n     reconciliation bill.\n       You can bet that there will be a continuing resolution--a \n     C.R.--this year. That's because section 307 of the budget \n     resolution--comically named the ``Government Shutdown \n     Prevention Allowance''--provides that the Budget Committee \n     Chairman can boost the allocations to the appropriators and \n     lift the appropriations caps by $1.3 billion in outlays \n     (enough to get to a CBO freeze) if and only if the \n     appropriators report out a C.R. The only question now is, \n     will the FIRST appropriations bill be a C.R.?\n       The Republican budget contains a tax reserve fund that \n     allows tax cut legislation to be offset by spending cuts. The \n     types of tax breaks allowable show the Republican priorities: \n     family tax relief, fuel tax relief, and incentives to \n     stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic \n     growth--read capital gains--so long as the legislation does \n     not increase the deficit.\n       The Republican budget contains a reserve fund to \n     reauthorize superfund. This will allow discretionary spending \n     to be moved off budget to pay for cleanup without holding \n     original polluters responsible.\n       The Republican budget contains a provision requiring that \n     asset sales be counted, rejecting the compromise present-\n     value language agreed to on the Senate floor.\n       The Republican majority has given us another extreme \n     budget, and the Senate should reject it.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in view of the fact that we have roughly 10 \nminutes left--as I understand it, we are planning to vote at noon, I \nask the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Nebraska is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in order to expedite the proceedings, I ask \nunanimous consent that the final 10 to 12 minutes, whatever time is \nleft on the Democratic side, be reserved for use between 11:40 and \n11:55 this morning.\n  Mr. GORTON. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator from \nNebraska make that period of time end at 11:50 so that the Senator from \nNew Mexico, as the proponent, may have the last 10 minutes? Can the \nSenator move it forward a little and end at 11:50?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, if the Senator wants that. I agree to amend the \nunanimous consent request as suggested by the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. EXON. I withhold.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I regret the absence from the floor of the \ntwo Senators from North Dakota who just engaged in a discussion of this \nand of other budget proposals. But even in their absence, their \nstatements should not go without response.\n  At one level, the so-called Social Security argument, the proposition \nthat these budgets are not balanced, we are dealing with mere debating \npoints, and relatively outrageous debating points at that.\n  At a second level, the concerns of the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad, who was a part of the same bipartisan group attempting to reach \na common ground on that issue, as I was, I wish my remarks to be more \nserious. I think his were more pointed and more thoughtful. I will try \nto do the same.\n  More than a year ago, at the time at which this argument about \nwhether or not payroll taxes and Social Security benefits should be \ncounted when we determine whether or not the budget was balanced, \nCharles Krauthammer, in his column in the Washington Post, wrote:\n\n       In my 17 years in Washington, this is the single most \n     fraudulent argument I have heard. I do not mean politically \n     fraudulent, which is routine in Washington, in a judgment \n     call anyway; I mean logically, demonstrably, mathematically \n     fraudulent, a condition rare even in Washington, and a \n     judgment call not at all.\n\n  Why did Mr. Krauthammer, an outside observer, write about this \nargument in this fashion? For one simple reason, Mr. President. The \nbudget deficit of the United States of America, however many billions \nof dollars we are speaking of, is an exceedingly simple concept, \nreadily understood by any citizen of this country. It is the difference \nbetween the amount of money the Government of the United States spends \nevery year and the amount of money the United States takes in every \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, for various and sundry purposes, some good, some not \nso good, we have frequently passed laws that put some of these receipts \ninto a particular fund, spend out of that particular fund, and then we \nhave gone beyond that process to pretend they are not a part of the \nbudget or of the budget deficit. But they are.\n\n  The payroll tax is a tax which the Presiding Officer pays and I pay \nand every other working American pays, just to exactly the same extent \nthat the income tax is a tax or an excise tax is a tax. The money spent \nby the Federal Government is a Federal expenditure, however worthy or \nunworthy its purpose, whether it is wasted or spent highly \nconstructively.\n  When we speak of a balanced budget in the year 2002, we speak of it \nin the sense of how much money we are spending and how much money we \nare taking in. When President Clinton says that he has a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002, he speaks of it in the sense of how much money \nwe spend and how much money we take in. When the bipartisan group, of \nwhich the Senator from North Dakota was a part, speaks of a balanced \nbudget, it uses exactly that same concept.\n  My gosh, Mr. President, by the argument that we received over here, \nwe can balance the budget this year. All we have to say is that $150 \nbillion of money we spend is not on the budget. Let us pass a law. Just \npass a law. Let us say all the money that we spend on national defense \nis not counted on the budget. Presto, we would have a surplus, and we \ncould all go home, and the budget would not be unbalanced.\n\n  Mr. President, obviously, it is not as easy as that. The money we \nspend on national defense does count. The money we spend on Social \nSecurity does count. The money that comes in our payroll taxes does \ncount. When we count everything, the budget is passed.\n  Even worse, Mr. President, some Members voted against a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget unless we included in it \nthis fiction that payroll taxes for Social Security purposes and \npayments to Social Security recipients did not count. Mr. President, \nthat is especially outrageous because by the time the constitutional \namendment was ratified and became fully effective in this country, it \nwould have exactly the opposite effect that the proposal has today.\n  Today, the proposal outlined by the two Members from North Dakota \nwould say we cannot count as balanced a budget that is, in fact, \nbalanced. We have to state there is a $100 billion deficit because in \nthat particular year, the Social Security taxes are taking in $100 \nbillion more than is being paid out in benefits.\n  We all know, we have been told, we know inevitably that sometime \nrelatively early in the next century, exactly the opposite will be the \ncase: The Social Security trust fund will be paying out more money than \nit is taking in.\n  So if these Senators have their way, in 10 or 15 years we will be \nable to claim a budget is balanced while the Social Security trust fund \nis going bankrupt and while the country is, in fact, obligated to spend \nhundreds of billions of dollars every year that it does not have. The \nbooks will say the budget is balanced in exactly the same way that it \nwould say that they were balanced today if we just decided to take \nnational defense off budget and claim the money we were spending on it \ndid not count, for some reason or another.\n  It is for that reason, Mr. President, that Charles Krauthammer, a \nyear and a half ago, said this was the most fraudulent argument he had \never heard in 17 years in Washington, DC. That is not the real issue \nbefore the Senate, in our judgment, as to whether or not to\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\npass this budget resolution. That judgment really rests solely on the \nquestion, is it time to begin to move honestly toward a balanced \nbudget? Is it time to arrest the growth rate of a handful of \nentitlements which each year take a larger percentage of our budget and \neach year contribute more to our budget deficit? Is it time to assure \nthat we are going to have enough money for the very appropriated \naccounts about which the Senator from West Virginia was so eloquent, or \nare we going to allow them to be eaten up completely by these \nentitlements to the point which we will have no money for any of those \npurposes--for education, for the environment, for a park system, for \nthe Department of Justice, because we are simply unwilling to deal with \nthese entitlements?\n  In fact, Mr. President, it is true under this budget resolution, the \ndeficit in 1997 will be larger, by a small margin, than the deficit in \n1996. The deficit in 1998 will begin to go down, it will be about the \nsame as the 1996 deficit, and then it will go down more rapidly \nthereafter.\n  Mr. President, if we were to adopt President Clinton's budget, the \nincrease in the deficit in 1997 would be even greater, and in every \nsingle year it would be significantly more than it is under the \nproposal before the Senate now. Why? Because he does not arrest the \ngrowth of entitlements in the way we do. In the early years, at least, \nhe proposes to spend much more in discretionary spending.\n\n  Mr. President, this is what I principally regret about the argument \nof the Senator from North Dakota. The bipartisan budget, which the two \nof us supported, also has a higher deficit using these figures in 1997 \nthan in 1996. It has a higher one in 1998 than in 1997. Yet, the \nSenator from North Dakota and I both supported it. Why? Because, in my \nopinion, it does a better job in the long-term control of entitlement \nprograms. Thereafter, it allows for at least as much in tax relief to \nworking Americans as does ours, and allows for more in the way of \ndiscretionary spending on education, law enforcement and the like. I \nfelt it preferable to the one we have before the Senate now, but we did \nnot win. This one is infinitely preferable to the proposal of the \nPresident, and it is infinitely preferable to doing nothing and \nallowing the status quo to continue and engaging in fruitless debate-\npoint kinds of arguments.\n  Mr. President, the job would have been easier had we started a year \nago. The President's veto of a balanced budget then frustrated that \ngoal. It would have been easier still if we had started 2 years before \nthat, at the beginning of the Clinton administration, or 2 years before \nthat in the Bush administration. For one reason or another, we did not. \nNow we have a series of excuses as to why we should not start now or, \nmore precisely, why we should do it differently.\n  Everyone is for a balanced budget. Everyone is for a balanced budget, \nMr. President. It is always a different one. It is never the one they \nhave before them. That, accumulated over 30 years, is the reason we \nfind ourselves in our present position.\n  I believe this resolution is going to pass. I think that will be a \ngood thing. I believe the President of the United States is almost \ncertain to veto the enforcement mechanisms which would make it a \nreality. That will be a bad thing.\n  We are likely to be back here next year, whoever is President, faced \nwith the same challenge, but a more difficult challenge. We will be \nfurther in debt, it will be more difficult to bring these spending \nprograms under control, but we will have the same debate once again as \nwe do now. It will not be won by debating points. It will only be won \nby a support of something that is actually before the Senate and \nsomething that will actually work, that this present resolution most \ncertainly is.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent it be \ncharged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, how much time does the minority \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On this side we have how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 39 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that any time charged to the \nminority in the immediate past quorum call be charged to the majority, \nbecause they are very short of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I voted against the Republican budget \nresolution when it came before the Senate. I told this body my reason \nwhich distills to one simple truth: It does not reflect the priorities \nof the American people. Sadly, as soon as Members of the House of \nRepresentatives had their say in the budget, as soon as the influence \nof the Speaker of the House was brought to bear in the conference \ncommittee, a bad budget was rendered even worse.\n  Mr. President, the bill which lies before us is in fact the Newt \nGingrich budget. After the drubbing the Republican Party took last year \nfor holding hostage the Government and those its services help as those \nRepublicans sought their scorched Earth budget at all costs, some of \nthe rougher edges have been slightly rounded, some of the more severe \nslashes have been moderated. But this is unmistakably a budget without \na heart, a budget that has no concept of investment for the future of \nour country and its people.\n  When we first considered the budget for the next fiscal year, I tried \nto improve the bill by restoring funds for environmental protection and \nconservation efforts, for education--the Gingrich budget marks the \nlargest education cut in history--and I tried to trim unnecessary \ndefense spending to the level requested by the President.\n  But then as now, the Republican Party has moved in lockstep to \nprevent us from providing services that the American people urgently \nneed.\n  As an alternative, the President's budget continues the sound \neconomic and fiscal policy put in place in 1993 which has halved the \ndeficit, kept interest rates and inflation low and created more than 8 \nmillion jobs. His budget is the right way to balance the budget.\n  But this resolution is shameful. The Gingrich budget continues the \nsmoke-and-mirror gimmicks vetoed by the President and rejected by the \nAmerican people. It slashes Medicare, cripples education programs, and \nopens tax loopholes for big corporations. This is the wrong way.\n  Despite continuous and strong economic news, American workers feel \ninsecure. Working families worry about their economic security; they \nworry about their retirement security. As I travel across \nMassachusetts, people tell me they are worried about their physical \nsafety and their ability to afford health care.\n  This Republican budget will only exacerbate this pervasive sense of \ninsecurity. At a time when we are fearful about the level of violent \ncrime and the need to conduct a real war on drugs, the Gingrich budget \nwould spend less in 1997 than was allocated in 1996 for crime \nprevention. At a time when Americans believe that their only chance to \nrealize the American dream is through education, the Republican budget \ngives education and training funding short shrift--$56 billion less \nthan the President's balanced budget. At a time when Americans look \ntoward their senior years and see an uncertain future, the Republican \nconference report slashes Medicare spending by $168 billion.\n  That is the wrong set of priorities for our Nation, for our economy, \nand for hard-working American families, Mr. President. I reject this \nconference report as I, the President and the American people rejected \nthe Republican plan last year, and as I rejected only 2 weeks ago this \nyear's Republican plan.\n  I hope my colleagues oppose the Republican conference report. We can \ndo better for the country and we ought to. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        wrong budget priorities\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the budget resolution conference report now \nbefore us once again reflects the impact\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\nof what I fear is an extreme conservative agenda that I believe is not \nshared by the majority of my constituents, or indeed of the Nation. I \ncannot support it.\n  I note at the outset that I was happy to support the bipartisan \ncentrist alternative budget that was offered last month by Senators \nChafee and Breaux. In my view, the alternative plan took a more \nmoderate approach based on a far more reasonable ranking of priorities.\n  I should also note that the budget resolution which passed the Senate \non May 23 was somewhat better than the pending conference report. \nAlthough I did not vote for the bill, I was pleased that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, added $5 \nbillion to discretionary spending, of which $1.7 billion was earmarked \nfor education.\n  Unfortunately, that enlightened step was quickly undone by the \nconferees, and the budget now before us resembles all too clearly last \nyear's ill-conceived and misguided reconciliation bill that resulted in \n2 Government shutdowns and 13 continuing resolutions. It is dismaying \nto contemplate a repetition.\n  The budget before us is all wrong, in my view. It continues the \npreposterous inconsistency of scheduling tax cuts and continuing tax \nbreaks while at the very same time purporting to move toward a balanced \nbudget. It pads the defense budget by more than $11 billion. And to \noffset these costly steps, it depends on excessive and unwise cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid as well as in welfare and education.\n  I am, of course, most particularly distressed by the cavalier and to \nmy mind dangerous treatment of the Federal investment in education, \nwhich this budget would cut by 20 percent across the board by 2002. The \nimpact would be felt at all levels of education, at a time when \nenrollments particularly at the secondary levels are climbing to \nhistoric highs.\n  At the college level, the Republican budget would cut the Pell grant \nprogram by $6.2 billion over 6 years. An estimated 1.3 million students \nwould lose Pell grants, and the value of the maximum grant would \ndecline by $400 per student.\n  College work study opportunities would be lost by 800,000 students by \n2002. The Direct Student Loan Program would be capped, forcing colleges \nand students out of the program. And national service would be cut, \ndenying opportunity to some 40,000 over the 6-year period.\n  At the secondary level, in fiscal year 1997 alone, the pending budget \nwill have a very harmful effect on several programs of proven merit:\n  Cuts in education for disadvantaged children would deny funding for \nmath and reading skills for some 344,000 children.\n  Safe and drug free school antidrug and antiviolence programs would be \ncut by $30 million next year.\n  Cuts in Head Start would deny preschool education to at least 12,500 \nchildren next year.\n  Funding under Goals 2000 would be cut for 500 schools helping 250,000 \nstudents meet higher education standards.\n  Reduction in funding for bilingual education would eliminate services \nfor some 38,000 students with limited proficiency in English.\n  Cuts in summer jobs for youth and dislocated workers assistance will \nresult in lost opportunities for skill enhancement for some 81,000 \nyoung people.\n   Mr. President, these reductions might have been justified if every \nlast dollar had been shaved from programs less essential than \neducation, or if national defense was seriously at risk or if every \ntaxpayer in the country was being taxed to the limit of his ability to \npay.\n  But the fact is that none of these conditions obtain. On the \ncontrary, this budget provides tax cuts and tax breaks that may reach \n$180 billion for the wealthiest individuals in the Nation while at the \nsame time cutting education programs by $25 billion,.\n  This is an unconscionable inversion of reasonable priorities and it \nought to be rejected out of hand. I can only hope that our successors \nwill bring a more enlightened and responsible attitude to the task.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise this morning in strong support of \nthe conference budget resolution. I believe it provides us yet another \nopportunity in the 104th Congress to put our Nation's budget on a path \ntoward balance, and does so in the spirit of compromise.\n  Mr. President, as if we needed any further proof of the difficulty we \nface in balancing the budget after 27 consecutive years of fiscally \nirresponsible behavior, the last year and a half has further \nhighlighted the challenges we face in achieving this goal. Even with an \noverwhelming majority in this Congress expressing strong support for a \nbalanced budget--indeed, 64 Members of this body even voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment just this past week--and a President \nexpressing the same support, we have still not enacted the legislation \nnecessary to put us on a path to balance.\n  If there is anything that we have learned during these past 17 \nmonths, it is that some measure of compromise will be needed by all of \nus in order to get to what we claim to be a shared goal. The Democratic \nParty may control the White House, but they do not control the \nCongress. By the same token, the Republican Party controls the \nCongress, but not with a margin sufficient to unilaterally override a \nPresidential veto. Therefore, with neither side having control \nsufficient to simply make happen whatever they would like, we are \nforced to exercise give-and-take if we truly wish to move forward at \nall.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the budget conference report that has \nbeen crafted demonstrates give-and-take, and is a sincere effort to \nforge a compromise before the 104th Congress adjourns sine die. By \ndoing so, this resolution gives us a chance to move the process \nforward. And through continued compromise in reconciliation, \nlegislation could then be enacted that would put us on a path toward \nbalance in 2002.\n  Therefore, I would like to commend the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Mr. Domenici, and all of the members of the House-Senate \nconference committee for their efforts in crafting this conference \nbudget resolution. Their willingness and ability to put together a \nbudget that strikes a compromise between the positions taken by the \nPresident and congressional leaders during months of often acrimonious \nnegotiations is a testament to their commitment to balancing the budget \nsooner rather than later.\n  Mr. President, during the debate on the Senate budget resolution just \nthis past month, I was part of a bipartisan group of Senators that \noffered an alternative budget resolution that split the differences on \ncontentious issues such as Medicare, Medicaid, and tax cuts. Although \nthat resolution was ultimately defeated by a narrow margin, it proved \nthat compromise was possible and that Republicans and Democrats could \nwork together and find common ground.\n\n  After the defeat of that bipartisan resolution, I voted in favor of \nthe budget resolution crafted by Senator Domenici because I felt it \noffered a sound and reasoned approach to balancing the budget--and \ncould also warrant bipartisan support. I regret that none of my \nDemocratic colleagues voted in favor of that resolution because I \nbelieved that it not only offered a fiscally responsible and realistic \npath to achieving balance in 6 years, but it also demonstrated the \nongoing commitment to compromise by the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici.\n  In an effort to gain support from Democrats as well as Republicans, \nChairman Domenici incorporated a variety of the bipartisan budget \ngroup's 7-year savings targets in his 6-year Senate budget resolution. \nNow, following negotiations with the House, the Chairman is again \npresenting us with a plan that contains many of these similar savings \ntargets. I therefore give this conference report my support--and am \nhopeful that my Democratic colleagues will reconsider their prior \nopposition to the Senate budget resolution.\n  To reach balance, the total level of savings derived in the most \ncontentious categories of the 1997 conference report are very similar \nto those contained in the bipartisan budget proposal. Specifically, the \nbipartisan budget assumed $154 billion of savings in Medicare, $62 \nbillion in Medicaid, $58 billion in welfare and the EITC, and\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\ncut taxes by $130 billion. In comparison, the conference report would \nslow the growth of Medicare by $158 billion over 6 years, slow Medicaid \ngrowth by $72 billion, derive savings of $70 billion from reforms to \nthe welfare and the EITC programs, and cut taxes by a net total of $122 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, despite these similarities, I am sure that there are \nthose who will criticize this conference budget resolution on the \ngrounds that the policies that back the numbers are wrong. I would \nsimply remind my colleagues that a budget resolution is a blueprint and \nnot a final package of policies for balancing the budget. The policies \nthat embrace these targets will be crafted during the reconciliation \nprocess. We will have ample time to debate the specific policies that \nachieve these targets in the coming months.\n  Still others will argue that the savings targets contained in the \n1997 conference report are unrealistic or hurtful. To those I would \nask: Is it hurtful to save the Nation's Medicare Program from \nbankruptcy? Is it unrealistic to believe that Medicaid and welfare can \nbe reformed in a manner that improves the delivery of services to those \nin need--especially the poor and elderly?\n  The answer to all of these questions is the same: ``Of course not.''\n  One striking example of the unjustified vilifying of this budget \nresolution is in the Medicare program. As we all learned from the \nMedicare trustees this past week, the Medicare trust fund is now \nexpected to go insolvent in 5 short years--which is 1 year less than we \nwere told just over 12 months ago--and perhaps in as quickly as 4 \nyears. We have a responsibility and an obligation to make the changes \nnecessary to ensure that this program--which provides essential health \ncare for millions of our Nation's senior citizens--be preserved for 10 \nyears.\n  Rather than embrace a broad budget goal for Medicare that would allow \nus to craft a package of reforms to preserve this program for 10 years, \nopponents contend that the President's plan --which contained real \nreforms that would only extend solvency of this trust fund for 1 \nadditional year --should be embraced. We owe it to our senior citizens \nof today--and to those of tomorrow--that this vital program will not be \nimperiled simply because it appeared to be a good ``wedge issue'' for \nan upcoming election.\n  By the same token, Mr. President, the entire balanced budget debate \nis not only about today, but also about tomorrow. We must never forget \nthat balancing the budget is not merely an exercise in national \naccounting, rather it is about improving the lives of every American \nboth now and in the future. Today, a balanced budget would mean \nimproved financial conditions for our Nation's workers and families by \nproviding for higher growth and lower interest rates. We would \neffectively be putting money in the bank accounts of working Americans \nbecause they would be paying less interest on their mortgages, less on \ntheir student loans, and less on their car loans.\n  At the same time, balancing the budget is about preserving the future \nby ensuring that our children and grandchildren would not be subjected \nto an 82-percent tax rate or a 50-percent cut in benefits to pay for \nour profligate spending today. Every generation of Americans has sought \nto provide a brighter economic future for the next--but our \nunwillingness to exercise self control today is imperiling this goal \nfor the generation of tomorrow.\n  I believe John F. Kennedy said it most succinctly: ``It is the task \nof every generation to build a road for the next generation.'' I do not \nbelieve that building this road for the next generation can be put off \nany longer. I do not believe that we can stand idly by while our \nchildren's inheritance is squandered.\n  This budget resolution provides us with an opportunity. An \nopportunity to forge a compromise now--not after the next election. We \nshould not allow the forces of politics to overcome the force of \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I support this budget agreement.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the finishing touches have been applied \nto the leadership's Presidential election year budget, and as many of \nus on both sides of the aisle feared, the cornerstone of that election \nyear budget is not balancing the books but cutting taxes.\n  Even the few fig leaves that were carefully placed on last year's \nbudget resolution have been removed. The special reserve fund from \nwhich tax cuts were to be funded only after CBO certified that we were \non a glidepath to a balanced budget has been removed.\n  Instead we have a Rube Goldberg construction of reconciliation bills, \nleading to a massive tax cut which, we are told, totals $122 billion, \nbut which might actually be closer to $180 billion if one believes the \nChairman of the other body's Budget Committee.\n  If anything, the conference version of the budget resolution provides \neven more opportunities for enacting a tax cut before the budget is \nbalanced. As I understand the conference report, Congress can now \nconsider tax cuts as part of the welfare-Medicaid reconciliation bill, \nor as part of a separate tax cut reconciliation bill. It is readily \napparent that the goal of this year's budget resolution is not to \nbalance the budget in 7 years, in 6 years, or even sooner.\n  The goal is to pass an election year tax cut.\n  Mr. President, the goal, and thus the budget as a whole, is entirely \npolitical--a defect that is not unique to this budget resolution. The \ntax cut bidding war that has been heating up for the past 2\\1/2\\ years \nis now white hot. The President is proposing tax cuts. The Republican \ncongressional leadership are proposing tax cuts. The GOP candidate for \nPresident is about to propose tax cuts. Even the bipartisan coalition \nof Senators proposed a significant tax cut as part of their own budget \nplan, though I think many in that coalition would have preferred no tax \ncuts at all until we balanced the budget.\n  Mr. President, every time you turn around you bump into somebody \nabout to propose a tax cut. Last week, the President proposed a $1,500 \neducation tax credit, and there are reports that he may propose a tax \nbreak for first-time homebuyers. The Republican congressional \nleadership is pushing a gas tax cut, and has also proposed an adoption \ntax credit and a series of business tax cuts. And the Republican \nPresidential nominee is expected to propose a significant tax cut, \nreportedly as much as a 15-percent across-the-board cut in income \ntaxes, a cut that would cost about $90 billion a year according to one \nreport.\n\n  Mr. President, we may need an environmental impact statement \nreviewing the loss of all those trees that will be used to make the \npaper for this blizzard of tax cut bills. The Washington Post took both \nPresidential candidates to task for their election year tax cut \nproposals. That June 4 editorial noted that ``both men know better,'' \nand went on to say that ``the candidates are moving, both of them, \nagainst what we persist in regarding as their own better instincts \ntoward a bidding war on taxes.''\n  Mr. President, I think that is a fair characterization.\n  I respect both President Clinton and Senator Dole, and I think they \nboth know better than to engage in this bidding war on taxes. It is \ndriven purely by political winds. With continuing budget deficits \nfacing the Nation, our focus must remain on balancing the budget, not \non cutting taxes.\n  This is true not only for the Federal budget as a whole, but also \nwithin the budget in areas such as Medicare. The recent report of the \nMedicare trustees came as no surprise. We have known for some time that \nthe Medicare trust fund would be insolvent in a few years, a projection \nthat has been all too common over the past 25 years.\n  We need to devote our economic resources toward stabilizing that \ntrust fund in the short term, and ensuring its solvency in the long \nterm. I regret that the path of this budget resolution is instead to \nfurther undermine that trust fund by putting tax cuts ahead of both \nbalancing the Federal budget and the long-term solvency of Medicare.\n  Mr. President, the bipartisan budget plan that was debated here last \nmonth also had this fatal flaw. That plan, which held much promise in \nso many areas, was fatally flawed by having to provide funding for a \ntax cut that was neither politically necessary nor fiscally \nresponsible. That it used as its funding source an across-the-board cut \nin Social Security COLA's not only frustrated the rest of the plan, it \nalso may have jeopardized efforts to reform\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\nthe Consumer Price Index which so many respected authorities maintain \noverstates the cost of living. Making a case that the CPI needs to be \nmodified will only suffer if the savings realized from reform are used \nto cut taxes rather than to secure the fiscal stability of Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, there was absolutely no need for that bipartisan plan \nto include a tax cut, and I very much hope that any future bipartisan \nactions which may flow from that important effort begin by dumping \nthose tax cuts and focusing every last dime of savings on balancing the \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I regret that so many have been infected by this tax \ncut fever. Its symptoms seem to cloud the mind. Even those who persist \nin believing the thoroughly disproven voo doo economics of the early \n1980's can find little on which to launch their arguments for a so-\ncalled pro-growth tax cut.\n  As some have noted, whether or not the ``pro-growth'' set believe in \nthose discredited policies, there is little doubt that the Federal \nReserve and the financial markets do not, and the effects of any tax \ncut that might be enacted would be countered in short order with an \noffsetting rise in interest rates.\n  Mr. President, we can barely cut taxes and balance the budget on \npaper, let alone actually putting such a plan into effect. Maintaining \nthe fiscal discipline needed to eliminate the deficit is hard enough \nfor Congress. Adding a tax cut on top of that goal is fiscally \nirresponsible.\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution invites mischief. It provides \nmultiple opportunities to stray from what must be our most important \neconomic goal, namely a balanced budget. And by opening up these new \nfronts, it further escalates a tax cut bidding war that is already \ngetting out of control.\n  Mr. President, we can expect a long, hot summer of tax cut proposals \nflying back and forth.\n  Mr. President, it may have appeal in some quarters, but the great \nbulk of the American people would much rather be dealt with honestly \nand responsibly. They know that you cannot balance the budget and cut \ntaxes at the same time. You have to choose one road or the other.\n  Mr. President, let us choose the road to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I come to the floor today to speak on \nthis budget conference report I am reminded of the immortal words of \nYogi Berra: ``It feels like deja vu all over again.''\n  Because, contrary to my colleagues' protestations of moderation, this \nconference report repeats the same mistakes of last year's failed \nbudget process, which twice shut the Government down. Last year's plan \ngutted Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment and was \nsoundly rejected by the American people and this conference report \nseems to be no different.\n  Frankly, I'm amazed that after the lessons of last year the \nRepublicans would try to hoodwink the American people into thinking \nthat they have changed their stripes. But this budget does just that by \npresenting the thin veneer of compromise and moderation, while at the \nsame time maintaining draconian spending cuts in America's priorities \nand tax cuts for Americans who don't need them.\n  But the American people will not be fooled. They learned long ago \nthat when it comes to the Republican's budget-cutting efforts, ``All \nthat glitters is not gold.''\n  Unfortunately, the only thing that shines in this budget is the \nrepetition of the same mistakes that gave us 13 continuing resolutions \nand 2 Government shutdowns last year.\n  For example, on Medicare this conference report calls for cuts of up \nto $168 billion. These reductions would leave seniors with an \nincreasingly second-class health care system. The enactment of the \naccompanying profound policy changes would leave the sickest and \npoorest Americans in a weakend and toothless Medicare program.\n  This conference report also represents a $123 billion reduction in \npart A. These cuts would limit beneficiary access to hospital health \nservices and limit payments to hospitals. These reductions could result \nin cost-shifting, affect quality and leave in serious jeopardy the \ncontinuing viability of many rural and urban hospitals.\n  But, Republicans don't stop with Medicare. Medicaid, too, would be \ngutted by $72 billion in cuts and block grants that would threaten this \nNation's guarantee to provide health care for children and the poor. In \nfact, under the Republicans' block grant approach, these Medicaid \nreductions could total $250 billion if States spend only the minimum \nrequired.\n  If this conference report were enacted, more than 36 million Medicaid \nbeneficiaries, including 18 million children, more than 6 million \npeople with disabilities and millions of older Americans who rely on \nMedicaid, would lose their guarantee of adequate health care.\n  But these Medicaid costs are an integral part of a conference report \nthat finds more than 42 percent of its savings by cutting priorities \nthat affect low-income Americans. Is this any way to balance the \nbudget--on the backs of America's poorest citizens while at the same \ntime including sizable tax cuts for wealthy Americans?\n  Additionally, I hear a lot of rhetoric from across the aisle about \nmoving Americans from welfare to work and making the opportunity of the \nAmerican Dream available to millions of Americans. Maybe one of my \nRepublican colleagues could explain to me how we are supposed to do \nthat when we're taking away the tools to make those dreams a reality?\n  In my opinion, there is no better example of the Republicans' \ninsensitive attitude to the working poor than their proposed cuts in \nthe earned income tax credit. [EITC].\n  Here we have a program that benefits millions of America's working \npoor that in the past has had sweeping bipartisan support and that \nprovides an essential lifeline for those Americans trying to escape \npoverty.\n  But, while most Americans would look at the earned income tax credit \nand say ``Here's a Government program that works,'' my Republican \ncolleagues look at the EITC and say, ``Here's a place to save money.'' \nThis is akin to raising taxes on the working poor.\n  At at time when growing wage inequalities threaten to segregate \nAmericans by economics, it is beyond my ability to understand how my \nRepublican colleagues could pass a conference report that raises taxes \non the working poor while cutting taxes for wealthy Americans. But, it \nseems those kind of skewed priorities have become the norm is this \nbody.\n  Additionally, this budget continues the Republican assault on \neducation and job training. The overwhelming desire of the American \npeople to see Congress maintain our national commitment to education \nhas led my Republican colleagues to increase funding. But, Americans \nwon't be fooled by these hollow increases.\n\n  In real terms,this conference report would mean $25 billion less in \neducation and training spending over the next 6 years. On the other \nhand, President Clinton understands the need for maintaining our \ncommitment to education and job training. That's why his budget \nincludes nearly $60 billion, more than the GOP budget, in new \ninvestments in priorities such as Head Start, Goals 2000, Pell grants, \nschool-to-work, summer jobs, and dislocated worker training.\n  The President's budget also maintains our national commitments to the \nenvironment and to crime fighting, which suffer serious blows under the \nGOP conference report.\n  For example, the Republican budget cuts nearly $4 billion, from the \nPresident's request for environmental priorities such as energy \nconservation and EPA enforcement and maintains the GOP commitment to \nopen up one of America's last great environmental treasures, the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, to oil and gas drilling.\n  On the crime front, while Republicans like to portray this President \nas soft on crime, it is Republicans who are actually cutting money that \nhelps keep our streets safe from the scourge of drugs and violent \ncrime. For example, the Violent Crime Reduction fund would see serious \ncutbacks and the total funding for the Administration of Justice \nfunction would be cut by more tan $2.5 billion than the President \nrequested.\n  Yet, at the same time they're cutting money for crime, education, the \nenvironment and job training, this conference report still finds enough \nmoney\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nto provide $11.3 billion more in defense funding than the Pentagon even \nrequested.\n  This additional, unrequested funding, along with another $60 billion \nboondoggle for a Star Wars missile system serves as a vivid reminder of \nwhere the priorities of my colleagues across the aisle lie. And to be \nhonest with this much in additional spending it's hard to take \nseriously Republican assertions that they truly want to balance the \nbudget.\n  There's an inherent hypocrisy in suggesting that on one hand we need \nto balance the budget--even amending the Constitution if need be--while \non the other hand calling for additional, unrequested defense spending \nand a repeal of the gas tax, which will only drive up the deficit.\n  What's more, these spending increases come on the heels of \nRepublicans' continued insistence that this Congress pass tax cuts for \nwealthy Americans who don't need them. Last year's budget devoted 47 \npercent of its tax cuts to people making more than $100,000 and there \nis little reason to believe that this year is any different.\n  Stop me if this agenda sounds familiar. As one of the 11 Senators to \nvote against the 1991 Reagan budget plan that cut taxes, raised defense \nspending and plunged this Nation into deeper and deeper debt the \nsimilarities are all too familiar.\n  It was that plan that brought this Nation to the point we're at \ntoday. If we hadn't exploded the deficit during the 1980s this debate \nwould not necessary. But, it seems some people never learn.\n  If my Republican colleagues were truly intent on balancing the budget \nin a fair and equitable manner they might want to look down \nPennsylvania Avenue to the White House.\n  President Clinton has presented a budget that puts our fiscal house \nin order while protecting our values and priorities as a Nation. But, \nit seems Republicans are more intent on playing politics with this \nissue, rather than taking up the President's offer to continue the \nnegotiations.\n  This conference report puts us in the wrong direction toward \ncompromise, but more importantly it puts us on the wrong path toward \nmaking a better future for our children. It is my intention to vote \nagainst this conference report and I urge all my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, to reject it as well.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nthat the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution alters my sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment in a way that completely changes the intent of the \namendment agreed to by 57 Senators.\n  In February I introduced legislation that would create a dedicated \ntrust fund for Amtrak. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I reported \nout this legislation with the support of my colleagues on both sides of \nthe isle. On the budget resolution I offered a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that expressed support for this legislation--for direct \nfunding for Amtrak--and it was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate.\n  While my sense-of-the-Senate amendment received strong support in the \nSenate, my amendment was drastically changed while in conference with \nthe House. My amendment was supported by 57 Senators who voted for \ndirect funding for capital improvements to Amtrak. My legislation would \nhave been offset according to the budget rules, therefore, it would not \nhave had an affect on the deficit. It would fund Amtrak without raising \ntaxes, without increasing the deficit, and without cutting funding for \nother forms of transportation.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was modified in conference. The modified \nversion of my amendment would only create an authorization, with no \ndirect spending for Amtrak. These are two different amendments with two \ndifferent meanings. However, only my amendment was voted on by the full \nSenate and only my amendment received overwhelming support from this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, the 57 Senators that voted in favor of direct spending \nknew what they were voting on. These Members know that if Amtrak is to \nsurvive, it will need direct spending to make the needed capital \nimprovements and upgrades to equipment and shops. They also know that \nanother authorization will not help Amtrak secure the money needed for \nlong term capital investments.\n  What Amtrak needs and what the Senate voted on is direct funding for \ncapital improvements. I conclude by expressing my profound \ndisappointment that the conference report for the fiscal year 1997 \nbudget resolution does not reflect the will of the Senate on this \nissue.\n  Let me also point out that my preference for the overall budget \nresolution would have been the lower discretionary levels as contained \nin the House-passed version of the budget resolution.\n  Thank you Mr. President and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know there is a lot of redundancy in \nwhat we all say around here, and certainly I have tried to make these \npoints before, but we had quite a discussion this morning debating the \nbudget resolution. During that time, I guess one of the most eloquent \nSenators in the history of this body, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, \nhad some comments that I want to respond to.\n  One was he commented on the mistake that he made when he voted for \ntax cuts back in the 1980's. I suggest that there is a basic difference \nin philosophy. I hope it came out. I think people have to weigh this on \ntheir own.\n  I can remember, in 1992, a quote I attribute to Laura Tyson, the \nchief economic adviser to President Clinton, who said, ``There is no \nrelationship between the level of taxation that a nation pays and its \nproductivity.'' I think that is the crux of where we are now in our \ndebate, whether it is about the balanced budget amendment or just a \nbalanced budget. If you really believe that, then I can understand why \npeople would not want to have tax cuts and why they would vote the way \nthey do.\n  But I have to remind the distinguished Senator that there is no \nperiod of time in history when we had greater tax cuts than there was \nin the 1980's. That is when we had our marginal rates coming down so \ndramatically. In 1980, the total revenues for Government were $517 \nbillion. In 1990, it was $1.03 trillion. It doubled in that period of \ntime. During that period of time, we had the greatest tax decreases of \nany 10-year period in America's history. The revenues from marginal \nrates went, in 1980, from $244 to $466 billion.\n\n  That is where the basic difference of opinion is. People want to have \nmore of their money to invest. For each 1 percent increase in the \neconomy, it develops an additional $26 billion of new funds.\n  The distinguished Senator from West Virginia said--and this is a \nquote, I wrote it down--he said, ``The people of America are going to \nwake up and say we are tired of cutting domestic discretionary \nprograms.'' I think that is a basic difference of opinion among many of \nus here. I think perhaps the majority of us do not believe that. We \nthink the people of America are not tired of cutting domestic programs. \nThey are tired of tax increases. They are tired of deficit increases. \nThey are tired of having their children and their grandchildren born \ninto an environment where they immediately inherit a $19,000 debt, and \nif we do not do something to change it, they will end up having to pay \n82 percent of their entire lifetime income just to support Government.\n  Another thing that was said was said by the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Dakota, who again used the ``S'' word, I call it, star wars. \nI have to say, and I firmly believe it--I am on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and the Intelligence Committee and I was on the same \ncommittees over in the House of Representatives--I believe there is a \ngreater threat facing America today than there has been, certainly, \nsince World War II, maybe since the Revolutionary War: the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, and the \nlack of defense against delivery of those weapons. As the distinguished \nPresiding Officer knows, because he is on the same committees I am, we \nare in an environment where we have had slashes in the military budget \nfor 12 consecutive years. So now we are essentially where we were in \nbuying power in 1980 when we could not afford spare parts.\n  So I think it is doing a disservice to the American people to use \nsuch terms as star wars. When you realize it is not\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n$70 or $80 or $90 billion, we are talking about an investment that the \nAmerican people have made in national missile defense today of about \n$50 billion. Just take the Aegis ships, 22 Aegis ships, already paid \nfor, already floating, that have launching capability, all we have to \ndo is spend about $4 billion more to give them the capability of \ngetting into the upper tier to give us the defense system that we have \nto have.\n  We have rogue nations, as James Woolsey said, some 25 to 30 rogue \nnations, nations that have weapons of mass destruction, not the obvious \nones of Russia and China and North Korea, but Iran, Iraq, and all the \nother nations, Syria, Libya. I think about the war that took place, the \nPersian Gulf war, where Saddam Hussein said, ``If we could have waited \nfor 5 more years before we invaded Kuwait, we would have been able to \nhave the missile capability of delivering a weapon of mass destruction \nat the United States of America.'' This is coming from a guy who \nmurdered his own grandchildren, so we are not talking about normal \npeople who think like we do.\n  So I would say I wanted to respond to those two statements made by \nthose two very distinguished Senators from West Virginia and from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairman of our committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point an article in the Wall Street Journal of June 6 entitled, \n``A Tax Cut Trap,'' by the distinguished journalist Albert R. Hunt.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 6, 1996]\n\n                            The Tax Cut Trap\n\n                          (By Albert R. Hunt)\n\n       [No matter how many consultants told him to make his \n     message more upbeat . . . no one could ever convince Dole \n     that deficits would simply ``grow away.'' Bobby Joe Dole grew \n     up in Russell, Kansas. He saw people die from debt.--From \n     ``Bob Dole,'' a 1992 biography by Richard Ben Cramer.]\n\n       Bobby Joe Dole is on the verge of an epiphany on huge tax \n     cuts aimed at helping the federal budget deficit simply grow \n     away, according to Republican bigwigs who are prodding him in \n     that direction. Running 16 points behind President Clinton, \n     they want their nominee to return to those salad days when \n     the GOP won elections by promising to cut taxes for \n     everybody.\n       If a tax exists, Sen. Dole is being urged to cut it, \n     ranging from lower capital gains rates to bigger write-offs \n     for personal savings and donating to charities that help the \n     poor. Overlaying this would be the big ticket: either an \n     across-the-board 15% reduction in income taxes or a flatter \n     income tax with only a few politically necessary exemptions.\n       The total tab over seven years could reach three-quarters \n     of a trillion dollars, or three times as much as the huge \n     GOP-drafted tax cut that played such a pivotal role in \n     unraveling the Republican's budget plans this Congress.\n       Sen. Dole, who undoubtedly will propose a major tax \n     reduction plan, probably in July, is more cautious than those \n     giving him advice. And for good reason; skeptical voters may \n     spot the fallacies in this supposed free lunch:\n       (1) It would be sayonara both to the centerpiece of the \n     Republican revolution, a balanced budget, and to deficit \n     cutting, a hallmark of Sen. Dole's 36-year congressional \n     career (which is slated to end next Tuesday).\n       The Kansas Republican's contempt for supply-side tax \n     cutters in the 1980s was legendary. In 1992 he assailed a \n     proposed Bush tax cut as ``bad medicine,'' and last year he \n     was quoted as saying that in the 1980s the tax cutters said, \n     `` `Everything's going to be fine.' Well . . . it wasn't. You \n     see how the debt went up during those years.''\n       Dole advisers insist he'll accompany tax reductions with \n     spending cutbacks, likely to include tax loophole closings \n     too, and they note there'll be some stimulus effect of the \n     massive tax cuts. But a quick glance at last year's budget \n     battle shows just how tough this is. To finance a $245 \n     billion tax cut the Republicans had to propose politically \n     unpopular cutbacks in Medicare and slash so many social \n     service programs that cumulatively their plan amounted to an \n     assault on the poor. The conservative House Democrats, the \n     so-called Blue Dogs, have proposed a federal budget that \n     would balance in six years with no tax cut.\n       (2) The economic rationale for these cuts is full of snake \n     oil. Proponents contend that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts \n     produced a surge in revenues--rising, in real terms, an \n     average of 3.8% a year from 1982 to 1989--and that the 1993 \n     Clinton-engineered tax increase was a disaster.\n       Tax revenues did rise in the 1980s for one primary reason: \n     Payroll taxes were boosted six times during that period, and \n     rose an average of 4.8% from 1982 to 1989. Individual income \n     tax revenues rose only an average of 2.2% and most of that \n     was after passage of the 1986 tax reform act.\n       Since the 1993 act, tax revenues have risen 4.8% a year. \n     Back in 1993 Republicans warned of the dire consequences of \n     that deficit reduction/tax hike legislation. Newt Gingrich \n     said it would ``lead to a recession . . . and will actually \n     increase the deficit.'' Rep. Dick Armey (R., Texas) called it \n     a ``job killer.'' Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) was even more \n     apocalyptic.\n       Here are the facts: The unemployment rate today is 5.4%; \n     three years ago it was 7.1%. Since August 1993, seven million \n     new jobs have been created, and the budget deficit has been \n     more than cut in half to $130 billion. The Dow Jones \n     Industrial Average has soared more than 2000 points, with \n     relatively low inflation and interest rates.\n       (3) Under the proposed tax plans, the GOP can forget about \n     emphasizing income inequality or the lagging middle class, \n     issues that featured so prominently in the early primary \n     contests.\n       When Sen. Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.) and others complain \n     that individual taxes have risen 25% under the Clinton \n     administration, they omit some pertinent particulars. The \n     1993 tax increase raised tax rates for only the wealthiest \n     1.2% of Americans. That legislation also included a tax cut \n     for 15 million poor workers and their families. The average \n     federal income tax rate for the typical family of four today \n     is lower than it was four years ago, and lower than during \n     much of the Reagan administration.\n       The Republican tax proposals being urged on Bob Dole--\n     despite some window dressing--would amount to a considerable \n     redistribution of income to the more affluent. If the \n     Republican nominee opts for a flatter, two-tier tax, remember \n     he already has vowed to retain the home mortgage deduction, \n     charitable write-offs and deductions for state and local \n     taxes. Thus he is left with three choices: (a) adopt rates so \n     high that his plan loses any political appeal; (b) bust the \n     budget; or (c) sock it to the middle class. More than 47% of \n     the benefits of a 15% across-the-board cut would go to \n     individuals making over $100,000 a year; less than 8% would \n     go to people making less than $30,000.\n       Yeah, some Republicans counter, but the Republican nominee \n     is so far behind he needs to try something audacious: \n     Moreover, they relish the idea of switching the political \n     terrain to a fight with President Clinton over tax cuts. One \n     example: Privately, Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin--once a \n     towering figure on Wall Street--is telling the president the \n     evidence is that a capital gains tax cut would do little to \n     stimulate the economy. Political strategist Dick Morris--with \n     no experience in either tax policy or economics--is \n     whispering it could undercut the Republicans and appeal to \n     contributors. The Republicans figure the president will side \n     with the politics and then they can outbid him.\n       But the GOP confidence that the tax issue always works to \n     their advantage may be outdated. It may be more like generals \n     who are always fighting the last war, even in the face of \n     changing circumstances. Few voters love paying taxes, but \n     polls suggest taxes are not a high priority for the vast \n     majority of Americans.\n       Bob Dole hopes to capitalize on the character issue. Yet \n     he's about to present a whopping tax cut that would be \n     antithetical to much of what he has championed for years. \n     This may gain Mr. Dole some previously skeptical converts, \n     but he risks losing something far more valuable in this \n     contest: his credibility.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have been so frustrated in trying to \nget the truth out. I am not amazed that colleagues on the floor differ \nwith my views on a tax cut, but my frustration has been with the \nmedia's coverage of this issue. When I find the truth I want to include \nit in the Record, and this is not only a very, very good analysis of \nthe false promise of a tax cut, but also outstanding advice for our \ndistinguished friend, Senator Dole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHollings' time be charged to the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of our time.\n  I am not sure I am going to have a chance, just before the vote, to \nthank people, but I want to thank Senator Exon. His last budget \nresolution and conference agreement is this one. Members of the Budget \nCommittee come and go, but he has been a member since the 96th \nCongress, January 1979, when it was then chaired by Senator Muskie.\n  I want to recognize other departing members of the Budget Committee:\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\n Senator Bennett Johnston, who has been a member of the committee since \nJanuary 1975, the 95th Congress, when it was under the chairmanship of \nSenator Muskie--19 years on the committee; Senator Simon of Illinois, a \nmember of the Budget Committee since the 100th Congress, January 1987, \nwhen Senator Chiles was chairman, and a member on the House Budget \nCommittee, also, when he served there; and, finally, Senator Brown from \nColorado, a dedicated member of the committee who has been on this \ncommittee for a short period of time, comparatively speaking, during \nall his tenure with us in the Senate. His tenure began in the 102d \nCongress, in January 1991.\n  I thank each of the Senators for his distinguished service and hard \nefforts with reference to the budget.\n  Senator Exon, in your absence I had extended my congratulations and \nappreciation to you and including other members who are leaving the \nBudget Committee in my congratulations.\n  I understand, Senator Exon, that you have 10 minutes remaining. We \nhave essentially 20 minutes at this point. I am trying to find out if \nRepublicans are meeting, in which event I will leave for a while, but \nwe will try to arrange the last 20 minutes in some kind of sequence. I \nhave not had a chance to talk to our leader, but I am hopeful since you \nwould have 10 of that 20, we would at that point presumably have 10, \nthat we might divide it up in some kind of equal proportions, with the \nmajority obviously being entitled to the last 5 minutes of any such \narrangement. I am unable to do that for a while, but I hope you \nunderstand that is my intention.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question? We certainly want to \naccommodate all parties as best we can. We had earlier assumed that we \nwould have a vote at 12. Is that still the intention?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely. I think that is the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. EXON. Therefore, as I understand it, we have 10 minutes left and \nwe are to use that 10 minutes under the unanimous consent from 11:40 to \n11:50, and then you, the majority, would have the last 10 minutes, is \nthat the understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not know if that is the consent agreement. We can \nask the Presiding Officer. What does the consent agreement says in \nterms of the allocation of the last 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Exon will have from 11:40 to 11:50, \nunder the previous unanimous consent.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What we are trying to do is do you a little better than \nthat. When I get hold of Senator Lott, if there are four speakers who \nwant to wrap up, I am hoping to have them speak for 5 minutes each, not \nthe full 10 first, but 5 from you and 5 from us.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection to that whatever. I thank my colleague \nfrom New Mexico. All these years we have worked on the committee \ntogether we have had an exceptionally fine relationship. He has always \nbeen kind and understanding before he was in the leadership position, \nand he has been even more kind and more understanding since he has been \nmy chairman of the Budget Committee. I thank him for his fine remarks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask the time be charged to the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I propose the following unanimous \nconsent request. I ask unanimous-consent that at 11:40, Senator Exon be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes, to be followed by Senator Domenici from \nNew Mexico for up to 5 minutes, to be followed by the Democratic leader \nfor up to 5 minutes, with the majority leader recognized for the final \n5 minutes prior to the vote on the adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the budget resolution \nconference report advanced by our Republican colleagues. I do so, not \nbecause I object to implementing plans for a balanced Federal budget. \nMy commitment to that objective remains unshakeable. I oppose this plan \nbecause it is tied to a political agenda, not a substantive one, and \nbecause it opens the door to huge tax cuts even before we make and lock \nin the tough principled choices necessary to actually balance the \nbudget. The sad truth about this plan is that its proponents know it \nwill be vetoed by the President, and budget gridlock will continue. \nThis whole exercise is not about balancing the budget, which I have \ndone everything I can to advance on a bipartisan basis. It's about \npolitical positioning for this fall's election. I know of no precedent \nunder either party's control of Congress for the present course we are \nfollowing.\n  This budget proposal has split up the reconciliation process into \nthree different bills. The first bill will encompass both Medicaid and \nwelfare reform. While the President has indicated his willingness to \nenact a welfare reform bill this year, this budget resolution calls for \nthe attachment of a Medicaid reform plan that our Republican colleagues \nknow the President will veto. By combining these elements into the same \npackage, the Republican majority precludes any chance for positive \naction on welfare reform this year.\n  The second reconciliation bill is directed at reform of the Medicare \nProgram. Given the recent report of the trustees, action is clearly \nneeded to address the finances of the program. While the Republicans \ndeserve credit for tackling this issue head on, the fact of the matter \nis that the actions they have proposed for shoring up Medicare's \nfinances threaten the effective delivery of the very health care \nservices to our seniors that they say they want to preserve.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the proposed reductions in \nMedicare, Medicaid, and welfare wouldn't have to be as large if they \nweren't needed to finance a large tax cut at a time we're trying to \nbalance the budget, and their refusal to consider an adjustment to the \nconsumer price index in order to spread the burden of deficit reduction \nmore equitably across the entire Federal budget may be good politics \nbut it's not good policy.\n  Not only are the reductions in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare \nprograms unneccessarily large in this budget proposal, we are going to \nhave to vote on discretionary spending levels in this resolution which \nare both unwise as a matter of policy, and unattainable politically. \nWhile the conference committee has attempted to provide a sufficient \namount for fiscal year 1997, not a single appropriator, from either \nside of the aisle, can tell you how those out-year numbers can be \nachieved which means that the pressure of future Congresses to ignore \nthe proposed restraints will be overpowering--and most of the savings a \nsham.\n  Mr. President, the events of the past year have confirmed that the \nonly way to solve our major fiscal problems, both short term and long \nterm, is on a bipartisan basis. The difficulty is that enacting a \ncredible, fair, and bipartisan budget proposal will require tough \nmedicine for both sides. Republicans will have to come down on their \ndemands for tax cuts, and Democrats will have to be more willing to \nconfront entitlment reform, including Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I have been fortunate this past year to work with a \ngroup of bipartisan Senators, dubbed the centrist coalition, to produce \na credible balanced budget proposal--a proposal with a realistic \ndiscretionary spending\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\npattern, one with significant entitlement reform which continues to \nprotect our most vulnerable citizens, and one which makes a justified \nmodifcation of the consumer price index. This plan, offered as a \nsubstitute during the consideration of the current budget resolution, \nwas the only proposal to receive significant bipartisan support this \nyear, garnering 24 Democratic votes and 22 Republican votes.\n  While I cetainly understand the inability to move this proposal this \nyear given election year politics, I am hopeful that it will provide \nthe seeds for an effective compromise early in the next Congress since \nthe budget resolution before us does not move us any closer toward \nlong-term balanced budgets than we are today.\n  Mr. President, I am very frustrated by the process that we are \nengaged in at the moment. We have an opportunity, if we can work on a \nbipartisan basis, to advance the cause of a balanced budget and fiscal \nresponsibility, and we are missing that opportunity.\n  I, for one, am prepared to make substantial reductions in spending in \nthe entitlement areas--in Medicaid, in Medicare and in Social Security. \nI am also prepared to address the very politically sensitive area of \nadjustments to the Consumer Price Index to more accurately reflect \ninflation. But at this point, we are not going to do that.\n  The current resolution is designed to split the reconciliation \nprocess into three different pieces. The most objectionable part, from \nmy point of view, is we put tax cuts right up at the front so that we \nundermine any public confidence that we are really serious about \ndeficit reduction.\n  We are making bigger reductions in the projected spending in some of \nthe entitlements than we need to because we are planning to put that \nmoney into a tax cut before we have actually locked in the tough, \nprincipled choices that are going to be necessary if we are going to \nachieve the stated objective of a balanced budget.\n  This resolution also substantially reduces the chance of ever getting \nany meaningful welfare reform in this Congress by linking Welfare \nreform with a Medicaid reform package that the President is committed \nto vetoing.\n  It seems to me that we ought to be able to get together; indeed, 24 \nDemocrats and 22 Republicans found common cause with respect to a \nbudget resolution that was submitted earlier. If we are serious about \nsolving this particular problem, the Resolution before us is not the \nway to do it.\n  So, Mr. President, I regret very much that I am going to have to vote \nagainst the pending measure, notwithstanding my long-term commitment to \ndeficit reduction and a balanced budget.\n  For the opportunity to express my views, I thank the Presiding \nOfficer and I thank the ranking member of the Budget Committee for \nsuggesting this approach for getting my views on the record.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the Senator from \nNebraska, and under the previous unanimous consent agreement, he is to \nbe recognized now for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 6 minutes.\n  I make a unanimous-consent request I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I spoke yesterday on \nthe budget, and I will not reiterate that. I wanted to make a very \nbrief statement about two issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6167-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BURNING OF CHURCHES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have seen in recent weeks a series of \nattacks on black churches in the south. At least 33 churches have been \nset ablaze in a campaign of terror.\n  Mr. President, every one of us has to make his or her voice heard in \nopposition to this wave of terror. These churches have been sources of \nstability, of kindness, of moral and spiritual guidance for their \ncongregations.\n  These fires are a chilling reminder of a period that we all thought \nhad passed. A period marked by some of the most shameful, hateful acts \never perpetrated by Americans against Americans. A period in which \nbombings, fires, beatings, and shootings were tools to prevent African-\nAmericans from realizing equal status in our society. A ``dark era in \nour Nation's history,'' the President recently called it.\n  I want to praise President Clinton for his leadership in mobilizing \nFederal investigators while at the same time offering solace to the \npeople whose churches have been burned. It is the business of the \npresident to offer moral leadership, to console the victims of racists \nattacks, to call the cowards out for what they have done.\n  I also praise Ross Perot for his leadership in calling on his Reform \nParty members to guard the churches.\n  I also wish to praise Senator Moseley-Braun for offering a \nresolution, of which I am a cosponsor, condemning the church fires and \nurging the administration to mobilize all appropriate resources to put \nthe people who set these fires behind bars.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to state that this is a problem not \njust for African-Americans, but for all Americans. We should speak with \none voice and pass the Moseley-Braun resolution unanimously, so that \nour message is clear.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, as we wrap up the debate on the budget \nconference report, I would like to make a few final observations, if I \nmight.\n  If last year was the Republicans' winter of discontent, this is their \nspring of missed opportunities. I know the Republicans wanted to hit \none out of the ballpark with this budget, but what they did reminds me \nmore of the Red Sox's Bill Buckner in the infamous 6th game of the 1986 \nWorld Series. That is when he let Mookie Wilson's grounder roll through \nhis legs. The Mets rallied and eventually won the series. That was a \nmissed opportunity on a grand scale; so is this budget.\n  There was a chance--granted a small one--to craft a compromise on a \nbalanced budget this year. To his credit, the President has repeatedly \noffered to come back to the bargaining table. As he has pointed out, at \nthe very least, we could have agreed on the common\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nsavings in both the Republican and the Democratic plans. But the \nRepublicans rebuffed the President, and now we are saddled with this \nGOP budget retread.\n  It still has too many reductions in Medicare--reductions that are not \nnecessary to maintain the solvency of the trust fund. As much as the \nRepublicans bridle at the suggestion, the size of the tax breaks always \nhas and still does determine the size of the Medicare reductions. The \nMedicaid provisions still jeopardize the guarantees to health for our \nmost vulnerable citizens. The cuts to education and the environment are \nstill too severe, and they got worse in this conference report.\n  So much time has passed since we first saw this Republican budget 18 \nmonths ago, and so little has really changed. We can see from this same \ntired budget that the majority's cupboard is bare; they are bereft of \nnew ideas. This conference report is just a sorry addendum to last \nyear's budget fiasco. I think we all know it, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote against it.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me thank all of the members of the \nBudget Committee on both sides, of which the distinguished presider of \nthe Chair is one. On my side of the aisle, I have had nothing but \ncooperation from all the Democrats on the Budget Committee, and I \nparticularly thank all of them for all of their efforts.\n  I want to take just a moment, if I can, to thank Bill Dauster, who \nheads up our great staff on this side of the committee. We worked well \nwith the other side and staff as well.\n  I simply say, while we do not agree on this budget, there has been a \nlot of good-faith effort and good intentions to try to work this out \nthe best we could. I am sorry that we do not have a better product.\n\n  I reserve any balance of my time that I have.\n  May I inquire of the Chair, do I have any time left of my 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute, 30 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One and a half minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, although we have \nhad very great difficulty this morning in coming to an agreement in \nbreaking it, that those who are scheduled to make speeches at this \ntime, to call to their attention time is running out. I will suggest at \nthis time the absence of a quorum, and that the first 3 minutes of the \nquorum would be charged equally to the time remaining on both sides. I \nwithdraw my request. The chairman of the committee has arrived on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry I was late. I apologize to the Senate. How \nmuch time does the Senator from New Mexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes, 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, as I have said frequently, if I were a king I would \nnot write this budget. But we do not have any kings in the United \nStates. We have a U.S. Congress. That means we have Senators from very \ndifferent States. That is the way our Founding Fathers decided to run \nthis Republic. And there are very differing views, even among \nRepublicans and certainly among Democrats and Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  I believe, however, that other than having some kind of mandate from \non high on how to do it, I believe this is as good as we can do this \nyear. And to tell you the truth, I have been at budgeting for a long \ntime. For those who would call this a budget that perhaps does not \nreduce spending enough, or counts on too many things happening next \nyear and the year after that, let me suggest, it would be beyond the \ncomprehension of the Senate 10 years ago to think they could vote up or \ndown and pass a budget resolution with this much savings in it.\n  We have never come to grips with the real problems. And this budget \nresolution at least says, ``We know the problems. We know we can't \ncontinue this deficit spending. And let's try it this way.''\n  As I said, it is not perfect, but it takes the main problems with \ndeficit spending, the big ones that everybody knows about, and it \nbegins to say, ``Let's try to spend less. Let's try to send some of \nthem closer to home where more efficiencies can be adopted.''\n  It says to Medicaid, which is burgeoning beyond what the States will \nbe able to pay, ``Let's ratchet it down. Let it increase, but not as \nmuch as it would. Let the States make some decisions to see if they \ncan't save significant amounts of money and still cover our poor people \nwith health care.''\n  On welfare reform it is not only saying we are spending too much, it \nis saying the program is broken. Let us do a new one, give the States \nmore authority, and build it around the premise of 5 years instead of a \nlifetime on welfare; and those who are on welfare have to get educated \nand work at preparing to get a job, and then get jobs. That is doing \nwhat the American people want.\n  Ten years ago if that were all the reform we had in the budget we \nwould have been heralding it as something great for America. In \naddition, we try to make Medicare solvent for 10 years without hurting \nsenior citizens.\n  Our budget also recognizes that in addition to a deficit up here, \nthere is a deficit in the checkbook of working Americans. Especially \nthose with children. Their taxes are too high and their credits for \nhaving to raise children are too low. So we say, let us fix one other \ndeficit. Let us fix the deficit in the checkbooks of working men and \nwomen who have children under 18. Let us give them a $500 tax break for \neach child that they are raising. This is a deficit that is going to \ndestroy family life unless we work at trying to solve it.\n  We have left only 122 billion dollars' worth of tax relief in this \nbudget. Most of it will go to that cause. I think when you add it all \nup--and one salient point, that for all of the discretionary spending, \nwe are at a freeze. We have asked the Congressional Budget Office, how \nmuch should we spend in 1997 if we want to spend at a freeze level? \nThey gave us the dollar numbers, and that is what we settled with the \nU.S. House in conference.\n  So hopefully we will get appropriations done and we can tell \nAmericans we have frozen it. We have not increased it, and we have not \ncut it. That is a pretty good approach to a year when you really say \nyou are trying to balance the budget. When you add that all up, it \nseems to me this budget resolution not only deserves a majority vote, \nbut I am very hopeful that the President will sign much of the \nlegislation that comes from it because I think we have the right \nmessage. We are delivering in a way that is good for Americans, be they \nyoung or old or those who are out there working to make sure their \nchildren and their seniors are taken care of. It is a good budget. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Exon. \nThis will be the last budget he works on in his capacity as ranking \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee. I must say no one has put more \neffort, more work, and more real leadership into this whole process \nthan has he over the last many years. He is an extraordinary member of \nthe caucus. It has been my good fortune to work with him very closely \nand, fortunately, with great effectiveness as a result of his \nparticipation. I thank him, not only for his work in this Congress, but \nfor all the years that he has worked so diligently as a very key member \nof the Budget Committee.\n  Let me also commend his excellent staff, led by Staff Director Bill \nDauster, for the outstanding work they have done in presenting our case \non this budget and throughout the many difficult budget battles in this \nCongress. They do exemplary staff work, and they have served this \nSenator, and indeed our entire caucus and the American people, with \ndistinction and intelligence.\n  Let me also thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. \nHe works diligently and with passion and conviction. I oftentimes \nremark about the real contribution he makes. I may find myself in \ndisagreement with him on many occasions, but not with him personally. \nHe carries out his duties admirably. I commend him for his work.\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\n  In this case, Mr. President, in spite of his leadership, the fact is \nthat he proposes to move this process in the wrong direction. He and \nhis colleagues have produced a budget that is designed to appear more \nmoderate, but it contains the same failed policies that the President \nwas forced to veto last winter.\n  In fact, this budget, in spite of all of the good work and rhetoric \nof the distinguished chairman, contains the same extreme proposals \nrelating to Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and the \nother issues we debated so vociferously last winter. It is just as \nextreme if you follow it out to take into account the 7-year budget \ntimeframe that we had to work with last year. The numbers are hardly \ndifferent. So no one should be misled. This is almost identical to what \nwe were presented last year. Because of the extreme and harmful \npolicies it contains, the President had to veto it last year.\n  The President has offered a plan that balances the budget without \nresorting to such extremism. The deficit as a result of his efforts and \nour efforts over the last 4 years has been cut by more than half. The \ndeficit was $290 billion in 1992. The deficit this year is $130 \nbillion. For 4 years in a row, the first time since the 1940's, we have \ncut the deficit dramatically. This resulted from real leadership, and \nbecause we did what we said we were going to do.\n  This deficit will actually go back up under the Republican budget \nplan for the next 2 years. So instead of this hyperbole and instead of \nall of the partisan rhetoric, we ought to be negotiating downtown with \nthe White House, sitting down with the President and the bipartisan \ncongressional leadership, and finding an agreement that will balance \nthe budget by 2002.\n  Instead, as is often the case in this Congress, Democrats have been \nlocked out: locked out of the budget negotiations, locked out of the \nbudget process almost entirely, and locked out of any real effort to \ntry to resolve these matters in a bipartisan way.\n  There are many problems with this budget. But I want to cite very \nbriefly just six.\n  First of all, this budget reveals again what is really at the heart \nof the Republican priority list: more tax breaks for those who do not \nneed them. The conference agreement drops any pretense of balancing the \nbudget before it provides for the opportunity to propose tax cuts. At \nleast in the Senate bill the tax cuts were contingent on the passage of \ntwo other bills which actually cut the deficit and achieved balance.\n\n  The reconciliation prescription in this budget conference report does \nnot even do that. The conference agreement drops all contingencies. It \nproposes that major tax reduction proposals for those at the very \nhighest income levels be dealt with in the very first reconciliation \npackage that comes before the Senate.\n  The first bill could be a $122 billion net tax cut in addition to the \ndeep cuts in Medicaid and welfare. The actual tax breaks, Mr. \nPresident, will actually add up to $180 billion in that bill, according \nto the Chairman of the Budget Committee in the other body.\n  This arrangement will force a veto. It is designed to include \ndevastating Medicaid cuts that will act as a poison pill. There is no \ndoubt in my view that the tax cuts that we are going to be confronted \nwith are the same kind that created the deficit. Just after we have \nbeen able to deal so effectively with the deficit over the last 4 years \nis no time to turn back the clock and propose budget-busting tax breaks \nbefore any serious effort to cut the deficit.\n  So that is problem No. 1: approving tax cuts before we actually make \nroom for them; tax cuts in many cases that are not necessary; tax cuts \nthat are going to drive up the deficit all over again in the not-too-\ndistant future.\n  The second problem is the excessive Medicare cuts that we all know \nare incorporated in this plan. The tax cuts, in large measure, to the \nextent they are paid for at all, are paid for out of Medicare \ncuts, $168 billion in Medicare cuts. We know these deep cuts will lower \nquality of health care provided to millions of seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities. We know they threaten the solvency of many rural \nhospitals, who may be forced close their doors. We know they will \nundercut the ability of many beneficiaries to gain access to care, and \nwe know they will create real problems for many who obtain their health \nonly through the Medicare system today.\n\n  Mr. President, these issues will go away. They must be addressed in a \ncomprehensive way. We know we have to deal with solvency. The \nPresident's budget proposal maintains the solvency of Medicare for the \nnext 10 years. Yet, the pending budget resolution contains $50 billion \nmore in Medicare reductions than the President's plan. The only purpose \nof such unnecessary reductions in Medicare is to finance the excessive \ntax breaks proposed in this resolution. We simply cannot accept a \nwillingness on the part of some to use deep Medicare cuts to pay for \nthe tax cuts in this budget plan.\n  The third problem is that this bill virtually destroys Medicaid--it \nproposes $72 billion in Medicaid cuts. We are also concerned about the \nway in which these cuts are provided. It proposes to turn the Medicaid \nProgram into block grants. This approach does not reflect the \nbipartisan plan proposed by the National Governors Association. It has \nbeen opposed by Democratic Governors. Block grants would create a \ntremendous inconsistency in the availability of benefits under \nMedicaid, regardless of what other assurances were being given by the \nRepublican majority. These cuts are not just $72 billion as they relate \ndirectly to the budget. Because of the ability for States to \ndramatically reduce the availability of funding, the cuts could \nactually reach $250 billion if the States maximize their ability to \nreduce the commitment to health care.\n  This will undercut the availability, and in some cases completely \neliminate the availability for millions of children, and for persons \nwith disabilities. It threatens seniors in nursing homes and the \nfinancial well-being of their spouses. All this devastation and \nsacrifice is being asked for in order to provide for tax breaks in many \ncases for those who do not need them at all. The fourth problem is this \nbudget proposal dramatically shortchanges education. It reduces \neducation and training by a full 20 percent in real dollars, or $25 \nbillion by the year 2002. When we vote on this resolution, keep in mind \nthat it incorporates the largest education cuts in history. Over the \nsame time period, in spite of the fact this represents the most \ndramatic reduction in the availability of funding for education in our \nhistory, school enrollments are going to rise to historic highs. Every \nschool is going to be faced with the prospect of increasing enrollment, \nand greater demands for real budgets, at the same time the Federal \nGovernment is reducing its commitment to the very schools it claims to \nsupport. The President's budget, on the other hand, invests $57 billion \nmore than what this budget resolution provides.\n  The fifth problem, Mr. President, is this resolution dramatically \nharms the environment. It cuts $3.8 billion from environmental \nprotection and natural resources. That is 17 percent below the \nPresident's commitment to the environment into the year 2002. We cannot \nall talk about how much of an advocate we are to the environment if we \nare not willing to commit the resources to ensure that environmental \nprotection can become a reality. Mr. President, we have to address \nenvironmental funding in a way that ensures the ability to implement \ncomprehensive environmental protection.\n  Finally, the sixth problem, is that it raises taxes on working \nfamilies. It proposes an $18.5 billion in increase in taxes on working \nfamilies through the cutting back on the earned-income tax credit. It \nraises taxes on 7 million working families in the next 7 years. As the \nPresident's budget makes clear, we can balance the budget without \nraising taxes on working people.\n  Mr. President, we can do a lot better than this. This is an extreme \nbudget. This budget takes money from health, education, the \nenvironment, and working families. Those priorities, we have said from \nthe beginning, are our priorities. This budget attacks those priorities \nin ways that we do not believe are wise for this country or for the \npeople affected. Obviously, this budget continues the great debate \nabout where we ought to be taking this country. Do we really want to \nmake the dramatic and draconian cuts in health and in education, in \nMedicare and in Medicaid, in the EITC, to provide for the tax breaks \nfor many people who simply do not\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\nneed them today? I do not think the American people want that. I know \nmembers of our caucus do not want it, either.\n\n  This budget resolution represents an abandonment of any pretense of \nbalancing the budget before cutting taxes. As a result of this fiscal \nirresponsibility and the cruelty of its priorities, this budget is \ndead. The reconciliation process that will be carried out as a result \nof this budget resolution is going nowhere.\n  The only way that we can resolve this matter is to do what we talked \nabout doing yesterday, to work together, to resolve our differences, \nand in a bipartisan way to come up with an agreement on a plan that \ndetails ways with which to balance the budget. We should build on the \nrecord of the last 4 years, and guarantee the kind of economic growth \nand the protection of priorities that we all know are so critical to \nthe long-term best interests of this Nation.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to look at this resolution very \ncarefully and to join us in opposition when we have that opportunity a \nfew moments from now. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have 1 minute remaining. I will stay \nwithin that 1 minute. I thank my Democratic leader, my good friend from \nthe neighboring State of South Dakota for his kind remarks. I thank the \nchairman of my committee for all that he has done over the years.\n  This is my last part in managing a budget resolution. I simply say in \nleaving, while I am not satisfied with what we have done and while I \nwill be involved, I am sure, in the months to come this year in trying \nto bring some resolution to the remaining differences, I want to say it \nhas been a thrill and an honor to work with so many outstanding people \non both sides of the aisle. I only wish my friends on the Republican \nside could have been a little bit more understanding. But I simply say \nwe have, in the last 3 years, cut the deficit from about $300 billion \nto about $140 billion. We are on the road to the right course. We \nshould not give up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the hour of the vote has arrived. I \nbelieve we have 5 minutes' time remaining. I will use leader time if \nthat is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be here today to endorse this budget \nresolution conference report. It is obviously the thing we need to do. \nIt is the first critical step in the process this year. After we pass \nthis budget resolution conference report, we can then quickly move to \nthe reconciliation bills that, in fact, enforce the things that we say \nwe are going to do in this bill, and we can begin passing the \nappropriations bills because the Appropriations Committees will then \nhave the numbers they need to mark to, and we can move this process \nforward as we need to in a cooperative way. But first, we must pass \nthis conference report.\n  I begin by again recognizing the outstanding work of the \ndistinguished chairman, the chairman of the Budget Committee. I daresay \nthere is no Senator that knows more about the budget rules and the \nbudget itself than Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico. He does \noutstanding work, here in this body, on that committee, and working \nwith Members across the aisle and with the other body. I congratulate \nhim for the fine job he has done, once again, this year.\n  I also want to extend my congratulations and best wishes to our good \nfriend, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon. He certainly \nepitomizes the old saying, ``you can disagree without being \ndisagreeable,'' and particularly this year we have found that while he \nmade his points and offered some amendments he has worked with us to \nmove the process along. I know the Senator from New Mexico has already \npointed that out. We appreciate the very fine work of Senator Exon.\n\n  Also, I might note today, Mr. President, that this the last budget \nresolution other Senators who are members of the Budget Committee will \nwork on, too. Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana has been an \nexcellent member of the Budget Committee since the 95th Congress, \nJanuary 1977, I believe under the chairmanship of Senator Muskie. Mr. \nPresident, 19 years on the committee is almost a sentence, but he has \ndone excellent work as a member of the Budget Committee. He also has \nbeen a pleasure to work with and has been helpful on many occasions.\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois with the bow tie, Senator \nSimon, has always worked as a really good member of the Budget \nCommittee, and the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, \nhas worked on budgets many times in the past and has been a great \nmember of the Budget Committee. I commend them all for their fine work \nand what they have done.\n  It has not been easy to reach this budget conference report, to get \nto this point. We have had disagreements along the way. In the Budget \nCommittee and on the floor of the Senate efforts were made to amend it, \nsubstitute alternatives were offered, and the Senate passed an \namendment that added some additional funds for nondefense discretionary \nspending. When the conference work was going on, that was not received \nwith a great deal of pleasure in some circles, but we worked it out and \nwe came up with a reasonable agreement that will allow us to do what we \nneed to do for our country and continue to move us toward our ultimate \nimportant goal of a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  We do have a budget resolution conference report here before the \nSenate that continues to represent dramatic changes in the way we \ngovern. If you want to continue to build a monument to status quo, the \nway things have been done around here for years, that basically always \nseems to lead to more spending, then you do not want to be for this \nbudget resolution. This budget resolution continues the good work that \nwas started last year, that moves us in a different direction, that \nmoves toward giving some relief to the American people that work and \npay taxes, and moves toward some real reform in the entitlement areas, \nwhere we need it so badly.\n  It does continue to restrain spending. It does allow enough funds for \na strong national defense, but it will continue a pattern overall, in \nthat period of years, of less spending for defense. We have worked on \nthat very carefully, and I think this conference report does an \nadequate job there.\n  This conference report reflects our beliefs in a balanced budget and \nlower taxes for families with children. When I hear these accusations \nabout tax relief for those that do not need it, I wonder first of all, \nwhose taxes are they, anyway? Whose money is it? It is the people's \nmoney. We are talking about allowing families with children to have \njust a little help in raising their children with their own money, a \n$500 tax credit--which, by the way, is limited to people under a \ncertain income level.\n  So I do not apologize at all for wanting to help families with \nchildren, for wanting to help children with some tax relief instead of \nit coming to Washington and letting Washington decide, ``Oh, yes, we \nwill send it back the way that we determine is best for your \nchildren.'' We say, ``How about letting the families make that \ndetermination?''\n  With regard to the Medicare issue, we have seen recently that the \ndecline in the Medicare Trust Fund is greater than we had anticipated, \ngreater than even a year ago. We can stand here and ignore this \nproblem. But what we are threatening is our parents', our \ngrandparents', and our children's future, and their ability to depend \non this program.\n  The bipartisan substitute that was offered, as a matter of fact, had \nproposed Medicare reforms that would lead to a savings over the 6-year \nperiod of $154 billion. In this conference report, the proposed savings \nare $158 billion. As you can see, the numbers on Medicare are very \nclose. Over a 7-year period, I think the difference between the \nadministration's proposal and ours is around 2 percent. Yet, we are \nstill all talking about an increase every year--every year for this \nimportant program.\n  So I think that we are doing the right thing here. It provides for \nreduced Government spending and less Government intervention. It lays \nout a blueprint for what we need to do, but it continues the path we \nstarted with last year. By the year 2002, we will have the first \nbalanced budget since 1969.\n  With regard to what the President has proposed, Mr. President, I \nwould like to submit for the Record a chart\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\nwhich shows budget deficits, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 BUDGET DEFICITS                                                \n                                            [In billions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  1996   1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent law baseline...........................................    146    156    160    147    136    111    105\nConference agreement...........................................    146    153    147    117     89     42     -5\nPresident's Budget: a                                                                                           \n    With trigger...............................................    146    155    152    123    105     54     -3\n    Without trigger............................................    146    156    153    125    108     87     81\nChaffee-Breaux Moderate........................................    146    147    154    134    114     77     49\nBalanced Budget Act b..........................................    151    159    127     97     73     34     -3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na CBO reestimate.                                                                                               \nb CBO reestimate from December baseline.                                                                        \n                                                                                                                \nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff, June 13, 1996.                                                                  \n\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this chart shows that every year--every \nyear--the President's proposals would have the deficits that our \npackage has over these 6 years. As a matter of fact, there has been \nthis reference to the spike we have in the next fiscal year. Yes, there \nis a spike in our budget in the next fiscal year, but there is also one \nin the President's budget, and it is $2 billion higher than our \nproposal.\n  So if you want to compare the proposals, I invite you to do so. This \nchart will be in the Record.\n  I am proud to support this package. It is fair. It is what we need to \ndo.\n  I urge my colleagues today to stand up, do the right thing, and vote \nfor this budget resolution. Let us move the process forward. Let us do \nwhat is right for our children and for our country.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I understand the yeas and nays have not been \nrequested.

Mr. President, I am disappointed and disillusioned by this \nconference report on the budget resolution for the 1997 fiscal year.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report lowered next year's \ndiscretionary spending by $1.3 billion from the Senate-passed budget \nresolution. I applaud Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici \nand ranking member James Exon for their strong support of adequate \nfunding for programs that invest in our country. Unfortunately, the \nHouse of Representatives refused to accept the Senate's more \nresponsible discretionary spending levels.\n  Moreover, I am disillusioned that the House budget conferees have \nresorted to a new budget gimmick. Instead of showing leadership to \nproduce a more moderate budget resolution, they have added a new smoke \nand mirror--the Government shutdown prevention allowance. This section \nof the conference report will free up $1.3 billion more in spending \nonly if Congress decides to pass a continuing resolution to fund the \nGovernment. This is a billion-dollar incentive for Members to pass a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  After two unnecessary and expensive Government shutdowns and more \nthan a dozen continuing resolutions last year, I have had enough of \nthis piece-meal approach to budgeting. Budgeting by continuing \nresolutions is a true failure in leadership. Instead of passing the \nbuck by passing continuing resolutions, we should make the tough budget \ndecisions and then vote on them in appropriations bills. Unlike short-\nterm continuing resolutions, year-long appropriations bills allow \nFederal, State, and local agencies to plan their budgets and make \nGovernment more effective.\n  This conference report also makes harmful short-term cuts in \nimportant programs that will have devastating consequences over the \nlong-term. It cuts Medicare and Medicaid more than is necessary to \nachieve a balanced budget. These cuts would reduce Medicare spending \ngrowth per-beneficiary far below projected private sector growth rates. \nI am disappointed that the majority persists in cutting a program that \nis vital to 83,000 Vermonters, 12 percent of whom live below the \npoverty level.\n  And it cuts environment funding while increasing defense spending by \n$11 billion for 1997--which is unacceptable in today's post-cold-war \nworld. The people of the United States never voted to gut environmental \nspending in the last election. They overwhelmingly want to make sure \nGovernment provides basic safeguards for a clean environment. This is a \njob that Government can do and needs to do.\n   Mr. President, this budget resolution is better than last year's \nextreme budget, but it still cuts programs for elderly, young and low-\nincome Vermonters more than is necessary to balance the budget. And it \nhurts the environment while resorting to budget gimmicks.\n  We can do better than this disappointing and disillusioning budget.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we hope to have some announcement about \nproceeding for the remainder of the day and week momentarily. We are \nworking on that right now. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, we appreciate the opportunity to take some \ntime this afternoon. This is a continuation of our effort among the \nfreshmen to have a freshman focus and to bring what is often a unique \nperception of Senate Members, those of us who just came less than 2 \nyears ago, on the topics of today. So we appreciate that. Some of my \ncolleagues will join in.\n  Mr. President, we want to talk a little today about me, too politics. \nI think it is a timely topic. It is one that has been very prominent \nhere in this body over the last several months or even, in fact, year.\n  It sounds kind of good--me, too. It sound like that ought to give us \nan opportunity to agree. We will order something and there will be a \nresounding, me, too.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the way it works. Unfortunately, me, too \npolitics means when there is an idea that comes up, I say, me, too, and \nthen find lots of reasons why you cannot do it, so that there is a very \ndifficult problem in determining--walking one way and talking another, \nsaying, ``I'm for it,'' but making sure that it never happens. That is \nwhat we increasingly are seeing with this administration, President \nClinton, and with the minority here in the Senate.\n  There are, of course, real choices to be made. There is nothing wrong \nwith choices. That is what politics is about. It gives you and me, as \nvoters, a chance to choose because various candidates are for various \nthings. That is how the system works. When those choices are made \nindistinguishable, then it is very difficult. It is very difficult to \nhave politicians who say one thing and do another, and continuously do \nthat.\n  So there are basic decisions that have to be made. Are we going to \nhave more Government, more Federal Government or less? Are we going to \nmove in the direction of having more taxes, or are we going to move in \nthe direction of having American families spend more of their money \nthemselves? Those are basic decisions. Are we going to spend more? Are \nwe going to borrow to spend more so that the credit card can go to \nour kids, or are we going to reduce spending?\n\n  These are tough decisions, but they are fairly clear decisions. What \nis happening is they are being blurred by this me, too politics. The \ntechnique, of course, is that whatever is suggested as fundamental \nchange, then the others say, ``Well, I'm for that as well,'' and then \ngo about making sure it never happens.\n  The technique, of course, is to speak for it, and then decide, \n``Well, but it goes a little too far,'' or, ``There are some details \nhere that we can't do. I want a balanced budget, but this isn't the \nright way.'' So it is a way of saying, ``I'm for it,'' but making sure \nyou never have to vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I think that is troublesome. I think that is \ntroublesome in terms of the system. It is troublesome certainly in \nterms of elections where, at least in my view, the purpose of elections \nis to give some direction to our Government.\n  We have to generally do it in fairly broad areas. Certainly no one \ntalks about 800 different votes that you take in a year, but they do \ntalk about your philosophy. Are you for less Government or for more? \nMore spending or less? A balanced budget or not? Term limits or not?\n  Unfortunately, the President has become a me, too President. There \nare countless examples of echoing the fundamental changes that have \nbeen brought about by the Republican Party, or by Bob Dole, almost like \na shadow. Every time the Republicans come out with a plan to make \nfundamental change, to bring about the reforms that people have asked \nfor, why, we see the President standing up and saying he agrees; but \nwhen the chips are down, he goes the other way. It is no longer ``Me, \ntoo.'' It is more like the old Frank Sinatra song, the old tune of ``My \nway.'' ``Do it my way.''\n  So it is easy to say, ``Well, I'm for that, but, you know, it's not \nthe right way to do it,'' or, ``I'm for that, but it goes too far,'' \nor, ``I'm for that, but there are the details.'' So it confuses where \nwe really are.\n  Balancing the budget and cutting taxes and reforming welfare, ending \nthe days of big Government, why, the President continues to sound in \ntune with fundamental change, but when the reform comes around, then \nhis position shifts and it does not happen. That has happened so many \ntimes this year.\n  For example, he vetoed the balanced budget after saying he was for a \nbalanced budget. After running on a balanced budget, after saying, we \ncan do it in 5 years, in 8 years, in 10 years, in 7 years, he vetoes a \nbalanced budget.\n  He vetoed welfare reform after pledging to change welfare as we know \nit. He vetoed legislation that would have kept Medicare solvent for the \nnext generation after promising to save the program. These are the \nissues that we are seeing too much of ``Me, too'' instead of reform.\n  We need to really bear down on the idea of people saying one thing \nand doing another. I am pretty proud of this body and of the majority \nin this body who came here a year and a half ago and said we believe \nthat voters want some fundamental change in terms of the direction of \nthis country, a balanced budget being one of them.\n  Of course, the idea of moving welfare and many of the programs closer \nto people by moving them to the States, these are fundamental changes \nthat people talk about. We have done many of those things, but \nunfortunately, the ``Me, too'' politics has kept them from being \ncompleted. We have sent the first balanced budget in 25 years to the \nWhite House--the first time. Vetoed.\n\n  So we need to really take a look at what we are for. If people \ndisagree, if people want more government--and\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\nthere are those who do, a legitimate point of view. I do not happen to \nshare it. But you can argue that, ``Yes, there are more things \nGovernment can do. Yes, we ought to take more money from folks because \nwe can spend it better in the Government.'' That is a legitimate point \nof view; not one I share. But we at least ought to decide where we are \non those things so that what we say and what we do are the same.\n  Welfare reform is one that comes, of course, to mind. We provided the \nPresident an opportunity to reform the Nation's welfare system, not \njust once, but twice. On both occasions the President said no; first, \nas part of the Balanced Budget Act in November and then a bill that \nstood on its own in January.\n  Just last month the President issued an Executive order requiring \nStates to end welfare payments to teenaged parents who quit school or \nrefuse to live with a responsible adult, language in part that was part \nof the proposal. Now the ``Me, too'' politics will say, ``Yeah, I'm for \nthat. I agree with that. Look what I've done,'' which is about one-\nhundredth of the total package. We see more and more of that.\n  Another flip-flop occurred on, of course, announcing support for \nWisconsin's historic welfare reform plan to put able-bodied recipients \nto work, something the Republican welfare program that was vetoed would \nhave accomplished. Now the administration is backing off of that, flip-\nflopping again, saying there are some details in the Wisconsin plan \nthat need to be negotiated.\n  Let me tell you, the people in Wisconsin have a better idea of what \nneeds to be done to deliver services in their State than bureaucrats \nhere do.\n  I come from a State that is small. We need a different system than \nyou need in a large State. The States are the only place to do that. So \nyou cannot talk one way and walk another. Balancing the budget clearly \nhas been the most significant issue over the last year and a half, not \nsimply because of the numbers, not simply because of the arithmetic, \nbut because the budget reflects the kind of approach we take to govern, \nwhether we are fiscally responsible, whether we say, ``Yes, we will \nspend more than we take in,'' whether we say it is morally correct if \nyou want services, those people who receive them ought to pay for them, \nrather than putting it on the credit card for the kids. Those are basic \nissues.\n\n  We cannot balance the budget unless we are willing to adjust and make \nfundamental changes in Government. Budgets are vital to where we are \ngoing. The first 2\\1/2\\ years the administration never submitted a \nbalanced budget to the Congress despite all of the talk, and opposed a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution, arguing we do not need \nto do this. ``Just balance the budget,'' the same argument that has \nbeen going on 25 years right here in this place, and we have not \nbalanced it. Of course we need the discipline of a constitutional \namendment.\n  Finally, under the pressure to produce a balanced budget, but not \nbasically making the changes that have to be made to do it. You have to \ndeal with entitlements. Two-thirds of the expenditures are in \nentitlements. If you do not deal with entitlements, several things \nhappen. One is that you never balance the budget. The other is that \nprograms we want to strengthen and save, like Medicare, cannot exist \nunless you make some fundamental changes in them.\n  Tax cuts, promises to cut taxes--instead, what do we get? The largest \ntax increase in the history of this country. Last year, we came forward \nwith plans to reduce taxes--vetoed, of course.\n  Mr. President, I have great confidence in the American people. I have \ngreat confidence in voters that they will make decisions based on \nfundamental direction. I certainly hope so. That is our job as voters, \nto decide where we want to go and then, of course, have to decide who \nthe candidates are that are going in the same direction we are, not \nthat any party or any politician is going to represent every detail of \nour point of view, but in general this party, this party, this \ncandidate or that candidate comes closer to representing my view than \nthe other. That is the choice we have.\n  Mr. President, I hope we all understand this business of ``Me, too, \npolitics'' is not leadership. It is not decisiveness. It is a matter of \navoiding taking strong positions. It is a matter of saying, ``Yes, this \nis a good idea. I am for it, I want to balance the budget, but I just \ncannot vote for it the way it is,'' and never will.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. I see my associates \nhave come forward. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator. On the issue of the President, \nwhich is a discussion that many of us are scratching our head about \nwith respect to the rhetoric we are hearing from the White House on \nissues--very, very important issues--that face this country, where \nRepublicans here in the Congress and in many places, on a bipartisan \nbasis, are trying to move forward with programs we believe will move \nthis country forward. We have been met with very stiff resistance from \nthe White House.\n  Yet when the campaign that has now commenced--the speeches; the \nPresident is out, making the campaign speeches--you would think from \nthe speeches that he gives that all of the things that we are pursuing, \nthat the American public is in general agreement with, like balancing \nthe budget, like cutting taxes, like having smaller Government, like \ngiving more power back to State and local governments, like welfare \nreform, all of those things that are very much supported by the \nAmerican public and have been stopped, clearly been stopped by this \nWhite House, because we have passed all of those things, and they have \nbeen vetoed down at the Oval Office, the President is now campaigning \nin his speeches that he is for all of this. In fact, he is the one who \nis trying to make these things happen.\n\n  It is particularly difficult for me, as someone who has worked \nextensively in the area of welfare reform, to hear the President of the \nUnited States not only giving speeches on the issue about how he is in \nsupport of the welfare system, but we have a President of the United \nStates running ads on television talking about his welfare plan. Let me \nremind the President and my colleagues that the President of the United \nStates has introduced one welfare reform proposal. It was introduced in \nJune 1994, some 18 months into the President's term.\n  As you may recall, in 1992 when he ran for election, he promised to \nend welfare as we know it and made it a centerpiece of the campaign--he \nwas a new Democrat, someone who understood that big Government policies \nof the Great Society were, in fact, hurting the very people they \nintended to help, and that we had to do something different. We had to \ndo something dramatically different. As a Governor from Arkansas, he \nsaw the need for decentralizing welfare back to the States, into the \ncommunities, where antipoverty programs have been more effective and \nmore tailored to the needs of the people in those communities.\n  So he said he wanted to end welfare as we know it. I think that was a \nvery significant component of putting together the Clinton majority \nthat earned him the electoral votes necessary to win the Presidency. \nMr. President, 18 months later, he introduced in that interim period of \ntime massive health reform, tax increases, further spending increases, \nnew entitlement programs, a whole lot of other things were introduced \nin the first 18 months. He tried to do the gays in the military and \nother things that were obviously higher in priority because they \ncertainly came before any initiative on welfare. He took no initiative.\n  The 103d Congress, from 1993 and 1994, introduced no legislation, the \nDemocratic majority in both Houses introduced no legislation to move \nthe welfare debate forward. In June 1994, it was introduced. It was a \npathetic bill by everyone's estimate. It was panned by both sides as \nbeing no significant reform at all. In fact, they had trouble finding \nDemocratic cosponsors of the bill. Someone even introduced the \nlegislation for the President because it was considered such a minimal, \nincremental, insignificant reform of a system that was in terrible need \nof reform.\n  This is the plan--I assume this is the plan--that the President now \nis going around the country suggesting ends to welfare as we know it. \nNo one from the left or the right, whether you are for\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\nwelfare as it is or would like to see substantial changes, would \nindicate that the President's plan of 1994 ended welfare as we know it. \nYet, we have the President of the United States out on television, out \nin speeches, suggesting that he is trying to end welfare as we know it.\n  He had an opportunity to end welfare as we know it. Last year, we \nworked on a bipartisan basis here in the U.S. Senate and passed, I \nthink, a very strong bill, one that attacked the significant problems \nin the welfare system, began to attack them. I do not see this as the \nfinal solution, by any stretch. But, in fact, it began to take us into \na new course, where we focus more on allowing individual communities \nand States to fashion their own welfare programs with more flexibility. \nWe put some work requirements in there, because we believe that is \nabsolutely essential to transition people off of welfare. If you are \ngoing to transition people off of welfare, you have to give them work \nexperience and teach them the skills necessary to work, and you have to \nput in time limits. If you do not put time limits in, you have a system \nthat perpetuates nonwork, perpetuates a whole lot of values which I do \nnot believe make for successful Americans.\n\n  We worked together on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate and came \nup with a bill that got 87 votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate--87 \nout of 99 votes; there were 12 who voted against it. That is an \nenormous bipartisan effort. In a year or two, now, where you have seen \nclaims and disgust from the public about the intense partisanship, \nabout the serious issues that face the country, here in the U.S. \nSenate, the issue that I think is one of the most pressing and \nimportant issues to this country and to our culture, to helping those \nwho are in need, we were able to get 87 votes for a bipartisan bill.\n  The President of the United States, who originally said, ``This is a \ngreat bill and I like it,'' as time went by, as we were working on this \nbill in conference, the President said he would veto, in fact, the \nSenate bill, that he would not support the Senate bill, even though it \ngot 87 votes here in the U.S. Senate. So the President again very \nclearly signaled to the other side that he was not for anything that \nlooked like the Senate bill or certainly not the House bill, and sent \nthe signal to block whatever came out of conference as unacceptable \nwelfare reform, even though there were 87 votes here.\n  Now, this is the President who is running ads saying he wants to end \nwelfare as we know it, having torpedoed a bill that got 87 votes here \nin the U.S. Senate, having not offered any substantive proposal in this \nsession of Congress, having offered a weak proposal in 1994 that, \nagain, was panned by both left and right as insignificant.\n  This is the President who now wants you to believe that he is for us; \nhe is for the same things that we are for and that you are for in \nwelfare reform. The fact is on this ``me, too'' he is not ``me.'' He is \nnot ``us.'' He is ``them.'' He is the status quo. He is for \nperpetuating a system that while well meaning in its inception--and \ncertainly the people who put these programs together did not put these \nprograms together because they thought they were going to hurt the \npoor, or because they thought they were going to hurt the children, or \nthey thought were going to destroy communities, or thought they were \ngoing to create a culture of despair, or thought that they were going \nto really begin to tear apart families, or thought they were going to \nsee fathers becoming less and less responsible for their children. None \nof those things were intended consequences of the Great Society \nprograms and the other welfare programs we passed. But they surely have \ncontributed to all of those things.\n  What we are saying is that it is time to do things differently that \nwe know work in rebuilding those institutions. The institutions of \nfamily, of parental responsibility to children, of community \norganization that builds values in the communities like churches and \nnonprofit organizations, and civic associations that build a sense of \ncommunity and set standards and values for this community so people can \nrelate to--in fact, not only do they relate to but they participate in \nestablishing.\n  We believe that sending welfare back down is not just substituting a \nState bureaucrat for a Federal bureaucrat, but substituting the \nneighbor down the street who works at the local community center, or \nthe pastor of the church, or the social worker at the nonprofit mission \nhelping the poor. That is what we are talking about in the welfare \nreform that is envisioned in the bills. I am hopeful that we can see \nthat kind of progress in this area.\n  I am also hopeful that the President will own up to the fact that he \nis not for welfare reform as that envisioned that I have just given \nyou. That is not his vision of welfare reform. His vision of welfare \nreform is ensuring Federal control over these programs, guaranteeing \nthat you will hear very much, ``Well the Republican plan didn't \nguarantee this; it cannot guarantee that.'' I can tell you what all of \nthese Federal guarantees have gotten us over the past 30 years: \nGuaranteed failure, Federal guarantees failures of families and \ncommunities and culture. We want to get rid of the Federal guarantees. \nYes, because we believe it is much more important that instead of \nhaving the bureaucrat guarantee that someone gets a check passed out by \nsomeone who sits behind bulletproof glass and you receive the check \nbecause the number that you have on your card is the number that \nmatches that computer. Who you are does not matter. What your concerns \nare, does not matter. What your needs are, does not matter. You are a \nnumber in a computer and you get processed like it. That is not the \nkind of guarantee that I think the poor want in this country. What they \nwant is the guarantee that someone loves them, cares for them, who sees \nthem as a neighbor, who sees them as part of what they are in a \ncommunity, and has the resources available to them to help them. That \nis the guarantee that we want to provide. That is the kind of program \nenvisioned that we see for helping the poor in this country, and it is \nnot about the Federal Government taking care of people. It is about \nneighbors taking care of each other which is about the goodness of \nAmerica and the culture that we so much want to rebuild in this \ncountry.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I just wanted to add a few words to what my colleagues have been \ntalking about here this afternoon--about leadership that I believe the \nAmerican people have been calling for, leadership in areas such as a \nbalanced budget, leadership of Federal spending reforming our welfare \nsystem, and, yet, leadership in providing tax relief to America's hard \nworking families. That is what people think about leadership on these \ntype of issues. They usually first think of the President because he \nnaturally, after all, is our chief executive officer of the country; \nthe person who delivers the State of the Union Address every year; the \none required by law to begin the budget process by submitting that \nproposal to Congress. The President is elected to lead. But that is not \nwhat President Clinton has done over the last 3\\1/2\\ years. Instead of \nleading the Nation he has been more of one that is following in the \nfootsteps of Congress. Whatever we do the President now especially in \nthis campaign year is saying ``me, too'' as we have noted in other \nthings. But his proposals in comparison with ours are really just pale \nexamples of what needs to be done.\n  We talk about welfare reform. He says ``me, too.'' But he does not \nprovide adequate reform that we need to save and provide for that \nsystem of Medicare. We say we need to save Medicare. He says ``me, \ntoo'' but does not provide the basic reform and changes in the Medicare \nsystem to ensure that it is going to be here for the seniors who rely \non it today and for the generations to come.\n  Few issues symbolize the me-too response better than what has \nhappened to tax relief. This President in 1992 as candidate Bill \nClinton for President campaigned on the issue of tax relief for \nAmerican families. In fact, then even called for tax relief as high as \n$1,000 per child tax credit. He said American families need tax relief. \nBut what did the President do after the election? Did he come to \nCongress? Did he come with a budget that said, ``Now I am going to do \nwhat I promised to do, and that is to provide tax relief in some form \nto America's families?'' No.\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\n He did not. In fact, in 1993 the President proposed and this Congress \npassed--again without one Republican vote because we did not want to \nadd to the tax burden of the American families--a $265 billion tax \nincrease; not tax relief for families, but tax increases. Of course, we \nare going to hear the rhetoric all the time that it was targeted for \nthe rich so they can pay their fair share. If that is true, why is the \naverage tax burden on Americans today at all levels higher than it was \njust 3 years ago? Why is tax freedom day now on May 7 and not May 1 as \nit was 3 years ago? It is because the average American in this country \nis paying more taxes today than at any time in history.\n  Our tax levels are higher today than at any time in history for \naverage Americans--not just for a few but for all Americans. This flies \nin the face of what President Clinton said just 3\\1/2\\ years ago in \n1992 that he was going to provide tax relief.\n  In 1993 while a Member of the House I introduced a budget called \nfamilies first, and among the budget proposals included was tax relief, \nand specifically $500 per child in that tax relief package, half of \nwhat the President had talked about but as much as we can get a \nconsensus on. We thought that was important. But when it reached the \nWhite House as part of our budget plan last year what did the President \ndo? The President vetoed that. The President did not carry through on \nhis promise of providing tax relief as I said, in fact he added more \ntaxes to the average American family's debt.\n\n  In doing so, I was hoping that we could win the President back over \nby providing for and including this tax cut in our budget. For nearly 3 \nyears we have been fighting that. As I said, the President has vetoed \nevery attempt that we have made.\n  So the President keeps saying--and we will hear it on the floor here \nas well, again as I mentioned--that this is just tax relief for the \nrich. I do not know where that comes from. When average American \nfamilies in this country--in my State of Minnesota alone $500 million a \nyear for average families could stay in their pockets rather than being \nsent to Washington. You will hear a lot of those--``Well, Washington \nspeaks, and we can't afford here in Washington to give this type of tax \nrelief.'' Well, the question is: Whose money is it? It is not \nWashington being able to afford to give tax relief. The question should \nbe: Should American families be able to keep more of the money that \nthey worked hard for every day? How much can we allow them to keep? \nThat should be the question rather than saying, ``How much is this \ngoing to cost Washington?''\n  The President though in his me-too efforts says, ``Well, I do want to \ngive tax relief now.'' This is an election year. But now he is saying \nin his latest budget, ``Yes. I want to give tax relief. Me, too. I want \nto give a family tax credit, $500 per child. Me, too.'' But what is the \nPresident's proposal? It is not $500, and it is not for all children. \nIt starts out as a $300 tax break for children, and it is phased in \nover 5 years. But at the end of 5 years it dies again. So he gives it \nand takes it away.\n  Is it for all children? No. It is for children up to the age of and \nincluding the age of 12. So it is not for the same type of a tax relief \nthat we have offered across the board of $500 per child tax credit.\n  So, in other words, when it comes to $500 and the tax credit, the \nPresident has said ``me, too'' but only for a few years, not for \nchildren over the age of 13, and I guess not for real.\n  So today, still 4 years after that promise was made, 3 years after we \nbegan the fight of offering tax credit and tax relief for American \nfamilies, taxpayers still find themselves now caught between the \nrhetoric and reality. We have tried. We have included tax relief in our \nbudgets. The President has vetoed it.\n  So when Bill Clinton took office in 1993 we said then the taxes were \ntoo high, we believed Government was too big, and that spending was out \nof control. Nearly 3\\1/2\\ half years into the Clinton Presidency, and \ndespite all the efforts that we have made, taxes are still higher than \nthey were 3 years ago, Government is bigger than it was 3 years ago, \nand spending. Well, I think you get the message. Spending has increased \nover the last 3 years.\n  The bottom line is this cannot continue. We cannot give up on our \nefforts to return to the American people their hard-earned tax dollars. \nIf the President is not willing to exercise the responsibilities of \nleadership handed to him by the voters, then we must. We are going to \ncontinue our efforts when it comes to carrying out the taxpayers' \nagenda. Their demand for a balanced budget, less Government spending, \nand tax relief is what we are going to continue to work for. We cannot \nafford to simply sit back and say, ``Me, too,'' like the President has \ndone. We have to say we can and we will do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to continue this same theme of \ndiscussing ideas that have been put forth by Republicans in the \nCongress and which the President has claimed he also supports, though \nin some cases the record would suggest otherwise.\n  Former Congressman and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has said something \nthat I always thought was very wise. He said that campaigns are not so \nmuch about defeating an opponent as they are about providing leadership \nand new ideas.\n  The Republican Congress, particularly under the leadership of then \nMajority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich, have provided the \nleadership and the new ideas that have animated the agenda here in \nWashington for the last year and a half. It began with the Contract \nWith America, and it followed through with many of the ideas that have \njust been discussed by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  One of those was the idea of tax cuts that the Senator from Minnesota \nwas just talking about. These were proposed, of course, by Republicans. \nThe President said, ``Me, too, but not as much.''\n  With regard to welfare reform, the Senator from Pennsylvania talked \nabout that. I remember when President Clinton said, ``Me, too'' on \nthat, and tried to steal the thunder, apparently, from Majority Leader \nBob Dole, who was prepared to talk about welfare reform, when President \nClinton said, ``I like that Wisconsin State plan. That is the kind of \nreal welfare reform we need,'' in a Saturday morning radio address. \nThen, when it came time for following through and signing the waiver \nthat would allow Wisconsin to follow through with its welfare reform, \nthe White House said, ``Well, we are not quite ready to do that, yet. \nWe want to think about it a while.'' So one is not even certain \nwhether, when the President says, ``Me, too,'' he really means it.\n  In any event, taxes and welfare have been discussed. Let me mention \nquickly three other subjects that fall into the same category. One is \nthe subject of defense and, in particular, ballistic missile defense. \nThis is something that has concerned Republicans in the Congress, and \nsome Democrats, for a long time. It was a particular challenge when, \nduring the cold war, the Soviet Union had the capability of raining on \nthe United States the ultimate in weapons of mass destruction, the \nability to destroy, literally, the United States and, if we retaliated, \neventually the world.\n  President Reagan decided that the best way to deal with this was \nthrough the development of a defense, so that no longer would the world \nbe threatened with annihilation as a result of two superpowers killing \neach other and every other living thing on the face of the Earth; that \nwe would provide a defense for ourselves so no nation would want to \nattack us because they would know they could not succeed and they would \nsimply be wasting their money to try.\n\n  That work on star wars, as opponents called it--it was really called \nthe Strategic Defense Initiative [SDI]--is credited by many Russians as \nbeing one of the things which finally caused the Soviet Union to throw \nin the towel in the cold war, to acknowledge they could never compete \nwith us, not only economically but also militarily in these \nsophisticated high-tech areas, and, therefore, they may as well decide \nto be our friend rather than our enemy.\n  Today's ballistic missile threat is a little different. It does not \ncome from a country like Russia. It comes from a lot of so-called rogue \nnations around\n\n[[Page S6191]]\n\nthe world who are acquiring the technology to deliver weapons of mass \ndestruction by ballistic missiles, perhaps a little shorter range than \nthe Russian missiles, but still with the capacity to rain harm on their \nneighbors, on neighboring states, on the capitals of our allies, \ncapital cities, on troops deployed abroad.\n  The administration said, ``We are for that, too. But we do not really \nwant to spend as much money as it would take to develop the systems, at \nleast as soon as you would like to see them developed.'' So it has been \ndistressing to those of us who tried to support these programs to see \nthe administration delay them and delay them and delay them, while all \nthe time suggesting that nevertheless they do support them. \nSpecifically, I have in mind two very important theater ballistic \nmissile programs, the so-called THAAD Program and the Navy Upper Tier \nProgram.\n  Both of these are designed to, when they are deployed, intercept \nmissiles that would be delivered by an enemy in some theater around the \nworld. One reason for the Navy program is that you could send the Aegis \ncruisers all over the world, literally, and defend against such a \nsituation. For example, if the North Koreans decided to launch one of \ntheir new missiles against Japan or against South Korea, or even, as \nthey will have the capability of doing after the turn of the century, \nagainst the United States--say Alaska or Hawaii--positioning those \nAegis cruisers somewhere in the western Pacific would permit us to \nintercept such a missile.\n  The administration, however, has refused to comply with the law of \nthe land in spending the money necessary to develop those programs \nwithin the timeframe called for by the legislation that was adopted by \nthe Congress and signed by the President last year. Therefore, it is \nanother example of an idea where the President has said, ``I am for \nthat, too,'' but he is not willing to back up the words with actions.\n  Quickly, Mr. President, two other examples I wanted to mention. One \nis one where I really hope we can have a bipartisan effort, because \nthis should know no partisanship. It deals with the question of \nvictims' rights. People who have been victimized by violent crime ought \nto have some constitutional rights in our criminal justice system. I \nsay criminal justice system because that is what it has come to be \ncalled. But in a perverse way, it also expresses what has really \nhappened to our system, where justice is provided to criminals--and we \nwould have it no other way--but it is not provided to the victims of \ncrime. We need to right that imbalance right now.\n  Our society believes in the rights of innocent people so strongly \nthat we even say we would rather have nine guilty people go free than \nhave one innocent person convicted of a crime. So we protect the rights \nof defendants, people who are accused of crimes. But we do not provide \nsimilar protections to those people who are innocent and have already \nbeen victimized. Senator Feinstein, a Democrat, and myself have \nintroduced a constitutional amendment to protect victims of crime. We \nhope this will be a bipartisan effort.\n  Recently, we find that sounds coming from the White House suggest, \nagain, the President is for this. I am hoping this time he will not \nonly be for it in his expressions, but that he will support us in our \neffort to get this constitutional amendment adopted. The former \nmajority leader, Bob Dole, is a cosponsor of our legislation. I would \nbe very, very pleased if President Bill Clinton would join with us in \nsupporting this constitutional amendment so Republicans and Democrats \nalike could provide real protection for the victims of crime. This \nshould be a real test for the President. Will he not just say, ``Me, \ntoo,'' but come aboard and achieve the goal.\n  Finally, I just wanted to mention the fifth item, and that is the \nbalanced budget. The President has been very, very willing to say he, \ntoo, is for a balanced budget. The problem is that every effort that we \nhave undertaken to try to achieve that balanced budget he has thwarted.\n  We tried to do it first through a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, because we knew it would be difficult to get the Congress \nto actually pass a balanced budget. He lobbied several Senators on the \nDemocratic side who had previously supported the balanced budget \namendment, urged them to oppose it, and it failed by one vote, as we \nall know. So we did not get a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, even though the President said he was for a balanced \nbudget.\n  He said that ought to be the job of the House and Senate, so we took \nhim up on his word. On November 17 of last year, the Senate of the \nUnited States passed a balanced budget, the first one in 20-some years, \nI think it is 28 years. The House did the same thing. We sent that \nbalanced budget to the President. On December 6 last year, he vetoed \nit.\n  He is for a balanced budget, but when it came time to actually sign \nit, he was not ready to do that. So, once again, we have an example--\nthis is the fifth one, as I said--where the President is very quick to \nsay, ``Me, too,'' but when it comes time to follow through, he is not \nthere.\n  I will return to the beginning of my remarks. As Jack Kemp said, \ncampaigns are about providing leadership and new ideas. The Republicans \nhave provided this leadership. We have provided the new ideas. We have \nreally won this campaign of ideas because it seems to me that the \nPresident and many of our Democratic friends are now agreeing with us \nthat welfare reform, Medicaid reform, tax relief for American families, \na strong national defense, a balanced budget, regulatory reform--which \nI have not even talked about--all of these things are good ideas and \nthey should be implemented.\n  The President says, ``I agree.'' The problem is that we cannot get \nhim to follow through with this. That is what this next election \nprobably is going to be all about. Will we follow our leadership? Do \nyou agree with our ideas? If you do, Mr. President, what we will be \nsaying is elect the kind of people who will follow through on those \nideas. If you do not agree with those ideas, of course, then you are \ngoing to want to support someone else. But I think politics is about \nproviding leadership and new ideas. These are the right ideas, and it \nis time for us to get support, not just in the House and in the Senate \nof the United States, but from the President of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I cannot support the budget resolution \nwhich the majority has presented to us. First, it reduces funding for \nMedicare and Medicaid more than is necessary in order to provide \ndollars for tax cuts which are likely to benefit most of the wealthiest \namong us.\n  The budget also reduces discretionary funding for education from \ncurrent levels--and I emphasize that--the funding for education is \nbeing reduced in this budget from current levels for 5 of the next 6 \nyears. It does that at the same time that it increases the funding for \ndefense each and every year during that period, including $11 billion \nmore for next year than the Pentagon requested.\n  Those are not the right priorities. Last year we fought long and hard \nbefore succeeding in restoring funding for education, such as Head \nStart, vocational education, the title I reading, writing and math \nskills program, Perkins loans and the State student incentive grants \nfor college students. I believe it would be shortsighted to now retreat \nfrom a firm commitment to the best investment in our future, and that \nis education.\n  We have now reduced the deficit for three straight years, and we are \non the verge of a fourth. We are doing that--reducing the deficit for \nthree straight years--for the first time since World War II. During \nthose same years, the deficit has been cut by more than half, from $290 \nbillion in 1992 to less than $145 billion in 1996.\n  We should build on that progress, and we should continue that \nprogress. That\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\nis why I supported two alternative budget resolutions, each of which \nwould have balanced the Federal budget within 7 years.\n  Those budgets would do so, however, without providing large tax cuts \nto the wealthiest among us at the expense of children, seniors and \nstudents. We can balance the budget without damaging cuts to health \ncare for the elderly, education funding and environmental protection, \nand those are among the top priorities of American working families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, I was privileged to see and \nhear a dramatic presentation by four high school sophomores from my \nhome State of Washington. They performed a short dramatic work, with \nchoral music, in my office for me and my staff. They had no fancy stage \nlights or microphones or curtains. They had simple costumes, and no \nstage make-up. Yet, they created true magic. It was emotional, \npowerful, and indicative of what young people can do if given half a \nchance.\n  These four young women, Dallas Milholland, Cynthia Ward, Kristin \nAllen-Zito, and Malissa Kobbevik, came to Washington, DC, from their \nhome 3,000 miles away in Bellingham, WA, to compete in the National \nHistory Day Finals. The presentation they created was entitled ``Focus \nof Concern: Breaking the Silence Surrounding Battered Women.''\n  They researched the plight of battered women throughout history. They \nexamined the accounts of women's ill-treatment, and the silence, \nignorance, and approval of such treatment. They also looked at the rise \nof concern about domestic violence and passage and enforcement of laws \nto protect women against it.\n  These four young women wrote the script, adapted the accompanying \nmusic for beautiful three-part harmony, chose the subdued black \ncostumes, and did the understated blocking and choreography. They \nperformed before national judges, and other students from around the \ncountry.\n  This morning, they called and told me that they have been chosen as \nthe National Champions of the National History Day Competition. I know \nthe Presiding Officer is as proud of these four young women from \nWashington State as I am.\n  The teachers and students of Bellingham High School, and those on \nVashon Island, in Port Angeles, and Richland, who also brought their \nterrific History Day projects to the competition, should all be proud. \nThe people of Bellingham, of Washington State, and all Americans should \nbe very proud of these four young women from Bellingham, and all those \nwho made their great victory possible.\n  What their performance teaches every person who sees it is that \ndomestic violence is an overpowering presence in the lives of too many \nwomen and children, almost as hard to outlive as his to live through. \nAs these young women point out in their presentation, ``During the 10 \nminutes of (our) presentation, 66 women have been beaten. Sometime \nduring the next 3 hours, one of these women will die.''\n  To quote further: ``During the 13 years of the Vietnam war, 58,000 \nAmerican service personnel died on the battlefield. During the same \ntime period, 54,000 American women were killed by their domestic \npartners.''\n  Their performance teaches that with brutality against women, as with \nall brutality in the human experience, there are times of concern, when \nactions happen, and there are times of silence, or worse, times when \nbrutality is condoned. Each of us needs to be responsible to call 911 \nwhen we hear the sounds of domestic violence in our neighborhoods. Each \nof us needs to be responsible to value women and their young children. \nEach of us needs to tell young girls that they deserve and should \nexpect better.\n  We must become aware that every day women are beaten, pushed, and \nthreatened by those they love: and they are too afraid to admit \n``someone I love is hurting me.''\n  This performance also teaches something about the power of a relevant \neducation. Young people learn best when they see relevance to their own \nlives outside the classroom, relevance to their current interests, and \nrelevance to their future careers.\n  These young women are talented, interested, and powerful. They are \nnot, however, alone, and they are not unique. Behind these four young \nwomen are four families, and at least one great teacher who gave them a \nchance. A chance to do something adults these days don't seem to expect \nfrom American students--strive for excellence.\n  Every student can benefit from seeing this performance. Every student \ncan also benefit from being given a chance to work hard for something \nthat they truly care about. Whether it's a book, a social cause, a \nbusiness idea, a sport or hobby--we must encourage young people to see \nthe connections.\n  These young people from my State are incredible. They can help us \nsolve the problems facing this country, so can all the other children \nin this country today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of the script from \nthe students at Bellingham High School be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       ``Battered Women''--Script\n\n       4 girls standing in darkness with backs to audience.\n       C/D/K: Open with song: ``Can You Hear the Prayer of the \n     Women.''\n       [single spotlight on.]\n       M: My heart is in anguish within me. The terrors of death \n     have fallen on me. Fear and trembling come upon me and horror \n     overwhelms me. It is not enemies who taunt me.

BROWNE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the untimely \npassing of a former Senate staff member, great Iowan, and personal \nfriend. Stanley Browne started from very humble roots, one of six \nchildren born to a school administrator and housewife in Sioux Falls, \nSD, in 1923. His father Walter died suddenly when Stan was just 6 years \nold. From that day on, he watched the determination and selfless \ndedication of not only his mother Ida, as she cared for the family all \nday, then scrubbed floors and cleaned homes evenings, but also his \noldest brothers as they dropped out of school, and sacrificed their \nfutures--all to enable their family to stay together. He grew up rather \nquickly, acutely aware of both the value of hard work and money, for \nthen there was no such thing as welfare. He became an Eagle Scout and \nserved in various leadership roles in Scouting as an adult. He served \nour country in world war II, as a Paratrooper with the 13th Airborne \nDivision, 326th Glider Infantry in central Europe, European African \nMiddle East theater. After the war, he rekindled an acquaintance with a \nwonderful lady named Coral Jane Freeman. They\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\nwould have celebrated their 48th wedding anniversary this Thursday June \n13. Stan Browne, both with the help of this great country's GI bill and \nthe hard work ethic installed upon him and embedded in his mind as \nyoung child, went on to graduate from Drake University Law School in \nDes Moines, IA, while simultaneously juggling several part-time jobs to \nmake ends meet. While at Drake he was president of the Delta Theta Phi \nlaw fraternity. Upon graduation, he practiced in the law firm of Wilson \nand Browne. He was active in Republican politics as both a candidate \nand campaign manager. After a victorious Senate campaign, Stan Browne \nbecame Senator Jack Miller's administrative assistant for 12 years. He \nserved as president of the Administrative Assistants Association and \nwas a member of St. Marks Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD. As \ncurrent member and past chairman of the 116 Club, he was especially \nproud to have been responsible for admitting the very first woman to \nthis formerly male dominated organization during his tenure. After his \ndeparture from the hill, Stan Browne entered the private sector, \njoining the DuPont Corp., serving as its Washington counsel until his \nretirement in 1986. He served on the board of directors for the PUBCO \nand Bobbie Brooks Corp., based in Cleveland, OH. He was also a former \nmember of the Iowa State Bar Association, Polk County Bar Association \nand the Jr. Bar Association, Worshipful Master of New Century Masonic \nLodge, past president of the Central Iowa Multiple Sclerosis Society, \nand a member of the Landings Club in Savannah, GA. Both on and off \n``the Hill,'' Stan Browne was known for his modesty, humbleness, \nhonesty and integrity. With his calm and cool demeanor, he was highly \nrespected and well known for his effective low-key and behind-the-scene \naccomplishments. In addition to his wife of nearly 48 years, Coral, he \nleaves behind two children; Laurel Bigelow and Neal Browne--currently \nin the Senate Document Room--14 years service--daughter-in-law Lisa \nBrowne, three surviving siblings; Norma Egland, Barbara Fonder, and \nMiles Browne, seven grandchildren; Daniel Bigelow, Thomas, Scott, and \nJoshua Trickett, Adam and Rachel Browne, Skylar Hattrich; and one great \ngrandson, Christopher Bigelow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6193-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6194-S6195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ``IOWA SPIRIT'' SALUTE TO EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for those awaiting the floor, I will \nonly be here for another 3 or 4 minutes. I started a week ago to speak \nabout the 150th anniversary of the State of Iowa, which we are \ncelebrating with a congressional reception on June 26 on The Mall \noutside the Smithsonian Institution. I hope all of my colleagues will \ncome to that and see some of the exhibits over the next 2 weeks \nhonoring our 150th anniversary of our State.\n  I had a chance earlier this week to speak about the only Iowan to \nbecome President, Herbert Hoover. I want to speak today about something \nthat is really great about Iowa, our educational system.\n  Our country's Founding Fathers, of course, had a very clear vision \nabout America's public schools and firmly believed that excellence in \neducation is paramount to the growth and prosperity of America. Iowa \nbenefited from a pattern that was set by the central government, even \nbefore we had a U.S. Constitution, when the Northwest Compact was \nadopted in 1786, when land was set aside for public education in the \nnew territories. That tradition continued west of the Northwest Compact \narea to be included in the traditions of education throughout the upper \nMidwest.\n  Today, in honor of Iowa's sesquicentennial celebration, I am proud to \nbe able to tell you that Iowa's educational system is a working example \nof what our Founders had in mind. Iowa's high standard of excellence in \neducation began in one-room rural school houses on the prairie. That \nsame standard can now be seen in advanced academic settings across our \nState, both in the urban areas as well as the rural areas and small \ntowns of Iowa.\n  The one-room rural school environment ended in the 1950's, but there \nis still the foundation in today's educational system of the personal \ninterest of teacher and student in each other that comes from that one-\nroom rural tradition.\n  Today, though, I am proud to share with you accomplishments of Iowa's \nincreasingly diverse student population. I commend the continued \ndedication to education not only of students and teachers, as I have \nalready said, but of parents and the volunteer school board members as \nwell as school administrators across the State. Their combined daily \nefforts are a key part in the continued success of the Iowa public \nschool system and the Iowa private school system.\n  Iowans are proud of our commitment to quality education for all \nchildren. It is a commitment that has earned national and international \nrespect. Iowa's excellence in education is a direct result of its local \ncontrol of schools and community-level responsibility. For decades, \nIowa students have received the highest quality education and performed \nwell above national averages in academic assessment.\n  It is estimated that 88 percent of Iowa students graduate from high \nschool. What's more, each year Iowa's rate of students pursuing post-\nsecondary education and other post-high school training continues to \ngrow.\n  Iowa's high literacy rate is a key component of the success of Iowa's \nstudents. We rank as No. 1 of the 50 States in literacy. And, \nindividuals in Iowa read more books than those in any other State on a \nper capita basis. The active involvement of some 525 public libraries, \n7 regional libraries, and 62 academic libraries is testimony to Iowa's \ncommitment to the advancement of knowledge.\n  Iowa's young scholars have ranked at the highest level in the Nation \nfor a number of years in college testing assessments. In fact, for 6 of \nthe last 7 years, Iowa has ranked first of all the 50 States in the SAT \ntests--and either first or second vis-a-vis Minnesota or Wisconsin, \ndepending upon what year you are looking at, as tops in the ACT test.\n  In addition to Iowa's 390 public school districts and 235 non-public \nschool districts, educators across the Nation rely on the Iowa Tests of \nBasic Skills and Iowa Tests of Educational Development to assess \nstudent achievement in grades 3 through 12. These two standardized \nachievement tests, developed by the Iowa Testing Program in Iowa City, \nwhere our university is located, provide teachers nationwide with \nunique supplementary information of the students that are in their \norganizations. This information bears on decisions about academic \nobjectives, instructional materials, and learning environments for \nstudents in elementary and secondary schools.\n\n  I also want to acknowledge the proud tradition, although it is a \nrelatively new tradition of about 30 years, of Iowa's 15 community \ncolleges. Prior to the community college we had a student system of \njunior colleges throughout Iowa. But it was not statewide. The \ncommunity college system developed 30 years ago is a statewide system \nof community colleges so that all students throughout the entire State \nof Iowa have access to a community college.\n  Each year, thousands of students in Iowa have successful academic \nexperiences through one of Iowa's 15 community college districts. Last \nyear, over 50 percent of the new freshmen in Iowa colleges and \nuniversities were enrolled at public community colleges. Year after \nyear, these community colleges award thousands of high school \nequivalency GED diplomas for that 12 percent of our students who do not \ngraduate from high school. Iowa's community colleges provide a myriad \nof curricula options for students whether they are seeking a degree or \nwhether they want just a few courses. Our State's community colleges \npromote the concept that is a fact of life in our technological age--\nthat education does not begin at kindergarten and stop with a college \ndegree. Today, for people of all ages, education is a continuing \nprocess throughout life, including the formalized aspect of education \nthat comes through an institution.\n  So access, quality, and responsiveness, are the three fundamental \nconcepts upon which the community colleges' mission was developed and \nthe principles which guide their growth and development that began 30 \nyears\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\nago and is an expanding and more influential aspect of education in \nIowa all the time.\n  Iowa's long history of academic excellence meets the high standards \nthat our Founding Fathers set over 150 years ago when our State was \nestablished. With ongoing dedication from students, parents, teachers \nand school officials, I am confident that Iowa's education system will \ncontinue its path of growth and success as we continue our history and \ndevelopment as a leading State in the Nation.\n  I look forward to these new developments in education for today's \nleaders and future generations of American students.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I preface my comment by joining with my \nfriend and colleague from Iowa, congratulating his great State on the \nsesquicentennial of admission to the Union. As he and I discussed \nbefore, I have a good many relatives who live in his State. I have had \nthe privilege of spending a good bit of time over the years in Iowa. I \nenjoy the State, the people, and, again, I express my congratulations \nto them on the occasion of their celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6194-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6195-S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LEGAL GAMING ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue about which \nmuch has been said recently, the so-called need for a Federal gaming \nstudy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is advised that some \ntime ago we were to have gone to certain Federal Reserve Board \nnominations.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe pending business and that I be able to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair for advising me of the parliamentary \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, I was commenting, we have had much discussion in the \nmedia, on the floor and as part of the national dialog of the need for \na so-called Federal study of gaming. The integrity of the legal, \nlegitimate entertainment industry, one which is of primary importance \nto the economy of my State, has been repeatedly impugned.\n  One Member of the other body took the House floor to call those who \nwork in the gaming entertainment industry a group of ``roaches.''\n  I want to cut through some of this rhetoric and set the record \nstraight. Excessive rhetoric has been used to drown out a constructive \ndialog and a careful deliberation about a legitimate issue: the rapid \ngrowth of gaming across America.\n  Opponents of legalized gaming have resorted to character \nassassination, guilt by association, and distortion of the views of \nthose with whom they disagree.\n  The time, Mr. President, has come to say, ``Enough is enough.''\n  At the outset, it is imperative to step back from this emotional \nrhetoric by gaming critics and to observe that gaming entertainment in \nall forms would not be expanding without demand for this form of \nentertainment. Simply stated, the American consumer, not the \nGovernment, has decided to spend his or her precious recreational \ndollar in this fashion. For example, 30 percent, or 32 million \nhouseholds, made a total of 125 million visits to casinos across \nAmerica in 1994. The total number of casino visits rose to 150 million \nin the following year of 1995. In many respects, this growth in casino \nvisits is not surprising, given the changing nature of gaming \nentertainment in general and casino gaming in particular.\n  Since the late 1980's, casinos have become what the experts \ncharacterize as ``destination resorts'' which offer more than the \nvarious games of chance normally associated with the casino. These \ndestination resorts now offer a range of additional entertainment \nexperiences, including a variety of sporting events and recreational \nactivities, theme dining experiences, unique shopping, Broadway-quality \nshows, and many other attractions.\n  If casino entertainment was not providing solid value for the dollar \nspent, consumers would not be patronizing these establishments. It is \nsomewhat puzzling that those who are defenders of the free market and \nproponents of State regulation are quick to second-guess consumers and \nStates on this policy question.\n  Advocates of legislation to create a Federal gaming study commission \nhave stressed in their public statements and in testimony before \nvarious congressional committees that the limited purpose of this \ncommission was to study the socioeconomic effects of all forms of \ngambling and to give policymakers at the local, State, and Federal \nlevel the data they need to make educated decisions.\n  I might just say parenthetically that there has been no request \ngenerated by local or State government, that I am aware of, of calling \nupon the Federal Government to conduct such a study. But that is \nostensibly what they claim.\n\n  They have consistently emphasized that no one, least of all the legal \ngaming industry, should fear anything that is just a study.\n  Mr. President, the gaming entertainment industry in my own State has \nabsolutely nothing to fear from a fair and unbiased study. Nevada's \ntough regulation has made this industry a model for other States, which \nhave adopted gaming, to follow and, indeed, is an international or \nglobal model.\n  However, what is going on here is a crusade by those who want to \ndestroy an activity that they do not like, and that, Mr. President, is \ndangerous. The principal premise for the proposed commission advanced \nby its antigaming opponents is that States and local governments lack \nthe ability to acquire and act on objective information in the face of \nwell-financed attempts to put casinos in. This simply does not square \nwith reality.\n  No State--and I repeat, Mr. President, no State--has approved new \ncasino gaming for several years. For example, 7 of 10 gaming \ninitiatives were defeated in 1994, and no new casino gaming was \napproved by a new jurisdiction in 1995.\n  Let me just comment parenthetically. From a parochial perspective, \nrepresenting my State, I am not an advocate for the expansion of casino \ngaming in other jurisdictions. But the point needs to be made that that \nis a decision which States, local governments, free from Federal \ninterference, ought to be able to make on its own.\n  Those who have an established agenda decided to elevate this \ncommission from one to study the impact of gaming to one that is \ndesigned to investigate the operation of a legalized gaming industry.\n  While many of those who support a study have good intentions and \nprefer a reasonable approach, they are being drowned out by those \nextremists whose goal is the destruction of this industry. The loudest \nvoices calling for a gaming study are those who want to shut down a \nlegal industry in a State which has chosen to allow gaming. They \nbelieve they possess a superior moral barometer and should tell us what \nis right and what is wrong.\n  They feel the same way on other aspects of our society, and we know \nnot what will be their next target. What I want to do today is to give \nyou a more fair picture of the legal and highly regulated gaming \nindustry in my own State.\n  In Nevada, the gaming entertainment industry provides 43 percent of \nthe $1.2 billion annual State general revenue. This is the source that \nfinances the essential operations of State government; first and \nforemost, education.\n  The gaming entertainment industry accounts for more than 50 percent \nof Nevada's employment, either directly or indirectly. The gaming \nindustry in Nevada has today extensive regulation and oversight, \ninvolving day-to-day onsite supervision by State gaming control \nauthorities, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Treasury Department \nunit which handles currency transaction issues.\n  In fact, when the Treasury Department testified before the U.S. \nSenate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee recently, they had \nhigh praise for the regulation of currency transactions in the State of \nNevada.\n  The regulation of gaming is not perfect. We have worked long and hard \nin Nevada to establish a tough regulatory system that is a model for \nhow such a system should be run.\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\n  The State of Nevada employs 372 regulators and charges the gaming \nindustry $19 million on an annual basis to see that only legitimate \ninterests are involved in gaming and that the games of chance are \nconducted honestly and fairly.\n  Despite Nevada's success with gaming, I would be the first to admit \nthat legalized gaming may not be the best choice for every community, \nand I have repeatedly expressed my concern that Indian gaming \nregulation in some States is far too lax.\n  Some States have unrealistically looked at gaming to solve all of \ntheir financial problems; a panacea, if you will. And some States have \nrushed into gaming without the proper regulatory controls, and the \nresults have been disastrous. Any State or community that chooses to \nlegalize gaming should do so with its eyes open and with a strong \ncommitment to strict regulation and control.\n  I am confident, however, that States are more than qualified to make \nthese type of decisions on their own without the intrusion of the \nFederal Government.\n  I am proud of what I did in Nevada in my 6 years as Governor at a \ntime when the industry worked with me to improve the industry's \noperation. The chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board is Bill \nBible, the son of a highly respected colleague of ours, U.S. Senator \nAlan Bible. Bill Bible is tough, he is honest, and he is effective. \nNevada's gaming regulations reflect his commitment to making sure that \nour industry is regulated completely and thoroughly.\n  The fact is that today the legalized gaming industry is a legitimate \nbusiness, as legitimate as any business on the Fortune 500 list. More \nthan 50 publicly traded companies, all regulated by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, own gaming interests. The financial operations of \nthese concerns are carefully scrutinized by market analysts, market \nregulators and investors of all kinds. All these companies file 10K's, \nor similar forms, with the SEC.\n\n  The stocks of these companies are widely traded on major public stock \nexchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange and overseas markets. \nStocks of gaming and gaming-related companies are broadly held by major \ninstitutional investors, such as pension funds and other retirement-\nrelated funds, including the California Public Employees Retirement \nSystem, the Colorado Public Employees Retirement System, the New York \nState Teachers Retirement Fund, the Wisconsin Investment Board and \nHarvard University.\n  The gaming entertainment industry employs over 1 million people \nthroughout the United States, paying $6.8 billion in salaries in 1994. \nThe industry paid more than $1.4 billion in taxes to State and local \ngovernments in 1995, along with an estimated $6 billion to $7 billion \nmore paid by other forms of gaming entertainment, such as State \nlotteries, sports betting, horse and dog racing.\n  While Las Vegas is proud to be the gaming entertainment capital of \nthe world, Nevada is far from alone as a gaming industry base. Jobs, \nentertainment, taxes and positive economic effects are felt in States \nas economically and politically diverse--New Jersey, Mississippi, \nIllinois, Connecticut, Minnesota and Iowa. Indeed, some forms of gaming \nentertainment are legal in 48 of the 50 States.\n  The industry will spend an estimated $3 billion on new construction \nin 1996, with billions more slated to be spent on construction projects \nover the next several years. This construction creates demands for \ngoods and services sold by companies around the country for everything \nfrom construction materials to architectural services.\n  The true agenda of the industry's critics is an agenda of ending \nlegalized gaming, as the title of the group ``National Coalition \nAgainst Legalized Gaming'' states in bold letters.\n  My response is simple: in this country, adults are free to make their \nown decisions about where, when, and how to spend their entertainment \ndollars.\n  It is indeed ironic, at a time when many decry the power of the \nFederal Government and seek a return to more State and local control \nand personal freedom, that some of the very same people who assert this \nas their philosophy are people who seek to establish a national \ncommission in this case, without requiring involvement of State \ngovernment officials, to determine how best to oversee a State-\nregulated industry.\n  None of this is to suggest that gaming entertainment, like any other \nmajor business, particularly one which hosts millions of visitors each \nyear, does not have its share of public issues and challenges. For \nexample, in all of the recent commentary, little if anything has been \nsaid about the serious effort made by individual companies and the \nindustry as a whole to address concerns about problem gaming.\n  The industry recently announced the creation of a multimillion dollar \ncommitment to the new National Center for Responsible Gaming.\n  The companies involved in gaming entertainment are recognizable names \nlike Hilton, ITT, and Harrah's.\n  These companies engage in a wide range of community activities.\n  These companies are run by highly respected business leaders such as \nTerry Lanni, Bill Bennett, Clyde Turner, Dan Reichartz, Bill Boyd, and \nmany others I could mention who are recognized for the business acumen \nwell beyond gaming circles.\n  When a Member takes the floor to call a hard-working, law abiding \nindustry a group of ``roaches'', it is time for a return to civility, \nto disagreeing without being disagreeable or disingenuous, in order to \npermit a rational debate on matters pertaining to the gaming industry.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nas in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa for \npermitting me to go on his time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6195-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6196-S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF POWER BY THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have learned that an extraordinary \nnumber of highly confidential FBI files were improperly obtained by the \nWhite House. I do not know what I find more appalling: the fact that \nthe White House requested, received and kept the confidential files of \nmore than 300 Reagan and Bush administration workers--that is appalling \nenough--but is that more appalling than the fact that the FBI turned \nthem over to the White House these files without an apparent second \nthought?\n  This latest White House mishap, or snafu, or outrageous abuse of \npower raises serious questions about the White House, the FBI, the \nSecret Service, and the Department of Justice. I cannot help wondering \nif anyone is in charge.\n  I have no doubt that if this kind of misadventure occurred on the \nwatch of a Republican President, it would create a tremendous furor. \nThe irony is that it was discovered during an investigation into the \nTravel Office affair which also involved the admitted misuse of the FBI \nby the White House. It seems as though this White House views the FBI \nas its own personal private investigator. This is the kind of arrogant \nabuse of power that led to the fall of the Nixon White House. Mr. \nPresident, this is what Watergate was all about.\n  FBI files on individuals should be the most private and confidential \nof all documents. They are not compiled for political purposes, and \nthey should never be used for political reasons. They certainly should \nnot be easily provided to partisan political appointees.\n  What was actually in these files? They were summaries of \ncomprehensive FBI files on Reagan and Bush Administration employees \nwhose last names began with the letters A though G. They include James \nA. Baker, former White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of State in \nthe Bush administration. They include another former chief of staff of \nthe White House, Ken Duberstein; and the fired Travel Office Director \nBill Dale.\n  These files contained summaries of interviews with neighbors, \nfriends, coworker going way back to the high school years of those upon \nwhom the files were complied. Some of those interviewed might be \nindividuals with\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\nan ax to grind. They can contain any bizarre allegation that such an \nindividual may concoct. This is the type of information that the \nClinton White House thought should be trusted to a low-level civilian \ndetailed from the Army who answered to a partisan, political appointee.\n  This all come up because of the inability of the White House to admit \nthat it fired Billy Dale to make room for the President's Arkansas \ncousin and his Hollywood friends. For months, the White House has \nrefused to comply with the Clinger committee's subpoena of all \ndocuments related to the Travel Office firings. When Billy Dale cried \nfoul upon learning that his FBI file had been turned over to the White \nHouse, the White House claimed it received his file as part of a \nroutine investigation of employees. That was the original explanation. \nSuddenly the Billy Dale file shows up in the White House. How did it \nget there? As part of a routine investigation of an employee? Then the \nstory changed. The White House tried to claim that it was not its \nrequest after all. The GAO had asked for the FBI files. ``No, no, no,'' \nsaid the GAO, ``not us!'' Suddenly the whole thing became an innocent \nmistake that involves trampling on the fundamental right to privacy of \n330 loyal public servants.\n  I applaud Representative Clinger, chairman of the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and Oversight, for his commitment to untangling this \nweb of misinformation, claims of executive privilege, and \nrationalizations. I believe that his matter is serious enough to \nwarrant a full congressional investigation. Unfortunately, this White \nHouse has dodged the truth for too long.\n  I remember when an overzealous Bush supporter, Elizabeth Tamposi, who \nwas an Assistant Secretary of State, decide to search the passport \nrecords of a young Governor from Arkansas, Bill Clinton. The press was \noutraged. Bill Clinton was outraged, but, most of all, President Bush \nwas outraged. He fired Elizabeth Tamposi.\n  What have we heard from this administration about this latest \nscandal? Mark Fabiani, a White House attorney hired to answer questions \nabout Whitewaster and the Travel Office matter, believing that the best \ndefense is a good offense, said, ``Instead of attacking, Clinger and \nSpeaker Gingrich should be apologizing.'' Now that is chutzpa if I ever \nheard it.\n  This is a serious matter Mr. President. We cannot have the FBI used \nas a private research agency for the White House. I think this matter \nneeds immediate attention.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and again want to thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa for permitting me to go before him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6196-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6197-S6213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF ALAN GREENSPAN, OF NEW YORK, TO BE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD \n               OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the nomination of Alan Greenspan, to be Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve System. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Alan Greenspan, of New York, to \nbe Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for \na term of 4 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Under the previous order, \ntime is equally divided under the control of Senator D'Amato and \nSenator Harkin. Senator Harkin is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, finally we have gotten to the nomination \nof Alan Greenspan to be Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I have \nbeen waiting for several months for this opportunity, to have the \nopportunity to debate not just the nomination but what this nomination \nmeans for the American people.\n  I am very pleased that we finally have a reasonable opportunity to \ndebate this nomination, the nomination of the most important \nPresidential nomination to come before this Congress, the nomination of \nAlan Greenspan to serve as Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. I \nhave been pushing for this debate for months, and I want to thank the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders for scheduling this 3-day debate.\n  This debate about Chairman Greenspan's policies and their impact on \nour economy, about how we can get our economy to grow faster, about how \nwe can create more jobs and raise incomes, zeros in on the most \nimportant issues that we face.\n  Before we get into substance, I want to be clear about one thing. \nThis issue has never been about personalities. It is about policy. It \nis about making sure that this body gives thorough consideration to the \nnomination of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, the single \nmost important economic decisionmaker in our land.\n  Over the course of today and tomorrow and next Thursday, I and others \non our side hope to cover at least the following areas.\n  First, we want to talk about a policy of growth versus a policy of no \ngrowth that has been prevalent at the Fed for the last several years \nand that is prevalent today. We wish to talk about the record of Alan \nGreenspan. I will go into his record at some length. Why? Because he \nhas been Chairman of the Fed now for two terms.\n  I think it is legitimate for us to ask: Has his stewardship, has his \nrunning of the Federal Reserve, been such that we, the Congress and the \nSenate, should reward him with another 4-year term? We would ask that \nof any person nominated by the President to fill an important position. \nWe certainly should ask it of Alan Greenspan and look at his record.\n  Third, we hope to talk about the impact on our budget and what we do \nhere over the next several years and the impact on our economy of \ndecisions made by the Federal Reserve Board, especially the Open Market \nCommittee.\n  Fourth, a recent GAO study that recently came out in preliminary \nform--the final version of that, I guess, will be out next Thursday--I \nbelieve raises substantial questions about how the Federal Reserve \nSystem is operating. Let us also be clear about another thing, Mr. \nPresident. The Federal Reserve Board is a creature of Congress.\n  Yes, it is independent, and I believe it should be independent, but \nit is not a separate branch of Government enshrined in the \nConstitution. It is not like the judiciary or like the executive branch \nor the legislative branch. It is, in whole, a creature of the U.S. \nCongress. As such, it must be responsive to the Congress, responsive to \nthe American people through Congress. I believe it is our duty to \nexamine closely the policies of the Federal Reserve and to suggest \nthrough the legislative process changes that we may wish to make in the \nFederal Reserve System.\n  I will be talking about one thing later, for example, the fact that \nthe minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee are held secret for 5 \nyears. Why 5 years? Maybe there is a legitimate reason to keep them \nwithheld for a period of time, but certainly not 5 years. I think that \nneeds to be reexamined. Maybe 1 year, but not 5 years. Having said \nthat, I will say we have gone back in the minutes of 5 years, 8 years, \nand 10 years ago and looked at the minutes, that quite frankly revealed \nsome pretty interesting comments by the nominee now before the Senate. \nWe will be talking about that at some length later, also. Those are the \nitems we wish to cover in this debate.\n  Again, I want to thank both the Republican and Democratic leaders for \nworking this out. It is something that is going to take some time \nbecause this is a complex subject, but, I believe, a very important \nsubject, one that really ought to command the attention not only of the \nSenate, but of the American people.\n  The real point, I believe here, Mr. President, is to start a national \ndialog and to deliberate and not simply rubberstamp this important \nnomination, as well as other nominations to the Federal Reserve. The \nChairman is the single most important. Again, I think that is our duty \nand our obligation. Let me say I consider this debate that we begin \ntoday a victory for this body and a victory for the American people. So \nwe did not just rubberstamp and put someone through of this importance \nwithout raising serious policy questions about the Federal Reserve and \nhow it is operated.\n\n[[Page S6198]]\n\n  Mr. President, raising the living standards and real wages of \nordinary Americans stands as our primary economic challenge. The policy \nof the Federal Reserve under Chairman Greenspan has stood in the way. \nUnder current law, the Federal Reserve is obligated to conduct a \nbalanced monetary policy, so as to reconcile reasonable price stability \nwith full employment and strong, stable, economic growth, and balance. \nBut under the Greenspan Fed, job growth and the living standards of \naverage Americans have been sacrificed in the blind pursuit of \ninflation control. The Greenspan Fed has raised interest rates not when \ninflation was knocking at the door or threatening, but when there was \nnot even any specter of inflation.\n  In 1994, in the midst of six straight rate increases, Chairman \nGreenspan himself acknowledged there was no evidence of rising \ninflation. Mr. President, I raise a lot of eyebrows at a lot of \nmeetings when I talk about the Fed and why I wanted to have this \ndebate. When I tell people, Mr. President, in 1 year, from February \n1994 to February 1995, that Alan Greenspan raised interest rates 100 \npercent, people look at me like I arrived from another planet. They \nsay, ``That is impossible.'' It is true. Look at the record. The \nFederal funds rate went from 3 percent in February 1994 to 6 percent in \n1995, a 100-percent increase in 1 year, with no inflation threatening. \nI will have more to say about that later. Since that time, it has only \ncome down three-quarters of a point. Again, no inflation threatening. I \nbelieve that is leading this country to an economy where we see more \nand more millionaires every month, but average working families are \nstuck in a rut. They are working harder, spouses are working, and yet \nthey are not getting ahead. I will have more data on that as we go \nthrough the debate in terms of what wage increases have been in the \nlast few months, several months, last couple of years, what prices have \ndone, to show the average working family is not only not getting ahead, \nthey are falling behind in this great economy. Our stores are chock \nfull of goods, and yet for some reason, the American family is not \ngetting ahead.\n\n  One of the reasons they are not getting ahead is because their debt \nload is too great. We hear a lot of talk around here about cutting \ntaxes, because the American people feel they are overburdened with \ntaxes. They do and they are. I submit there is another burden that they \nare carrying that is weighing them down, and that is the burden of debt \nand the high interest rates that they are paying. There is no reason \nfor those high interest rates now. Again, I intend to go into this in \ngreat depth over the next few days. Mr. President, 100-percent increase \nin interest rates in 1 year, and they are still there.\n  Mr. President, the decisions of a Fed Chairman touch every pocketbook \nand every family budget in America. The decisions of this Chairman have \ncost American families in lost wages and lost opportunities. The \nGreenspan Fed has stifled economic growth and the incomes of average \nAmericans. Interest rates have been kept artificially high, and middle-\nclass families and businesses have been forced to pay the price. It is \ntime for the Federal Reserve to pursue a more balanced policy based on \nraising economic growth and increasing jobs alongside continued \nvigilance against inflation.\n  America at this point in our history ought to have a forward-looking \nFed Chairman who recognizes the importance of expanding opportunities \nfor our economy and our people in today's global market. We do not live \nin the 1970's. We have changed considerably since that time. We need \nstrong leadership, committed to higher growth and incomes, fuller \nemployment, and lower, more stable interest rates to improve the \nquality of life for average Americans. We have not gotten that with \nAlan Greenspan. There is what I call a common thread, Mr. President, in \nthe thinking and the actions, and the policies of Mr. Greenspan over \nthe years. It did not start yesterday. It will not end tomorrow or next \nweek.\n  Ripe from his days as Chairman of the Counsel of Economic Advisers \nunder President Ford, until today, Mr. Greenspan has consistently shown \nthe same two tendencies, as evidenced by the public record. First, he \noften misjudges the signs of an oncoming recession. Second, he does not \nact decisively enough to pull the economy out of recession because of \nan inordinate fear of inflation.\n  Again, I will discuss both of these issues in greater detail \nthroughout my remarks. Let me ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at this point, Mr. President, a guest editorial that was in \nthe Investor's Business Daily, May 1, 1996. It is headlined \n``Greenspan's Rotten Record,'' by Mr. Don Hays. I do not know Mr. Hays.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Investor's Business Daily, May 1, 1996]\n\n                       Greenspan's Rotten Record\n\n                             (By Don Hays)\n\n       We may have an exciting new contrary indicator: Alan \n     Greenspan's predictions. Our search of the record has never \n     found him to be right about what the economy, inflation or \n     interest rates were going to do.\n       We could go back further, but let's begin with a much-noted \n     1981 speech. As a private and well-connected economist, \n     Greenspan declared that inflation would not decline anytime \n     soon. Whoops--inflation was about to drop from 12% a year \n     down to 4%.\n       In 1982, he wrote a letter of commendation for Charles \n     Keating. He also made an impassioned plea to Congress, asking \n     for more freedom for the savings and loan industry. Years \n     later, the S went bust at great cost to the taxpayers. \n     Keating wound up in jail.\n       The same year, Greenspan's published economic forecast said \n     bond yields would fall \\1/4\\% from the previous year-end \n     level. In fact, they fell 3\\1/2\\%.\n       But the drop in inflation was only temporary, he argued in \n     May 1983. The extraordinary Volcker-induced inflation calm, \n     he insisted, was about to end. In fact, inflation stayed \n     quite steady at 4% through 1987 and the end of the Volcker \n     regime.\n       Also in 1983, Greenspan said long-term interest rates would \n     increase 20 basis points. This proved to be his best forecast \n     ever: Rates did rise--but by 1%, not the meager 0.2% he \n     predicted.\n       At the start of 1984, he forecast that for the next three \n     years, bond yields would rise from 5 to 55 basis points. They \n     actually dropped each year, from 123 to 199 basis points.\n       Perhaps because he spent more time schmoozing the halls of \n     the White House and Congress than he did in his office, in \n     1987 Greenspan was chosen to be chairman of the Federal \n     Reserve Board. He promptly got in a contest with the \n     Bundesbank to see who could raise interest rates faster, and \n     also squabbled flagrantly with Treasury Secretary James \n     Baker. Some would argue that the conditions fostered by these \n     conflicts ultimately let to the October 1987 stock market \n     crash.\n       Greenspan answered the crash with a flood of monetary \n     easing. But by mid-88, he was right back to the battle, \n     raising the fed funds level from 6% to 9\\3/8\\% by mid 1980.\n       He seemed to think this famine-feast-famine was just the \n     thing for the economy. In February 1990, he told Congress the \n     economic weakness had stopped. In fact, it continued to \n     weaken, and a recession began in August.\n       On top of his chaotic monetary reversals, he launched a \n     regulatory war. In 1990-91, he bought the claim that banks \n     held too many real estate loans. In concert with Treasury, he \n     sent swat teams of auditors through the banking system, \n     totally wrecking banks sentiment to loan.\n       As a result, when Greenspan tried to drive the economy away \n     from the ditch he had steered it into in 1992 and 1993, he \n     found the vehicle extremely sluggish, unresponsive to the \n     lower fed funds rate. He had to ratchet them down until he'd \n     achieved the steepest yield curve in history. With short-term \n     rates at 3% and the long bond up close to 8%, Orange County \n     and many corporations and hedge funds leveraged their bond \n     positions to the hilt.\n       Let's jump ahead to a more recent example. In 1995, a sales \n     slump moved auto dealers to offer the biggest rebates in \n     history to tempt consumers. In September, Greenspan saw the \n     temporary hike in auto sales in his rear-view mirror--and \n     declared that his monetary policy and the economy were right \n     on track. So he refused to lower interest rates. That \n     Christmas was the weakest in at least four years. Judging by \n     the bellwether Wal-Mart earnings, it could be argued that it \n     was the weakest in 25 years.\n       Greenspan's rear-view mirror finally cleared up in late \n     December, with the economy about to drive once again into the \n     ditch. He reversed course, cutting interest rates by \\1/4\\% \n     in December and again in January.\n       It looks like we can go in a direction always opposite to \n     Greenspan's current message and look like an economic genius.\n       So why did Republicans leave President Clinton no choice \n     but to reappoint Greenspan? Maybe they thought Clinton should \n     have to suffer the same election-year treatment the Fed chief \n     had dished out to GOP presidents. More likely, they are just \n     more proof of his amazing ability to mesmerize the herd--\n     despite a record that has virtually never been right.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to read a few of the lines from this editorial.\n\n       We may have an exciting new contrary indicator: Alan \n     Greenspan's predictions. Our\n\n[[Page S6199]]\n\n     search of the record has never found him to be right about \n     what the economy, inflation or interest rates were going to \n     do.\n       We could go back further back, but let's begin with a much \n     noted-1981 speech. As a private and well-connected economist, \n     Greenspan declared that inflation would not decline any time \n     soon. Whoops, inflation was about to drop from 12 percent a \n     year down to 4 percent.\n       In 1982 he wrote a letter of commendation for Charles \n     Keating. He also made an impassioned plea to Congress, asking \n     for more freedom for the savings and loan industry. Years \n     later, the S's went bust at great cost to the taxpayers. \n     Keating wound up in jail.\n       The same year, Mr. Greenspan's published economic forecasts \n     said bond yields would fall one-quarter of a percent from the \n     previous year-end level. In fact, they fell 3\\1/2\\ percent.\n       But the drop in inflation was only temporary, he argued in \n     May of 1983. The extraordinary Volcker-induced inflation \n     calm, he insisted, was about to end. In fact, inflation \n     stayed quite steady at 4 percent through 1987 and the end of \n     the Volcker regime.\n       Also in 1983, Mr. Greenspan said long-term interest rates \n     would increase 20 basis points. This proved to be his best \n     forecast ever: Rates did rise--but by 1 percent, not the \n     meager .2 percent that he predicted.\n       At the start of 1984, he forecast that for the next 3 years \n     bond yields would rise from 5 to 55 basis points.\n\n  Listen to this. At the start of 1984, he forecast that for the next 3 \nyears bond yields would rise from 5 to 55 basis points. They actually \ndropped each year from 123 to 199 basis points.\n  Well, the article goes on. I will have more to say about this \narticle. I do not know the author of the article, but he correctly, I \nthink, captured the record of Mr. Greenspan.\n  Again, I want to talk about this because the bottom line is that \nChairman Greenspan has this long history of focusing solely on \ninflation to such an extent that all focus on expanding our economy has \nbeen lost.\n  So what do we have today? We have a mindset at the Fed that 2-percent \ngrowth is acceptable--2 percent--that the economy cannot grow any \nfaster; maybe 2.5, but that is getting close to the limits, but that we \ncannot have the 3-percent growth of the 1970's or the 4 percent growth \nof the 1960's. That is the mindset at the Fed.\n  Mr. President, I believe we ought to do more to promote stronger \neconomic growth, and at the very least we should not put our economy in \na harness when there is such a tremendous potential for growth in \nAmerica today. Saying that America can grow at 2 or 2.5 percent is like \nsaying that we are going to accept a C average when we know we can do a \nB-plus or an A. I would not let my kids get by with that, and neither \nwould you, and neither would anyone else. We should not let America get \nharnessed in these shackles when all of the indications are out there \nthat, with a better monetary policy at the Fed, our manufacturing \nsector will expand, we will get new plant and new equipment, we will \nhave some wage growth for average working families that will not be \ninflationary, and our farmers will be able to have a better deal, \nbecause they borrow a lot of money, and especially our small main \nstreet businesses. They are the ones in our main streets of our small \ntowns that have to borrow money at higher rates of interest. They need \na break, too. It is small businesses that employ most of the people, \nthe ones that are getting the new jobs out there. They should not be \nshackled by this low-growth mentality that we see evidenced by the \nChairman of the Fed.\n  I urged President Clinton to appoint someone with a greater \norientation toward economic growth, someone with a greater concern for \nthe need to increase the incomes of average Americans, and someone who \nwould strive toward keeping the unemployment low.\n  There is a constant flow of articles written about relatively minor \nchanges in tax policy or in the amount of spending for a number of \nrelatively trivial Federal programs. Yet, the questions of our monetary \npolicy and what we do about the supply of money and interest rates are \njust not being written about or discussed. That is one of the reasons I \ntook the position which I did when this nomination came to the Senate \nback in March--that we needed articles written about him, that we \nneeded voices heard around the country to start talking about the \nmonetary policy of the Fed, to bring it out of the shadows and into the \nsunlight. We have seen more and more articles and more and more \neconomists speaking out and business people speaking out saying that we \nought to have a better growth policy at the Fed.\n  Because of the huge deficits run up in the 1980's to the present, \nfiscal policy changes in the amount of Government spending and taxes \nhave become pretty ineffective in our efforts to stimulate the economy \nduring poor economic times. We cannot afford to increase the deficit \neven when we are entering a recession. One of the reasons, I feel, for \nreaching a balanced budget and then to perhaps run a small surplus is \nso that we can restore this capability--this capability of the Federal \nGovernment to be able to respond to recessions in a meaningful manner. \nSo with such a huge deficit and high debt load, we cannot do that. We \nneed to get to that balanced budget and reduce the debt load of the \nUnited States so that we can begin to invest more in our \ninfrastructure. I do not mean just our physical infrastructure; I mean \nour human infrastructure such as education.\n\n  This dependence that we have today on monetary policy and the extent \nthat we have any control over it whatsoever is set by the Federal \nReserve System. There is little doubt that the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve and the policies he espouses are crucial to our economy.\n  What will be the balance between our concerns for inflation and our \nconcern about economic growth and unemployment? Rising interest rates \nmean a tremendous downward pressure causing the economy to slow. Higher \ninterest rates mean higher costs of doing business, or running a farm. \nIt means smaller profits. It means buying a home or a car is more \ndifficult for working families. If you have an adjustable rate \nmortgage, as more and more people do these days, it means a bigger \nchunk of money will be going to the mortgage and less money will be \navailable to your family for other needs like education. It also means \nwe have rising interest rates; high interest rates. It means more \nunemployed people and the social unrest and harm that this causes.\n  When we talk about family values, few things are as destructive to a \nfamily as unemployment. It strains marriages, causes divorces, and our \nchildren suffer. This stricture on our monetary policy also means fewer \npay increases and a lower standard of living even for those who do not \nlose their jobs. People ask a lot of times, and I read articles, about \nwhy in America today with our seemingly wonderful economy that the \nstores are full of goods, and prices in most cases are pretty decent, \nwhy is it that there seems to be this unrest among the American people? \nMr. President, it was there in 1992. It was there in 1994, and it is \nstill there in 1996. It can all be summed up by saying that the average \nworking families are stagnant in their incomes. Their wages are not \nincreasing as fast as prices. They are incurring more and more of a \ndebt load and paying higher and higher interest rates for the money \nthey borrow. I believe this is leading to great social unrest and will \ncontinue to lead to great social unrest unless we have a change in \nmonetary policy at the Fed.\n  Federal Reserve policy has a considerable impact on the health of the \neconomy, the level of unemployment, and the ability of average \nAmericans to improve their incomes.\n  So I am happy to say that I have seen some increase in the number of \nsubstantive articles in this area over the past few months. I believe \nthat is one of the benefits of the delay that we have had. I hope that \nwe see more articles in the future.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Greenspan has had a long history in key economic \npositions; as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under \nPresident Ford, and as Chairman of the Federal Reserve since 1987. He \nis a known quantity. He is, I believe, proud of his reputation as a so-\ncalled inflation hawk. By that I mean he consistently emphasizes the \nneed to fight inflation. Unfortunately, his policies seem cold to the \nneeds of families to see a little more income come in and to not lose \ntheir job. I am not saying he does not care. I am just saying that his \norientation toward fighting inflation is, in my view, almost obsessive. \nIt seems to blind him to the need to react to signs of recession or to \nthe societal inequities that his policies lead to.\n  Mr. President, the current law of the land is that the Federal \nReserve is to\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\nbalance concerns about inflation on the one side and full employment \nand production on the other. These goals are in law, placed in law by \nthe Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. It is still the \nlaw of the land.\n\n  Prior to the 1978 act, I understand there was no specific mention of \ninflation in the law at all. It was not in the Employment Act of 1946 \nor laws prior to that, going all the way to the founding law of the \nFederal Reserve in 1913.\n  Now Mr. Greenspan wants to overturn that balance. He actually \nsupports the concept of eliminating the requirement that the Federal \nReserve consider the need for full employment and production. He wants \nto focus solely on the goal of very low inflation. That is not a \nbalanced policy, in my view, and I think we need, at this point in our \nhistory, a Federal Reserve Chairman with more balance.\n  Mr. President, I now want to get back to looking at the results of \nsome of Mr. Greenspan's policies at the Federal Reserve and what have \nbeen the results of his policies during his tenure at the Federal \nReserve System. I have a series of charts and some other things I would \nlike to refer to here at this point in time.\n  Let us take a look, first, at this chart. This is, ``Economic \nPerformance Under Greenspan.'' We have compared the years 1959 through \n1987, in aggregate, versus his tenure at the Fed from 1987 to the \npresent. We have different indices here. We have: GDP, real GDP, income \nper capita, payroll jobs, and productivity. The green bar represents \nthe pre-Greenspan years. The orange bar depicts the Greenspan years.\n  Let us look at real GDP. During the years, cumulative years--and \nthere were some that were pretty bad in there, too. There were some \ngood and some bad. But during the years prior to Mr. Greenspan, real \nGDP averaged 3.4 percent per year. That is from 1959. The only reason \nwe picked 1959 is because we changed the way we calculate the GDP. \nThose figures only go back to 1959. GDP averaged 3.4 percent. Under Mr. \nGreenspan, it has only averaged 2.2 percent growth, in real GDP.\n  Let us look at per capita income. The average prior to Mr. \nGreenspan's tenure, 2.5 percent growth in per capita income; under Mr. \nGreenspan, 1.2 percent average growth in per capita income.\n  Let us look at payroll jobs, growth of jobs, new jobs. Prior to Mr. \nGreenspan, an annual average of 2.4 percent growth in new jobs; with \nMr. Greenspan, 1.7 percent growth in real jobs.\n  But this is one of the most telling of all, and that is the last bar \non this graph. It has to do with productivity. Productivity prior to \nMr. Greenspan averaged 2.3 percent. Under him, it has averaged 1.1 \npercent. That is crucial. It is through productivity growth that we get \nour ability to increase incomes of people with little inflation risk.\n  I suppose there are some who say there are other reasons for this. \nThat may be true that there are other factors that influence this, but \nI believe that in each one of these, the key, let us say the one domino \nthat you push that knocks over all the rest, is the actions taken by \nthe Federal Reserve in each one of these areas, because it has to do \nwith the monetary policy and what our monetary policy is.\n  I would like to turn to another chart, which was in an article \nwritten by Rosanne Cahn. I will read parts of that article. This \narticle was in a publication, issued by CS First Boston. This is an \neconomic treatise put out by CS First Boston, May 31, 1996, by Ms. \nRosanne Cahn. Again, I do not know Ms. Cahn. Let me read some of this \nbefore I turn to the chart, because it will tell you what this chart \nshows. Ms. Kahn writes, in the May 31, 1996, CS First Boston report on \nthe economy, ``Grow Is Not a Four-Letter Word.''\n\n       The Federal Reserve acts like it's wrong for the economy to \n     grow at a reasonable rate. The bond market, conditioned by a \n     stern parent, deteriorates so rapidly in response to strong \n     growth that it may not even be necessary for the Fed to raise \n     short-term rates anymore. Like a child catching itself in a \n     naughty deed, it punishes itself by sitting in the corner in \n     advance of a parent's reprimand.\n       Between 1950 and 1989, U.S. annual growth averaged 3.6 \n     percent, with one-third of the years above 4 percent. The \n     1990's, at a 1.8 percent average annual rate, have been the \n     slowest 6-year period since 1950.\n\n  We wonder why there is unrest around America?\n\n       The immediate post-war recession and the beginning of the \n     Great Depression were the only 6-year periods with worse \n     records since 1929. The rate that rocked the bond market this \n     year was first published at 2.8 percent. . . .\n\n  That was first quarter. I remember when it came out, oh, my gosh, a \nhuge surge in growth, 2.8 percent. Later on we found out that it had to \nbe revised down to 2.3 percent. Ms. Cahn asked, ``Can't we grow faster \nwithout jacking up bond yields by a percentage point?'' These are not \nthis Senator's words. These are words written by Rosanne Cahn in this \narticle.\n\n       Chairman Alan Greenspan's record on growth is the worst of \n     all post-war Fed Chairmen, with no meaningful progress on \n     inflation.\n\n  Maybe, Mr. Greenspan argued, we have not had growth because we have \nhad great progress on inflation. Well, that is not so. As shown, growth \nduring his leadership has been, as I pointed out on the earlier chart, \na paltry 2.2 percent--right down here, real GDP growth, 2.2 percent, \nwith inflation in the year before he took over at 4.1 percent and \ninflation averaging 3.2 percent.\n  Paul Volcker, right before him, real GDP growth, 2.5 percent, kind of \npaltry but a little bit better than Greenspan's. But look what Mr. \nVolcker did with inflation. You can say, ``Yeah, he didn't have much \ngrowth,'' but look at inflation. The year before he came in, inflation \nwas 13.2 percent. He brought it down to 6.2 percent during his term. He \ncut it in half.\n  If you go back through, you can see the same thing. What has happened \nis in each of these cases--then you see here the real higher GDP growth \nrates during the other terms--what happened is that Mr. Greenspan \nreally has not cut inflation by that much, but he has stifled the \neconomy with low growth.\n  So, if we are going to be suffering with low growth, well, inflation \n4.1, we should probably be down to zero inflation. We are not. So, \nagain, we are suffering low growth without any real attack on inflation \nand no real headway made there at all.\n  Ms. Cahn goes on to say:\n\n       Some would assert that the U.S. economy's rate of expansion \n     is constrained by its maturity. That argument has been made \n     throughout history.\n\n  I particularly like this part.\n\n       For example, after the invention of the wheel, cavepeople \n     presumably thought that there was nothing more they needed. \n     Today, penetration of cellular phones and home computers is \n     low, so buying them should keep consumers busy until the next \n     new products/services are invented.\n       By some measure, there's not much wrong with the U.S. \n     economy. For example, full employment has been achieved \n     according to some experts. Why quibble over one percent? \n     Anyone who is willing to give up a percentage point per year \n     of income growth for the next six years can stop reading now. \n     Multiply that by 100 million households and it adds up to \n     real money.\n       Other wonderful things happen with a strong economy. The \n     Federal budget deficit shrinks . . . For example, if growth \n     were 1 percentage point per year faster for the next 6 years, \n     that would reduce the deficit by $120 billion, according to \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, or bring it \n     close to balance.\n       Households' debt problems evaporate if incomes grow without \n     new debt being added. Income distribution disparities might \n     or might not narrow, depending on structural factors behind \n     the higher growth. However, the poor would certainly become \n     less poor as the economy expanded rapidly.\n       So what is the problem? Why not go for growth?\n\n  Ms. Cahn goes on to say:\n\n       Prices are determined by the intersection of supply and \n     demand. As demand gets closer to supply, inflation heats up. \n     Inflation is bad because it allegedly causes distortions in \n     the economy, and eventually accelerates enough to destabilize \n     the economy. Most problems caused by inflation are infeasible \n     to quantify; many are subtle or hidden. Therefore, no one has \n     taken a stab at measuring the costs of inflation. However, \n     adults who lived through the 1970s and early-1980s recognize \n     double-digit inflation imposes serious burdens on the U.S. \n     economy.\n       Without quantifying the cost of inflation, it is impossible \n     to determine the rational policy choice between inflation and \n     growth.\n       Besides, no one knows what number to put on full resource \n     utilization, though many will argue vigorously for or against \n     a specific one. In 1993 most analysts contend that NAIRU \n     (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) was above \n     6 percent; now some say 6 percent and many say 5\\1/2\\ \n     percent. In mid-1960s, debate focused on 5 percent, 4\\1/2\\ \n     percent and 4 percent.\n       The policy dilemma is compounded by the long lag between \n     when the economy reaches full employment and when wage \n     inflation picks up.\n\n[[Page S6201]]\n\n       Under such uncertainty, what is a wise monetary policymaker \n     to do? We'll never know, because the Feds' anti-inflationary \n     fervor is more religious than intellectual.\n       Even if the above difficulties are serious, perhaps there \n     is a more favorable inflation/employment trade-off than the \n     Fed will allow, without taking too much risk in the area of \n     uncertainty.\n\n  I think what Ms. Cahn basically has said here is that you have to \nhave a balance, you have to have a balance between caution on inflation \nand making sure that we have adequate growth, and to just have this \nalmost religious fervor against inflation can send us into a tailspin \nin terms of real GDP growth per capita income and the well-being of \nworking Americans.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk just a minute more about NAIRU, the \nnonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, and what that means. A \nlot of people say, ``Well, we can't have lower unemployment because \nthat will push wages up and that will cause inflation.'' Maybe that \nmight have been true in the sixties, and it may have been true in the \nseventies, but we live in a different global economy today that a \nlesser unemployment rate and concurrently some wage increases for hard-\nworking Americans can be offset.\n  We are in a global market. If they push too high, obviously \nbusinesses will tend to take their jobs offshore. Likewise, if the \nprice of goods gets too high because the supply and demand is getting \ntoo close, well, then, because of the global economy, more goods can \ncome in from overseas. So we do not have the kind of economic mix that \nwe had in the sixties and seventies.\n  I might add one other thing. We did not have in those years either \nthe kind of mass marketing and mass wholesaling that we have today, \nlike the Wal-Mart syndrome that we have in America today. That, too, \nacts as a buffer, as a damper on the push on inflation if, in fact, \nsupply and demand gets too close.\n  I now want to turn to a couple of articles by Mr. Felix Rohatyn. The \nfirst appeared in Time magazine in May, May 20, 1996. Mr. Rohatyn is a \nwell-respected investment banker, perhaps the best kind of an \neconomist, not one who lives in an ivory tower but one who is out there \nin the real world and has been very successful in what he does.\n  I first met Mr. Rohatyn over 20 years ago. Actually it has been 21 \nyears ago, I think, when I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. I represented a very rural district in Iowa, and that \nwas about the time when New York City needed some help from the Federal \nGovernment in order to avoid defaulting in its financial obligations. I \ndid not have much interest in that. In fact, I was predisposed to vote \nagainst the so-called bailout of New York City.\n  Then Mr. Rohatyn--I do not know what his position was at the time--\ncame down to speak to us on behalf of the city government of New York \nCity at the time. For a very then-young freshman Member of the House of \nRepresentatives who was very much predisposed to vote against a bailout \nof New York City, I listened with great attention to what Mr. Rohatyn \nhad to say about New York, why it was in the position it was in, how it \nwas going to get out, why it was in the best interest of our country to \npass the New York City bailout bill and how New York would pay back \nevery dime on the dollar and how it would lead to greater growth in the \nfuture for that city.\n  I voted for the New York City bailout. It probably was not the \nsmartest thing for a Congressman from a rural district in Iowa to do, \nbut I did, and I defended it.\n  It turns out he was right and we were right to do what we did at that \ntime. So I have had a great deal of respect for Mr. Rohatyn over all \nthose years, because I felt he had a commonsense, hands-on judgment of \nreally what was happening in the marketplace. I believe he understands \neconomics very well, but he understands it both in the theoretical \naspect and in the actual aspect.\n  The one thing I have always admired about Mr. Rohatyn is that he has \nalways believed that America can do better, that we can grow better and \nnot be just obsessed with the fear of inflation.\n  Anyway on May 20, in Time magazine Mr. Rohatyn wrote the following--I \nwill not read it all, but I think there are some passages in here I \nwant to read for the Record. The title is ``Fear of Inflation Is \nStifling the Nation. An outdated obsession is depriving us of greater \nwealth.''\n  Mr. Rohatyn writes, on May 20, not even a month ago--\n\n       As recently as March, most observers were concerned that \n     the economy might be headed for recession. Many expected the \n     Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Suddenly the great \n     concern is that the economy may be growing too fast. Earlier \n     this month, the Commerce Department reported that the economy \n     grew at a rate of 2.8% during the first quarter of the year. \n     The bond and stock markets treated this very good news as if \n     it were an unwelcome visitor, and declined sharply. Fickle \n     behavior in financial markets is nothing new, but this latest \n     episode illustrates a deeper problem.\n       It has become an article of faith among policymakers and on \n     Wall Street that if the economy grows at an annual rate above \n     2% or 2\\1/2\\%, inflation will rise, perhaps uncontrollably. \n     As illustrated by recent events, such conventional wisdom has \n     become almost a self-fulfilling limitation. When growth rises \n     above this level, investors, spooked by a belief that the \n     Federal Reserve will soon be ``forced'' to raise short-term \n     interest rates in order to prevent an outbreak of inflation, \n     rush to sell bonds. This pushes long-term interest rates up. \n     The result is that prospects for future growth are dampened.\n\n  And he points out parenthetically--``(And should the Fed do nothing, \nbondholders sell because they fear the central bank is no longer \nvigilant against inflation.)''\n\n       The irony is that these economic statistics, which so \n     frightened the markets, actually tell us that higher growth \n     is possible without inflation. The real rate of inflation for \n     the first quarter was 2.1%, with no sign of any upward \n     pressure; actual growth was understated because of the \n     General Motors strike and the winter blizzard. And remember, \n     inflation statistics are generally believed to be overstated \n     at least 0.5%.\n\n  So perhaps the real rate of inflation was not 2.1 percent. It could \nhave been closer to about 1.5 or 1.6 percent.\n\n       What the first-quarter results make clearer is that the \n     economy can grow more than 3% while holding real inflation \n     below 2%. The same can be said about unemployment. The latest \n     unemployment figures came in at 5.4%; that's well below the \n     6% unemployment figure that is supposed to trigger inflation \n     through demands for higher wages, according to the standard \n     view.\n\n  That is the NAIRU view.\n\n     . . . This view fails to take into account the forces of \n     global competition. American workers no longer compete for \n     jobs only with one another, but with workers worldwide, and \n     that tends to dampen wage demands at home. Wage inflation is \n     not a real threat, but we keep treating it as such.\n       Sure, one quarter isn't a trend, but there is nothing in \n     these numbers to provoke fear of inflation; on the contrary, \n     they should have been the basis for satisfaction and the \n     determination to do better.\n\n  I guess that is what I like about Mr. Rohatyn. He believes we can do \nbetter, that a C average is not good enough for America.\n\n     The conventional wisdom, however, is so embedded in the \n     financial community that the National Economic Council \n     chairman, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, felt understandably compelled \n     to reassure the markets by announcing that the \n     Administration's growth forecast for the year was unchanged \n     from its original 2.2%. It should not be necessary to tell \n     Wall Street that the economy isn't as good as it looks.\n\n  Perhaps this is an argument I have with the Clinton administration. \nIf they are accepting a 2.2-percent growth forecast, and if that is \nacceptable to the Clinton administration, all I can say is it is \nunacceptable to me, and it ought to be unacceptable to this country. We \nneed a higher growth rate than that.\n  Mr. Rohatyn goes on to say:\n\n       There was a time when 2.8% would have been considered a \n     modest rate of growth; today it is considered dangerously \n     robust. The sad reality is that it is still below our real \n     needs. Many corporate leaders don't agree with this notion of \n     dragging the anchor just as soon as the economy has the wind \n     behind it. They understand how we can sustain high growth \n     based on the muscular productivity improvements they are \n     generating in their own businesses. In today's environment of \n     rapid technological innovation and international integration, \n     we should be willing to be bolder, both in fiscal and \n     monetary policy.\n       Our excessive fear of inflation has a huge price: \n     stagnating wages for the vast majority of American workers, \n     the decline of our cities and the deepening of our social and \n     economic ills. Although there is no single answer to these \n     problems, increasing wealth and incomes hardly seems like a \n     bad way to start. As President Kennedy said, ``A rising tide \n     lifts all boats.'' The difference between then and now is \n     that the tide is not rising as fast--and it certainly is not \n     raising all boats equally. Without more growth we are simply\n\n[[Page S6202]]\n\n     setting the stage for a battle over the same pie.\n       We need higher growth if we are to balance the budget \n     without unacceptable cuts to social programs, or without \n     letting our infrastructure crumble. Only a growing economy \n     lets us generate the revenues needed by the public sector \n     while reducing the tax burden on the private sector.\n       The Clinton Administration is entitled to a great deal of \n     credit for cutting the federal deficit in half, while putting \n     the economy on a path of stable, moderate growth. But it's \n     time for Administration and congressional leaders to take \n     advantage of the current momentum to reach for a higher \n     level. It's also time for Wall Street and the Federal Reserve \n     to stop kicking up interest rates reflexively every time the \n     economy shows signs of momentum. The notion that we must \n     choose between growth and inflation is a false choice. Global \n     competition as well as new technologies has set new \n     parameters on every aspect of the economy. A 3%-to-3\\1/2\\% \n     growth rate is not only an achievable national objective; it \n     is an economic and social necessity.\n\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that article be printed \nin its entirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Time Magazine, May 20, 1996]\n\n                         (By Felix G. Rohatyn)\n\n  Fear of Inflation Is Stifling the Nation--An Outdated Obsession is \n                     Depriving Us of Greater Wealth\n\n       As recently as March, most observers were concerned that \n     the economy might be headed for recession. Many expected the \n     Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Suddenly the great \n     concern is that the economy may be growing too fast.

Fickle \n     behavior in financial markets is nothing new, but this latest \n     episode illustrates a deeper problem.\n       It has become an article of faith among policymakers and on \n     Wall Street that if the economy grows at an annual rate above \n     2% or 2\\1/2\\%, inflation will rise, perhaps uncontrollably. \n     As illustrated by recent events, such conventional wisdom has \n     become almost a self-fulfilling limitation. When growth rises \n     above this level, investors, spooked by a belief that the \n     Federal Reserve will soon be ``forced'' to raise short-term \n     interest rates in order to prevent an outbreak of inflation, \n     rush to sell bonds. This pushes long-term interest rates up. \n     The result is that prospects for future growth are dampened. \n     (And should the Fed do nothing, bondholders sell because they \n     fear the central bank is no longer vigilant against \n     inflation.)\n       The irony is that these economic statistics, which so \n     frightened the markets, actually tell us that higher growth \n     is possible without inflation. The real rate of inflation for \n     the first quarter was 2.1%, with no sign of any upward \n     pressure; actual growth was understated because of the \n     General Motors strike and the winter blizzard. And remember, \n     inflation statistics are generally believed to be overstated \n     at least 0.5%.\n       What the first-quarter results make clearer is that the \n     economy can grow more than 3% while holding real inflation \n     below 2%. The same can be said about unemployment. The latest \n     unemployment figures came in at 5.4%; that's well below the \n     6% unemployment figure that is supposed to trigger inflation \n     through demands for higher wages, according to the standard \n     view. This view fails to take into account the forces of \n     global competition. American workers no longer compete for \n     jobs only with one another, but with workers worldwide, and \n     that tends to dampen wage demands at home. Wage inflation is \n     not a real threat, but we keep treating it as such.\n       Sure, one quarter isn't a trend, but there is nothing in \n     these numbers to provoke fear of inflation; on the contrary, \n     they should have been the basis for satisfaction and the \n     determination to do better. The conventional wisdom, however, \n     is so embedded in the financial community that the National \n     Economic Council chairman, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, felt \n     understandably compelled to reassure the markets by \n     announcing that the Administration's growth forecast for the \n     year was unchanged from its original 2.2%. It should not be \n     necessary to tell Wall Street that the economy isn't as good \n     as it looks.\n       There was a time when 2.8% would have been considered a \n     modest rate of growth; today it is considered dangerously \n     robust. The sad reality is that it is still below our real \n     needs. Many corporate leaders don't agree with this notion of \n     dragging the anchor just as soon as the economy has the wind \n     behind it. They understand how we can sustain high growth \n     based on the muscular productivity improvements they are \n     generating in their own businesses. In today's environment of \n     rapid technological innovation and international integration, \n     we should be willing to be bolder, both in fiscal and \n     monetary policy.\n       Our excessive fear of inflation has a huge price: \n     stagnating wages for the vast majority of American workers, \n     the decline of our cities and the deepening of our social and \n     economic ills. Although there is no single answer to these \n     problems, increasing wealth and incomes hardly seems like a \n     bad way to start. As President Kennedy said, ``A rising tide \n     lifts all boats.'' The difference between then and now is \n     that the tide is not rising as fast--and it certainly is not \n     raising all boats equally. Without more growth we are simply \n     setting the stage for a battle over the same pie.\n       We need higher growth if we are to balance the budget \n     without unacceptable cuts to social programs, or without \n     letting our infrastructure crumble. Only a growing economy \n     lets us generate the revenues needed by the public sector \n     while reducing the tax burden on the private sector.\n       The Clinton Administration is entitled to a great deal of \n     credit for cutting the federal deficit in half, while putting \n     the economy on a path of stable, moderate growth. But it's \n     time for Administration and congressional leaders to take \n     advantage of the current momentum to reach for a higher \n     level. It's also time for Wall Street and the Federal Reserve \n     to stop kicking up interest rates reflexively every time the \n     economy shows signs of momentum. The notion that we must \n     choose between growth and inflation is a false choice. Global \n     competition as well as new technologies has set new \n     parameters on every aspect of the economy. A 3%-to-3\\1/2\\% \n     growth rate is not only an achievable national objective; it \n     is an economic and social necessity.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. There was another article by Mr. Rohatyn. This one was in \nthe Wall Street Journal, last December. In this article he talks about \nthe growth assumptions that we have made and the affect it has on \npolicy. I just want to read a couple of parts of it. I will not read \nthe whole article, but I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, Dec. 7, 1995]\n\n                         Cut and Be Prosperous\n\n                         (By Felix G. Rohatyn)\n\n       The current budget debate in the U.S. between the Clinton \n     administration and Congress has an air of unreality about it. \n     First, the debate is dominated by economic numbers to which \n     all sides cling with theological devotion, despite the lack \n     of any evidence that they correspond to events in the real \n     world. Second, the debate focuses on only one part of the \n     budget-balancing equation--controlling expenditures. Nobody \n     is talking about growing revenues by growing the economy, yet \n     this is certainly more important than any other part of the \n     budget equation.\n       Start with the numbers. Both the President and Congress \n     have signed off on a seven-year goal to balance the budget. \n     But there is nothing magical about the number seven. Whether \n     the budget is balanced in seven years or six or eight has no \n     economic, financial or intellectual relevance; the financial \n     markets will react no differently if, ultimately, there is an \n     eight-year or even nine-year agreement. What is critical to \n     the markets is the certainty of the outcome. In the present \n     seven-year plan there is no certainty whatsoever; the only \n     certainty is that things will undoubtedly turn out \n     differently than the budget forecast.\n       That's because the economic assumptions made by both sides \n     are faulty. The Congressional Budget Office forecast is for \n     2.3% annual growth for the seven-year period; the \n     administration's is for 2.5% annual growth. Both forecasts \n     are undoubtedly wrong. That is not their greatest sin, \n     however, because all forecasts are wrong, especially when \n     they go beyond next year. Their greatest sin is to accept, \n     and implicitly condemn, the U.S. to our present growth rate. \n     Despite Wall Street's love affair with slow growth, the vast \n     majority of the business community believes this to be far \n     short of the economy's real capacity for noninflationary \n     growth, as well as being inadequate to meet the nation's \n     private and public investment needs.\n       What's pushing us toward accepting lower growth? Part of \n     the problem is faulty economic measurements. Both Federal \n     Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and a distinguished panel of \n     economists have said that U.S. actual inflation rate may be \n     more than 50% below the official measurement of the consumer \n     price index. This means inflation may be a less immediate \n     danger. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has \n     decided that the methodology of growth rate measurements is \n     faulty and needs to be revised downward. Once this is \n     adjusted, it may ease fears that we're growing ``too fast.''\n       Another factor pushing the U.S. toward lower growth is \n     its foreign trade partners. In Western Europe, the goal of \n     a single European currency, requiring lower budget \n     deficits and lower debt, is given priority over growth and \n     employment in every country except Britian. Both Germany \n     and France, with inflation rates around 2% and \n     unemployment rates of 9% and 12% respectively, are running \n     deflationary policies of high interest rates together with \n     budgetary contraction. Japan is effectively in a no-\n     growth, asset-deflation mode.\n       I would be a tragic mistake for the U.S. to join the rest \n     of the developed world in a set of economic policies \n     combining low growth, high real interest rates and fiscal \n     contraction--the prescription seemingly favored by both \n     Congress and the White House. The net result of these \n     policies will not be balanced budgets but higher deficits and \n     serious social strains, because they will lead to less growth \n     and hence lower government revenues.\n\n[[Page S6203]]\n\n       Every major American social and economic problem requires \n     stronger economic growth for its solution. This includes \n     improvements in public education as well as increasing \n     private capital investment and savings; balancing the budget \n     and maintaining a social safety net; improving the economic \n     conditions in the big cities and reducing racial tensions as \n     a result. The economic and social pressures of global \n     capitalism can be offset only by higher rates of economic \n     growth. Even when global competition was less severe and \n     social problems less daunting, the U.S. did not generate \n     sufficient jobs and government revenues at less than 3% to \n     3\\1/2\\% annual growth in gross domestic product.\n       There is only one explanation for the U.S. government's \n     reluctance to adopt a higher growth objective: The inordinate \n     fear of inflation resulting from higher growth. The view that \n     the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth in limited \n     to 2\\1/2\\% is strongly supported by the financial community, \n     the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, all rightly anxious to \n     protect the securities and currency markets. But business \n     leaders strongly believe that we can achieve higher growth \n     with little risk of higher inflation. The latest economic \n     statistics seem to confirm this: The last quarter saw 4.2% \n     growth and less than 2% inflation. It is totally appropriate \n     to fight inflation; it is counterproductive to limit economic \n     growth unnecessarily.\n       It is obviously not possible, overnight, to try to raise \n     the growth rate without raising the fear of renewed \n     inflation; global capital markets are very nervous, and \n     maintaining a strong dollar is fundamental to U.S. \n     prosperity. But a number of policy changes should be \n     considered--but aren't at the moment.\n       First, the U.S.'s European and Japanese partners should be \n     persuaded to set a parallel course and coordinate lower \n     interest rates while promoting domestic growth policies of \n     their own. At home, the U.S. should consider tax reform to \n     promote investment and savings. It should make appropriate \n     increases in public investment, even as it reduces the cost \n     of social programs and defense spending. It should make \n     improvements in public education an integral component of a \n     strategy of higher growth and higher productivity. Hard \n     money, higher rates of growth, low interest rates and low \n     inflation should be the economic platform.\n       There will be obviously be vigorous differences between \n     Republicans and the administration about the tax and spending \n     policies needed to achieve these goals. However, since there \n     is no real argument any more about the goal of a balanced \n     budget let us, at least, agree that balance must be achieved \n     by higher growth and retrenchment. There is an excellent \n     precedent for this strategy: New York City's experience in \n     1975, when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy. How did the \n     city balance its budget in five years and regain access to \n     the credit markets? Through a combination of rapid and \n     sustained economic growth, on the one hand, and, on the \n     other, year-by-year compliance with tough budget targets \n     enforced by an Emergency Financial Control Board.\n       At the federal level, no new agency is needed--but a new \n     mechanism is required to keep the budget plan on track year \n     to year: First, the Congressional Budget Office would \n     determine the actual deficit, as opposed to the projected \n     one. Second, the President and the congressional leadership \n     would agree on measures to resolve differences between the \n     predicted deficit and the real one; this could include \n     additional spending cuts or new taxes, or a combination of \n     the two. This agreement would be subject to ratification by \n     Congress. Third, if no agreements was reached, automatic \n     across-the-board cuts in the budget (interest payments on the \n     debt alone would be exempt) would come into effect to comply \n     with the forecast. Of course, provisions would have to be \n     made to defer cuts in case of a serious recession or a \n     national emergency, but this plan would reassure financial \n     markets far more than any seven-year budget goal.\n       As a final step, both the administrative and the \n     congressional Republicans should agree on an objective of at \n     least 3% annual growth to be reached in the next two or three \n     years. The difference between 2.3% and 2.5% growth over the \n     seven-year period is $475 billion of added revenues; the \n     difference between 2.5% and 3% is more than $1 trillion. \n     There are stakes worth fighting for. The national debate \n     should now focus on the most important issue facing America: \n     not whether, but how, to generate the growth that is adequate \n     to the country's needs.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This was in the December 7, Asian Wall Street Journal.\n  Mr. Rohatyn is talking about budget forecasts. Let me just start \nwhere he says:\n\n       That's because the economic assumptions made by both sides \n     are faulty. The Congressional Budget Office forecast is for \n     2.3 percent annual growth for the seven-year period; the \n     administration's is for 2.5 percent annual growth. Both \n     forecasts are undoubtedly wrong. That is not their greatest \n     sin, however, because all forecasts are wrong, especially \n     when they go beyond next year. Their greatest sin is to \n     accept, and implicitly condemn, the United States to our \n     present growth rate.\n\n  Let me repeat that. What Mr. Rohatyn said is that to forecast and to \nset our policies based upon 2.3 percent or 2.5 percent growth for \nseveral years, that is not the greatest sin, he says, he stated the \ngreatest sin is to accept and implicitly condemn the United States to \nour present growth rate.\n\n       Despite Wall Street's love affair with slow growth, the \n     vast majority of the business community believes this to be \n     far short of the economy's real capacity for noninflationary \n     growth, as well as being inadequate to meet the Nation's \n     private and public investment needs.\n\n  Mr. Rohatyn goes on, he says:\n\n       What is pushing us toward accepting lower growth? Part of \n     the problem is faulty economic measurements. Both Federal \n     Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and a distinguished panel of \n     economists have said that U.S. actual inflation rate may be \n     more than 50 percent below the official measurement of the \n     Consumer Price Index. This means inflation may be a less \n     immediate danger. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     has decided that the methodology of growth rate measurements \n     is faulty and needs to be revised downward. Once this is \n     adjusted it may ease fears that we're growing ``too fast.''\n\n  Mr. Rohatyn goes on to say:\n\n       It would be a tragic mistake for the U.S. to join the rest \n     of the developed world in a set of economic policies \n     combining low growth, high real interest rates, and fiscal \n     contraction--the prescription seemingly favored by both \n     Congress and the White House. The net result of these \n     policies will not be balanced budgets, but higher deficits \n     and serious social strains, because they will lead to less \n     growth, and hence lower Government revenues.\n       Every major American social and economic problem requires \n     stronger economic growth for its solution.

But business leaders strongly believe we can achieve \n     higher growth with little risk of higher inflation.\n       It is totally appropriate to fight inflation. It is \n     counterproductive to limit economic growth unnecessarily.\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think Mr. Rohatyn, really in both those \narticles, has really outlined what our policy ought to be at the \nFederal Reserve. That is, a policy of balance. That is what he is \narguing for. He is not saying, forget about inflation. He is saying, \nwhen there is no inflation, when the fear of inflation is low and \ninflation is way down, below 2 percent, we can take some risks for more \ngrowth.\n  Like the story about the turtle that only makes progress when he \nsticks his head out from underneath the shell. Of course, he is most \nvulnerable at that point. The turtle could live his entire life closed \nup in a shell. He would not get very far, but he would be safe. Like \nthe turtle, we have to stick our necks out once in a while for growth. \nIf we see inflation coming, yes, then we can retreat. But to retreat \nbefore inflation is threatened is to condemn America to slow growth, is \nto condemn American families to low wages and high unemployment. It \nmeans that we will have a tougher time balancing our budget, or it \nmeans if we do want to balance the budget, we are going to cut very \ndeeply into social safety net programs. We will cut into education, we \nwill cut into health, we will cut into Medicare, and we will start \ncutting to balance the budget. That will exacerbate and make worse \nsocial unrest that we already see starting out there.\n  We must have a policy of growth. The Federal Government cannot do it \nby itself. We have no magic here to do that. Yes, we can cut budgets, \nand we are. We can cut the deficit, and we are. We can streamline \nGovernment.\n  I commend the Clinton administration for what it has done to \nstreamline Government. It was the Clinton administration that started \nthe reorganization of the Federal Government. It was President Clinton \nwho suggested we trim the size of the Federal bureaucracy to its lowest \npoint since John Kennedy was President.\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\n  Yes, we can take those steps, and we are taking those steps, but \nunless we have growth in our economy, those cuts are going to get \nharder and harder in the future. It will be harder to make politically, \nbut it will be harder on people with real needs, whether it is an \nelderly person who is ill or maybe an elderly person that needs heating \noil in the wintertime and we do not have enough money to pay and to \nhelp them buy that heating oil to keep warm in the winter. It is a \nfamily that has a child that needs a Head Start Program and cannot get \nit because we do not have the money for it. We simply do not. Or maybe \nit is a young couple starting out, both of them are working, and they \nwould like to save to buy a new home. They cannot to it because the \ninterest rates are too high. That is what is ahead for us if we do not \nhave growth in our economy.\n  As I said, we have limited resources at our fingertips here in the \nCongress to do that. We cut the deficit, we cut the size of the Federal \nGovernment, we can streamline, but in the end it has to be the Federal \nReserve and its monetary policy to reduce the interest rates that will \nallow the private sector to expand. By allowing the private sector to \nexpand and grow with new plants and new equipment and, yes, wage growth \nfor hard-working families, that will create the kind of revenues that \nthe Federal Government takes in to help meet our obligations to those \nless fortunate.\n\n  Mr. President, Rohatyn points out the increasing social unrest that \nwill happen if we continue on with the tight money policy under Mr. \nGreenspan. Mr. President, I do think we should have monetary goals that \nallow for 3 percent, maybe 3\\1/2\\ percent growth, a percent higher than \nwhat we have. Of course, as I said, if it was achieved, we would see \nour revenues climb as profits and income increase, and many program \ncosts would fall. Again, I commend President Clinton for the approaches \nhe has taken to reduce the budget deficit and to reduce the size of the \nGovernment.\n  Next, I want to discuss some of the recent news impacting on interest \nrates, how the perceptions of the Federal Reserve and its actions have \nshaped the market's reaction to the news, and why I believe Alan \nGreenspan's historic pattern of actions is not helpful for our economy \nto grow. I would like to know how approving his renomination and his \nhair-trigger reaction toward raising interest rates makes talk of a \ngrowing economy from a supply side tax cut totally impossible.\n  There are those who say we need to have this big tax cut now, as if \nsomehow this tax cut is going to lend itself to a supply side growth in \nour economy. But if you have high interest rates, unreasonably high \ninterest rates, tight money policy, then that will not happen. Tax cuts \nwill just simply go for higher interest payments. That is all they will \ngo for. If you want to really get the economy moving, yes, you should \nget our rate of interest down, and then have targeted tax cuts to \nworking families. That would really spur the economy. To do it without \nlowering interest rates is counterproductive.\n  If the Federal Reserve is going to look at a reduction of revenue \nwithout immediate offsetting reductions in spending as inflationary, \nthen interest rates are likely to increase and higher interest rates \nwill send the economy into a dive, further exacerbating the deficit. In \nthat environment, the ability to promote any kind of a supply side tax \nreduction that benefited the economy becomes highly suspect.\n  One of the very strange things to most people who read the newspapers \nis how the bond and stock markets now tend to go down when there is \nsignificant good news about the economy as a whole, as I just read from \na couple of articles. The reason is because they believe as soon as the \neconomy gets better, interest rates will rise.\n  Will they rise because of fear of inflation, or do they think they \nwill rise because of a hair-trigger orientation toward raising interest \nrates at the Federal Reserve? I believe a very large component is the \nfear of the Federal Reserve increases in its interest rates and not the \nfear of inflation.\n  I suppose Mr. Greenspan's supporters would say the answer is if the \neconomy overheats, there will be a bottleneck in the economy, shortages \nof goods, the inability to deliver them on time, shortages in \nemployees. This, of course, will result in higher prices for wages \npaid, and thus inflation. Inflation will increase and erode the value \nof long-term bonds. The bond market will therefore demand higher \ninterest rates to slow the economy and reduce inflation, and clearly \nhigher interest rates reduce consumer demands, increase business costs \nand lower profits.\n\n  Under Mr. Greenspan's Federal Reserve, I believe there is a \nperception, cultivated by him, that he does have a hair trigger and if \nthere is ever any early sign at all of any inflation, they will raise \ninterest rates. Unfortunately, it is more than true. He may claim it \ncalms the markets, but I think he is leading the charge to higher rates \nin a slower economy.\n  Sometimes we have seen this hair trigger operate when signs of \ninflation are ephemeral, at best. The bonds and stock markets both \ninitially hit the skids when the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued its \nreport on May unemployment last Friday. What did the report say? Mr. \nPresident, 348,000 jobs were added to the payroll. In addition, there \nwas an upward revision in the April employment figures by 163,000; \nabout 500,000 additional jobs in America over a 2-month period. There \nwas about 40,000 less than that because statistics counted higher for \nelection day in many States, so we are talking about 460,000.\n  There was a huge 549,000 increase in the work force in May. Half a \nmillion people wanted to get into the job market. They wanted to work \nin April. Only two-thirds found jobs.\n  I hear people say, ``My gosh, look at all the new jobs we have \ncreated. We are up to 500,000 in a couple of months.'' But what they \npoint out is that in May, there was a 549,000 increase in the work \nforce, and what we found is that over that period of time, about \n460,000 new jobs.\n  So only about two-thirds of the people looking for work found work. \nSo, in actuality, the unemployment rate increased from 3.6 to 5.6 \npercent in May. Again when you tell people that, they say, ``Wait a \nminute. I have been reading about all of these new jobs created.'' That \nis true. That is only one side of the ledger. You must look at the \nother side of the ledger and how many people are looking for work. This \nis about a third more looking for work than actually found jobs. So \nunemployment actually increased. With a fear that increased jobs will \nyield to bottlenecks, this news says there are a lot more people \nlooking, providing competition for the growing number of job positions \nthat become available.\n  What about the direct measure of inflation--rising wages? We talked \nabout unemployment; let us talk about wages. In the March figures \nreleased in April, wages increased by 7 cents. On Friday, the new \nfigure said, after adjustments after the past 2 months, wages only \nincreased by a penny an hour. The economy, they said, did very well in \nApril. Generally, economists felt it was a pretty good month and a \npretty good quarter of the year. There is a widely held view that the \neconomy will not do as well in the second half.\n  What is the problem with rising bond prices? It is the Federal \nReserve. Everyone in the market understands Mr. Greenspan's character. \nSo the 30-year Federal bond interest rate increased by 13 basis points \nlast Friday largely on the bet that the Federal Reserve rate increase \nwas on the way. We keep hearing that, at the next meeting of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, there is going to probably be an \nincrease.\n  First of all, unemployment actually went up. Rising wages is only \nabout a penny an hour. Why? Yet, bond interest rates increased by 13 \nbasis points. Why is all of this important? It is important because, in \nthe short term, the fear and the expectation of Federal Reserve rate \nhikes mean higher mortgage rates and other interest costs even before \npossible Federal Reserve action. If the Federal Reserve increases the \ninterest rates, which in recent years is almost automatically followed \nby increases in the prime rates of banks, then the cost of doing \nbusiness or operating a farm will increase. The cost to consumers who \nwant to buy things increases.\n  But the most important effect of Mr. Greenspan's Federal Reserve \npolicy is it blocks faster economic growth. As I said, Mr. Greenspan \ntalked about the\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\ndesirable growth at a bit over 2 percent a year. Many economists say \nthat our economy could grow well over 3 percent, as Mr. Rohatyn does, \nwithout triggering higher inflation. Many say we could sustain that \nrate for a longer period of time.\n  But I think it can be said with certainty, a 1-percent increase in \ngrowth for 1 year means an extra $75 billion added to the economy and \nthe following year and each year thereafter. If we sustain that higher \ngrowth for 2 years, then we are talking about an extra $150 billion in \nthe size of the economy per year; 3 years, $225 billion a year added; 4 \nyears--you get my point. What this would mean in cumulative effects to \nthe economy is nothing short of startling.\n  A larger economy means more in wages and a better quality of life for \nAmericans. I believe it is worth a try. Mr. Rohatyn believes it is \nworth a try, and so do many, many economists. Especially business \npeople think it is worth a try. I think we should allow the economy to \ngrow at the strongest rate possible. Of course, this means we must \nlower interest rates.\n  Again, is there a risk of inflation? Yes; not as great as the risk \nwould have been 20 years ago in the 1970's. As I pointed out, we have a \nworld market in goods, we have a world market in labor, and we have \nnew, more massive retailing and discounting in America that we never \nhad 20 years ago. Plus we have a large pool not only of unemployed but \nunderemployed.\n  That is another point that I am going to be talking about later. We \ncan look at the unemployed figures. They say, ``Well, it is 5.6-percent \nunemployment. But there are a lot of people--and we all know it because \nwe talked to our constituents--there are a lot of people out there who \nare underemployed. They have a job, but it is not the job they want, \nand it is not the job paying them the wage that their education and \ntheir abilities might otherwise argue for. But they are taking it \nbecause there is nothing else. It is not uncommon for a family with the \nhusband working one or two jobs, the spouse, the wife, working one or \ntwo jobs, and one or more of the children working. Many of those second \njobs are lower wage, many times minimum-wage, jobs. So there is, I \nthink, a great deal of underemployment.\n  So, if we were able to spur economic growth to buy new plants and \nequipment, new opportunities, I believe that a lot of the underutilized \njobs would move to other sectors and a lot of the underemployed people \nwould take those jobs. So again, it argues against any kind of \ntightness in the labor market that would argue for inflation. So, yes, \nthere is a chance, there is a risk.\n  As I said, it is like the turtle. The turtle never makes progress \nuntil it sticks its neck out. Of course, that is when it is most \nvulnerable. A turtle can spend its whole life clammed up in its shell, \nbut it would never get anywhere. We can spend the rest of this century \nand a good portion of the early part of the next century clammed up in \nour shell, too, while other nations outstrip us, while other nations' \ngrowth rates exceed ours, and while we condemn our people to a lower \nstandard of living. That is really what this is about.\n  Some people say, ``Well, you mean to tell me it is all wrapped up in \none person, Mr. Greenspan?'' My answer is, yes, a lot of it; not all of \nit, but a lot of it because of the power of the Federal Reserve \nChairman and because of the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve.\n  Some would say that cannot be true. Alan Greenspan does not want the \neconomy to grow more quickly? Is that a fair statement? Mr. Greenspan \ndoes not believe that the risk of inflation is worth what could be \nsubstantial job growth and higher income. He has spent his entire \nprofessional life fighting for that view. I believe he is so oriented \ntoward that view, blinded by that view, that he failed to act \ndecisively to bring the U.S. economy out of two of the most serious \nrecessions in the post-World War II era.\n  In 1974, while chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic \nAdvisers, and in 1990, as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, both times \nhe failed to act decisively to bring the U.S. economy out of serious \nrecessions. In February 1994, he started a series of seven interest-\nrate increases with no real sense of inflation. Perhaps on the horizon \nthere may have been a mirage of inflation sometime in the future.\n  Last Thursday's Washington Post had an interesting article written by \nJohn Berry. It said the Federal Reserve officials did not intend to \norchestrate a signal on the prior Wednesday, on May 29, that the Fed \nwanted to raise interest rates at their July 3 meeting. But we have \nseen a number of statements last week on exactly that point, a few days \nbefore the article. Some of those statements said that the Federal \nReserve was not intending to raise rates, and inflation looks like it \nis under control; the economy is not going out of hand. But I note that \nthe bond and stock markets did take some of the remarks made by Fed \nofficials made on May 29 very seriously.\n\n  Susan Phillips, a member of the board, and Al Brodous a member of a \nRichmond bank, indicated that they were seeing inflationary pressures \nin the economy. When the news came out that the 30-year bond moved up, \nstocks quickly dipped when the economists were heard on Wall Street. \nSpeaking in Washington, according to the Wall Street Journal, Phillips \nwas concerned about rising commodity prices and Brodous was concerned \nabout the tightness in the labor market. On Friday, 2 days later, the \n30-year bond was still 13 basis points higher, affecting real people. \nMortgage rates were also up sharply. The beginning of last week saw \nlots of statements of denial, and the culmination was John Berry's \npiece in the Washington Post, and the 30-year bond returned to near its \nprior level.\n  My point in telling this is not to say that Fed officials purposely \norganized an effort to send a signal or not. That is not the point. It \nis to say that everyone in the market knows about Mr. Greenspan's hair \ntrigger. If you are going to have large sums that will be invested in \nthe bond market, that view is highly to your advantage. It keeps the \nchances of inflation way down. Unfortunately, it keeps the economy \nhobbling along and wages close to stagnant. What is good for \nbondholders is not necessarily always good for America, and not \nnecessarily always good for the average American.\n\n  At the end of last week the 30-year bond was about 15 basis points \nhigher than it was a few days before. Mortgage rates went up. And, \nunfortunately, there is now a reasonable chance that the Federal \nReserve might increase rates on July 3. That is all being bandied \nabout. Again, why? What is there out there that would even cause \nsomeone to think that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates? \nThe labor market is not tight. There is no inflation inherently \nthreatening at all. Yet they are talking about it.\n  What was the truth, anyway--commodity prices? They have been stable \nfor months. On the day Ms. Phillips made her comments, the IPC stood at \n253. A month before, at the end of April, it was around 256. This is \nthe Index of Prices for Commodities. So how could that statement be \nmade that there is a tightening in commodities when, in fact, the index \ncame down three points, from 1 month to the other?\n  Oil came down to about $20 a barrel from its peak of about $25 a \ncouple of months ago. Oil prices are coming down, to the refinery. \nUnfortunately we have not seen much at the gas pump yet.\n  So where is the climb in commodity prices? They are generally going \ndown more than up.\n  Let us look at the labor markets. Again, what do we see? Unemployment \nwas up. Unemployment was up 5.4 percent for April, but unemployment has \nbeen in a range of 5.4 to 5.8 percent since October, 1994. And in 1994 \nmany at the Fed were saying that anything below 6-percent unemployment \nwould likely cause higher inflation. Wrong. Perhaps, if we would not \nsend interest rates skyrocketing, we might discover we could sustain \nstrong growth without accelerating inflation, bringing unemployment \ndown actually to 5 percent.\n  In recent months the Help Wanted Index has also been low. This is a \nclear indication that employers are not having difficulty finding \nemployees. A weak Help Wanted Index is something that might be expected \nin a slumping economy. More important, a weak Help Wanted Index is also \none more indication that inflation is not threatening\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\nbecause employers will not have to increase wages and benefits to \nattract employees. And we all know that employee wages and compensation \nare one of the greatest causes of inflation. So why the hair trigger? \nThere is little reason, in my view, that fair-minded, balanced experts \nshould want to raise interest rates at this time.\n  Just over the last couple of days we have received some good news \nabout inflation. The CPI went up by .3 percent, core CPI went up only \n.2 percent, producer prices went down .1 percent. Yet the airwaves have \nbeen all filled with talk that the Fed may raise rates. Why? Because of \nMr. Greenspan's hair trigger.\n  I would like to now go through some of Alan Greenspan's actions in \nthe past concerning interest rates, that might explain the perceptions \nof the bond and stock markets.\n  First I want to talk briefly about a constant called NAIRU. I \nreferred to it earlier, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment. Under this concept, as unemployment falls below a certain \npoint, bottlenecks occur because the country runs out of skilled \nemployees. As a result, employers must begin to offer increased pay and \ngreater benefits to attract employees. As a result of this, producers \nmust raise their prices to keep pace with the increased costs of doing \nbusiness. Thus, this leads to inflation.\n\n  This model argues that if monetary policy is structured in such a way \nas to keep unemployment below its natural level, runaway inflation will \nresult at an accelerating rate that could be reversed by only painfully \nhigh levels of unemployment. The conventional wisdom held by Mr. \nGreenspan is that the current natural rate of unemployment is around 6 \npercent. I want to be as fair as I can. Mr. Greenspan said he has no \nspecific rate in mind, that he just watches the details. But for a long \ntime the word was that this NAIRU, if I can call it that, was at least \n6 percent. Below that rate, we would see escalating inflation. But \nunemployment went below 6 percent about 20 months ago and there is \nstill no impact. Now the accountants are saying that NAIRU is maybe 5.8 \npercent, or 5.5 percent.\n  There was an interesting article by Patrice Hill earlier this month \nin the June 4 Washington Times on that point. I just wanted to read a \nlittle bit from that article. This was in the Washington Times dated \nJune 4, by Patrice Hill.\n       Is the Federal Reserve keeping unemployment unnecessarily \n     high and preventing more than a million workers from finding \n     jobs?\n       A number of analysts say yes, the Fed may be depriving \n     workers because of a too-cautious belief that if it loosen \n     the money tap and lets the unemployment rate fall below its \n     current level of 5.4 percent, the would trigger wage and \n     price inflation.\n       ``The Fed is probably shortchanging the economy,'' said \n     Maury Harris, chief economist with Paine Webber Inc. in New \n     York pointing to a succession of relatively inflation-free \n     economic reports.\n       In the 1980's, inflation reared its ugly head when \n     unemployment dropped to between 5.5 and 6 percent, so the Fed \n     and many economists still see that level of unemployment as a \n     ``danger zone'' where inflation lurks. They fear the demand \n     for workers will start outstripping the number of people \n     seeking work, driving up wages, the cost of business, and \n     ultimately, fueling inflation.\n       But Fed critics in Congress and in economic circles note \n     that unemployment has hovered in the 5.5 percent range for \n     two years now, with little sign of a pickup in wage growth or \n     inflation. In fact, ``wage stagnation'' is frequently singled \n     out as a problem.\n       Mr. Harris and a growing number of prominent analysts say \n     unemployment could drop still further--to between 4 percent \n     and 5 percent--without triggering inflation. And that would \n     make life better for a lot of people--a one-point drop in \n     unemployment puts a little over a million back to work.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 4, 1996]\n\n               Inflation-Wary Fed Costs Jobs, Critics Say\n\n                           (By Patrice Hill)\n\n       Is the Federal Reserve keeping unemployment unnecessarily \n     high and preventing more than a million workers from finding \n     jobs?\n       A number of analysts say yes, the Fed may be depriving \n     workers because of a too-cautious belief that if it loosens \n     the money tap and lets the unemployment rate fall below its \n     current level of 5.4 percent, that would trigger wage and \n     price inflation.\n       ``The Fed is probably shortchanging the economy,'' said \n     Maury Harris, chief economist with Paine Webber Inc. in New \n     York, pointing to a succession of relatively inflation-free \n     economic reports.\n       In the 1980s, inflation reared its ugly head when \n     unemployment dropped to between 5.5 and 6 percent, so the Fed \n     and many economists still see that level of unemployment as a \n     ``danger zone'' where inflation lurks.

Parry has \n     told reporters that he believes the unemployment rate below \n     which inflation becomes a problem--in technical jargon known \n     as the ``non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment''--\n     is around 5.75 percent. He says the economy is already \n     operating in the inflation ``danger zone.''\n       ``It would surprise me if `96 and `97 didn't show some \n     pickup'' in inflation, he said last week. ``It would probably \n     be wrong to think that the lack of influence of wage \n     pressures will continue indefinitely.''\n       While many economists agree with the Fed, some say it has \n     not fully taken into account two factors that have increased \n     the economy's employment potential: the aging of Baby Boom \n     workers and the stiff, worldwide competition in trade that \n     has unfolded since the end of the Cold War.\n       Mr. Harris and Ed Yardeni, chief economist with C.J. \n     Lawrence Inc. in New York, say the unprecedented trade \n     competition has held down prices and wages, while the aging \n     of the baby boom has brought more experience to the work \n     force and is driving down the unemployment rate.\n       When the large baby boom generation was young and less \n     skilled in the 1970s and 1980s, they had a harder time \n     finding jobs, causing the unemployment rate to drift higher. \n     But now, the reverse may be happening, the analysts say.\n       Mr. Harris points to the low, 4.5 percent unemployment rate \n     in the Midwest manufacturing belt--accompanied by low, 2.7 \n     percent wage inflation--as evidence that unemployment \n     nationwide could drop further without setting off a wage-\n     price inflation spiral.\n       Mr. Yardeni notes that unemployment dropped as low as 4 \n     percent in the 1960s without inflation. The same thing could \n     happen in the 1990s, but for different reasons, he said.\n       ``The world has changed. The end of the Cold War is a major \n     shock'' that has brought with it a flood of trade and cheap \n     imported goods, but along with it the fierce competition that \n     has kept a lid on prices and wages, he said.\n       David Wyss, economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc. in Boston, \n     defended the Fed and dismissed as ``wishful thinking'' the \n     theory that unemployment could go much lower without \n     inflation.\n       Some one-time factors have been aiding employers in holding \n     jobs costs down, he said, including a recent dramatic drop in \n     health care inflation, and recessions in Europe and Japan \n     that have held down worldwide demand and prices for raw \n     materials. Those helpful developments could soon subside, he \n     said.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to read one other part of that article. Ms. \nHill said that:\n\n\n[[Page S6207]]\n\n\n       Mr. Greenspan, in appearances before Congress, insists that \n     the Fed is open to higher growth and employment and is not \n     targeting any specific unemployment rate such as 5.5 percent. \n     But he defends the Fed's decision to dramatically raise \n     interest rates in 1994 when unemployment fell below 6 \n     percent, saying it was accompanied by a big pickup in \n     commodity prices.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       While many economists agree with the Fed, some say it has \n     not fully taken into account two factors that have increased \n     the economy's employment potential: the aging of Baby Boom \n     workers and the stiff, worldwide competition in trade that \n     has unfolded since the end of the Cold War.\n\n  She quotes Mr. Ed Yardeni, chief economist with C.J. Lawrence, Inc., \nin New York who said:\n\n       Mr. Yardeni notes that unemployment dropped as low as 4 \n     percent in the 1960s without inflation. The same thing could \n     happen in the 1990s, but for different reasons, he said.\n\n  So, again, I said at the outset of my comments, I think Mr. \nGreenspan's economic perceptions are locked in the 1960's and 1970's. \nAnd the world has changed dramatically since that point in time.\n  So, let us say--let us assume that the floor on unemployment is not \n5.5 percent. Let us just say it is 5 percent, half a percent lower. The \nNational Bureau of Economic Research, a distinguished group that is \nrecognized as the arbiter of when recessions begin and end, recently \npublished a working paper which might explain part of the problem. It \nis entitled, ``How Precise are Estimates of the Natural Rate of \nUnemployment,'' NAIRU.\n  To explain this point I would like to use the hypothetical example of \na political poll, which we are kind of all familiar with. For example, \nif a poll says that 60 percent of the American people believe x, it \nbasically means that 60 percent plus or minus a certain percentage \nactually believe x. NAIRU, nonaccelerating inflation rate of \nunemployment, and other economic statistics, work the same way. So I \nwas surprised to learn that the range of NAIRU is plus or minus 2.6 \npercent of unemployment. That means that when NAIRU is assumed to be \n6.2 percent in 1990, the natural rate of unemployment is actually \nsomewhere between 5.1 percent and 7.7 percent.\n  I would like to point out that each one-tenth of one point of \nunemployment represents about 132,000 people who do not have a job, \nmany of whom have families. What this means is that a Federal Reserve \ndecision to tighten credit through higher interest rates to slow the \neconomy down does a couple of things that impact Americans. Some become \nunemployed, more than would otherwise have become unemployed. Every \ntenth of a percent almost equals more than the entire working age \npopulation of the capital city of Iowa, Des Moines.\n  Second, it keeps the cost of wages down. That is the real goal. \nIncreased unemployment is an indirect goal, although it is not stated \nthat way, but what they are really after is keeping wages from rising \nto prevent inflation. We must keep in mind, however, that employees' \nhourly wages have fallen in 1995 dollars from $12.85 in 1978 to $11.46 \nper hour in 1995, a drop of 11 percent. And while that is happening, \nour productivity is going up. Not as much as it should. But \nproductivity is, in fact, going up in our country at a time when wages \nare going down.\n\n  So now we are told we have to keep tight reins on the economy or it \nwill overheat and damage the economy. At what point will the economy \noverheat and damage our economy? Should we really be worried if \nunemployment comes down to 5 percent, 4.8, 4.6 or maybe even 4.5 \npercent? Is there really any fear that that will cause inflation?\n  There are many who do not believe so, and I happen to be one of \nthose. I believe we can reduce the rate of unemployment in this \ncountry, provide for more jobs and better wages without increasing \ninflation.\n  I guess the concern I have with Mr. Greenspan is he always seems to \ncome down on one side of this debate, stopping inflation at any cost, \nand will not let the economy grow as it should.\n  Mr. President, I said when I started my comments that I would at some \npoint go over Mr. Greenspan's history, and I do want to do that, but I \nsee in the Chamber the Senator from North Dakota, who has been a great \nleader in this effort to get a more reasonable balance at the Fed, who \nhas been an eloquent spokesman for a more balanced policy and for lower \nrates of interest and for a growth in our economy. I see the Senator is \npresent on the floor.\n  At the conclusion of his remarks, or perhaps tomorrow, when we are in \nsession tomorrow, I wish to trace for the record and for Senators and \nfor the public Mr. Greenspan's record from the time that he was \nChairman--well, I may even go back further when he was one of Ayn \nRand's disciples in New York. I may even go back to that. But I want to \ntrace his history from the time he was chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers through his private years, when he was private and he \nwas stating what the economy would do, and to show also through this \nperiod of time as Chairman of the Fed how, quite frankly, Mr. Greenspan \njust simply has been wrong.\n  I say that with no malice. I just say that is the record. I wish to \ntrace that record in some detail in the hours and days that follow. I, \nagain, see my colleague and again, as I say, one of the great spokesman \nfor a better balance at the Fed and for more growth in our economy and \none of the great fighters for small businesses and our farmers present \non the floor.\n  I yield whatever time he might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from Iowa. I \nhave listened to his comments. I know that he has taken some criticism \nfor his position that there ought to be a debate about monetary policy \nhere on the floor of the Senate. But I admire the fact that he will not \nback down. There are big economic interests out there who want to say \nto the Senator from Iowa, ``Back away from this, back down or else.''\n  The Senator from Iowa has one of those stubborn streaks that says if \nsomething is right and it ought to be done, he is going to make sure it \nis done. I say to him I appreciate the fact he stood strong and said, \n``We demand an opportunity to debate on the floor of this Senate,'' \nsomething that is as important to every family and to our economy as \nthis subject is.\n  A century and a half ago, from barbershops to barrooms in this \ncountry, people would talk about interest rate policy and monetary \npolicy. It was enormously important. In fact, if you study the two \ncenturies of economic or financial history of this country, you find \nthat there has always been a constant wrestling match between those who \nproduce and those who finance production. Sometimes you go for a decade \nor two and the financiers have the upper hand. Then it switches and the \nproducers have the upper hand. But always this tension and this \nwrestling back and forth for economic power.\n  In 1913, we created something called the Federal Reserve Board. It \nwas promised at the point of its creation not to become a central bank \naccountable to no one. It was promised that would not happen. Of \ncourse, what has happened at the end of this century is it is a strong \ncentral bank accountable to no one, serving its interests as it sees \nits interests in dealing with monetary policy and interest rates with \nrespect to the American economy.\n\n  I thought it would be helpful just to begin this discussion to put up \non a poster board the Federal Reserve Board. Almost no one ever sees \nthese folks. They are undoubtedly wonderful people. I have only met a \nfew of them.\n  This is Alan Greenspan, appointed in 1987. He has been in and out of \nthe Federal Reserve System in the field of economics and doing \nconsulting work, and so on, for many years.\n  Let me say at the start, we are talking about confirming Alan \nGreenspan, Chairman of the Fed, for another term. I admire him, and I \nrespect him. However, I fundamentally disagree with him about monetary \npolicy and about his stewardship at the Fed. He knows I disagree with \nhim, because we have had these discussions back and forth when I was on \nthe Joint Economic Committee, when I was on the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the House and in other venues. But because I disagree with \nhim on interest rate policy, no one ought to interpret that to mean \nthat I do not admire him. I do. I just think he is wrong.\n  How? Alan Greenspan is the person who heads the Federal Reserve \nBoard.\n\n[[Page S6208]]\n\n He believes that America's unemployment really should not drop below \n5\\1/2\\ percent because that would cause us a lot of trouble. He also \nthinks that economic growth should really not go much above 2 or 2\\1/2\\ \npercent, because that would cause us trouble. He believes largely in a \nhigh-interest-rate, slow-economic-growth policy.\n  It does not take great creativity to pursue a slow-growth economic \npolicy. My Uncle Joe could do that. If I said, Look, our goal is to \nslow the American economy down, my Uncle Joe could slow it down, and he \ndoes not have a Ph.D. in economics. He has no experience at the Fed, \nbut my uncle Joe could slow the economy down.\n  My point is, the current Federal Reserve Board strategy, stemming \nfrom the Chairman, is a strategy that says, ``Let's keep economic \ngrowth rates in this country slow,'' because they believe that that \nrepresents the right balance in dealing with the kind of issues they \nought to deal with, the twin economic goals of stable prices and full \nemployment.\n  The goal of price stability now is the overriding goal of the Fed, \nand the Fed will probably say, ``Well, we have cut inflation 5 years in \na row, inflation is down and it continues to come down. Look at what a \nwonderful job we've done.'' And I say to them, my uncle Joe could have \ndone that as well. Bringing inflation down was not your success. The \nglobal economy has reduced the rate of inflation. You don't see wages \nin America increasing; you see wages coming down.\n  Why? Because two-thirds of the American work force are now competing \nwith 2 to 3 billion other people halfway around the world, some of whom \nwill work for 10 cents, 20 cents and a half dollar an hour. This global \nwork force has put downward pressure on American wages. And as a \nresult, too many families now are working for fewer wages or fewer \ndollars than they used to earn in the same job.\n  So inflation is coming down, wages are coming down, and the Fed will \nsay, ``Gee, look at what a great job we've done.'' I do not know that \nthey ought to claim credit for lowering inflation when the global \neconomy is what has resulted in lower wage rates in America.\n  But I will say this: While they have been about whatever job it is \nthey are doing, America has sustained a rate of economic growth that is \nsimply anemic. This economy has the capacity of producing economic \ngrowth and new jobs and new opportunities at a much greater rate than \nnow exists.\n  Why does it not? Because, in my judgment, the Chairman and the \ncurrent Federal Reserve Board see themselves as a set of human brake \npads whose job it is to slow down the American economy.\n  Let me read something from the National Association of Manufacturers. \nI sometimes agree and sometimes disagree with them. Jerry Jasinowski, \nwho is the president of the NAM and a friend of mine, an awfully good \nthinker and author, writes the following, along with Dana Mead, who is \nchairman and chief executive officer of Tenneco. They coauthored a \nguest editorial in Investors' Business Daily. Let me read what he says:\n\n       Whether it's balancing the budget, raising worker \n     compensation or paying for tax cuts or social and \n     environmental programs, the answer to most of our difficult \n     problems is higher economic growth. Raising economic growth \n     by a mere one-half of a percentage point would generate \n     nearly $200 billion in increased tax revenue over the next 8 \n     years. Personal disposable income would be $180 billion \n     higher in 2003 than 1995, which brings us to one of the great \n     mysteries of the late 20th century: Why is the world's most \n     competitive economy restricting itself to economic growth \n     rates--\n\n  Or he says ``anemic growth rates''--of 2 percent to 2.5 percent?\n  That is the key question posed by the president of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. ``Why is the world's most competitive \neconomy restricting itself to anemic growth rates of 2 percent to 2.5 \npercent?''\n  The answer, he says:\n\n       The Federal Reserve Board. They all seem to buy--not only \n     the Fed, but the CBO, OMB, and the forecasters--the \n     prevailing wisdom that higher growth rates will trigger \n     inflation. That recalls Mark Twain's observation about the \n     cat who once sat on a hot stove. He'll never sit on a hot \n     stove again, but he'll never sit on a cold one either.\n\n  This from a producer, the National Association of Manufacturers, and \nthe chief executive officer of Tenneco, asking the question, why should \nwe be content, as the most competitive economy in the world, with 2 to \n2\\1/2\\ percent rates of economic growth? We are content with that, or \nat least some are content with that, because that is what the Federal \nReserve Board determines our economic growth rate will be.\n  That is what the Federal Reserve Board has managed to do. They make \ninterest rate decisions in secret. They do it in a closed room with the \ndoor shut, and with no debate that the American public can become a \npart of. There is no public discussion that represents any form of \ndemocratic notion at all. They do it in private.\n  This is the dinosaur of public policy institutions. It is the only \none left that is highly secretive, and does all of its business in \nsecret. In fact, here are the Fed's Board of Governors.\n  Then you have the presidents of the regional Reserve banks. They \nparticipate on a rotating basis, I believe five at a time. They join \nthe Board of Governors in what is called an Open Market Committee. They \ndecide what the interest rates will be. They vote in a closed room with \nthe door closed. You and I are not a part of it. The American people \nare not a part of it. They vote.\n  Who do the bank presidents report to? Who are they accountable to? \nWell, they come from the regional Fed banks, and they are accountable \nto their boards of directors. They are accountable to the boards of \ndirectors. Who are the boards of directors of these regional Fed banks? \nBankers. So these folks come to Washington, DC, and in the Open Market \nCommittee vote on interest rate policies. They have neither been \nappointed nor confirmed by Congress. There is no people's involvement \nor people's input here. They owe their job to their boards of \ndirectors, which are bankers.\n  Now, what interests are they going to represent when they are in this \nclosed room with the Board of Governors voting on interest rate issues? \nThe interest of the money center banks, I think.\n  The point I am making here is, this represents the closed system by \nwhich monetary policy is dealt with in this country. It is not \ndemocratic. It is not open. There are many imperfections in this system \ntoday.\n  Would I suggest we get rid of it? No, I do not suggest that. I \nsuggest we make some substantial changes. Do I believe we should give \nmonetary policy to the Congress? No, I do not believe that either. \nShould monetary policy be part of the normal politics of this country? \nNo; it is too important for that as well.\n  But should it be closed off, isolated, insulated, and away from the \nview or input of the American people? Of course not. This is a \ndinosaur, one of the last remaining dinosaurs in our country. Change \nneeds to occur with respect to the workings of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. A little fresh air and a few rays of light creeping through the \ndoors of the Federal Reserve Board would be good for this Board and \ngood for this country.\n  But that is not the issue. The Federal Reserve Board reform issue is \nnot the issue today. Today's issue is the nomination of Chairman \nGreenspan for another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.\n  About 2 weeks ago, there was a story in the Washington Post. They \nwere talking about the political campaign that is now going on in this \ncountry--President Clinton and Senator Dole--and they were talking \nabout the proposals for tax cuts that are ricocheting around and the \nproposition that Senator Dole may or may not propose some across-the-\nboard tax cuts.\n  I thought it was interesting that the former CBO Director, Robert \nReischauer, said something that relates to this discussion today. He \nsaid:\n\n       Whether or not the supplysiders think cutting taxes will \n     make the economy grow faster does not really matter, said \n     former CBO Director Robert Reischauer, now of the Brookings \n     Institution. The Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan, thinks the \n     economy can't grow faster than 2.2 percent a year without \n     triggering inflation. It is not going to happen.\n\n  No matter what anyone thinks about monetary policy issues here in the \nCongress or what they try to do with respect to fiscal policy issues, \nif Alan Greenspan does not believe the economy should grow faster than \n2.2 percent, it is not going to happen, Mr. \n\n[[Page S6209]]\n\nReischauer alleges. Of course, he is absolutely correct.\n\n  I will talk just a bit about what has happened in recent years. I \nwill talk about the high interest rate policies now pursued by the \nFederal Reserve Board. I have a chart that shows the current Federal \nfunds rate. That is the rate that the Federal Reserve Board sets by \nitself. It says, ``Here is what our rate is going to be.'' And all \nother interest rates come off of this rate, with the exception of long-\nterm rates, which are set by the market but are influenced by this.\n  But the fact is, all other interest rates--credit cards, business \nloans, the prime rate--all follow the Federal funds rate. Historically, \nthe Federal funds rate has been 1.77 percent above the rate of \ninflation. In other words, the rent that is incorporated in the Federal \nfunds rate above the rate of inflation is 1.77 percent. These are very \nshort-term funds, as you know. Since Chairman Greenspan came to the \nFed, the average has been 2.18 percent, and the current rate is 2.32 \npercent above inflation.\n  In other words, all other interest rates in this country that \nvirtually everyone pays--consumers and business men and women and \nfarmers and others--is now higher than it should be because the Federal \nReserve Board is keeping the current Federal funds rates much higher \nthan in the past.\n  Why are they doing that? Well, because I guess they fear, if they \nwould cut the Federal funds rates, someone would believe they have \ngiven up their fight against inflation. Despite the fact that the Fed \nhas said that they see no troubling signs of inflation over the \nhorizon. They believe the long-term market in which you have a spikeup \nof long-term rates, or had a spikeup of long-term rates, the assessment \nby the market is wrong.\n  I asked the Fed, ``If you believe that, if you believe there is not a \ncredible long-term threat of inflation or a credible threat of \ninflation just over the horizon, why, then, are you deliberately \nkeeping the Federal funds rates at a level that is historically a fair \namount higher than it has been in the past and, therefore, causing \nevery American to be taxed--yes, taxed--with an interest charge that \nthey did not have any part in being able to debate or talk about or \nwonder about whether they should be paying?'' It is a tax in the form \nof an interest charge extracted from every single American family, \nhigher than it should be, because the Federal Reserve, sitting behind \ntheir closed doors, decides they want higher interest rates. Presumably \nthey want higher interest rates because they want to continue to dampen \nthe rate of economic growth.\n  If you said to Mr. Greenspan or many of the other members of the Fed, \nwhy can't we have more economic growth, which would produce more jobs \nat better pay and more expansion and more opportunity in our country? \nWhy cannot we do better than 2 or 2.5 percent? They would probably say \nto us, well, it is because of inflation. If we have higher economic \ngrowth, then we overheat the economy and get more inflation. ``Look \nwhat we have done with inflation,'' they would say. ``Look at what has \nhappened in 5 years. Inflation has come down, down, down, down, down, \nall the way down to 2.5 percent.'' Because Alan Greenspan has said \npublicly he thinks the CPI overstates the rate of inflation by as much \nas 1 or 1.5 percent, one would conclude that in his mind inflation is \nsomewhere around 1.5 percent or 1 percent in our country today.\n  So, they say, we cannot have a healthy rate of economic growth. We \ncannot have robust expansion of new jobs in our country because they \nare worried about inflation, despite the fact that inflation has come \ndown for 5 straight years, not because of the Fed but because the \nglobal economy has put downward pressure on wages by and large, in my \njudgment. But that is what the Fed would say: No, we cannot have more \nrobust economic growth because we are worried about inflation.\n  Well, I am worried about inflation as well. I think we ought to fight \ninflation. But I think the twin economic goals that we ought to be \npursuing in monetary policy are not only stable prices, but also full \nemployment, which means a robust growing economy. To focus on one \nexclusively, which I think is what is happening at the Fed, I think is \nunfair to the American people.\n\n  Let me provide a record of the economic performance of this country \nunder this monetary policy scheme. I should say that not only monetary \npolicy affects our economic performance; so does our fiscal policy. I \nam not one who wants to pat Congress on the back for its wonderful \nfiscal policy. I understand that we have also caused problems. But let \nus talk a little about what is happening with respect to the economy.\n  Real gross domestic product. Prior to the Greenspan years--I think it \nis about a 20-year period--the average was 3.4 percent of economic \ngrowth per year; Greenspan years, only 2.2 percent. This difference is \nsubstantial. This might look like a bar chart to most people. This \nlooks like unemployment to many people. This looks like families \nwithout jobs. This looks like lost opportunity. This looks like lower \nincome. This looks like kids coming out of college that cannot find \nwork to some people. But this difference is substantial. A 3.4-percent \naverage yearly rate of economic growth prior to Mr. Greenspan going to \nthe Federal Reserve Board and 2.2 percent following, and since and \nduring.\n  Income per capita; 2.5 percent to 1.3 percent. I should note this is \nnot wages. Wages would look different than this. This is aggregate \nincome per capita.\n  Payroll jobs; 2.4 to 1.7 percent.\n  Productivity; 2.3 to 1.1 percent.\n  The record demonstrates a slow-growth economic policy that squeezes \nour economy and dampens our opportunity to produce the kinds of jobs \nand the kind of opportunity we should have in this country.\n  Another chart shows the consequences of this kind of strategy. The \nconsequences of someone saying we should slow the rate of economic \ngrowth might not seem like very much today. The difference between 2.2 \npercent growth and 3.2 percent might not seem like very much next month \nor next year, but if you take a look in the outyears, what you have, \nthe difference in these rates of growth of 2.3 percent annual rate of \ngrowth versus 3.3 percent, you will see that in the outyears, 20 years, \nyou are talking about nearly $3 trillion in additional economic \nopportunity and output. What is $3 trillion converted to jobs, to hope, \nto a brighter future?\n  So while some people may think this is fairly irrelevant whether you \nhave a 2.3 percent rate of economic growth or 3.3 percent, it is an \nequation that will determine our place in the world as an economic \npower.\n  To develop a strategy that says, ``Let's get reasonable rates of \neconomic growth out of our economy so our economy can grow and provide \njobs and opportunity,'' that is not going to happen with respect to \nthis Federal Reserve Board and its leadership.\n  I previously used a chart that showed the real Federal funds rate. I \nalso have a chart that shows the difference in the real prime rate. The \nprime rate, the rate the very best customers of the lending \ninstitutions get their money at, shows pre-Greenspan, 3.09; current, \n5.35; the average Greenspan is 4.63. Everyone borrowing at prime rate \nis paying a higher prime rate than they ought to because the Federal \nReserve Board decides they want to slow the economy down by extracting \nfrom the economy a higher interest charge and slowing growth rates as a \nresult.\n  I have spoken some about the Federal Reserve Board's policies, and \nespecially the monetary policies with which I disagree. I expect some \nwill substantially disagree with me. They will say, ``We like the Fed \nas it is; 2.3 or 3.3 economic growth are irrelevant issues. We want to \nvote to confirm Mr. Greenspan.'' When this debate is over, I expect Mr. \nGreenspan will be confirmed and will likely be confirmed with a rather \nsubstantial vote. I do not intend to join in the vote in favor of \nconfirmation. I will restate again, lest anyone think differently, it \nis not personal. I admire Mr. Greenspan and his public record. I \ndisagree substantially with the policies he is pursuing at the Federal \nReserve Board, and I believe President Clinton would have done better \nfor this country by offering a candidate with a chairmanship of the \nFederal Reserve who would pursue more balanced policies, policies that \ndo not so clearly benefit one part of the economy at the expense of the \nother, policies that do\n\n[[Page S6210]]\n\nnot so clearly benefit the bigger banks at the expense of this \ncountry's productive capability and at the expense of this country's \nworries.\n  I will speak for a couple of minutes about a GAO report that Senator \nReid and I requested be done about the Federal Reserve Board. It is \nanother element that ought to be discussed with respect to a \ndiscussion, not only of the confirmation of Chairman Greenspan but the \nappointment of two other members of the Board of Governors at the \nFederal Reserve Board. We asked the GAO to do an evaluation of the \nFederal Reserve System largely because it sits out there apart from \nother Government institutions. It operates by itself and chooses how \nmuch money it wishes to spend, and takes the money from the interest \ncharges it levies and makes its own judgments about how many people it \nwants to hire and how it wants to spend its money.\n  We have not really had any indepth audits of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. There is very little information about the Federal Reserve \nBoard available to Congress. Senator Reid and I asked for information \nto be made available through the General Accounting Office. We asked \nthe GAO to do the audit. And it took them some 2 years to do it. It was \ninteresting what we discovered.\n  The first thing we discovered was a cash stash, we call it, actually, \na surplus account at the Federal Reserve Board. I suppose some were \naware of it. I was not aware of the surplus account that had been \naccrued at the Federal Reserve Board. This Federal Reserve Board has \nput away nearly $4 billion in a surplus account. They have done so in \norder, they say, to have it available to offset any losses they might \nincur. The Federal Reserve Board has been in existence for 80 years. In \n79 years they have not ever had a loss. In 79 consecutive years they \nhave always had a surplus, they have made money, had no loss, and there \nis no expectation in the next 79 years that the Federal Reserve Board \nwould have a loss.\n  Yet they have captured some $3.7 billion--not million, billion--and \nput it into an account called a surplus reserve account. It has grown \nmore recently because they want to offset against any losses they might \nhave. An agency that has never had a loss and is never going to have a \nloss squirrels away $3.7 billion as a hedge against loss? That seems \nincredible to me.\n  We have a big debt with big deficits. We have a lot of needs. We are \nin a situation in this country where the Federal Reserve Board has \ncounseled, appropriately so, everyone, including the rest of the \nGovernment, to tighten their belt, and the Federal Reserve Board, \nbehind closed doors, decided to overeat. We should tighten our belt; \nthey want to expand.\n\n  I have a picture of a building that the Fed had built. Here is the \noutside of the building, a beautiful building. I would not suggest they \nbuild an ugly building. It is a beautiful building built in Dallas, TX. \nNext, I want to show you the lobby of the building, because one of the \nthings the GAO pointed out was that this Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, \nthey purchased more land than they needed for it. The original square \nfootage approved for the lobby area was exceeded by 250 percent. I \nthought the picture was interesting because they were going to build a \nbank with a lobby that had 7,800 square feet. If you can see this \npicture, we ended up with a lobby with 27,000 square feet. This is a \ngiant lobby with all these wonderful windows and shiny marble, and this \ntiny little desk, two tiny chairs and a coffee table that could fit \ninto a trailer, even if it was not a double wide. They put it in a \n27,000 square foot lobby in a building they built suggesting they would \nhave a lobby of 7,000 feet. The GAO says--I guess the taxpayer here \nends up paying for a 27,000 square foot lobby. Who is accountable for \nthat? Where does it come from? I do not want to spend a lot of time on \nthe lobby in Dallas. I have never been there. I do not expect to go \nthere. I wish them well. In the meantime, somebody had to pay the bill \nto build a 27,000 square foot lobby. Some wonder if that is a useful \napproach to using taxpayers' money.\n  Perhaps we could talk about the cumulative percentage increase in \nFederal Reserve expenses that the GAO found. The GAO is fairly critical \nof the Federal Reserve Board, saying at a time when the rest of the \nGovernment is told, ``Tighten your belt,'' the blue line on this chart \nsuggests their operating expenses far exceed the Federal discretionary \nspending. If you included some entitlement spending here with health \ncare costs that are automatically increasing, you have a different \nchart. This is a chart the GAO made. They point out in the areas where \nthere is discretionary spending decisions that are made, while the rest \nof the Government is told to tighten their belt, the Fed is \nsubstantially increasing its spending.\n  The next chart shows again, while the rest of the Government is being \nasked to tighten its belt, benefits per employee of the Federal Reserve \nBoard in a 6-year period increased 91 percent. Benefits per employee \nincreased 91 percent in a 6-year period, at a time when others are \nbeing told, ``You should tighten your belt.''\n  The GAO report raises a series of questions about the stewardship and \nthe management of the Fed. We intend to address some of those questions \nthrough legislation. I think it is useful for the Congress to read it \nand to evaluate it and have a discussion about it when we are \ndiscussing the confirmation of Mr. Greenspan, the other nominees and \ndiscussing the Federal Reserve Board generally.\n  I have more to say, and there is more time to say it at a later time. \nI will be happy to yield the floor. I will be back on the floor at a \nlater point and finish my statement. I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for \nhis eloquent remarks a few moments ago in regard to the pending \nnomination of Mr. Alan Greenspan to continue as Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, a position he has now held for 8 years. The nomination \nis for another 4 years.\n  When I turned over the floor to Mr. Dorgan I had said at the time \nthat I wanted to begin a process of going through Mr. Greenspan's \nhistory and I thought I might do it somewhat sequentially and then \ntomorrow I will pick up on a little bit more of his background \nregarding his early years. Because, not that I want to go back into \nancient history, but I think you can see a pattern here throughout his \nentire adult lifetime of, quite frankly, being wrong on the economy and \nmisjudging what is taking place.\n  Again, it is my observation that, when you find people who are \nconsistently wrong in a certain area, more often than not it happens \nbecause, I think, that person is more closely linked with an ideology \nor a certain philosophy, and therefore cannot accept facts as they \nreally are, but they tend to be molded into an ideology, they tend to \nbe molded into a conceptual framework and it impacts their view of the \nactual or real facts or real world as it might be.\n  I think Mr. Greenspan's focus on getting as close to zero inflation \nas possible has molded his economic thinking, forecasting views, \nobservations, prognostications, in such a way that they do not really \ncomport with what is happening. Thus, the seemingly endless string of \nerrors that he has made since the earliest times.\n  I quoted earlier from the Investors Business Daily about some of \nthose items. I will now go over a few more, before I yield the floor \nfor the day. But let us start here with the time when Mr. Greenspan was \nthe head of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Ford.\n  President Ford introduced his whip inflation now, plan. I remember \nthe little buttons, the ``WIN'' buttons: whip inflation now. He took a \nlot of his advice and consultation from Alan Greenspan. Let me say \nJerry Ter Horst, Jerry Ford's press secretary, said this about Mr. \nGreenspan and the WIN plan, whip inflation now, and I am quoting Mr. \nTer Horst, who was President Ford's press secretary.\n\n       To be blunt about it, the President has lost confidence in \n     their ability, [meaning the economic advisers' ability] to \n     predict the future. He feels he has received inaccurate \n     advice and, having been burned politically and\n\n[[Page S6211]]\n\n     publicly because of it, Ford has adopted a ``show me'' \n     attitude toward his economic counselors while listening more \n     seriously to the advocates of direct Federal action to \n     overcome the country's economic crisis. This fall, when he \n     fashioned the anti-inflation package he presented Congress \n     following his series of economic summit meetings, Ford relied \n     heavily on the forecasts of his consultants, including \n     economic council chairman Alan Greenspan. They assured him \n     that rising prices and production costs were the prime enemy \n     of a healthy America. He was advised that, while a recession \n     lurked distantly on the horizon, it was not an imminent \n     prospect that would confront him immediately.\n\n  Well, what happened is just the opposite of what was happening--what \nMr. Greenspan had predicted. Let us look here at the recession of 1974-\n1975. This is a question in an interview with U.S. News & World Report, \nNovember 4, 1974. Keep in mind the President introduced his plan in \nOctober.\n\n       Question. Are you prepared to say we are in a recession \n     now?\n       Answer. I would say that as of September, the last month \n     for which we have actual figures--the answer is no.\n\n  That is November 4. The fact is that GDP fell at a rate of 4.2 \npercent in the third quarter of 1974, it fell--not grew--fell 2.8 \npercent in the fourth quarter of 1974, and it fell 5.8 percent in the \nfirst quarter of 1975.\n  So, here we are, we have a GDP falling at these rates in the third \nquarter, which he had the figures then, and the fourth quarter in which \nhe was in the middle of at this time. GDP is falling and he says no, we \ndo not have a recession. There is no recession out there.\n\n  So, again, I think that is why President Ford lost confidence.\n  Let us look at unemployment. Mr. Greenspan was completely off in his \nestimates for the unemployment level for mid-1975. Instead of the 6.5 \npercent ceiling as he predicted, unemployment reached 9 percent in May \n1975. It should be noted that when President Ford introduced his ``Whip \nInflation Now'' in October 1974, the unemployment rate was 6 percent.\n  Here again, the same U.S. News & World Report interview, November \n1974.\n\n       Question. Do you have a projection for unemployment for \n     mid-1975?\n       Answer. I have several, and they all show an unemployment \n     rate of more than 6 percent. It could be as high as 6.5 \n     percent.\n\n  Reality: For December 1974, the next month, the unemployment rate \nreached 7.2 percent. For May 1975, the unemployment rate reached 9 \npercent. Again, Mr. Greenspan was off by more than a considerable \namount.\n  In a March 16, 1975, editorial, the New York Times stated:\n\n       But the administration has consistently underestimated the \n     force of the recession and the rise of unemployment. The \n     first version of President Ford's economic program offered, \n     after his time-wasting economic summits last fall, would have \n     deepened the recession by going all out against inflation, \n     just as inflation was starting to slacken and the recession \n     worsen.\n\n  Again, who was advising the President to go all out against \ninflation? Mr. Alan Greenspan. At a time when we were going into a \nrecession--we already had the figures--at a time when unemployment was \nincreasing dramatically, Mr. Greenspan says that we have to whip \ninflation--forget about unemployment--and we fell into a very bad \nrecession.\n  This editorial went on to criticize the tight money policies and the \nlack of focus on unemployment of the Ford administration that lasted \ninto 1975. Again, I will finish the quote from this article. It says:\n\n       But why should inflation be a threat to an economy \n     functioning far below its full capacity? The administration's \n     own economic assumptions, stated in his fiscal 1976 budget \n     projections, are that unemployment will continue to hover \n     around 8 percent for the next 3 years.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan says it is only going to be 6.5 percent, do not forget.\n\n       If the administration were to walk away from its own long-\n     term forecast of unemployment, it cannot walk away from the \n     existing joblessness, the worst in the postwar period, and \n     the high probability that unemployment will increase over the \n     next few months.\n\n  In fact, unemployment stayed high and did not get back down to 6 \npercent until May 1978. So, we had a long recessionary period there.\n  Summarizing the strategy of Greenspan and Ford, the economist Hobart \nRowan noted:\n\n       Ford and Greenspan were willing to drag the Nation through \n     a long period of recession and stagnation in which layoffs \n     would mount, profits shrink and business expansion be \n     postponed, all in the hope that austerity would cure the \n     inflationary mess.\n\n  That is a quote from the Nation, by Hobart Rowan.\n  The concern about inflation over employment continued well into 1975 \nwhen the Ford administration was beginning its economic plans and \npredictions for 1976. Now we are past 1974; we are now into 1975.\n  Walter Heller, who was President Kennedy's chairman of Council of \nEconomic Advisers, said:\n\n       The fear of inflation is still so dominant in Washington \n     today that it is evidently destroying policymakers' faith in \n     the recuperative powers of the American economy and blinding \n     their sensitivity to the governing plight of the unemployed.\n       Transfixed by this fear, the White House and Federal \n     Reserve authorities are greeting the earliest signs of modest \n     recovery from the deepest of all postwar recessions as if \n     prosperity was just around the corner. The hellfires of a new \n     inflation are about to engulf us and let the devil take the \n     hindmost the job beast.\n       President Ford justifies his veto of the emergency jobs \n     bill last month in good part that economic recovery would be \n     well along by the end of 1975, and much of the bill's impact \n     would not be felt until 1976.\n\n  As we know, unemployment did not come back down again until 1978.\n  Those are a few of the things that Mr. Greenspan said during the \nrecession of 1974-75. Inflation was at a high period and should have \nbeen of concern. But, Greenspan's focus was only on that point. It was \nnot balanced.\n  Let us jump ahead to the recession of 1990-91. This is the transcript \nfrom the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, August 21, 1990. \nEarlier in the day, I said they keep these minutes sealed for 5 years. \nWe now have these minutes from that August 21 meeting. Mr. Greenspan \nsays:\n\n       I think there are several things we can stipulate with some \n     degree of certainty; namely, that those who argue that we are \n     already in a recession I think are reasonably certain to be \n     wrong.\n\n  August 21, 1990.\n  The reality: The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official \narbiter of when recessions begin and end, determined the recession \nbegan in July 1990.\n  In fact, Mr. Greenspan went on after that, later on--and I will get \nthose minutes--when he went clear into November basically stating that \nthere was really no recession at hand.\n  In his testimony at his confirmation hearings in 1987 before the \nSenate Banking Committee, Senator Riegle had the following exchange \nwith Mr. Greenspan. This is Mr. Riegle:\n\n       Now, in the first place, when you were chairman of the \n     Council of Economic Advisers during the Ford administration, \n     the council had a dismal forecasting record. I have here a \n     study by the Joint Economic Committee which showed in 3 \n     years--1976, 1977, 1978--the forecasts of the agency which \n     you headed, Mr. Greenspan, were wrong by the biggest margin \n     of any in the 11 years 1976 through 1986. They tied the \n     record for being wrong in 1978. They were almost as bad in \n     1977, and they were way off in 1976. That's on growth.\n\n  I am still quoting from Mr. Riegle's question.\n\n       When it comes to Treasury bill rate forecasting interest \n     rates, there you broke all records for the entire period . . \n     . when you estimated that you predicted that the Treasury \n     bill rate in 1978 would be 4.4 percent. It actually was 9.8 \n     percent. You were off by a huge margin.\n       In 1977, you predicted it would be 5.3 percent; it was 8.8 \n     percent. Again, way off. 1976 wasn't quite as bad, but you \n     were off then.\n\n  Again, Mr. Riegle, continuing on with his question, says:\n\n       Then we come to your forecast on inflation of the Consumer \n     Price Index. There, again, Mr. Greenspan, you broke all \n     records. 1978 was the worst forecasting year that you had. \n     You estimated the rate of increase in the CPI would be 4.5 \n     percent. It was 9.2 percent. And you were way off in 1977 and \n     1976.\n\n  What was Dr. Greenspan's response?\n\n       Well, if they're written down, those are the numbers.\n\n  As if it just did not matter. The source of this is testimony of Alan \nGreenspan before the Senate Banking Committee on July 21, 1987.\n  So, Mr. Greenspan's private record in the early 1980's was just as \nbad.\n  After Ford's defeat in 1976, Greenspan returned to his economic \nconsulting firm: Townsend, Greenspan. There he continued to make \ninaccurate predictions about which direction the economy was heading. \nIn 1982, Mr. Greenspan's published economic forecasts said bond yields \nwould fall one-\n\n[[Page S6212]]\n\nquarter of a percent from the previous year-end level. In fact, they \nfell 3\\1/2\\ percent. But the drop in inflation was only temporary, he \nargued, in 1983.\n\n  The Fed-Volcker-induced inflation calm, he insisted, was about to \nend. In fact, inflation stayed quite steady at 4 percent to the end of \n1987 and the end of the Volcker regime at the Fed.\n  Also in 1983, Mr. Greenspan said:\n\n       Long-term interest rates would increase 20 basis points.\n\n  This proved to be his best forecast ever. Rates did rise, but by a \nfull 1 percent, not the meager two-tenths of a percent that he \npredicted.\n  At the start of 1984, Mr. Greenspan forecast that for the next 3 \nyears, bond yields would rise from 5 to 55 basis points. They actually \ndropped from 123 to 199 basis points. So even in his private years, \nwhen we look at his forecasts, they were way, way off.\n  Let us look at the rate increases in 1990. As Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Greenspan's forecasting abilities continued to leave much to \nbe desired. Again, according to the June 9, 1995 Investors' Business \nDaily:\n\n       In February 1989, despite clear evidence of a slowdown, the \n     Greenspan Fed pushed its benchmark interest rate higher, to \n     9.75 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee based its \n     decision on staff advice that the recession was low, \n     according to the minutes from that period. The Fed did not \n     start easing rates again until June, too late to avoid a \n     recession. In fact, transcripts indicate that the Fed was \n     contemplating interest rate increases for much of the earlier \n     part of 1990.\n\n  During the August 21, 1990 Federal Open Market Committee hearing, \nthere was much discussion about the possibility that the U.S. economy \nhad slipped into a recession. Backed up by his economists, Greenspan \nbelieved there was significant evidence that showed the economy was not \nin a recession; it was merely sluggish. And thus his quote here:\n\n       I think there are several things we can say with some \n     degree of certainty; namely, that those who argue that we are \n     already in a recession I think are reasonably certain to be \n     wrong.\n\n  He goes on to say in the sense that we do have weekly data that \nsuggests, as others have mentioned, that there was no evidence of \ndeterioration in what was a very sluggish pattern. Yet, the recession \nstarted in July of 1990. Now, you might say this is a little early.\n\n  Two months later, at an October 2, 1990, Federal Open Market \nCommittee hearing, Mr. Greenspan used a meteorological analogy to \nstrengthen his argument that the U.S. economy had not slipped into \nrecession. Mind you, we started the recession in July. We are now in \nOctober, about 3 months into the recession. And here is what Mr. \nGreenspan said:\n\n       I still think we're in a situation in which there are \n     forecasts of thunderstorms, and everyone is saying, ``Well, \n     the thunder has occurred and the lightning has occurred and \n     it's raining,'' but nobody has stuck his hand out the window. \n     And the point is, it isn't raining. The point is, as best I \n     can judge, that the third quarter GNP figures in the green \n     book are not phony. I think they are relatively hard numbers. \n     They can get revised. They are being put down more and more, \n     but the economy has not yet slipped into a recession.\n\n  The actual words of Mr. Greenspan, October 2, 1990. I will not get \ninto the thunder and lightning and the rain and all that kind of stuff. \nWhat he was saying is, oh, there is all this talk about a recession \nbut, he said, I have looked at the numbers and it is not there. We had \nbeen in a recession for 3 months. He was very wrong.\n  The economy actually went into a recession in July 1990, a month \nbefore Iraq invaded Kuwait, by the way. Not only did Mr. Greenspan miss \nthe oncoming recession, he missed it when he was in the middle of it. \nAnd he did little to reverse its negative effects.\n  In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee he rejected measures \nto put Americans back to work by saying proposals by Democrats to \nstimulate economic growth by pumping more Federal money into public \nworks programs were ``risky'' and ``probably counterproductive.'' \nInstead, he denied the economy had gone flat and predicted a moderate \n2.5 percent growth rate that year rising as high as 3 percent in 1993. \nThe GDP only grew 2.2 percent in 1993.\n  Even Senator D'Amato said at a July 1992 hearing:\n\n       I believe the Federal Reserve has acted in an almost timid \n     manner. You, (Mr. Greenspan) don't know what's taking place \n     on Main Street.\n\n  That is a quote of my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato. That \nwas quoted in the Indianapolis Star, July 22, 1992.\n  I think that brings us to a period of time that I want to dwell on at \nsome length tomorrow, that is, the period of 1994 into 1995. As I said \nearlier today, when I tell people that Mr. Greenspan raised interest \nrates 100 percent in one year, February 1994 to February 1995, people \ncannot believe it. They have never heard of such a thing.\n  Yet, here is what happened. The Federal funds rate in February 1994 \nwas 3.05 percent. In May they went to 4.25; March they went to 3.5; \nApril, 3.75; in May of 1994 to 4.25. So from February to May, that is \none, two, three--that is four increases already. And in August another \nincrease. November another increase. February another increase. By the \ntime February of 1995 came around, the Federal funds rate was 6 \npercent, up from 3.05 percent 1 year earlier. A 100 percent increase in \n1 year.\n  And again, why? Was there inflation? Even Mr. Greenspan during that \nperiod of time said he did not really see inflation. I will have those \nquotes and I will have those words.\n  But I just wanted to make the point here before I close--I see I have \nsome other people on the floor who want to speak; probably about other \nitems--that Mr. Greenspan was wrong when he was head of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers. He was wrong when he was in private business. Now as \nChairman of the Fed, when we are in the midst of a recession, he says \nhe does not see it happening. Then in 1994, with little threat of \nincreasing inflation, he raises interest rates 100 percent. That hit \nworking families hard. It slowed our economy down. I think it is a \nlarge part of some of the problems we have now with the stagnation in \nour wages.\n  Mr. Greenspan can have all kinds of reasons why he raised the \ninterest rates. But the fact is, there was absolutely no inflation \nthreatening at all at that period of time. I am going to have more to \nsay tomorrow about 1994 and 1995. I will have the quotes from Mr. \nGreenspan when he basically said that he did not think there was any \ninflation threatening. But he went ahead and raised interest rates.\n  What has happened? You might say, OK, interest rates went up 100 \npercent. But that was February 1995. Since February 1995, throughout \nnow, we have had not seen inflation increase. So have interest rates \ncome back down? Three-quarters of a point. Three-quarters of a point.\n  In fact, the last time they came down, in January, I believe a \nquarter of a point, there was all this talk about how the Fed was now \nreducing interest rates. But the fact is, as Mort Zuckerman pointed \nthis out in his editorial--I will read that tomorrow also--in U.S. News \n& World Report, pointing out that actually there was not a decrease in \ninterest rates. It was an increase in interest rates. Why? Because \nduring the previous period of time, inflation had fallen more than a \nquarter of a point. Inflation fell by more than a quarter of a point \nand interest rates only came down a quarter point. Real interest rates \nwere still high. It was not a real reduction, a reduction in real \ninterest rates.\n  We have had this 100 percent increase in interest rates, 1994 to \n1995. Since that time Mr. Greenspan has only reduced interest rates \nthree-quarters of a point. So I believe American working families, \nAmerican workers, the middle class, the real middle class in America, \nis overburdened by too much debt and too high interest rates. It is \nsapping our economy and hurting our small businesses. It is hurting our \nproductive sector, and it is hurting farming and manufacturing.\n  As I said, it is hurting our working families. It is hurting the real \nmiddle-class America, not Congressman Heineman's middle class, but the \nreal middle class. The Congressman from North Carolina stated last year \nthat he believed the real middle class were people who made between \n$300,000 and $700,000 a year. That is not the real middle class.\n  The real middle class is feeling really pinched these days. They are \npinched by high interest rates that do not need to be there. They are \nonly there because Mr. Greenspan, I believe, has an\n\n[[Page S6213]]\n\ninordinate, unhealthy fear of the specter of inflation. That has caused \nthe kind of hair-trigger approach that they have at the Fed that any \ntime there is even the specter on the horizon of inflation, they will \nmove to increase interest rates, to the point now, that the bond \nmarkets react even before they do it because they think they are going \nto do it.\n  So I am going to discuss the 100 percent increase in interest rates, \n1994 to 1995, why that happened, why at least I think it happened, and \nthe fact that interest rates should have come back down to that \nprevious level by now and could come down, not in one fell swoop, but \ncould have over a period of time. That could have really strengthened \nour economy.\n  As I said, that is nothing personal. I agree with Mr. Dorgan. I have \nnothing personal against Mr. Greenspan. I assume he is a very bright, \nintelligent individual. But I believe that his policies, I believe that \nhis mindset, are locked in the past. After all, this is an individual \nwho as late as last year in committee on the record said that he did, \nindeed, believe in going back to the gold standard, he would support \ngoing back to the gold standard.\n  Well, I do not know how many economists believe that. But I think you \nget that kind of mindset that says, yes, he would like to be on the \ngold standard again. Well, that may have been a good thing at one time, \nbut the world has moved, the economy has moved. We are in a little \ndifferent situation today. I daresay anyone who believes that we ought \nto go back to the gold standard is the same kind of person who would \nhave this inordinate attitude that we must keep relatively high \ninterest rates no matter what, even if inflation is less than 2 \npercent.\n  I believe it does a disservice to our economy, it does a disservice \nto America, and it does a disservice to our next generation of young \npeople coming along. We need to grow this economy. We can do all we \nwant here in the Congress. Because of budget constraints, there is \nnothing we are going to do that could in any way affect the growth of \nour economy as much as lowering interest rates by the Fed could. That \nprobably will not happen as long as we have Mr. Greenspan.\n  (The remarks of Mr. HARKIN pertaining to the introduction of S. 1876 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6197-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6213-S6214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been very distressed, as many \npeople have, over the recent developments in Bosnia, statements that \nhave been made, attributed to a number of our high-ranking officials, \nincluding Secretary of Defense William Perry.\n  Many of us were quite outspoken in our opposition to sending troops \ninto Bosnia back when the decision was made by the President and his \nadministration. I can remember having the resolution of disapproval \nthat I had with Senator Hutchison. We only lost that by four votes. One \nof the selling points on the floor was this is going to be a mission \nthat will be completed, successfully completed, and the troops will be \nout in a period of 12 months. None of us believed that at that time.\n  I can remember so well on October 17 of 1995, the Senator from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman, asked the question of Secretary Perry: ``What \ndo we contemplate as far as a remaining presence once the one-year \nperiod is up, or once the IFOR troop development is complete? Would we \nexpect to see some residual NATO force remain?''\n  Secretary Perry responded:\n\n       ``I expect that the security-- that the function of \n     external forces maintaining security will be accomplished by \n     then . . . The IFOR, the NATO force which is responsible, an \n     external force for maintaining security--we expect that \n     function to be completed in one year and the forces to be \n     completely removed.''\n\n  Later in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he \nsaid: ``The implementation force will complete its mission in a period \nnot to exceed 12 months. We believe this will be more than adequate to \naccomplish the needed tasks that will allow the peace to be self-\nsustaining. As we did in Haiti, we anticipate the IFOR will go in heavy \nand, if successful''--a key phrase--``would begin drawing down \nsignificantly far in advance of the final exit date,'' that exit date \nbeing 12 months.\n  We keep hearing how successful the operation is, so we assume, if \nsuccessful, that condition has been met. He was talking about drawing \ndown the forces far in advance of the 12-month period that he committed \nto.\n  I suggest the commitment was much stronger. I asked in that committee \nmeeting: ``Are you saying to this committee on the record that 12 \nmonths is it, and after 12 months we are out of there?''\n  I remember that distinctly because I asked the question of General \nShalikashvili: ``Can you tell me any time in military history when you \nhad an exit strategy that is geared to time as opposed to events.'' \nThat was October 17.\n  General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nalso responded at that time to a question asked by Senator Robb of \nVirginia. The response was: ``From a military perspective,'' this is \nGeneral Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the top \nguy, ``From a military perspective, as I evaluated the tasks we wished \nthis force to accomplish, it was my judgment that in fact can be done \nin 12 months or less.''\n  Right after that, Mr. President, I wanted to see for myself, and I \nspent some time and went over to Bosnia, went alone, and talked to a \nnumber of the commanders. Not a single U.S. NATO or U.N. commander \nthought the peace in Bosnia could be achieved in anything close to 12 \nmonths. I thought I would talk to the people in the northeast sector, \nwhich is that sector assigned for our troops, our thousands of troops \nthat would go over there and accomplish some mission that is still not \nreal clear to me. I could not get there, only to find out that no \nAmerican had been up there in the northeast sector.\n\n  I remember so well a very attractive British general by the name of \nRupert Smith, who we will be hearing a lot from. He is quite a figure. \nHe took pity on me after the second or third day and agreed to help me \nget up there. So we did, in a driving snowstorm, go up to the northeast \nsector, where we talked to those individuals up there with the United \nNations.\n  The commander at that time, from Norway, was General Haukland, who \nsaid at that time when I said, ``Can you assure us that our \nparticipation up in this northeast sector can be done and the mission \naccomplished and we can be out of here in 12 months,'' and they all \nstarted laughing. General Haukland used the analogy, he said, \n``Senator, it is like putting your hand in water and then leaving it \nthere 12 months, and you take it out of there and everything is back \nthe way it was, and you cannot tell your hand was there in the first \nplace.'' He started talking about the responsibilities we would have to \nkeep peace up there. At one time, when I said, ``12 months,'' he said, \n``You mean 12 years.''\n  ``No, we mean 12 months.''\n  It was a very distressing experience. When we came back, we had \nanother Senate Armed Services Committee, and we repeated the questions \nto Secretary of Defense Bill Perry and General John Shalikashvili. \nAgain, they were emphatic that it would be done. Of course, that is \nwhen we had the lengthy debate on the resolution.\n  I will read to you out of the Congressional Record from December 13 \nfrom this floor, right here, quoting myself:\n\n       But the administration cannot have it both ways. President \n     Clinton cannot say that our vital interests are threatened in \n     Bosnia and at the same time pledge that we will be out of \n     Bosnia in a year. If two vital interests--European security \n     and NATO alliance--are truly threatened in Bosnia, how can \n     there be a one-year statute of limitations on our response? \n     Since when are American vital interests only worth one year's \n     commitment? . . . If there are vital interests at stake, the \n     administration should be honest and tell the American people \n     that we are committed to Bosnia for a longer period of time.\n\n  In the last few days, Tuesday's Washington Post: `` * * * A consensus \nis growing among senior NATO officials that a substantial NATO-led \nfollow-on force will likely patrol Yugoslavia well into 1997, according \nto alliance officials in and Western diplomats.''\n  Strong indications are that United States troops will stay in Bosnia \nfor much longer than 1 year.\n  Finally, yesterday, the other shoe dropped, and Secretary Perry said,\n\n[[Page S6214]]\n\n``NATO will not want simply to give up on the investment that we have \nmade in Bosnia.''\n  This is a kind of a creep that we get into. We make a commitment, and \nwhile mission creep is a very realistic thing, this is commitment \ncreep. We are now saying we will be there for a longer period of time.\n  I wanted to be proven wrong, but I was right when I said on this \nfloor on December 13, 1995, and I have to repeat it now because this \nwill become a major issue:\n\n       The simple truth, Mr. President, is that the Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina is about to become America's pet \n     country. The United States of America is going to own Bosnia \n     and all of her problems just as soon as the 1st armored \n     division sets up in Tuzla. Does anyone really believe that we \n     will leave Bosnia in a year if the threat to her stability \n     remains? Does anyone really believe after arming, training, \n     and equipping the Bosnian army for a year that we will stand \n     by and watch if our pet army is on the verge of defeat? Of \n     course not; if Bosnia is as important as the administration \n     says it is, we will stay in Bosnia as long as we have to . . \n     . I say to my colleagues--\n\n  December 13.\n\n       We are on the verge of what may be a very long commitment.\n\n  I am not saying that to say we were prophetic at that time, Mr. \nPresident. I am only saying that we made that statement. I firmly \nbelieve there are more than four Senators who would have voted for the \nresolution of disapproval if the administration had been honest with us \nand admitted to us that our commitment was going to be longer than 1 \nyear. They were not honest with us. They were not honest with America. \nThat was just a commitment that happens to coincide with the reelection \nin November of this current year.\n  I think it is something we have to address. We will have to make a \ndecision. Are we going to stay in until some tragedy takes place? I \nremember so well--I am not being partisan, I am not just being a \nRepublican on this floor--it was George Bush in December 1992 that sent \nthe first American troops over to another commitment that we had, with \nthe idea they would be coming back in 90 days, and of course Bill \nClinton took office in January 1993, and the troops stayed over in \nSomalia. It was not until 18 of our troops were brutally murdered and \ntheir corpses dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that the \nAmerican people finally put enough pressure on the administration to \nbring our troops home.\n  I see the same type of analogy right here, that we could leave them \nthere indefinitely. I can tell you right now if they do not stay with \nthat 1-year commitment, it will not be just another few days, another \nweek or another month; it will be exactly as every U.N. commander, U.N. \nand NATO force that we dealt with said it was going to be and \npredicted, as we told the American people.\n  It is going to be a much longer period of time. This is a very \nserious thing. We are going to have American troops at risk. It is far \nmore serious than the other one; that is, while we are deploying troops \nall around the world on missions that are either peacemaking or \npeacekeeping--and the world is expecting us to do this now all the way \nfrom the Near East to the Far East to the Middle East--now they are \nexpecting us to come in on the Golan and come into the Gaza on \npeacemaking and peacekeeping missions at the same time we are sending \nour American troops. We are depleting our very scarce resources. As I \nsaid earlier on the floor today, we have been cutting our military \nbudgets each year for 12 consecutive years, and we are in the same \nposition we were back in 1980.\n  So it exacerbates that problem to think we are going to be leaving \ntroops over there longer than this period of time. I am deeply \ndistressed about developments in the Middle East, and about the things \nwe are hearing out of Iraq.\n  I remember so well when the Saddam Hussein--the guy who murders his \nown grandchildren--made a statement 5 years ago that if we had waited 5 \nyears to invade Kuwait he would have had the capability of reaching the \nUnited States with a missile with a weapon of mass destruction. This is \na very serious thing.\n  So we are making it even worse by leaving troops in place where the \nPresident committed to the American people the troops would be out in a \nperiod of 12 months. I never believed they would. Most of the people \nhere never believed they would. I suggested there are many people who \nwould have voted in favor of a resolution of disapproval to keep our \ntroops out of it. Now we are in the position where I would lead the \ncharge to support our troops over there, but we have to go back to the \noriginal mission, keep our commitment to the American people, and keep \nour commitment to this Congress and to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  So I serve notice to the administration at this time that it is not \ngoing to be easy for them to leave our troops over there past the time \nthat they promised and committed to us the troops would be back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the \nreappointment of Alan Greenspan to the chairmanship of the Federal \nReserve Board. If we want to do something about the economy, if we want \nto do something about creating jobs and keeping the economy moving, it \nseems to me that the first step we can take is the quick approval of \nthe nomination of Alan Greenspan. It has been on the agenda quite a \nwhile. I think that we ought to move forward.\n  I have had a chance to observe several Chairmen of the Federal \nReserve Board. I look at what these Chairmen do not in the way of \nspecific policy but in the way of bringing stability, in the way of \nbringing confidence, to the system. It seems to me that Alan Greenspan \nhas been very good at bringing confidence to the system. Confidence is \nvery important in a free market economy. Particularly where a \nGovernment like ours is so dominate in the economy, with about 23 \npercent of the gross national product being our Federal budget. The \nfact that we may make erratic decisions in Government, or unpredictable \ndecisions, or even send the signal that we might be about to make some \nbad decision, can have a very tremendous impact upon the economy; \nwhether the President makes the decision, or whether the Congress makes \nit. The public is very suspicious of the Government making \nirresponsible decisions in an election year. All of this brings a lack \nof confidence in Government action, having a very detrimental impact \nupon the economy.\n  So when you have a steady hand like Chairman Greenspan tends to have, \nit seems to me that it builds confidence. He has given a very good \nstewardship to the American financial system. He has had a very \nconsoling influence over the economy. He has had a sound policy.\n  If we are going to build the economy and create jobs, it means that \nwe need to approve this type of steady person to be Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board. The fact that we are raising some questions \nabout whether he should be confirmed and that we are taking so long to \nget him confirmed, seems to me to be disconcerting to a lot of people \nwho otherwise, if they had confidence that Congress is going to make \nresponsible decisions, would move forward with those business, \neconomic, and investment decisions that are going to create jobs.\n  So I think the reappointment of Alan Greenspan is nothing but good \nnews for jobs and for the economy. He has had the confidence of three \nPresidents of different philosophies. I believe he has proven himself \nto be an effective inflation fighter. Big Government types might be \ndisappointed in the announcement. But the fact is that Chairman \nGreenspan has held the line on inflation, and that has been a big part \nof helping the economy grow.\n  The economy I believe grows because Greenspan himself is a \npersonality. There is a certain amount of confidence building in what \nhe does. He kind of leadership exudes confidence through his \npersonality. This confidence is so necessary for job creation, or I \nshould say for the investment that brings about job creation.\n\n[[Page S6215]]\n\n  We have just spent a lot of time talking about balancing the budget. \nThis very day we passed a budget resolution balancing the budget in 6 \nyears. Unfortunately, not 7 years like we were talking about last year, \nbecause we lost that opportunity when the President of the United \nStates vetoed the first balanced budget act that a Congress had passed \nin a generation. He vetoed it on December 5.\n  If you wonder if Congress can pass a balanced budget, yes. Congress \ncan do it. But we cannot do it over a Presidential veto. So we start \nout again as we did today to balance the budget.\n  If we balance the budget, if we create a situation where Government \nis going to live within its means--and a policy of living within our \nmeans is a much more predictable policy and sends a more clear signal \nabout the economy--then people are going to have more confidence in \nwhat Congress is going to be doing in the future. Just balancing the \nbudget will reduce interest rates by 2 percent. Chairman Greenspan has \nsaid that. That is going to have a very positive impact upon investment \nand job creation, particularly in small business where 70 percent of \nthe jobs are created in our economy.\n  But when Congress has not balanced the budget for a generation--27 \nyears to be exact--when Congress is fiscally irresponsible over such a \nlong period of time, the public has to have confidence that there is \nsome nonpolitical entity out there that is going to be a counterbalance \nto the irresponsible fiscal decisions made by the elected branch of \nGovernment--the Congress and the President.\n  The more Congress acts with fiscal responsibility, the less \nsignificant is the job of the Federal Reserve Board to offset the bad \ndecisions made by the Congress.\n  If the people who raise questions about the impact of the Federal \nReserve, and what they would consider negative impacts of the Federal \nReserve on the economy, would put their muscle and shoulder behind \nhaving a sound fiscal policy passed by the Congress of the United \nStates, then they would not have to be so concerned about the Federal \nReserve. There would be less concern of inflation and less for the \nFederal Reserve to do. The more satisfied the Chairman would be, and \nthe less there would be observation by the financial centers of the \nworld about what he might be saying. We would all be working together \nto build the confidence that it takes to create jobs and to encourage \ninvestment to do it.\n\n  So we, in this body, ought to be putting our energy to not so much \nfighting the appointment of Chairman Greenspan but to being more \nfiscally responsible. Those particularly on the other side of the aisle \nshould have encouraged their President to sign the first Balanced \nBudget Act that had been passed in a generation to get us on the road \nto fiscal responsibility and to build the confidence that encourages \ninvestment and creates jobs. Further, they should stop putting on the \nshoulders of our children and grandchildren our living high on the hog \nin this generation. The immoral aspect of our being materialistic and \nnot caring about who pays for the bill has, more sadly, deprived our \nchildren and grandchildren of the American dream. They deserve a life \nwithout being saddled with paying for an out-of-control Government.\n  Alan Greenspan has been a strong and consistent advocate of our \nbalancing the budget. While we have been spending time debating, \nChairman Greenspan has been on the front line fighting the results of \nbig Government spending, the deficit and the potential inflation that \nthat brings about, especially high interest rates. The Federal \nGovernment is more and more every day in the line seeking credit--we \nalways tend to be first in the credit line and the Federal Government \nwill pay whatever it takes to borrow what is needed--affecting interest \nrates. And the private sector borrowers, who are next in line, are \ngoing to pay more than what the Federal Government pays to borrow \nmoney. There is going to be less investment and less jobs created \nbecause of that. Because he is an inflation fighter, because he helps \nbuild confidence, he has saved jobs by keeping inflation in check and \nhe has helped to provide a steady climate for business to grow.\n  There is a recent Journal of Commerce editorial that states, ``the \nFed and Mr. Greenspan have done their jobs well. The economy has been \ngrowing at a decent rate.''\n  The editorial goes on to quote the chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato, that Americans have ``benefited from a \nlengthy period of stable, predictable prices, making purchase and \ninvestment decisions much more efficient.''\n  The big Government types in Washington think that only the Federal \nGovernment can spend money efficiently. The Federal Government can \nspend money very efficiently, but the efficiency with which we spend \nthe money is more related to the rapidity with which we spend money, \nand not the efficiency with how much we get out of each dollar that is \nbeing spent. There is going to be more economic progress made by that \ndollar being spent in the private sector than being spent in the public \nsector. More jobs will be created as a result of the private sector, \nand that is the efficiency that Senator D'Amato speaks about.\n  I know there are those who would still like nothing more than to \nstart up the Government printing presses and to push more money into \nthe economy, to reflate, as some people would say. But inflation is the \nresult. And inflation is a sales tax on the consumers of America. It is \nan expense on interest being borrowed. It is just another tax that is \nthe most regressive tax that you can have. It is a tax applied \nregardless of ability to pay.\n  For those people on the other side of the aisle who are always \ntalking about: We have to tax the high incomes, tax the wealthy, tax \nthe corporations, be progressive in the taxation--I wish they were as \nconcerned in the war against inflation as Chairman Greenspan is, of how \nregressive the tax of inflation is upon the poor people of America.\n  Those who want to start up the printing presses believe that is the \nway to make the economy grow, a way to solve economic problems. That \nwas the old way for Government to do business. It is still too much a \npart of Government, but not as much of a part, as it has been under a \nlot of other people. All of the previous Chairmen's jobs were more \ndifficult because of an irresponsible Congress for a generation, I \nmight say. I do not tend to blame the Federal Reserve Board. They are \nalways acting after the fact. They are always looking at what is a \nresponsible Congress doing, or, rather is it being irresponsible? The \nblame ought to rest with us, but it is always easier to push it off \nonto somebody else.\n\n  So, all Americans can be thankful that Chairman Greenspan does not \nwalk down the path of inflation, of inflating our way out of the \nproblem. For all Americans today recognize the wisdom of fiscal \nresponsibility. That is why we have 80 percent of the people of America \nwho expect us to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced \nbudget. It does not matter whether that is fiscal responsibility in the \nCongress or in the administration, because they know, if we do that, we \nare going to have a responsible monetary policy.\n  It is ironic, perhaps, that when he was first nominated to the \nFederal Reserve by President Reagan, many thought that Mr. Greenspan \nwould not be aggressive enough against inflation. We must remember that \nhe was replacing one of those legendary inflation fighters of all \ntimes, former Chairman Paul Volcker. All of us remember how Chairman \nVolcker tamed sky-high interest rates that were hurting ordinary \nAmericans. Many were fearful of a return to that time. Now, being \nnominated to a third term, the criticism is being leveled from the \nopposite direction. ``Alan Greenspan is being too tough on inflation,'' \nthese critics say. ``Alan Greenspan should lower interest rates and \nfree up money,'' they say.\n  There is one way to lower interest rates effectively to the benefit \nof the American people and American businesses. That way is to have a \nsound fiscal policy in the Congress of the United States. It is the \nbest way to build confidence. I suppose somebody could argue you do not \nalways have to have a balanced budget to have a sound fiscal policy \nbecause I suppose you could measure it over the long haul, but over the \nlong haul we have been totally irresponsible, year after year, for 27 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S6216]]\n\n  It might sound idealistic, but at least, if you have a balanced \nbudget and the public can predict you are going to live within a \nbalanced budget, that helps to build confidence. Because the more we \ncan do in Government that lends to predictability, the more confidence \nwe are going to build. So, that way is to balance the Federal budget. \nNothing could be more beneficial to the American economy than if we in \nCongress could get our own spending habits under control.\n  During the debate on the farm bill last year, and this gets back to \ninterest rates being lower as a result of our balancing the budget, I \nhad an opportunity to ask the Food and Agriculture Policy Research \nInstitute, an institute working in tandem between the University of \nMissouri and Iowa State University--I asked the Institute what benefit \nit would be to agriculture if Congress balanced the budget. This \ninstitute replied that, if the Federal budget were balanced by the year \n2002, the yearly benefit to agricultural economy would be $2.3 billion \ndue to interest rate reductions. On top of that increased cash flow \nfrom increased economic activity would be another $300 million yearly \ninto the profitability of agriculture. So this adds up to a total \nincrease of $2.6 billion per year, just for agriculture, if Congress \nbalances the budget.\n  The Institute's findings are based on the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate that short-term interest rates would decrease 1.1 percent, and \nlong-term interest rates would decline 1.7 percent. That is still under \nwhat Chairman Greenspan said that interest rates would go down to if we \nwere to balance the budget. Everybody knows, whether it is small \nbusiness or agriculture, interest rates are extremely important to \nprofitability. Farming happens to be a very highly capital intensive \nindustry. Land is expensive and getting more expensive, and farm \nmachinery is expensive. The lower the interest rates the better for our \nfarmers. Small business benefits as well. We all understand the need of \nlower interest rates.\n  But, again, it is better to achieve those lower interest rates \nthrough congressional action on a balanced budget, not on some \ninflationary action by the Federal Reserve.\n  A recent editorial in the Washington Post said it so well--that \neditorial states:\n\n       There will always be a debate about how fast the economy \n     can safely be allowed to grow and where the balance point \n     exists between the risk of renewed inflation and lingering \n     slack. The more success the Fed has had in combating \n     inflation, lately, the more that risk has seemed to recede. \n     But that hardly means that the board's policies have been \n     wrong.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Our own sense is that the board has both less latitude and \n     less fine control of the economy than some of the rhetoric \n     surrounding its decisions would suggest. Its ability to tilt \n     in the direction of growth is further constrained by Congress \n     itself. The budget deficit they have compiled in recent years \n     has given the board little choice but to lean on the brakes \n     as an offset. Mr. Greenspan seems to have done the job in \n     navigating a narrow channel.\n\n  I think that says it better than anything I can say. But it \nreemphasizes, from the Washington Post editorial, the significant \ndifficulty of Chairman Greenspan's job and the Federal Reserve's job of \nfighting inflation when Congress is fiscally irresponsible.\n  If we want the economy to grow, we do that by having a predictable \nfiscal policy, and that is best done when we are committed to balancing \nthe budget year after year after year. In turn, people then can look at \nthe Federal Reserve and say they do not have a very important job; \ntheir job is less significant than our decisionmaking of business \ninvestment and the number of jobs that would be created, bringing about \na stable economy.\n  Congress has not been responsible. So in the meantime, we have to \nhave a master who can stabilize the economy. It seems to me that Alan \nGreenspan serves that purpose. We have seen real growth. We have seen \nreal confidence. We have seen people investing more money in the stock \nmarket daily. We have seen new highs achieved in the stock market. If \nyou do not think that is an important indicator, the President is \ntalking about it all the time as a measure of why he should be \nreelected.\n  But if we want to encourage growth, we have no further to look than \nourselves in this body and the other body. Balancing the Federal budget \nwill promote and ensure economic growth. Confirming Alan Greenspan to a \nnew term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve will keep inflation under \ncontrol and promote economic stability. The American people need this \nstability because it is the only way we are going to create the jobs we \nhave to create to keep the American dream alive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President. I have introduced a resolution against \nthe senseless burning of churches that we have witnessed and, really, \njust become aware of in recent weeks. The latest one, unfortunately, is \nin my State. So I want to speak out on this issue for a few minutes.\n  Let me say, I think all of us have been horrified that a place of \nworship would be a place to be chosen by terrorists to desecrate. We \nall know in this country, whatever our religious preference is, how \nimportant a part of our lives the place of worship is, that it is a \npart of our communities, part of our families and part of what makes \nAmerica so wonderful, that we do have the freedom of religion and the \nability to come together to worship God in a way that we want to do.\n  It is because of that very special place that churches hold in our \nsociety that it is particularly awful that we see a burning of churches \nin any way, but especially in what seems to be a pattern. In fact, \nsince 1991, there have been 110 such incidents of church arson that \nhave been reported.\n  I picked up the phone this week and called Chester Thomas, who is the \npastor at the New Light House of Prayer in Greenville, TX. This church \nwas burned to the ground. Mr. President, I never cease to be amazed at \nhow wonderful people can be in a time of crisis. And, truly, Pastor \nThomas is a person that inspires me because he is so upbeat about the \nexperience that he has just had. He told me that they have been \nexperiencing burglaries in the church and vandalism. But now, of \ncourse, they have lost the church. It was burned to the ground. But he \nsaid that he had just come from a service that was put together by \nanother church in Greenville, TX, a church that said, ``Come and \nworship with us. Bring your congregation to our congregation, and we \nare going to work together to rebuild what you have lost.''\n  You know, that is what America is--reaching out in a time of crisis \nthat helps heal the wounds for something that really is unexplainable \nsuch as burning down a place of worship. But Pastor Thomas was very, \nvery upbeat about it. He said, ``We are going to come together, and \nthis is going to make us stronger, and I love the people of this \ncommunity. I even love the person that did this terrible act, because I \nknow whoever it is is a troubled person.''\n  Well, we can learn a lot from Pastor Thomas. I am here today to say \nto Pastor Thomas and to all of the people\n\n[[Page S6217]]\n\nwho worship at the New Light House of Prayer in Greenville, TX, as well \nas the people who worship in the Church of the Living God in \nGreenville, TX, which was not destroyed but which was burned and is \nbadly damaged, I am here to say to them that all of America cares, that \nthis is not right, and we must condemn the burning, the desecrating and \nthe destruction of religious property.\n  In fact, I am reading from the resolution that condemns the burning, \ndesecrating, and destruction of religious property. We urge Federal law \nenforcement authority to expeditiously and vigilantly investigate and \nappropriately punish the perpetrators of these heinous crimes.\n  Mr. President, this is something that we can all come together and \nfight for. We will work with the President. We will work with the \nentire U.S. Senate and the entire U.S. Congress to say that we want to \nput teeth in the laws that would keep this from happening, because you \nare tearing down the very spirit of a community when you desecrate a \nplace of worship. We do not want to do that. We want to speak out \nagainst it.\n  So I say to Pastor Thomas and to his whole congregation, to the \npeople who also worship at the Church of the Living God in Greenville, \nTX, that we must to stand together against this, and by doing so, we \nwill learn the lesson from Pastor Thomas. We will be stronger. We will \nbe stronger as communities. We will be stronger as a country.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to read the list of the cosponsors of this \nresolution. Besides myself, they are Senators Gramm, Faircloth, \nMcConnell, Cochran, Thurmond, Coverdell, Helms, D'Amato, Murkowski, \nWarner, Nickles, and Abraham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6216-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6217-S6218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING BECKY CAIN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend the \nefforts of a fellow West Virginian, Becky Cain, for her enormous \ncontribution to her State and country. Since Ms. Cain's days as a high \nschool civics and American government teacher, she has worked to \nreverse the trend of low voter turnout and the lack of citizens' \nparticipation in politics.\n  In the 1970's, Ms. Cain began to volunteer for the League of Women's \nVoters, a nonprofit organization aimed at increasing the political \nparticipation of American women. Constantly on the search for new \nvoters, she did not leave her days of manning voter registration tables \nbehind when she became president of the League in 1992.\n  Mr. President, as president of the League, a volunteer post, Ms. Cain \ndecided that the organization should undertake projects that would \nrebuild voters' faith in the political system. She has made it her \nmission to attack the apathy and distance between citizens and their \ngovernment, a recurring problem that the League hopes to cure. Becky \nCain and the League of Women Voters of the United States have made \ngreat strides toward this goal with the passage of the National Voter \nRegistration Act, or the ``motor-voter'' law, in 1995. The ``motor-\nvoter'' law has generated the greatest increase in voter registration \nsince the late 19th century, registering some eleven million voters.\n  Ms. Cain and the League are now focusing on encouraging registered \nvoters to take the second step and to responsibly vote. They have \njoined the Ladies' Home Journal in an effort to educate women voters by \nrunning political features aimed at women's issues.\n  Ms. Cain has been active in West Virginia for more than 20 years, \nworking on numerous advisory boards to the government on issues such as \nenvironmental protection and health care reform. Her experience in \ngrass roots movements has helped her to keep in touch with the voters \nas she fulfills the responsibilities of her national position in the \nLeague.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Becky Cain has ably served her fellow West \nVirginians and the American people through her participation on \nadvisory boards, as well as her volunteer work for the League of Women \nVoters for the United States. She is a West Virginian who embodies the \nqualities and character of a leader, and I salute her for her \ncommitment to the American political process. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a recent article in the National Journal, entitled ``She's in a \nLeague of Her Own,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Natural Journal, May 4, 1996]\n\n                      She's in a League of Her Own\n\n                        (By Eliza Mewlin Carney)\n\n       When Becky Cain started staffing voter registration tables \n     for the League of Women Voters of the U.S. in the 1970s, she \n     frequently ran into people who were embarrassed to admit that \n     they had failed to sign up to vote.\n       Now that she's president of the league, one of the nation's \n     oldest nonprofit dedicated to citizen political \n     participation, Cain still goes to malls and state fairs in \n     search of new voters. But these days the public reaction is \n     different.\n       ``We get people saying: `No. No way. I don't want to \n     legitimize that system with my participation.' That's a whole \n     different change in attitude,'' Cain said. ``They are \n     choosing--deliberately choosing--not to participate in a \n     system that they think is broken.\n       To Cain, a former teacher of high school civics and \n     American government, that change is alarming. Cain's concern \n     has helped prompt the league this year to pursue several \n     projects aimed at rebuilding voters' faith in the political \n     system and at closing the gulf between citizens and their \n     government.\n       Since 1992, when Cain became president, a volunteer post, \n     the league has scored one of its most important victories: \n     the passage of the National Voter Registration Act, or \n     ``motor-voter'' law, which took effect last year. Some 11 \n     million citizens registered to vote in 1995, and another 9 \n     million are expected to do so by November--the largest \n     increase since the late 19th century, the league maintains.\n       Now it's time to make sure that those voters take the next \n     stop and actually pull the lever, Cain said. In addition to a \n     full roster of league get-out-the-vote and voter education \n     activities, Cain's group has teamed up with the Ladies' Home \n     Journal on a massive ``Power the Vote!'' campaign to increase \n     women's political participation, which poll show has recently \n     declined. (For more on the drop in women's voting, see NJ 4/\n     13/96, p. 824.)\n       The league and the New York City-based Journal have set up \n     a toll-free number to help people register and vote, as well \n     as a World Wide Web site that offers how-to tips on rating \n     debates, understanding political polls and interpreting \n     campaign ads. Between now and November, the Journal, which \n     has a circulation of 4.5 million, will also run political \n     features aimed at women.\n       It's one of dozens of ambitious league partnerships formed \n     under Cain, 48, who has been working her way up the group's \n     ranks since 1975. A citizen activist in West Virginia for \n     more than two decades, her eclectic background includes \n     grass-roots political work and a stint as West Virginia's \n     deputy secretary of state. She's also served on dozens of \n     government advisory boards set up to tackle issues ranging \n     from environmental protection to health care reform.\n       Her hands-on political savvy has helped Cain win powerful \n     allies and raise the league's profile. The nonprofit, \n     nonpartisan organization enjoys credibility on both ends of \n     the political spectrum, and a healthy budget adds to its \n     clout. The organization and its educational affiliate, the \n     League of Women Voters Education Fund, spent upwards of $5 \n     million last year.\n       But Cain's down-to-earth, ebullient personality has never \n     allowed her to lose touch with voters and their day-to-day \n     concerns, her colleagues say. Cain still lives in West \n     Virginia, in a town outside the capital called St. Albans, \n     and commutes by plane two or three days a week to the \n     league's Washington headquarters. (The league reimburses her \n     for the propeller plane rides, which officials say are \n     cheaper than if Cain rented an apartment in Washington.) Much \n     of her time is spent on the road visiting the league's 1,200 \n     affiliates.\n       ``She is very much in touch with not only what league \n     members are doing, but with the politics of the country, \n     which I think is an extremely important thing to bring into \n     an organization,'' said Ann McBride, president of Common \n     Cause, which is collaborating with the league and other like-\n     minded groups on a grass-roots lobbying drive to promote \n     campaign finance reform.\n       The league's education fund is helping to host a series of \n     ``citizen assemblies'' nationwide that explore the \n     relationship between money and politics. Dubbed ``Money + \n     Politics: People Change the Equation,'' the project is a team \n     effort with the Harwood Group, a Bethesda (Md.)-based \n     research firm. The idea is to improve public understanding \n     and to brainstorm new solutions to the campaign reform \n     quandary.\n       If the league can help fight the malaise that's driving \n     citizens from politics, Cain said, the 76-year-old \n     organization will, in a sense, have come full circle. \n     Originally launched by women who'd recently won the right to \n     vote, the league has long sought to educate voters about \n     citizenship and coax them to the polls. To Cain, that mandate \n     is timelier than ever.\n       ``We're seeing this erosion of people's trust and faith in \n     the democratic process, in the health of our democracy,'' \n     Cain said. ``Right now, Americans are opting out of the \n     system. That's new, and that scares us. Because\n\n[[Page S6218]]\n\n     we believe in the common good. And you can't get the common \n     good if we're not all at the table.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6217-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on June 11, 1996, a dinner honoring Senator \nMark Hatfield, who will be retiring from the U.S. Senate in January, \nwas hosted by Senator Stevens and myself in the National Archives \nRotunda. I was privileged to make remarks at this salute to my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Hatfield. I ask unanimous consent that my \nremarks, as delivered, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Remarks of Senator Byrd\n\n       The great Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once \n     observed that, ``Life is painting a picture, not doing a \n     sum.''\n       And, indeed, the transcendent life requires much, much more \n     than a mere balance sheet of wins versus losses. Just as \n     shade, hue and the subtle use of light distinguish great art, \n     delicate nuances of character, honor and intellect provide \n     the defining elements of a sublime human existence.\n       The man we honor here tonight has painted a life portrait \n     worthy of Rembrandt. A deeply religious man, Mark Hatfield \n     has done one of the hardest things in life for mere mortals \n     to do. He has actually lived, and even more incredibly \n     conducted a political career in near-perfect accordance with \n     the teachings of his personal faith.\n       Mark Hatfield has been a faithful disciple of his own \n     conscience. He has maintained that fidelity despite intense \n     pressure sometimes from his own party. He has gone against \n     the grain of popular public opinion. He was right about \n     Vietnam when most of the rest of us, including myself, were \n     wrong. He has sailed his boat against the wind time and time \n     again, and only grown stronger from the experience. He has \n     been called a ``maverick;'' yet, the quiet demeanor and ever \n     gentle way of his conversation belie none of the steel in his \n     spine.\n       The blind poet, Milton, wrote, ``Give me the liberty to \n     know, to utter, and to argue freely, according to conscience \n     above all liberties.'' We celebrate tonight the life and \n     achievements of a man who has always known, and uttered, and \n     argued freely from the dictates of his own keen inner voice. \n     He is an inspiration to anyone who has been fortunate enough \n     to watch him or to serve with him in public life. His kind is \n     rare and growing rarer still in this vast city of towering \n     egos, silly pretensions, and paper-mache values. Senator \n     Hatfield is, in the words of Edwin Markham, ``a man to hold \n     against the world, a man to match the mountains and the \n     sea.''\n       Mark Hatfield's decision to return to the peaceful Oregon \n     countryside leaves the United States Senate and this great \n     country with a special kind of uneasy void. The political \n     landscape of this nation will be suddenly starker for his \n     leaving. Markham's words come once again to mind:\n       ``. . . He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again\n       The rafters of the Home. He held his place--\n       Held the long purpose like a growing tree--\n       Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.\n       And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down\n       As when a lordly cedar, green with boughs,\n       Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,\n       And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6218-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSE UP FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Close Up Foundation on the celebration of its 25th \nanniversary.\n  I would like to start this tribute by recognizing Close Up's Oklahoma \nroots. A fellow Oklahoman, Harry Janger, encouraged and guided his son, \nSteve, in the creation of the Close Up Foundation. While we are \nsaddened by Harry's passing earlier this year, his legacy lives on. \nSteve Janger, the president and founder of Close Up, is a native \nOklahoman. He is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, the former \npresident of the university's alumni association, and a continuing \nsupporter of the university. Steve's family still resides in Oklahoma \nand he visits home as often as possible.\n  The strength Oklahoma gives to Close Up does not end with Steve \nJanger. He has involved many other Oklahomans on the foundation's board \nof directors. From the beginning, Close Up has benefitted from several \ndistinguished graduates of the University of Oklahoma--Tom Kenan, Max \nBerry, and Gordon Zuber. Several years later, Joel Jankowsky, another \ndistinguished Oklahoman, joined the Close Up board. These Oklahomans \nand the other board members serve without compensation and devote many \nhours of work to ensure the well-being of the foundation.\n  Their hard work and commitment has paid off. Close Up is the Nation's \nlargest civic education organization, bringing approximately 25,000 \nparticipants a year to Washington for its various citizenship education \nprograms. Close Up has participants from all 50 States, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Island territories. Their \nprincipal program is the Washington High School Program. In addition, \nClose Up has developed programs for various special constituencies, in \nkeeping with their mission of trying to reach at-risk or underserved \nstudents. This commitment has resulted in the creation of the program \nfor new Americans, the program for Older Americans, a program for \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives, and a program for Pacific \nIslanders.\n  Close Up's participants include all kinds of kids, from the \nacademically gifted to those who struggle to stay in school. There are \nstudents with disabilities, students from inner cities, rural areas and \nsuburban areas. There are students from all ethnic backgrounds and from \nall economic situations that are served by Close Up's efforts. Congress \nhas appropriately recognized the importance of Close Up Foundation's \nwork with students from virtually every background imaginable.\n  The uniqueness of Close Up is that it takes all of these students and \nputs them together for a week of learning. What results are strangers \nbecoming best friends, young people breaking down stereotypes, and all \nof them learning the important lesson that as different as we all are, \nwe all share the common bond of American citizenship and the \nresponsibility for ensuring its continued greatness.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Steve Janger, all of the other \nOklahomans, and the thousands of people who have been associated with \nClose Up for the past 25 years. I wish them great success as they begin \ntheir work for another 25 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6218-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE UNITED STATES? HERE'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending June 7, the United States imported 8,000,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,100,000 barrels more than the 6,900,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 56 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that this upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained about 45 percent of \nits oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in \nthe 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? U.S. \nproducers provide jobs for American workers. Politicians had better \nponder the economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when \nforeign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous \ncost of imported oil flowing into the United States--now 8,000,000 \nbarrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6218-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6218-S6219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  INDIANAPOLIS 500 WINNER BUDDY LAZIER\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as a sports enthusiast, I take great \npride on coming to the floor today to acknowledge the extraordinary \naccomplishments of members of the sports community from my home State \nof Colorado.\n  To begin, I would like to pay tribute to Buddy Lazier, winner of the \n80th annual Indianapolis 500 which took place this past Memorial Day. \nBuddy, a resident of Vail, CO, comes from a family with a history in \nrace car driving, his father also being an Indy car competitor and \nfinisher.\n  Winning this event would be a tremendous achievement for any race car \ndriver. What makes Buddy's victory so special is the personal courage \nand strength that it took for him to even compete in the race, for it \nwas only this past March that Buddy suffered a broken back as the \nresult of a crash that occurred in Phoenix, AZ.\n\n[[Page S6219]]\n\n  Barely 9 weeks prior to the Indy 500, Buddy was still in the hospital \nrecovering, feeling no sensation in either his hands or feet. And, yet, \nBuddy arrived at the Indy 500 prepared to compete with every other \ndriver, and in the end, was victorious in race car driving's most \nprestigious race. It takes an enormous amount of strength, both \nemotional and physical, for someone to overcome obstacles such as \nthese. However, the recovery period for Buddy is far from over. He \nstill experiences pain from his back injury. In fact, he had to be \nassisted out of the cockpit of his car when he reached the winner's \ncircle that day.\n  As a motor sports enthusiast, I would like to commend Buddy on his \nskill and courage, and I'm certain all Coloradans will join with me in \ncongratulating Buddy and wishing him well for a full and speedy \nrecovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6218-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COLORADO AVALANCHE VICTORY\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the recent \nsuccess of Colorado's national hockey league, the Colorado Avalanche. \nAs many in this Chamber already know, the Colorado Avalanche won the \nStanley Cup during the early morning hours of Wednesday the 12th, after \nan incredible triple-overtime 1 to 0 win over the Florida Panthers. \nThis victory marks the first world championship in a major sport for \nColorado, the Centennial State.\n  We were fortunate enough to have the Avalanche move to Colorado from \nQuebec, where they were known as the Nordiques. This last year was \ntheir very first season playing in Colorado, and their defeat of the \nPanthers make the Avalanche only the second expansion team in \nprofessional sports history to win a championship in its opening \nseason.\n  During the course of the playoffs, the Avalanche also set a number of \nother records. For instance, the final game against the Panthers is now \non record as being the longest scoreless game in finals history, with \nUwe Krupp's winning goal coming after 104 minutes and 31 seconds of \nplay.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to commend both the Colorado \nAvalanche and the Florida Panthers on an exciting Stanley Cup final, \nand I congratulate the Avalanche on a job well done. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6219-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE VERY BAD FEDERAL DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in making these daily reports about the \nFederal debt, which I began on February 27, 1992, I have tried to avoid \npartisan comment. But if I were a young American, just beginning my \ncareer, or just beginning to set up my family, I would be greatly \nconcerned at the breakdown of the Senate vote on the budget resolution \nearlier today.\n  No, I would be more than concerned. I would be angry. The American \npeople have demonstrated a hundred times in countless different ways \nthat they want the tragic finances of the Federal Government cleaned \nup. They want a balanced Federal budget. They want Federal spending to \nbe brought under control.\n  But in all fairness, Mr. President, when one looks at the 53 to 46 \nvote today on the budget resolution, it is apparent that the finances \nof the Federal Government are not going to be cleaned up, and the \nFederal budget is not going to be balanced, and Federal spending is not \ngoing to be brought under control. Not by the 104th Congress in any \nevent.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution approved today by the votes of \n53 Republicans is not really going to help the young people of America \nwho are now moving into maturity. The best that can be said of it is \nthat it's better than doing nothing. None of the 46 Senators who today \nvoted against the resolution has made any noticeable effort to cut \nFederal spending except for occasional efforts to try to downgrade our \nNation's national defense.\n  As a result, the Federal debt, which today exceeds $5 trillion by \nmore than $100 billion, will stand at a minimum of $6.5 trillion \nshortly after the turn of the century. Even under the resolution \napproved today, the interest on the Federal debt in 1997 will cost the \ntaxpayers more than $282 billion; and in the year 2002, the American \ntaxpayers will be socked for a minimum of $302 billion just to pay the \ninterest on the debt that the Congress of the United States will have \nrun up by that time.\n  Where did I get these figures? I got them by calling the \nCongressional Budget Office which acknowledged that the sad story I've \noutlined here probably will be even worse on the taxpayers than today's \nCBO's computations.\n  Mr. President, 4 years ago when I commenced these daily reports to \nthe Senate it was my purpose to make a matter of daily record the exact \nFederal debt as of the close of business the previous day.\n  In that first report on February 27, 1992, the Federal debt at the \nclose of business the previous day stood at $3,825,891,293,066.80. Fast \nforward to yesterday when, at the close of business, a total of \n$1,315,395,536,138.33 had been added to the Federal debt since February \n26, 1992.\n  Yesterday, Wednesday, June 12, 1996, the exact Federal debt stood at \n$5,141,286,829,205.13 at the close of business. On a per capita basis, \nevery man, woman, and child in America owes $19,396.59 as his or her \nshare of the Federal debt. But since the majority of Americans are \nchildren, or are unemployed, or pay only a small amount of taxes, the \n``per capita'' computation is almost meaningless. You might want to \nponder what your share of the debt really is.\n  And today's young people really have an enormous burden facing them \nin the 20th century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6219-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LABELCRAFTERS OF SOUTH DAKOTA, INC.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to share a story of how one South \nDakota family turned their vision and entrepreneurial drive into a \nthriving business. ``We had one press, one employee, and zero \ncustomers.'' That statement tells the story of the beginning of \nLabelcrafters of South Dakota, Inc., the Sioux Falls-based company \nhonored by the Small Business Administration. Del and Janice Buttolph \nstarted Labelcrafters in 1987 and 9 years later are being named the \nSouth Dakota Small Business Persons of the Year. They manufacture \npressure-sensitive labels for a variety of manufacturers in the four-\nState region.\n  The Buttolphs met with me here in Washington, DC, during Small \nBusiness Week. That statement about their beginning is indicative of \nthe risk-taking, entrepreneurial spirit, and dedication small business \nowners like Del and Janice Buttolph bring to a business startup. I know \nfrom my discussions with them that they brought great talent and \nexperience to this venture.\n  The Labelcrafter motto is ``Quality and Service--Our Priority.'' \nActing on this motto has resulted in growth to 27 employees and three \nstate-of-the-art presses with a fourth on the way. In fact, they plan \non expanding into a larger building next year.\n  We all strive to learn the ingredients of a successful business \nstartup. Besides their commitment to quality and service, I was most \nimpressed by their commitment to treating their employees well. They \nprovide employees with health, life, and disability insurance, a 401(k) \nplan matched by the company, and well-paying jobs. I hope their \nexperience is an inspiration not only to budding entrepreneurs, but to \nestablished companies as well.\n  The Buttolphs were helped in this venture by the Small Business \nAdministration, which provided timely and technical advice and cost-\nsensitive capital through the local bank. This public-private \ncollaboration worked exactly as it was designed by Congress. As a \nresult of their initiative and dedication, the Buttolphs produce a \nquality product, provide excellent service, and run a profitable \nbusiness that benefits their 27 employees and the Sioux Falls \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6219-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6219-S6220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent resolution (H. \nCon.

and\n       ``Whereas, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to implement \n     increased competition in the electric utility industry, but \n     does not relieve FERC or other federal agencies of their \n     responsibility and obligation to act in the public interest \n     and to carefully review and mitigate critical environmental \n     and health impacts that may result from open access to \n     transmission services; and\n       ``Whereas, FERC's draft Environmental Impact Statement on \n     its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Promoting Wholesale \n     Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory \n     Transmission Service by Public Utilities (the ``Mega-NOPR''), \n     asserts that sizable increases in air pollution could occur \n     due to a shift from cleaner generation sources to cheaper and \n     dirtier generators, but then greatly underestimates FERC's \n     obligation to mitigate the impact of its proposed Mega-NOPR \n     actions, by selecting an inappropriate base case which \n     assumes incremental implementation of the same policy of open \n     transmission access, instead of selecting the more \n     appropriate base case of no action and current air quality \n     trends; and\n       ``Whereas, there is sufficient underutilized electric \n     generating capacity in midwestern states, subject to much \n     lower air emissions standards than competitors in \n     northeastern states, so that implementing open transmission \n     access, without more appropriate, comparable and equitable \n     environmental regulation, could result in increased \n     electricity generation in midwestern states and significant \n     additional air pollution transport to northeastern states; \n     and\n       ``Whereas, federal air pollution regulation of electric \n     generators has too often been inappropriately based almost \n     exclusively on air quality in the vicinity of the generator, \n     without sufficient consideration of the effects of transport \n     of pollutants to downwind areas;

and\n       ``Whereas, New Hampshire's electric rates have been much \n     higher than the national average for many years, a \n     substantial cause of which has been New Hampshire's pursuit \n     over many years of lesser-polluting electricity sources as \n     alternatives to construction of additional lower-cost, higher \n     polluting coal-fired stations; and\n       ``Whereas, New Hampshire, as a result of its Reasonably \n     Available Control Technology (RACT) requirements for its own \n     electrical generating stations, has shown that state-of-the-\n     art selective catalytic reduction (SCR) RACT equipment \n     installed at New Hampshire's largest coal-fired electrical \n     generating station is a cost-effective method for reducing \n     emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and would be cost-\n     effective in other states as well; and\n       ``Whereas, the costs for upwind electric generators to make \n     similar source emission reductions, particularly in coal-\n     fired stations, typically appear to be significantly smaller \n     than the costs to northeastern states to compensate for \n     transported air pollution by imposing more expensive \n     mitigation measures on other sources of pollution; and\n       ``Whereas, such source mitigation costs also appear to be \n     only a small fraction of the potential additional revenue \n     from increased generation by low cost coal-fired generators \n     as a result of FERC's Mega-NOPR; and\n       ``Whereas, Governor Stephen Merrill indicated in a July 20, \n     1995 letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner that New \n     Hampshire is not willing to subsidize the economy, \n     environment, health and quality of life of upwind states at \n     the expense of those aspects of its own citizens' lives;

A bill to make certain technical corrections in the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  THE INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Kassebaum, Murkowski, Stevens, and Simon to introduce \nlegislation to make various technical amendments to the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act.\n  The bill we are introducing today will simply make technical changes \nto certain provisions of the act and extend the authorization for \nseveral Indian health care demonstration programs.\n  Mr. President, the Congress passed the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct in 1976 to raise the level of health care provided to American \nIndians and Alaska Native communities. While the health status of \nIndian people has generally improved since its enactment, it still lags \nfar behind any other segment of our population. Health crises in every \npossible problem area continue to afflict many reservation communities \nat alarming rates. The mortality rate for diabetes exceeds the national \naverage by 139 percent. American Indians are four times more likely to \ndie from alcoholism than other Americans. The incidence rates for fetal \nalcohol syndrome among native Americans is six times the national \naverage.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted to meet the \nfundamental trust obligation of the United States to ensure that \ncomprehensive health care would be provided to American Indians and \nAlaska Natives as it is provided to all other Americans. The act was \namended in 1992 to extend most of the authorized programs through the \nyear 2000, at which time the Indian Health Service is required to \nreport to Congress on the progress of meeting the health objectives \noutlined in the act. Until such time, we are seeking to make minor \nchanges to certain provisions of the act to allow maximum flexibility \nin the delivery of health services to American Indians and Alaska \nNatives and to ensure that several important tribal programs can \ncontinue through the year 2000.\n  First, the bill amends section 4(n), the Indian health scholarship \nand loan repayment fund, by modifying the definition of the term \n``Health Profession.'' This modification will provide greater \nflexibility to the IHS to determine eligibility for financial \nassistance to Indians enrolled in health degree programs. Second, the \nbill amends section 104(b), the Indian health professions scholarship, \nto maximize opportunities for scholarship recipients to meet their \nservice obligations to the IHS. It also authorizes the Secretary to \nwaive or suspend a service or payment obligation upon death, extreme \nhardship conditions or bankruptcy. Next, the bill amends section 206 \nregarding reimbursement from certain third parties of costs of health \nservices to clarify the provisions for individuals in collection \nactions for services provided by IHS or tribal health facilities. These \nprovisions were previously adopted by the Senate on October 31, 1995 as \npart of S. 325, the Native American Technical Corrections Act. However, \nthe House has not yet acted upon S. 325 because the bill contained \nprovisions resulting in joint referrals to a number of House \ncommittees. The bill I am introducing today has been drafted to permit \nreferral to just one House Committee.\n\n  The bill also amends section 405 to continue the Medicare/Medicaid \nDemonstration Program for direct billing of Medicaid, Medicare and \nother third party payers. The demonstration program authorizes up to \nfour tribally-operated IHS hospitals or clinics to participate directly \nin the billing and receipt of Medicare/Medicaid payments rather than \nthrough the current system of channeling payments through the IHS. The \nfour participating tribes including Mississippi Choctaw Health Center, \nBristol Bay Area Health Corporation, Choctaw Tribe of Oklahoma and \nSouth East Alaska Regional Health Consortium, unanimously report \nsuccessful results and satisfaction with the program. Collections for \nsome of these tribes have since doubled due to the implementation of \nthe program. I have also received a strong interest from other Indian \ntribes in expanding this program so that other eligible tribal \noperators may participate in this direct billing process.\n  The Medicare/Medicaid Demonstration Program is set to expire on \nSeptember 30, 1996 at which time the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services will evaluate the program and provide a \nrecommendation on whether the program should be made a permanent \nprogram. However, without this proposed extension, the four tribal \nparticipants will be forced to shut down their direct billing/\ncollection departments and return to the old system of IHS-managed \ncollections.\n  Given the highly favorable reports of the participating tribal \nprograms, we are proposing to continue the program through the year \n2000 and expand the number of eligible tribal facilities from four to \ntwelve. The Congress will evaluate the future of the program when the \nSecretary has submitted the final report on the project.\n  Finally, the act extends the authorization for several innovative \nhealth care demonstration projects that were established as model \nprograms to be replicated on other Indian reservations. Several of \nthese demonstration projects, including the California Contract Health \nServices Demonstration Program, the Gallup Alcohol and Substance Abuse \nDemonstration Program, the Substance Abuse Counselor Education \nDemonstration Program and the Home and Community Based Care \nDemonstration Program, are due to sunset in this fiscal year.\n  While the programs expire in fiscal year 1997, the Secretary is not \nrequired to provide a report on these programs until 1999. I believe \nthat these programs should be reauthorized through the year 2000 in \norder to continue the important health care services provided by these \nprograms and to achieve consistency with other portions of the act. The \nbill will simply extend the authorization for these programs through \nthe year 2000 until such time that the Secretary prepares his report on \nthe entire Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is necessary to ensure the \ncontinuation of these important health care programs for Indian people. \nIt is my hope that we can move this bill quickly and favorably.

A bill to establish a medical education trust fund, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE MEDICAL EDUCATION TRUST FUND ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould establish a Medical Education Trust Fund to support America's 124 \nmedical schools and 1,250 teaching hospitals. These institutions are \nnational treasures; they are the very best in the world. Yet today they \nfind themselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces \nreshape the health care delivery system in the United States. Explicit \nand dedicated funding for these institutions, which this legislation \nwill provide, will ensure that the United States continues to lead the \nworld in the quality of its health care system.\n  This legislation requires that the public sector, through the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector, through an \nassessment on health insurance premiums, will contribute broad-based \nand fair financial support. Over the 5-year period, 1997 to 2001, the \nMedical Education Trust Fund established under this legislation would \nprovide average annual payments of about $17 billion, roughly doubling \nthe funding that we currently provide for medical education.\n\n\n                             Brief History\n\n  My particular interest in this subject began in 1994, when the \nFinance Committee took up the President's Health Security Act. I was \nChairman of the Committee at the time. In January of that year, I asked \nPaul Marks, M.D., President of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center \nin New York City, if he would arrange a ``seminar'' for me on health \ncare issues. He agreed, and gathered a number of medical school deans \ntogether one morning in New York.\n  Early on in the meeting, one of the seminarians remarked that the \nUniversity of Minnesota might have to close its medical school. In an \ninstant I realized I had heard something new. Minnesota is a place \nwhere they open medical schools, not close them. How, then, could this \nbe? The answer was that Minnesota, being Minnesota, was a leading state \nin the growth of Health Maintenance Organizations, and HMO's do not \nsend patients to teaching hospitals, absent which you cannot have a \nmedical school.\n  We are in the midst of a great age of discovery in medical science. \nIt is certainly not a time to close medical schools. This great era of \nmedical discovery is occurring right here in the United States, not in \nEurope like past ages of scientific discovery. And it is centered in \nNew York City. This heroic age of medical science started in the late \n1930's. Before then, the average patient was probably as well off, \nperhaps better, out of a hospital as in one. Progress from that point \n60 years ago has been remarkable. The last few decades have brought us \nimages of the inside of the human body based on the magnetic resonance \nof bodily tissues; laser surgery; micro surgery for reattaching limbs; \nand organ transplantation, among other wonders. I can hardly imagine \nwhat might be next. Physicians are now working on a gene therapy that \nmight eventually replace bypass surgery.\n  After months of hearings and debate on the President's Health \nSecurity Act, I became convinced that special provisions would have to \nbe made for medical schools, teaching hospitals, and medical research \nif we were not to see this great moment in medical science suddenly \nconstrained. To that end, when the Committee on Finance voted 12 to 8 \non July 2, 1994, to report the Health Security Act, it included a \ngraduate medical education and academic health centers trust fund. The \ntrust fund provided an 80-percent increase in Federal funding for \nacademic medicine; as importantly, it represented stable, long-term \nfunding. While nothing came of the effort to enact universal health \ncare coverage, the medical education trust fund enjoyed widespread \nsupport. An amendment by then-Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming to kill \nthe trust fund by striking the source of its revenue--a 1.75-percent \nassessment on health insurance premiums--failed on a 7 to 13 vote in \nthe Finance Committee.\n  I continued to press the issue in the first session of the 104th \nCongress. On September 29, 1995, during Finance Committee consideration \nof the budget reconciliation legislation, I offered an amendment to \nestablish a similar trust fund. With a new majority in control and the \ncommittee in the midst of considering a highly partisan budget \nreconciliation bill, my amendment failed on a tie vote, 10 to 10. \nNotably, however, the House version of the reconciliation bill did \ninclude a graduate medical education trust fund. That provision \nultimately passed both Houses as part of the conference agreement, \nwhich was subsequently vetoed by President Clinton.\n\n  The conference agreement on the budget resolution, being considered \nby the Senate and House this week, also apparently assumes that this \nyear's Medicare reconciliation bill will include a similar trust fund.\n  That is the history of this effort, briefly stated.\n\n\n                          Need for Legislation\n\n  Medical education is one of America's most precious public resources. \nIt should be explicitly financed with contributions from all sectors of \nthe health care system, not just the Medicare Program as is the case \ntoday. The fiscal pressures of a competitive health care market are \nincreasingly closing off traditional implicit revenue sources--such as \nadditional payments from private payers--that have in the past \nsupported medical schools, graduate medical education, and research. \nThis legislation provides alternative funding to prevent the \ndeterioration of these institutions and the invaluable services they \nprovide.\n  Events in Rochester, NY, a community with a long and proud tradition \nof quality, cost-effective health care, provide a good example of how \nmarket forces are reshaping the health care delivery system. Last year, \nthe only option available to retirees of Kodak at no additional cost \nwas a managed care plan. Unfortunately, that managed care plan excluded \nStrong Memorial, Rochester's prestigious teaching hospital. Strong \nMemorial was established in 1920 with the help of George Eastman and \nwas named for Henry Strong, a financier of Eastman. Yet ironically, 75 \nyears later, Eastman Kodak's retirees could not get care at Strong \nMemorial Hospital.\n  After much protest, the managed care plan brought Strong Memorial \ninto its provider network, but only after Kodak agreed to make separate \npayments for 1 year to support the costs of graduate medical education \nat\n\n[[Page S6229]]\n\nStrong. The Rochester community worked out a solution, however \ntemporary, to the problems faced by its primary teaching hospital, but \nwe cannot, and should not, rely on the Kodaks of the world to finance \nmedical education. We must adopt a comprehensive Federal strategy.\n  Other teaching hospitals are facing similar difficulties. In its June \n1995 ``Report to Congress,'' the Prospective Payment Assessment \nCommission [ProPAC], the Commission which advises Congress on Medicare \nhospital insurance part A payment, summarized the situation of teaching \nhospitals as follows:\n\n       As competition in the health care system intensifies, the \n     additional costs borne by teaching hospitals will place them \n     at a disadvantage relative to other facilities. The role, \n     scale, function, and number of these institutions \n     increasingly will be challenged. . .. Accelerating price \n     competition in the private sector . . . is reducing the \n     ability of teaching hospitals to obtain the higher patient \n     care rates from other payers that traditionally have \n     contributed to financing the costs associated with graduate \n     medical education.\n\n  ProPAC's June 1996 ``Report to Congress,'' issued just last week, \nconfirmed that ``major teaching hospitals have the dual problems of \nhigher overall losses from uncompensated care and less above cost \nrevenue from private insurers.''\n  It is obvious that teaching hospitals can no longer rely on higher \npayments from private payers to cover the costs of their teaching \nprograms. Nor should they. The establishment of this trust fund, which \nreimburses teaching hospitals for the costs of graduate medical \neducation, will ensure that teaching hospitals can pursue their vitally \nimportant patient care, training, and research missions in the face of \nan increasingly competitive health system.\n  Medical schools also face an uncertain future. There are many policy \nissues that need to be examined regarding the role of medical schools \nin our health system, but two threats faced by medical schools now \nrequire immediate attention. This legislation addresses both. First, \nmany medical schools are immediately threatened by the dire financial \ncondition of their affiliated teaching hospitals. Medical schools rely \non teaching hospitals to provide a place for their faculty to practice \nand perform research, a place to send third- and fourth-year medical \nschool students for training, and for some direct revenues. By \nimproving the financial condition of teaching hospitals, this \nlegislation significantly improves the outlook for medical schools.\n\n  The second immediate threat faced by medical schools stems from their \nreliance on a portion of the clinical practice revenue generated by \ntheir faculties to support their operations. As competition within the \nhealth system intensifies and managed care proliferates, these revenues \nare shrinking. This legislation provides payments to medical schools \nfrom the trust fund that are designed to partially offset this loss of \nrevenue.\n  None of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the new competitive \nforces reshaping health care have brought only negative results. To the \ncontrary, the onset of competition has had many beneficial effects, the \ndramatic curtailing of growth in health insurance premiums being the \nmost obvious. But as Msgr. Charles J. Fahey of Fordham University \nwarned in testimony before the Finance Committee in 1994, we must be \nwary of the ``commodification of health care,'' by which he meant that \nhealth care is not just another commodity. We can rely on competition \nto hold down costs in much of the health system, but we must not allow \nit to bring a premature end to this great age of medical discovery, an \nage made possible by this country's exceptionally well-trained health \nprofessionals and superior medical schools and teaching hospitals. This \nlegislation complements a competitive health market by providing tax-\nsupported funding for the public services provided by teaching \nhospitals and medical schools.\n\n\n                       Description of Legislation\n\n  The medical education trust fund established in the legislation I \nhave just introduced would receive funding from three sources broadly \nrepresenting the entire health care system: A 1.5-percent tax on health \ninsurance premiums, the private sector's contribution; Medicare, and \nMedicaid, the latter two sources comprising the public sector's \ncontribution. The relative contribution from each of these sources will \nbe in rough proportion to the medical education costs attributable to \ntheir respective covered populations.\n  Over the 5-year period 1997 to 2001, the medical education trust fund \nwill provide average annual payments of about $17 billion. The tax on \nhealth insurance premiums, including self-insured health plans, raises \napproximately $4 billion per year for the trust fund. Federal health \nprograms contribute about $13 billion per year to the trust fund: $9 \nbillion in transfers of Medicare graduate medical education payments \nand $4 billion in Federal Medicaid spending.\n  This legislation is only a first step. It establishes the principle \nthat, as a public good, medical education should be supported by \ndedicated, long-term Federal funding. To ensure that the United States \ncontinues to lead the world in the quality of its medical education and \nits health system as a whole, the legislation would also create a \nmedical education advisory commission to conduct a thorough study and \nmake recommendations, including the potential use of demonstration \nprojects, regarding the following: alternative and additional sources \nof medical education financing; alternative methodologies for financing \nmedical education; policies designed to maintain superior research and \neducational capacities in an increasingly competitive health system; \nthe appropriate role of medical schools in graduate medical education; \nand policies designed to expand eligibility for graduate medical \neducation payments to institutions other than teaching hospitals.\n  Mr. President, the services provided by this Nation's teaching \nhospitals and medical schools--groundbreaking research, highly skilled \nmedical care, and the training of tomorrow's physicians--are vitally \nimportant and must be protected in this time of intense economic \ncompetition in the health system. I therefore urge Senators to support \nthe Medical Education Trust Fund Act of 1996.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary and a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These institutions are in a precarious financial \n     situation as market forces reshape the health care delivery \n     system. Explicit and dedicated funding for these institutions \n     will guarantee that the United States continues to lead the \n     world in the quality of its health care system.\n       The Medical Education Trust Fund Act of 1996 recognizes the \n     need to begin moving away from existing medical education \n     payment policies. Funding would be provided for demonstration \n     projects and alternative payment methods, but permanent \n     policy changes would await a report from a new Medical \n     Education Advisory Commission established by the bill. The \n     primary, and immediate, purpose of the legislation is to \n     establish as Federal policy that medical education is a \n     public good which should be supported by all sectors of the \n     health care system.\n       To ensure that the burden of financing medical education is \n     shared equitably by all sectors, the Medical Education Trust \n     Fund\n\n[[Page S6234]]\n\n     will receive funding from three sources: a 1.5 percent \n     assessment on health insurance premiums (the private sector's \n     contribution), Medicare, and Medicaid (the public sector's \n     contribution). The relative contribution from each of these \n     sources is in rough proportion to the medical education costs \n     attributable to their respective covered populations.\n       Over the five year period 1997-2001, the Medical Education \n     Trust Fund will provide average annual payments of about $17 \n     billion, roughly doubling federal funding for medical \n     education. The assessment on health insurance premiums \n     (including self-insured health plans) contributes \n     approximately $4 billion per year to the Trust Fund. Federal \n     health programs contribute about $13 billion per year to the \n     Trust Fund: $9 billion in transfers of current Medicare \n     graduate medical education payments and $4 billion in federal \n     Medicaid spending.\n\n    Estimated Average Annual Trust Fund Revenue By Source, 1997-2001\n\n                        (In billions of dollars)\n\n1.5% Assessment.......................................................4\nMedicare..............................................................9\nMedicaid..............................................................4\n                                                               ________\n\n  Total..............................................................17\n\n\n                     INTERIM PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES\n\n                      Payments to Medical Schools\n\n       Medical schools rely on a portion of the clinical practice \n     revenue generated by their faculties to support their \n     operations. As competition within the health system \n     intensifies and managed care proliferates, these revenues are \n     being constrained. Payments to medical schools from the Trust \n     Fund are designed to partially offset this loss of revenue. \n     Initially, these payments will be based upon an interim \n     methodology developed by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services.\n\n                     Payments to Teaching Hospitals\n\n       To cover the costs of education, teaching hospitals have \n     traditionally charged higher rates than other hospitals. As \n     private payers become increasingly unwilling to pay these \n     higher rates, the future of these important institutions, and \n     the patient care, training, and research they provide, is \n     placed at risk. Payments from the Trust Fund reimburse \n     teaching hospitals for both the direct and indirect costs of \n     graduate medical education.\n       Payments for direct costs are based on the actual costs of \n     employing medical residents. Payments for indirect costs are \n     based on the number of patients cared for in each hospital \n     and the severity of their illnesses as well as a measure of \n     the teaching load in that hospital. For the purposes of \n     payments to teaching hospitals, the allocation of Medicare \n     funds is based on the number of Medicare patients in each \n     hospital; the allocation of the tax revenue and Medicaid \n     funds is based on the number of non-Medicare patients in each \n     hospital.\n       The legislation also includes a ``carve out'' of graduate \n     medical education payments from Medicare's payment to HMOs. \n     Under current law, this payment is based on Medicare's \n     average fee-for-service costs--including graduate medical \n     education costs. Therefore, every time a Medicare beneficiary \n     enrolls in an HMO, money that was being paid to teaching \n     hospitals for medical education in the form of additional \n     payments for direct and indirect costs, is paid instead to an \n     HMO as part of a monthly premium. There is no requirement \n     that HMOs use any of this payment to support medical \n     education. Over a 4-year period, the legislation removes \n     graduate medical education payments from HMO payment \n     calculation. These funds are deposited into the Medical \n     Education Trust Fund and paid directly to teaching hospitals.\n\n\n                 medical education advisory commission\n\n       The legislation also establishes a Medical Education \n     Advisory Commission to conduct a study and make \n     recommendations, including the potential use of demonstration \n     projects, regarding the following:\n       operations of the Medical Education Trust Fund; alternative \n     and additional sources of medical education financing; \n     alternative methodologies for distributing medical education \n     payments; policies designed to maintain superior research and \n     educational capacities in an increasingly competitive health \n     system; the role of medical schools in graduate medical \n     education; and policies designed to expand eligibility for \n     graduate medical education payments to institutions other \n     than teaching hospitals.\n       The Commission, comprised of nine individuals appointed by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will be required \n     to issue an interim report no later than January 1, 1998, and \n     a final report no later than January 1, 2000.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CHAFEE:\n  S. 1871. A bill to expand the Pettaquamscutt Cove National Wildlife \nRefuge, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n the pettaquamscutt cove national wildlife refuge expansion act of 1996\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nenhance legislation I authored in 1988 that established the \nPettaquamscutt Cove National Wildlife Refuge in Rhode Island.\n  Pettaquamscutt Cove--a cove which divides the towns of Narragansett \nand South Kingstown, RI--is one of the State's natural jewels. The \ntidal marshes and mudflats in Pettaquamscutt Cove are home to a diverse \nspecies of waterfowl, wading birds and shore birds, and numerous small \nmammals, reptiles, and amphibians.\n  Pettaquamscutt Cove has been identified as the most important \nmigration and wintering habitat in Rhode Island for the black duck \npopulation under the North American waterfowl management plan. I might \nmention that this plan has been a tremendous success, capitalizing on \nthe cooperative efforts of the Federal Government working with \nnonprofit groups and local governments. These efforts to protect \nwetlands--through establishment of national wildlife refuges such as \nPettaquamscutt, through conservation efforts to implement the North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act, and through other statutes like the \nWetlands Reserve Program that was recently expanded in the farm bill \nthat protect our Nation's wetlands--have been a great success. Add to \nthis some decent rainfall, and the waterfowl populations have rebounded \ntremendously. Not since 1955 have we witnessed such a spectacular \nmigration of waterfowl as this past year.\n  Rhode Island has lost almost 40 percent of its original wetlands. It \nis essential that we do all we can to hold the line on continued losses \nof wetlands through preservation of ecosystems such as Pettaquamscutt \nCove. By expanding Pettaquamscutt Cove Refuge, this bill will protect \nthe fertile marsh habitat that supports a multitude of fish and \nwildlife and plants along Rhode Island's coast and provide more \nrecreational opportunities for Rhode Islanders and other visitors.\n  Currently, the Pettaquamscutt Cove National Wildlife Refuge boundary \nencompasses 460 acres of salt marsh and surrounding forest habitat. One \nhundred seventy-five acres of habitat have already been acquired by the \nService. This bill expands the Pettaquamscutt Cove National Wildlife \nRefuge boundary to include a 100-acre parcel, known as foddering farm \nacres and; allows the Fish and Wildlife Service to expand the refuge \nboundary to include other important habitat if and when suitable \nproperties become available in the future.\n  Mr. President, the expansion of Pettaquamscutt Cove Refuge to include \nthe foddering farm acres property provides a wonderful example of \ncooperation between the Fish and Wildlife Service and private citizens. \nThe 100-acre foddering farm property--adjacent to long pond--contains \nvaluable wetland habitat for waterfowl and other species. The Rotelli \nfamily who owns the property has been working with, and waiting \npatiently for, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for several years. \nThe Rotellis have indicated their willingness to donate a portion of \nthe value of the property to the Service. Through their partial \ndonation, the National Wildlife Refuge System gains valuable habitat at \na bargain price. Three cheers for the Rotellis. It is just this kind of \nprivate conservation effort and public spiritedness that has enabled us \nto preserve important open space throughout Rhode Island.\n  This bill will enable the Fish and Wildlife Service to continue their \nefforts to work with Rhode Islanders like the Rotellis to protect the \nbeautiful and important natural resources along Rhode Island's coast.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1871\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 922(x)(5) of title 18, United States \nCode, relating to the prohibition of possession of a handgun by a \nminor, to change the definition of minor from under 18 years of age to \nunder 21 years of age: to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               Amendments to the Youth Handgun Safety Act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I know that all of my colleagues share my \nconcern about the increasing violence committed by and against young \npeople in our Nation. There are many factors contributing to youth \ncrime and violence and, as legislators, it is essential that we \nconsider them not only as a whole but also individually. One of the \ncontributing factors is clearly the easy access to handguns by young \npeople. According to ``Violence by Young People: Why the Deadly \nNexus?'' by Prof. Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University, the \nnumber of murders committed by juveniles involving a gun has doubled \nsince 1985, while there has been no such shift in the number of non-gun \nhomicides. Guns are therefore playing a disproportionate role in the \njuvenile murder rate.\n  The legislation I am introducing amends the Youth Handgun Safety Act. \nSenator Kohl sponsored this important act, which was passed as part of \nthe 1994 crime bill, to establish a minimum age requirement of 18 years \nold for the possession of a handgun. Specifically, the act makes it \nillegal for anyone under age 18 to possess a handgun and for anyone to \nknowingly transfer a handgun to a juvenile. There are exceptions for \nranching or farming, and when the juvenile has written consent from a \nparent and is in compliance with all State and local laws. The act \nmakes handgun possession and transferring a handgun to a juvenile a \nmisdemeanor crime punishable by fines and up to 1 year imprisonment. Of \ncourse, Congress intends this measure to apply to handguns that have \ntraveled in interstate commerce.\n  Before the act became law, it was illegal for a licensed dealer to \nsell a handgun to anyone under age 21 and a long gun to anyone under \nage 18. However, there were no Federal penalties for the under-age \nperson who bought the gun or for private transfers of a handgun. I \napplaud Senator Kohl for his sponsorship of this important initiative.\n  As it now stands, however, the Youth Handgun Safety Act defines the \nterm ``juvenile'' as a person who is less than 18 years of age. My \nproposal would amend the definition of ``juvenile'' in this measure to \nmean a person who is less than 21 years of age.\n  Unfortunately, more and more frequently we hear stories about \njuvenile brawls which turn into deadly battles. Increasing the age \nlimit for possession of a handgun to 21 is one step we can take to try \nto reduce this bloody cycle. Recognizing that alcohol and teenagers can \nbe a deadly combination, Congress wisely amended the highway fund to \ninclude penalties for States that did not raise the drinking age to 21. \nWe should follow this example when it comes to guns and teens as well. \nBy introducing this measure I hope to encourage my colleagues to think \nabout how we might help our teens to grow into responsible young \nadults. As limiting access to alcohol has certainly saved lives, so too \nwill limiting access to handguns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO THE YOUTH HANDGUN SAFETY LAW.\n\n       Section 922(x)(5) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``18 years'' and inserting ``21 years''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n        Lugar):\n  S. 1873. A bill to amend the National Environmental Education Act to \nextend the programs under the act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      the national environmental education amendments act of 1996\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to reauthorize the \nNational Environmental Education Act. I am joined by my colleagues, \nSenators Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Kempthorne, Moynihan, Reid, and \nLugar. And I am joined on the House side by my colleague, Congressman \nScott Klug of Wisconsin, who is introducing an identical bill in the \nHouse today.\n  This bill will reauthorize the educational efforts at the National \nEnvironmental Education and Training Foundation and the EPA's Office of \nEnvironmental Education. These programs support environmental education \nat the local level. They provide grant money and seed money to \nencourage local primary and secondary schools and universities to \neducate children on environment issues.\n  With the importance of the environment and the continuing debate on \nhow best to protect it, it is vital to educate our children so that \nthey truly understand how the environment functions.\n  Over the last few years environmental education has been criticized \nfor being one-sided and heavy-handed. People have accused environmental \nadvocates of trying to brainwash children and of pushing an \nenvironmental agenda that is not supported by the facts or by science. \nThey also accuse the Federal Government of setting one curriculum \nstandard and forcing all schools to subscribe to their views. This is \nnot how these two environmental education programs have worked, and I \nhave taken specific steps to ensure that they never work this way.\n  The programs that this act reauthorizes have targeted the majority of \ntheir grants at the local level, allowing the teachers in our community \nschools to design their environmental programs to teach our children, \nand this is where the decisions should be made. In addition, the \ngrants have not been used for advocacy or to lobby the Government, as \nother grant programs have been accused of doing.\n\n  This legislation accomplishes two important functions. First, it \ncleans up the current law to make the programs run more efficiently. \nAnd second, it places two very important safeguards in the program to \nensure its integrity in the future.\n  I have placed in this bill language to ensure that the EPA programs \nare balanced and scientifically sound. It is important that \nenvironmental education is presented in an unbiased and balanced \nmanner. The personal values and prejudices of the educators should not \nbe instilled in our children. Instead we must teach them to think for \nthemselves after they have been presented with all of the facts and \ninformation. Environmental ideas must be grounded in sound science and \nnot emotional bias. While these programs have not been guilty of this \nin the past, this is\n\n[[Page S6236]]\n\nan important safeguard to protect the future of environmental \neducation.\n  Second, I have included language which prohibits any of the funds to \nbe used for lobbying efforts. While these programs have not used the \ngrant process to lobby the Government, there are other programs which \nhave been accused of this and this language will ensure that this \nprogram never becomes a vehicle for the executive branch to lobby \nCongress.\n  This bill also makes a number of housekeeping changes to the programs \nwhich are supported by both the EPA and the Education Foundation which \nwill both streamline and programs and make them more efficient.\n  The grants that have been awarded under this program have gone to a \nnumber of local groups. In Oklahoma alone such organizations as the \nStillwater 4-H Foundation; Roosevelt Elementary School in Norman, OK; \nOklahoma State University; the Kaw Nation of Oklahoma; and the Osage \nCounty Oklahoma Conservation District have received grants for \nenvironmental education under these programs.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and I hope both the Senate \nand the House can act quickly to reauthorize these programs.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON:\n  S. 1874. A bill to amend sections of the Department of Energy \nOrganization Act that are obsolete or inconsistent with other statutes \nand to repeal a related section of the Federal Energy Administration \nAct of 1974; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the department of energy standardization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the bill that I have just introduced, \nwhich is strongly supported by the administration, amends or repeals a \nnumber of sections in the Department of Energy Organization Act and the \nFederal Energy Administration Act of 1974 that are obsolete or that are \nduplicative or inconsistent with other, Governmentwide statutes \ngoverning rulemaking and advisory committee management.\n  Over the past 3 years, I have proposed, on a number of occasions, \namendments to remove administrative requirements of the Department of \nEnergy Organization Act that are more onerous than similar \nGovernmentwide requirements contained in more general statutes. For \nexample, with the support of the Department of Energy [DOE] and the \nOffice of Government Ethics, I have successfully promoted the repeal of \nfinancial disclosure and divestiture requirements affecting DOE \nemployees that were more stringent than the comparable requirements of \nthe Ethics in Government Act and that provided potent recruitment \ndisincentives for outstanding potential employees for the Department.\n  This bill continues the process of placing DOE on a similar footing \nin administrative law to other Federal agencies. The first subsection \nin section 2 of the bill repeals redundant and obsolete requirements \naffecting DOE rule making under the Administrative Procedure Act, and \nplaces DOE procurement rulemaking under the same statutory basis, that \nis, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, as all other Federal \nagencies. The second subsection repeals a restriction on DOE advisory \ncommittees that effectively prevents DOE from using committees under \nthe Federal Advisory Committee Act for peer review of scientific and \ntechnical proposals and the selection of awardees for such departmental \nscientific honors as the Fermi Award and the E.O. Lawrence Award.\n  The proposals are noncontroversial, the Department of Energy has \nrendered technical assistance in their drafting, and the administration \nhas indicated its strong support for these provisions in a letter dated \nJune 10, 1996. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 1996.\n     Hon. J. Bennett Johnston,\n     Ranking Democrat Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnston: This responds to your request for \n     Department of Energy views on proposed amendments to the \n     Department of Energy Organization Act (DOE Organization Act). \n     These amendments would repeal subsections 624(b) and 501(b) \n     and (d) of the Act. The Department strongly supports these \n     amendments.\n       The first amendment would repeal section 624(b) of the DOE \n     Organization Act (DOE Act) and section 17 of the Federal \n     Energy Administration Act. The amendment would place DOE \n     advisory committees on the same legal and procedural basis as \n     all committees covered by the Federal Advisory Committee Act. \n     Under current law DOE advisory committees are required to \n     meet in public session, while other agencies may close \n     meetings to protect information exempt from disclosure under \n     the Administrative Procedure Act. DOE's more stringent \n     requirement was justified at the time of its enactment by the \n     economic regulatory role of the Department's predecessor, the \n     Federal Energy Administration.\n       The second amendment would repeal subsections 501(b) and \n     (d) of the DOE Organization Act. Subsections 501(b) and (d) \n     elaborate on requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act \n     interpreted by the Supreme Court to require agencies to \n     provide the basis or purpose of the rule in their rulemaking \n     (Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 \n     U.S. 29, 43 (1983). With repeal of subsections 501(b) and \n     (d), the Department would be governed by the same standard \n     procedural requirements as other agencies in conducting \n     notice-and-comment rulemakings. The Department supports this \n     change.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection from the standpoint of the President's program \n     to submission of this report for the Committee's \n     consideration.\n       If you have further questions, please contact me, or have a \n     member of your staff contact Douglas W. Smith, Deputy General \n     Counsel for Energy Policy, at (202) 586-3410.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD (for himself and Mr. WYDEN):\n  S. 1875. A bill to designate the U.S. Courthouse in Medford, OR, as \nthe ``James A. Redden Federal Courthouse''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n               The James A. Redden Federal Courthouse Act\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to introduce today \nlegislation to name a Federal courthouse in my State after a fine \nlawyer, judge and Oregon citizen, U.S. District Judge James Anthony \nRedden. My legislation would rename the currently unnamed Federal \ncourthouse in Medford, OR, the James A. Redden Federal Courthouse.\n  Over the years Judge Redden's many accomplishments have made him \nworthy of this tribute. Judge Redden practiced law in Medford, OR, from \n1956-72. While practicing law he was elected to the Oregon State House \nof Representatives, in which he served from 1963-69. During the 1967 \nsession he served as the minority leader of the Oregon House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Judge Redden left private practice in 1973 to serve as the Oregon \nState treasurer. In 1977, he began serving as Oregon attorney general. \nHe served as Oregon's attorney general until 1980, when President Jimmy \nCarter appointed him to the position of U.S. District Judge. He was \nalso appointed to serve on the U.S. Judicial Conference Committee in \n1990 and reappointed to another 3 year term in 1993.\n  Judge Redden is a charter member of the American Board of Trial \nAdvocates. In 1954, he was admitted to the Massachusetts State bar \nfollowed by the Oregon Bar in 1955. In 1955, he was also admitted to \nthe bars of the U.S. District Court of Oregon and Court of Appeals, and \nfinally, in 1979, to the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The most important of Judge Redden's accomplishments is that he \npracticed law for 20 years in the Federal courthouse my legislation \nproposes to name in his honor. This courthouse is located in Judge \nRedden's beloved Jackson County. During his political life, he \nrepresented the people of Jackson County for 6 years, and now as a \nsenior judge, he plans to try cases in Jackson County again. He has \nalso taken a special interest in the ongoing renovation of the fine old \nbuilding.\n  Once again I believe that it would be a highly appropriate honor to \nname this courthouse after an individual who has done so much, and who \nhas had such a successful career.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to advance this important \nproposal through the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6237]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The United States courthouse at 310 West Sixth Street in \n     Medford, Oregon, shall be known and designated as the ``James \n     A. Redden Federal Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     other record of the United States to the United States \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``James A. Redden Federal Courthouse''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to cosponsor legislation \nto name a Federal courthouse in my State after a fine soldier, lawyer, \nand judge, U.S. District Judge James Anthony Redden. This legislation \nwould name the Federal courthouse in Medford, OR, the ``James A. Redden \nFederal Courthouse.''\n  Judge Redden has made public service the centerpiece of his life. He \nserved his country in the U.S. Army from 1946 to 1948. He honed his \nlegal skills practicing law from 1956 to 1972 in Medford, OR. He then \nleft his private practice to serve the people of Oregon as the Oregon \nState treasurer in 1973 and as the Oregon attorney general in 1977. In \n1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the position of U.S. \nDistrict Judge.\n  For 20 years, Judge Redden practiced law in the courthouse that \nSenator Hatfield and I propose to rename today. Judge Redden and \nSenator Hatfield have worked together over the years to renovate this \ncourthouse, and now I, as a Member of the Senate, am pleased to join in \nthe effort to rename this courthouse after Judge Redden, a great \nOregonian and a great American.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Baucus);\n  S. 1876. A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nto end health insurance portability for Members of Congress and \neliminate continued coverage for departing Members of Congress until \nhealth insurance portability for other U.S. citizens is enacted into \nlaw, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               the move it or lose it health coverage act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Move It or Lose \nIt Health Coverage Act. This is a straightforward bill that says if \nMembers of Congress fail to move health insurance portability for \nAmericans in a way that can be signed into law, then they will lose the \nhealth insurance portability that they now enjoy. If we don't pass it \nfor America, we lose it for ourselves.\n  My legislation is designed with one goal in mind: to build up the \npressure to provide greater health security for millions of American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, when many Members of Congress leave office today, they \ncan take their health care with them. No need to worry about \npreexisting condition exclusions or waiting periods or cancellations of \npolicy if they become sick. It's all taken care of. Everything's \ncovered.\n  Not so for far too many working families. Millions of Americans today \nface preexisting condition exclusions because they change jobs, lose \njobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies.\n  The legislation I offer today says plain and simple--as long as \nhealth insurance portability is denied to working Americans, it ought \nto be denied to Members of Congress as well. Holding office shouldn't \ninsulate anyone from all the health insurance concerns that face \nworking families in America every day.\n  And I am hopeful that this bill I offer today will provide the \nincentive needed for all of us to come together and pass responsible \nhealth insurance reform legislation for all Americans.\n  So my bill says that until Congress passes the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nhealth insurance measure or similar legislation, the coverage provided \nto Members of Congress through the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram [FEHBP] will be modified in several ways so that we know what \nso many others are facing.\n  First, health insurers participating in the FEHBP would be allowed to \ninclude preexisting condition exclusions in health plans covering \nMembers of Congress. Second, insurers would be free to refuse to issue \ncoverage or renew coverage provided to a Member because of current \nhealth, or preexisting medical condition. Carriers would be free to \ninclude these restrictions and limitations in any health plan covering \na current or retired Member of Congress.\n  And, third, current Members of Congress would no longer receive \ntaxpayer-subsidized health coverage after leaving office.\n  Mr. President, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill \npassed this body 100 to 0. Not one Senator voted against it. But now \nthat legislation--and those important reforms--are languishing.\n  It is time to unite together to give the American people some of the \nsame protections and health security that we have. If health insurance \nportability is good enough for Members of Congress, it ought to be good \nenough for working Americans, too.\n  And we must go about passing the Kassebaum-Kennedy reform in the same \nspirit that it was introduced and approved by the Senate the first time \naround--with strong bipartisan support and without controversial \nprovisions that will keep it from being signed into law.\n  Let us pass what the American people want: a clean bill of health. A \nclean bill of security for American families.\n  And make no mistake, Mr. President. If the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nlegislation is reduced from the commonsense bill that it was when it \nleft the Senate to merely a partisan, political bill, then there will \nbe no winners and American families will lose.\n  There is plenty of room to reach common ground by using common sense. \nIt was in that spirit that I acted over 1 month ago to call for a \ncarefully designed pilot project for medical savings accounts. And it \nis in that spirit that I offer my legislation today.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill which passed the Senate unanimously is \ntruly a modest proposal. It does not fix many of the flaws in the \ncurrent health care system. But it represents an important step toward \nreforming health care and injecting some fairness into the system. It \nwould offer some welcome relief for American families worried about \nlosing their health insurance.\n  Specifically, it would allow families to switch health plans without \nfacing preexisting conditions. And it would assure that they won't be \ndropped and their coverage will be renewed even if they become sick.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that 25 million Americans \nwould be helped by portability reforms contained in the Kassebaum-\nKennedy health insurance bill.\n  We can not afford to deny this basic reform to the American people. \nWe have passed common sense change before. We must do so again. The \nAmerican people demand and deserve no less. It is time to deliver.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATIONS OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) an estimated 81,000,000 United States citizens suffer \n     from some type of preexisting medical condition that could \n     make it difficult to obtain health coverage, especially for \n     that condition;\n       (2) millions of citizens are at risk of being subjected to \n     preexisting condition exclusions under current law because \n     they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change \n     insurance policies;\n       (3) Members of Congress may--\n       (A) choose to receive a health plan through the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits Program;

\n     and\n       (B) cannot be canceled and is required to be renewed;\n       (5) Members of Congress are often eligible to continue to \n     receive health care through the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program after they leave Congress;

A bill to ensure the proper stewardship of publicly owned \nassets in the Tongass National Forest in the State of Alaska, a fair \nreturn to the United States for public timber in the Tongass, and a \nproper balance among multiple use interests in the Tongass to enhance \nforest health, sustainable harvest, and the general economic health and \ngrowth in southeast Alaska and the United States; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT TIMBER CONTRACT EXTENSION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today along with Senator \nStevens and Congressman Young, I am introducing the Environmental \nImprovement Timber Contract Extension Act of 1996. This bill would \nextend for 15 additional years the long-term timber sale contract on \nthe Tongass National Forest between the Forest Service and the \nKetchikan Pulp Corp. [KPC]. The extension would provide KPC with a \nstable timber supply over a sufficient length of time to amortize the \ncost of new environmental improvements and energy efficiency equipment. \nKPC's situation is unique because all of its timber comes from the \nForest Service. There is no State or private timber available to the \ncompany.\n  I am introducing this bill as a result of: First, the important role \nthat KPC plays in the social, economic, and environmental vitality of \nsoutheast Alaska; second, the strong, bipartisan support within the \nState for this action; third, the record from field hearings I held \nlast month in southeast Alaska which overwhelmingly supports \nintroduction; and fourth, the performance of the Forest Service which \nstrongly indicates that, without congressional intervention, the KPC \nmill cannot survive. Let me elaborate on each of these factors.\n  First, let me describe the nature of the forest in southeast Alaska. \nThirty percent of the trees are dead or dying. The fiber is suitable \nonly for pulp. Without a pulp mill, lumber mills would be less \nprofitable and the pulp would have to be exported, creating no domestic \njobs. Let me also share with my colleagues what the Forest Service told \nus about the evolution and importance of KPC's long-term contract to \nsoutheast Alaska. Here is what the Agency told us at a May 28 oversight \nhearing in Ketchikan, AK:\n\n       The long-term contracts in Alaska which required the \n     construction and operation of manufacturing facilities such \n     as sawmills and pulp mills facilitated the establishment of a \n     timber industry in southeast Alaska.\n       Prior to the 1950's, economic conditions in southeast \n     Alaska were characterized as boom-bust. Federal Government \n     employment, mining and salmon processing were the economic \n     mainstays. After World War II, mining was essentially gone, \n     leaving a small local timber industry and commercial fishing \n     in the natural resources sector. Both the timber and \n     commercial fishing industries were subject to market swings \n     from year to year and were seasonal in terms of employment. \n     The United States favored the expansion of the timber \n     industry through several long-term timber sales on the \n     Tongass National Forest to stabilize employment in southeast \n     Alaska.\n       Making the best use of the timber on the Tongass required \n     having suitable markets for both high and low quality timber \n     and species. The markets were largely export markets in the \n     Pacific Rim and were somewhat limited by the need to use most \n     of the timber for pulp. The Forest Service advocated the use \n     of long-term sales to establish a pulp industry that would \n     bring greater economic diversity to the region and more year-\n     round employment. If successful, more service and trade \n     establishments were expected to follow--creating greater tax \n     bases, which would provide opportunities for improved \n     services, such as schools, water, fire protection, and the \n     like. For all of this to come together, however, the Forest \n     Service had to guarantee a long-term, stable timber supply to \n     attract outside capital investment.\n\n  I found this testimony compelling. The Forest Service witnesses \nrecounted the decisions of their predecessors--far-sighted people \nrecognizing the nature and importance of the resource and planning for \nan environmentally and economically secure future. The Forest Service \nrecognized that, as the sole owner of land and timber, it controlled \nthe economic and environmental vitality of the region.\n  Well what is the situation today? Today, KPC's operations directly or \nindirectly provide 25 percent of the total annual employment wages in \nKetchikan. KPC's municipal real estate and sales taxes generated $13.6 \nmillion in revenues in 1992.\n  More broadly, the southeast Alaska timber industry is the dominant \ncontributor to real estate development in Ketchikan. More than 25 \npercent of all households are timber dependent, and the typical timber \nemployee can purchase more than 90 percent of the existing housing \nunits. KPC comprises more than 50 percent of the total borough's \nindustrial assessed valuation.\n  Tourism and fishing are also important to the economy of Ketchikan \nand southeast Alaska. We need all three of our basic industries--\ntimber, fishing, and tourism--to be healthy if we are to have a healthy \neconomy in the region. But quite simply, without some stability of \ntimber supply, the economies of the region generally, and Ketchikan \nspecifically, are doomed.\n  Perhaps that is why the proposal to extend the KPC contract has \nreceived broad, bipartisan support from elected officials throughout \nthe State. Earlier this year, the Alaska Senate voted 18 to 1 to \nsupport a resolution urging the Congress to extend the contract. The \nAlaska House voted 34 to 3 to support the same measure. These are \nextraordinary margins of support. I will submit the resolution for the \nrecord.\n  Then, the Governor joined in, offering his support for congressional \naction to extend the contract. In a May 23 letter to me, Gov. Tony \nKnowles informed me that:\n\n       The State of Alaska supports a KPC contract extension, \n     contingent on KPC's agreement with the following five \n     principles: To protect the environment, Alaska jobs, and\n\n[[Page S6239]]\n\n     other forest users; and to utilize the Tongass Land \n     Management Planning [TLMP] process and value-added processing \n     techniques.\n\n  I am pleased to say that these conditions have been agreed to by KPC \nand are included in the compromise legislation I am introducing today. \nI will include the Governor's letter for the Record.\n  After receiving these views from the legislature and the Governor, I \nscheduled two oversight hearings on May 28 and May 29 in Ketchikan and \nJuneau, respectively. What I heard at these hearings was overwhelming \nsupport for the legislature's resolution, the Governor's action, and \nthe extension of the KPC contract. I heard from tourism interests, \nbankers, and fishermen who supported the contract extension. While not \nunanimous, the preponderance of testimony offered over the 2 days--and \nall of the demonstrators who marched in Ketchikan, as well as most or \nthem in Juneau--called for congressional action to extend the contract. \nThese people recognize that there is no alternative source of timber \navailable.\n  Last, I am introducing this legislation today because I have finally \nlost confidence in the ability of the Forest Service to provide a \nstable and sustainable supply of timber for southeast Alaska. Over the \npast few years, the agency has fallen further behind in keeping a \nworking timber sale pipeline. This problem has worsened despite the \nefforts of Senator Stevens to provide the agency with additional \nfunding for timber sale preparation. Consequently, more than half of \nthe operating mills in southeast Alaska have closed their doors during \nthe last few years during this administration's watch. KPC is the last \nremaining pulp mill in the State.\n  This situation is absolutely tragic. The Tongass is our Nation's \nlargest national forest. Yet the level of economic activity associated \nwith the production of forest products is very small, and sinking. We \nhave only one pulpmill and a few scattered sawmills left. Employment in \nthe industry has fallen 40 percent since 1990. New Yorkers burn more \nwood in their fireplaces and stoves than we harvest in southeast Alaska \neach year.\n  In its May 25 testimony, the Forest Service acknowledged that ``the \ncontract with Ketchikan Pulp Co. [KPC] has played an important role in \nthe development of Alaska's resources in southeast.'' Given this \nadmission, one would think that the Forest Service would want to see \nthe mill stay. One would expect the Forest Service to weigh-in in favor \nof a contract extension. But not so.\n  In very disappointing testimony, the agency maintained that ``the \nterms of the existing contract provide that all obligations and \nrequirements of the long-term contract must be satisfied on or before \nJune 30, 2004.'' In response to questions about any future obligations \npast that date, the agency insisted that it has none--none. This \ntestimony was offered even though the preamble to the contract \ndiscusses a commitment to a permanent economic base.\n  On the question of whether Congress should extend the contract, the \nForest Service testified that ``a long-term commitment of resources \nthrough a timber contract could further affect the flexibility of \nmanagement on the Tongass,'' and that ``we are committed to completing \nthe Revision of the Tongass Land Management Plan before we begin any \ndiscussion of future long-term commitments to timber related industries \nin Southeast.'' Yet, in response to questions, the agency witnesses \ncould not tell me: First, whether such commitments could be made within \nthe latitude provided by the range of alternatives in the draft TLMP; \nsecond, whether additional National Environmental Policy Act analysis \nwould be required; or third, whether such commitments would actually be \nprecluded by the selected alternative of the final plan. The testimony \nwas extremely unsettling. It convinced me that either the Forest \nService and/or the administration would like to see the KPC mill go \naway.\n  They have apparently no interest in seeing KPC invest $200 million to \npioneer chlorine-free manufacturing technology that could benefit \nenvironmental control efforts nationwide. That is also tragic.\n  Mr. President, the simple facts are that--without the contract \nextension--KPC will be unable to amortize the required capital \ninvestments for environmental improvements, and it will go away. The \ncompany's new CEO also testified on May 28. He was refreshingly, if not \nreassuringly, frank. He said:\n\n       In the very near future, we have to decide whether to \n     continue the large investments required to make KPC viable or \n     whether the losses currently being inflicted by the \n     appropriate implementation of the contract can be carried any \n     longer. Now, we are going to make that decision relatively \n     soon. This is not an issue for the year 2003. This is a 1996 \n     issue and decision.\n       We will make that decision, first of all, based on just to \n     keep running today we must have the Forest Service meet the \n     intent of the long-term bilateral contract, including the \n     volume and pricing provisions. And, then, secondly, to \n     continue to invest at the rapid rate that we are right now, \n     millions of dollars per quarter, this revised version of the \n     long-term contract must be extended a minimum of 15 years at \n     an offering level of 192 million board feet per year.\n       The people of KPC and the thousands of people who have \n     worked with us have met its--their contractual obligations to \n     develop the economy and provide permanent, year-round \n     employment for southeast Alaska. We want the government to \n     meet its contractual obligation to provide a sufficient \n     volume of economically viable timber in a timely fashion.\n\n  Some in southeast Alaska suggest that the region does not need the \nKPC pulpmill to have a successful and sustainable timber industry. What \nis needed they opine, is to eliminate the monopoly contract and develop \nmore small, value-added manufacturing facilities.\n  This is wishful thinking. The independent mill witnesses at our \nhearings indicated that the lack of a stable timber supply will \npreclude any additional investments in southeast Alaska. The \nmanufacture of pulp is a higher value added process than any of the \nalternatives suggested by opponents of the pulpmill. The loss of the \npulpmill will destabilize the industry and the infrastructure of the \nregion, and have a chilling effect on future industry investments. \nAvailable capital will migrate to other regions.\n  Mr. President, I cannot stand idly by and watch the town of Ketchikan \ndie. I will not. I am introducing, and ask respectful consideration of, \nthe Environmental Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Improvement \n     Timber Contract Extension Act.''\n\n     SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF LONG-TERM CONTRACT REGARDING TONGASS \n                   NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``board feet'' means net scribner long-log \n     scale for all sawlogs and all hemlock and spruce utility \n     grade logs.\n       (2) The term ``contract'' means the timber sale contract \n     numbered A10fs-1042 between the United States and the \n     Ketchikan Pulp Company.\n       (3) The term ``contracting officer'' means the Regional \n     Forester of Region 10 of the United States Forest Service.\n       (4) The term ``mid-market criteria'' means an appraisal \n     that ensures an average timber operator will have a weighted \n     average profit and risk margin of at least 60 percent of \n     normal in a mid-market situation, representative of the most \n     recent 10 years of actual market data.\n       (5) The term ``proportionality'' means the proportion of \n     high volume stands (stands of 30,000 or more board feet per \n     acre) to low volume stands (stands of 8,000 to 30,000 board \n     feet per acre.)\n       (6) The term ``purchaser'' means the Ketchikan Pulp \n     Company.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On July 26, 1951, the Forest Service, on behalf of the \n     United States, and the purchaser entered into a contract to \n     harvest 8,250,000,000 board feet of timber from the Tongass \n     National Forest in the State of Alaska. While the contract is \n     scheduled to end June 30, 2004, it acknowledges an intention \n     on the part of the Forest Service to supply adequate timber \n     thereafter for permanent operation of the purchaser's \n     facilities on a commercially sound and permanently economical \n     basis. This legislation is necessary to effectuate that \n     intent.\n       (2) A pulp mill or similar facility is necessary in \n     southeast Alaska to optimize the level of year-round, high-\n     paying jobs in the area, to provide high value added use of \n     low-\n\n[[Page S6240]]\n\n     grade wood and by-product material from sawmilling \n     operations, and to maintain a stable regional economy.\n       (3) The purchaser plans to make environmental and \n     operational improvements to its pulp mill, including \n     conversion to an elementally chlorine free bleaching process, \n     expansion of wastewater treatment facilities, relocation of \n     the existing wastewater outfall, and improvements to chemical \n     recovery and power generation improvements to chemical \n     recovery and power generation equipment. Total capital \n     expenditures are estimated to be $200,000,000, $25,000,000 of \n     which the purchaser has already invested.\n       (4) Extension of the contract for 15 years is the minimum \n     reasonable extension period to allow amortization of these \n     environmental improvement and energy efficiency projects.\n       (5) Ketchikan is the fourth largest city of Alaska. Its \n     economic and job base are extremely dependent upon the \n     continuation of the contract, which provides the principal \n     source of year-round employment in the area. The purchaser \n     has stated among its goals and objectives the following:\n       (A) Continuation of a long-term commitment to Ketchikan and \n     southeast Alaska, including maintenance of a stable Alaskan \n     workforce, utilization of Alaskan contractors, vendors, and \n     suppliers to permit those businesses to hire and maintain \n     Alaskan employees.\n       (B) Participation in the Forest Service's land management \n     planning process with other users so that the process may be \n     completed expeditiously with maximum information.\n       (C) Adherence to sound principles of multiple-use and \n     sustained yield of forest resources providing for the \n     production of sustainable contract volumes for the purchaser \n     and the other timber operators in southeast Alaska and the \n     protection and promotion of other forest uses, including \n     tourism, fishing, subsistence, hunting, mining, and \n     recreation.\n       (D) Protection of air, water, and land, including fish and \n     wildlife habitat, through compliance with applicable Federal, \n     State, and local laws.\n       (E) Commitment to continue to explore new processes and \n     technology to maximize the use of timber harvested and \n     increase the value of products manufactured in southeast \n     Alaska.\n       (6) The national interest is served by a policy that \n     accomplishes the proper stewardship of publicly owned assets \n     in the Tongass National Forest, a fair return to the United \n     States for public timber in the Tongass National Forest, and \n     a proper balance among multiple use interests in the Tongass \n     National Forest to enhance forest health, sustainable \n     harvest, and the general economic health and growth in \n     southwest Alaska and the United States in order to improve \n     national economic benefits. The national interest is best \n     achieved by fostering domestic forest product markets and by \n     modifying the terms of the contract pursuant to subsection \n     (c).\n       (c) Contract Fairness Changes.--The contract is hereby \n     modified as follows:\n       (1) Extension.--The term of the contract is extended by 15 \n     years from June 30, 2004.\n       (2) Sale offering plan.--The contract shall include a plan \n     describing the amount of volume, location, and the schedule \n     by which the purchaser shall receive the timber required by \n     paragraph (3) for the remainder of the contract term. The \n     plan shall be coordinated with the Tongass Land Management \n     Plan.\n       (3) Volume requirements.--The volume of timber required \n     under the contract shall be provided in 5-year increments of \n     962,500,000 board feet, which the purchaser shall be \n     obligated to harvest in an orderly manner, subject to the \n     following:\n       (A) Until March 1, 1999, when the next 5-year increment is \n     provided to the purchaser, the Forest Service shall provide \n     the purchaser with at least 192,500,000 board feet per year \n     of available timber at a date certain each year and shall \n     maintain a supply of timber adequate to insure the purchaser \n     can reasonably harvest 192,500,000 board feet each year.\n       (B) To ensure harvest in an orderly manner, the contracting \n     officer shall provide for the construction by the purchaser \n     of roads in portions of the 5-year increment area of timber \n     in advance of the 5-year operating period by including such \n     roads in the environmental impact statement prepared for the \n     5-year operating period.\n       (C) Timber selected for inclusion in the 5-year increment \n     shall meet the mid-market criteria.\n       (4) Appraisals and rates.--The contracting officer shall \n     perform appraisals using normal independent national forest \n     timber sale procedures and designate rates for the increments \n     of timber to be provided. The rates shall not be designated \n     at a level that places the purchaser at a competitive \n     disadvantage to a similar enterprise in the Pacific Northwest \n     and those rates shall be the sole charges the purchaser shall \n     be required to pay for timber provided.\n       (5) Measurement of proportionality.--The Forest Service \n     shall measure proportionality using the following criteria:\n       (A) Measure for groups of all contiguous management areas.\n       (B) Measure proportionality by acres.\n       (C) Measure proportionality over the entire rotation age.\n       (6) Conversion or replacement of pulp mill.--The purchaser \n     may convert or replace, in part or in whole, its pulp mill \n     with a facility that manufactures any other value added \n     product that utilizes pulp logs as a raw material component.\n       (7) Unilateral termination.--The unilateral termination \n     clause of the contract is eliminated.\n       (8) Subsequent modifications.--Any clause in the contract, \n     as modified by this subsection, may be further modified only \n     by mutual agreement of the Forest Service and the purchaser \n     and may be so modified without further Act of Congress.\n       (d) Effective Date for Contract Modification.--\n       (1) Effective date.--The modifications made by subsection \n     (c) shall take effect 45 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (2) Ministerial duty to modify the contract.--Not later \n     than such effective date, the contracting officer shall \n     revise, as a ministerial function, the text of the contract \n     to conform with the modifications made by subsection (c) and \n     implement the modified contract. The contracting officer \n     shall make conforming changes to provisions of the contract \n     that were not modified by subsection (c) in order to ensure \n     that the modifications made by such subsection are \n     implemented.\n       (e) Transition Timber Supply.--Timber volume available or \n     scheduled to be offered to the purchaser under the contract \n     in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act shall continue to be offered and scheduled under the \n     contract as modified by subsection (c) along with such \n     additional timber volume as is necessary to satisfy the \n     timber volume requirement of 192,500,000 board feet per year.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Senate Joint Resolution No. 40 in the Legislature of the State of \n                                 Alaska\n\n       Whereas, for the last 40 years, the timber industry \n     operating on national forest land in Southeast Alaska has \n     been the largest private employer in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas the United States Forest Service strategy for \n     creating permanent year-round employment through a timber \n     industry in Southeast Alaska has been to offer long-term \n     contracts to attract pulp mills to use, and add value to, \n     low-grade and by-product materials from timber harvesting; \n     these pulp mills serve as a market for pulp logs and chips \n     from the sawmills in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas pulp mills assure full utilization and protect \n     forest health by using that significant portion of the \n     Tongass National Forest that consists of dead, dying, and \n     over-mature timber; and\n       Whereas, since passage of the Tongass Timber Reform Act of \n     1990 (TTRA), a pulp mill and a major sawmill have closed, and \n     more than 40 percent of the timber industry has been lost \n     due, in part, to the failure of the United States Forest \n     Service to make available the approximately 420,000,000 board \n     feet per year needed to meet the jobs protection promises \n     made by those who sought passage of the TTRA, all of which \n     has created severe social and economic harm to the timber \n     industry, its workers, and timber-dependent communities in \n     Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas another of the reasons for the closure of the Sitka \n     pulp mill was the adverse economic impacts of unilateral \n     changes to its long-term contract made by the TTRA, those \n     unilateral changes also adversely impact the economics of the \n     Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPD) contract; and\n       Whereas KPC, which obtained a long-term contract to help \n     create year-round jobs in Southeast Alaska, is the sole \n     remaining pulp mill in Alaska, a mjor employer in Southeast \n     Alaska, and the market for pulp logs and chips from all the \n     other sawmills in Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas the loss of the KPC pulp mill would lead to the \n     loss of the entire industry now operating on the Tongass \n     National Forest with devastating social and economic effects \n     on families and communities throughout Southeast Alaska; and\n       Whereas, KPC pulp mill faces an uncertain future, not of \n     its own making, as a result of the continuing log shortage \n     created by the failure of the United States Forest Service to \n     meet its volume requirements under KPC's contract and the \n     TTRA, as a result of the adverse economic impacts to its \n     long-term contract caused by the unilateral TTRA changes, and \n     as a result of the requirement that more than $155,000,000 in \n     capital expenditures be made over the next few years to meet \n     new and ever changing federal environmental standards and \n     operating needs; and\n       Whereas, as a matter of economic common sense, KPC cannot \n     make all the necessary expenditures without the federal \n     government extending its contract for a sufficient period to \n     amortize those expenditures, without an adequate supply of \n     timber, and without modifying those portions of the \n     unilateral TTRA contract changes that have adversely impacted \n     the contract's economics; and\n       Whereas the legislature finds that an additional 15 years \n     is a minimum reasonable period to extend the KPC's timber \n     sale contract to allow such amortization and to provide \n     opportunities for value-added alternatives that maximize the \n     number of jobs and assures environmentally sound operations; \n     and\n       Whereas the legislature finds that sufficient timber must \n     be made available to maintain the KPC contract, to provide \n     100,000,000 board feet for the contracts to small business, \n     and to reopen the Wrangell facility and a by-product facility \n     in Sitka; be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature respectfully \n     urges the Alaska delegation\n\n[[Page S6241]]\n\n     in Congress and the Governor to take all steps necessary, \n     this year, to extend the Ketchikan Pulp Company long-term \n     contract for an additional 15 years and modify those portions \n     of the contract which the TTRA unilaterally impacted, because \n     such an extension and modification are critical to the \n     environmental, social, and economic well-being of the Tongass \n     National Forest timber workers, their families, and timber-\n     dependent communities in Southeast Alaska and because such an \n     extension is in the public interest of the State of Alaska; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Tongass National Forest should be \n     managed for a healthy and diversified economy for the benefit \n     of all users, including value-added forest products, \n     commercial and sport fishing, seafood processing, tourism, \n     subsistence, sport hunting, and local businesses that provide \n     goods and services; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature also \n     respectfully urges the Alaska Congressional Delegation, the \n     Governor, and the United States Forest Service to take action \n     this year to assure that sufficient timber be made available \n     as part of any revision of the Tongass Land-Use Management \n     Plan to maintain the Ketchikan Pulp Company contract, to \n     provide 100,000,000 board feet for small business contracts, \n     and to reopen the Wrangell facility and a by-product facility \n     in Sitka.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States;

Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: On behalf of Governor Tony Knowles, \n     I hereby submit, for the hearing record, the attached letter \n     from the Governor to Mr. Mark Suwyn, Chairman of Louisiana-\n     Pacific Corporation, concerning a possible contract extension \n     for the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC).\n       As the attached letter indicates, the State of Alaska \n     supports a KPC contract extension, contingent on KPC's \n     agreement with the following five principles: to protect the \n     environment, Alaska jobs, and other forest users; and to \n     utilize the Tongass Land Management Planning (TLMP) process \n     and value-added processing techniques. The State's support \n     for a contract extension, however, leaves for the federal \n     public process to resolve the issues of volume, contract \n     duration, and pricing structure.\n       With respect to the TLMP process, which we understand you \n     are also having hearings on, the State continues to provide \n     information and comments to the United States Forest Service \n     in an effort to develop a management plan for the Tongass \n     that is based on sound science, prudent management, and \n     meaningful public participation.\n       In addition to this letter for the record, the State plans \n     to be represented at the hearings by Veronica Slajer, of the \n     Department of Commerce and Economic Development, who will be \n     in attendance to listen to the testimony of the witnesses. As \n     we informed your staff earlier, Ms. Slajer will not be \n     testifying at the hearings, but the State is interested in \n     learning about what others think about these issues so that \n     the State can incorporate these thoughts in the formulation \n     of State policy.\n       Thank you for considering the State's views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John W. Katz,\n       Director of State/Federal Relations and Special Counsel to \n     the Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  State of Alaska,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                           Juneau, April 26, 1996.\n     Mr. Mark Suwyn,\n     Chairman and CEO, Louisiana Pacific Corporation, Portland, \n         OR.\n       Dear Mark: Thank you for our recent discussions about the \n     future of the Kctchikan Pulp Company (KPC).\n       As you know, my Administration has consistently supported a \n     sustainable timber industry in the Tongass, including a \n     predictable timber supply to meet the terms of the KPC \n     contract and 100 million board feet for small operators \n     through Small Business Administration sales. Thousands of \n     Alaskan families depend on the Tongass for their livelihoods, \n     subsistence hunting and fishing, recreation, and other uses.\n       With this letter, I want to inform you my Administration \n     supports a KPC contract extension, contingent on the five \n     principles outlined below. As you mentioned during our recent \n     meeting, a decision to extend KPC's current contract is a \n     federal one. While the state has no authority to grant an \n     extension, the long-term partnership between the people of \n     Southeast Alaska and the timber industry and between the City \n     of Kctchikan and KPC gives us an important interest in the \n     extension issue. This partnership has benefited the jobs and \n     families of Southeast Alaska and has helped maintain healthy, \n     safe, and stable communities.\n       Inherent in this long-term partnership are five principles:\n       1. Environmental Protection. Protection of air, water, and \n     land, including fish habitat through compliance with \n     applicable federal, state, and local laws. This means KPC \n     should develop a plan to achieve full compliance with \n     environmental laws within three years. This would include a \n     meaningful public process that resolves public health and \n     environmental issues.\n       2. Commitment to Ketchikan. A long-term commitment to \n     Ketchikan and the maintenance of a stable workforce, \n     including the hiring and training of resident Alaskans and a \n     willingness to hire Alaska contractors. KPC should have \n     longer terms contracts with Alaska timber businesses to \n     provide them the certainly to hire permanent employees from \n     Alaska. KPC should support a policy for directing 50 percent \n     of the timber from SBA sales to in-state secondary processing \n     through contracts with SBA timber businesses.\n       3. Multiple Use. Adherence to sound principles of multiple \n     use and sustained yield of forest resources. This means the \n     production of sustainable contract volumes for KPC and the \n     small timber operators in southeast and the protection and \n     promotion of other forest uses and users, including tourism, \n     fishing, subsistence, hunting, mining, and recreation.\n       The planning process is of little value if individual sales \n     remain mired in controversy and litigation. Therefore, timber \n     offerings in areas of high community interest and important \n     fish habitat, such as Cleveland Peninsula, Honker Divide, \n     East Kuiu, and Poison Cove, should be avoided. In addition, \n     every effort should be made to bring about a transition from \n     the harvest of old growth to second growth timber.\n       4. TLMP Process. The Tongass Land Management Plan, \n     including full participation by the timber industry and other \n     forest users, must be completed expeditiously. The timber \n     volume available for harvest must be determined through the \n     TLMP planning process.\n       5 Value-Added. The timber industry should continue to \n     explore new processes and technology to maximize the use of \n     timer harvested and increase the value of products.\n       As we discussed, the matter of volume, contract duration, \n     and price must be determined by the federal public process.\n       I look forward to our continued cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tony Knowles,\n                                                Governor. \n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1878. A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to \nprohibit the licensing of a permanent or interimnuclear waste storage \nfacility outside the 50 States or the District of Columbia, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the nuclear waste policy act of 1982 amendment act of 1996\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing an amendment to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act to prohibit an interim or permanent nuclear \nwaste storage facility outside of the 50 States. My bill would prevent \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission from issuing a license to store \nnuclear waste in any of the territories, or on U.S. possessions such as \nMidway Island or Palmyra Atoll.\n  Some of my Senate colleagues may wonder whether this is a bill in \nsearch of a problem that does not exist. Until a few weeks ago, I would \nhave never imagined that legislation such as this was necessary. \nHowever, based on information I have compiled, it is clear that the \nbill I am proposing is urgently needed.\n  Earlier this year, the Honolulu papers reported that Palmyra Island, \na Pacific atoll located 900 miles southwest of Hawaii, was sold to a \nNew York investment firm known as KVR, Inc. The reason KVR purchased \nPalmyra has always been vague and uncertain. However, 2 weeks ago \ndetails of a scheme for Palmyra were uncovered when the island's new \nowners quietly circulated legislation that would direct the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to issue a license for high-level nuclear fuel \nstorage on Palmyra. The State of Hawaii and its delegation in Congress \nstrongly oppose this proposal.\n  I have recently discovered that Palmyra was not the only island \ntargeted for nuclear storage. Midway Island and sites in the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands were also proposed for nuclear waste storage by \nthe owners of Palmyra and their associates.\n  As more and more information surfaces about the activities of \nPalmyra's new owners, their business associates, and the web of \ncorporations they control, the true picture of their scheme emerges. \nWhen you fit all the pieces of\n\n[[Page S6242]]\n\nthe puzzle together, you find that a group of nuclear entrepreneurs \nhave been combing the Pacific for the past 2 years, searching for a \nhome for their nuclear waste dump. It is an affront to Hawaii and the \nPacific that they would hatch this scheme and operate in the shadows \nfor so long.\n  Let me present the facts in greater detail. In October 1994, the \ndevelopers of this nuclear waste initiative wrote the President of the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands to propose that high-level nuclear \nwaste be stored in the Marshall Islands. Prior to sending their letter, \nrepresentatives from both sides met in Washington to discuss the \nproposal. In exchange for providing exclusive use of an island for \nstoring nuclear fuel, the Republic of the Marshall Islands Government \nwould receive $160 million in concession payments as well as a share of \nany profits from the venture.\n  Fortunately this initiative did not succeed. The plan to store \nnuclear materials in the Republic of the Marshall Islands was opposed \nby the Clinton administration and prompted Congress to enact \nlegislation prohibiting the Department of Energy from negotiating such \nan arrangement with the Republic of the Marshall Islands Government.\n  At this point the scheme to build a nuclear waste dump on a low-lying \nPacific atoll appeared dead. But the proposal resurfaced when a group \nof Washington lobbyists and Wall Street financiers purchased Palmyra \nAtoll earlier this year.\n  The bill drafted by the new owners of Palmyra is one of the most \nremarkable legislative proposals I have seen in my 20 years in \nCongress. It is a legislative blank check, granting carte blanche \nauthority to the owners of Palmyra to become the world's only, \nprivately owned nuclear fuel storage and reprocessing enterprise. This \nproposal would vastly increase the risk of nuclear proliferation by \nplacing the critical elements of weapons of mass destruction--plutonium \nand uranium--in private hands.\n  The bill directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a license \nto store 200,000 tons of nuclear fuel on Palmyra. The license shall be \ngranted for the maximum period permitted by law. By directing the NRC \nto license nuclear waste storage on Palmyra, the draft legislation \nwould circumvent NRC licensing standards and waive environmental, \nengineering, and safety requirements that normally apply to the storage \nof spent nuclear fuel.\n  One of the boldest elements of the bill grants the owners of Palmyra \nthe exclusive right to determine the scope of activities on the atoll. \nWhy should anyone, whether a private individual or an arm of \ngovernment, be granted unfettered authority over an island where \n200,000 tons of nuclear fuel is being stored and reprocessed? This \nwould be nuclear madness.\n  Another flaw of this proposal is that atolls like Palmyra are \nenvironmentally sensitive and prone to erosion and extreme weather \nconditions. Eastern Island, the highest point on the atoll, is less \nthan 6 feet above sea level.\n\n  Any nuclear material stored at Palmyra would eventually have to be \nrelocated. The National Academy of Sciences and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission have determined that above-ground storage of nuclear \nmaterials can only be an interim solution. Spent nuclear fuel stored at \nPalmyra would eventually have to be relocated to a permanent storage \nsite. If this proposal succeeds, ships carrying spent nuclear fuel from \nall corners of the globe will transect the Pacific to deposit nuclear \nmaterial at Palmyra, only to transport this fuel once again to a \npermanent storage site at another location. If the plan for nuclear \nreprocessing goes forward, the traffic in nuclear cargo would increase \ndramatically.\n  The bill further declares that the owners of Palmyra shall have title \nto any nuclear fuel, commencing at the time waste is transferred to \ncontainers bound for Palmyra. It would summarily select a site for \nstoring nuclear waste without scientific or technical evaluation of the \ngeologic, hydrologic, seismic or other conditions of the atoll. It \nnegates decades of research, planning, and development we have invested \nin achieving an acceptable approach to our nuclear waste problem.\n  Of course, in order to achieve this remarkable plan, the bill waives \nthe Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. These \nlaws are the hallmark of our Nation's commitment to protecting the \nenvironment and enjoy broad, bipartisan support. The notion that these \nfundamental environmental laws should be waived during the licensing of \na high-level nuclear waste storage site is simply irresponsible. The \nAmerican people will never accept such a proposal, no matter how well \nit is sugarcoated.\n  The revelation this week that Midway, an island that is part of the \nHawaiian chain, was also sought by the owners of Palmyra is an \nespecially frightening development for the people of Hawaii. In \nDecember 1995, the chairman of U.S. Fuel and Security requested that \nthe Navy allow high-level nuclear fuel storage on Midway Island. U.S. \nFuel and Security is a company affiliated with the new purchasers of \nPalmyra. The company has a business plan that calls for storing nuclear \nmaterials on a privately owned island in the Pacific Ocean, which we \nnow know to be Palmyra.\n  Fortunately, the request was denied and the Navy transferred \noperational control of Midway to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in \nMay of this year. The purchase of Palmyra was consummated only after it \nbecame clear that the Navy would not approve the proposal for Midway \nstorage.\n  Weeks ago, when details first surfaced about establishing a nuclear \nwaste dump on Palmyra, it was difficult to believe that there was any \ntruth to these proposals. But as I uncovered more and more information, \nI began to realize that this story was fact, and not fiction. This tale \nof nuclear intrigue is like a bad onion. Each time you peel away \nanother layer it smells even more. You begin to wonder what else this \ngroup is up to that we do not know about.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to prohibit the storage of \nnuclear waste in any of the Pacific territories or on U.S. islands such \nas Midway or Palmyra. My bill is a preemptive strike against proposals \nto store nuclear waste on Palmyra. It would shut the door on any \npossibility of turning these Pacific islands into a nuclear waste dump.\n  I also want to put the Senate on notice that I am examining \nlegislation to transfer jurisdiction of Palmyra, Midway, and five other \nU.S. possessions to the State of Hawaii. This proposal would give \nHawaii legal authority over, but not title to, these islands.\n  When a similar proposal surfaced last year in the House of \nRepresentatives, legitimate concerns were raised about the potential \nliability associated with such a transfer. In light of efforts to store \nnuclear fuel on some of these islands, I believe that we should revisit \nthe idea of placing these Pacific islands, which are geographically \nclose to Hawaii, under the State's jurisdiction. I will closely examine \nthe question of liability and take steps to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment is responsible for cleanup of any hazardous or toxic \nsubstances on these islands, and that the State of Hawaii is \nindemnified from future liability.\n  Transferring jurisdiction of islands like Palmyra and Midway to the \nState of Hawaii would mean that our Governor, the State legislature, \nand ultimately the people of Hawaii would have a greater say in \ndetermining the future of these islands. This legislation could be a \nsubstitute for, or an addition to, the bill I have introduced today.\n  My colleagues, the nuclear era began in the Pacific when the first \natomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Since that time, more than 150 \nnuclear devices have been detonated in the region. The United States \nconducted 66 tests in the Marshall Islands and Johnston Atoll during \nthe 1940's and 1950's. The British conducted 21 tests on Christmas \nIsland and in Australia during the 1950's. The French detonated more \nthan 180 devices on Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls under a nuclear \ntesting program that began in 1974 and ended in February 1996. The \nenvironmental consequences of this nuclear legacy are evident \nthroughout the Pacific to this day.\n  Given the international outpouring of criticism during the recent \nFrench testing, it is inconceivable that anyone would consider \nestablishing the world's largest spent nuclear fuel dump at Palmyra. \nThe Pacific has been under assault since the dawn of the nuclear era\n\n[[Page S6243]]\n\nand should not become a future dumping ground for the world's nuclear \nproblems. Half a century of nuclear testing is enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

VETERANS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 64\n\n       Whereas the Commonwealth of the Philippines was \n     strategically located and thus vital to the defense of the \n     United States during World War II;\n       Whereas the military forces of the Commonwealth of the \n     Philippines were called into the United States Armed Forces \n     during World War II by Executive order and were put under the \n     command of General Douglas MacArthur;\n       Whereas the participation of the military forces of the \n     Commonwealth of the Philippines in the battles of Bataan and \n     Corregidor and in other smaller skirmishes delayed and \n     disrupted the initial Japanese effort to conquer the Western \n     Pacific;\n       Whereas that delay and disruption allowed the United States \n     the vital time to prepare the forces which were needed to \n     drive the Japanese from the Western Pacific and to defeat \n     Japan;\n       Whereas after the recovery of the Philippine Islands from \n     Japan, the United States was able to use the strategically \n     located Commonwealth of the Philippines as a base from which \n     to launch the final efforts to defeat Japan;\n       Whereas every American deserves to know the important \n     contribution that the military forces of the Commonwealth of \n     the Philippines made to the outcome of World War II; and\n       Whereas the Filipino World War II veterans deserve \n     recognition and honor for their important contribution to the \n     outcome of World War II: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     President should issue a proclamation which recognizes and \n     honors the Filipino World War II veterans for their defense \n     of democratic ideals and their important contribution to the \n     outcome of World War II.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution \nwhich recognizes the valiant military service of Filipino soldiers \nduring World War II.\n  The Philippine Islands were the possessions of the United States from \nthe end of the Spanish-American War in 1898 until shortly after the end \nof World War II in 1946. On December 8, 1941, the Japanese invaded the \nPhilippine Islands. The invasion delayed the islands' independence from \nthe United States for 2 years.\n  On July 26, 1941, 4 months before the invasion of the Philippines, \nPresident Roosevelt issued a military order calling members of the \nPhilippine Commonwealth Army:\n\n     into the service of the armed forces of the United States for \n     the period of the existing emergency, and placed under the \n     command of a general officer, United States Army * * * all of \n     the organized military forces of the Government of the \n     Philippines * * *\n\n  On December 18, 1941, General MacArthur issued General Order No. 46 \nwhich provided that:\n\n       Pursuant to provisions of the Proclamation of the President \n     of the United States,\n\n[[Page S6244]]\n\n     dated July 26, 1941, all personnel of the Philippine Army on \n     active duty and all active units of the Philippine Army, less \n     personnel and units already accepted for service with the \n     United States Armed Forces, are hereby called into the \n     service of the armed forces of the United States in the \n     Philippines * * *\n\n  Among the fierce battles fought was the battle at Bataan, which could \nnot have been maintained without the valiant efforts of Filipino \nservicemen who constituted more than 75 percent of the troops and \nincurred a disproprionate number of deaths. During the Bataan Death \nMarch and subsequent internment, Japanese brutality toward Filipino \nsolders far exceeded those of American prisoners. For example, \napproximately one-half of the 60,000 Filipino servicemen died at Bataan \nin contrast to one quarter of the 10,000 United States servicemen who \nlost their lives while imprisoned.\n  According to a June 1973 Philipine study entitled ``The Status of \nMembers of Philippine Military Forces During World War II,'' Filipino \nguerilla resistance movements arose prior to the May 7, 1942, surrender \nto the Japanese. These movements comprised of personnel from the \nPhilippine Army, the Old Philippine Scouts and other units of the \nUnited States Army. These guerilla forces engaged in overly aggressive \nmoves against the Japanese that resulted in heavy losses and the \ncapture of many of the movement's leaders. From his headquarters in \nAustralia, General MacArthur, in March 1943, instructed the guerillas \nto limit combat contact to the minimum necessary for self-protection, \nand to concentrate instead of improving organizational \nand intelligence-gathering abilities. During May 1942 to May 1944, the \nJapanese could only maintain control over the major cities and towns \nbecause guerilla forces controlled the countryside. Without the combat \nand support contributions of the guerilla forces before and during \nGeneral MacArthur's return to the Philippines in October 1944,\n\n     the task of reoccupying the Islands would have been vastly \n     more costly to the United States in terms of time, money, \n     manpower, and casualties.\n\n  On October 28, 1944, Philippine Commonwealth President Osmena issued \nExecutive Order No. 21, which recognized the military service of \nguerilla forces as active service in the Philippine Army, the date of \nentry into such active service being the date of joining a recognized \nguerilla force. General MacArthur subsequently issued retroactive \nrecognition orders dating back to the times when the various guerilla \nunits began to fight, thereby bringing them within the terms of \nPresident Roosevelt's order calling Philippine forces into the service \nof the United States. Effective June 30, 1946, after cessation of \nhostilities in the Philippine Islands, the Philippine Army and its \nrecognized guerilla units were released from service in the armed \nforces of the United States by military order of the President.\n  The Philippine Army and its recognized guerilla units, loyally and \nvaliantly fought, suffered, and in many instances, died in the service \nof our country, in the same manner as other members of our armed forces \nduring World War II. We must not ignore the recognition they duly \ndeserve as United States veterans. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution which recognizes the valiant military service \nof the Filipino World War II soldiers.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, to recognize and honor World War II Filipino \nveterans. The concurrent resolution we submit today is the first step \nin acknowledging the contributions made by Filipino veterans to the \nUnited States during World War II.\n  Few Americans realize the pivotal role Filipinos played during World \nWar II. From 1898 to 1946, the Philippines were a U.S. possession. \nAlthough the Philippine Independence Act of 1934 established a 10 year \ntimetable for independence and bestowed the Commonwealth of the \nPhilippines with certain powers over internal affairs, its full \nindependence was delayed until 1946 because of the Japanese occupation \nfrom 1942 to 1945.\n  Between 1934 and 1946, the United States retained certain sovereign \npowers over the Philippines. President Roosevelt invoked an executive \norder on July 26, 1941, which ordered the Philippine Commonwealth Army \ninto the service of the U.S. Army Forces of the Far East under the \ncommand of Lieutenant General Douglas MacArthur.\n  Thousands of Filipinos served with United States military personnel \nin the Pacific during World War II. Of the nearly 142,000 Filipino \nveterans who fought during World War II, only 70,000 survivors remain \ntoday. From the Japanese landing at Lingayen to the liberation of the \nPhilippines in 1944, Filipino Army units gave their all to repel \nJapanese forces. Filipinos forces marched alongside Americans in the \nDeath March after the surrender at Bataan and Corregidor. Thousands of \nFilipinos continued to resist Japanese occupation and continued to \nassist the United States through intelligence gathering throughout the \nwar.\n  In return for their service, Filipino veterans were granted benefits \namounting to only fifty cents on the dollar compared to other veterans. \nPresident Truman objected to the restrictions on benefits for the \nCommonwealth Army veterans. The Filipino veterans who were called into \nservice by the United States served just as honorably and faithfully as \nAmerican veterans and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.\n  Recognition of the Filipino veterans who served during World War II \nis long overdue and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6243-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6244-S6245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 65--RELATIVE TO THE INTERNET\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a senate \nconcurrent resolution along with an identical concurrent resolution to \nbe submitted in the other body.\n  Yesterday, Wednesday, June 12, the committee I am proud to chair, the \nSenate Commerce Committee, held a subcommittee hearing on the vital \nimportance of making strong encryption available so that future \nelectronic services will come into being. Indeed, the very future of \nthe Internet hangs in the balance with respect to the availability of \nstrong encryption. But at that hearing, I noted that I'm an industrial \nage man trying to make sense of the current information age we now find \nourselves in. I'm an industrial age legislator making decisions about \ninformation age issues.\n  This, of course, describes almost everyone else in the Senate and in \nthe House, so at least I am not alone. But it is this dynamic, where \nindustrial age legislators are making information age decisions, that \nhas caused us to found the Congressional Internet Caucus.\n  We all know that the Internet will change beyond all imagining the \nway\n\n[[Page S6245]]\n\nwe will all work and play. Already, tens of millions of Americans are \nusing the Internet to communicate and to conduct important business. \nCyberspace has even become important in politics, where it is now a \nvital tool in many areas.\n  Congress has to be computer and Internet literate if we are to be a \nCongress for the 21st century. This is why we have founded the \nCongressional Internet Caucus. It is our intention to try to help to \nprovide for our other congressional colleagues navigation tools with \nwhich to find their way across the information landscape.\n  And that is why today we, the founding members of the Internet \nCaucus, are introducing this joint concurrent resolution on the \nInternet in both the House and the Senate today.\n  This House and Senate concurrent resolution urges our colleagues to \nget on-line and use the Net. It calls on Members of Congress to develop \na better personnel understanding of the Net and how it operates. And, \nfinally, it calls on Congress to start to use the Net in order to \nbetter communicate with the voters of this country.\n  The Internet and other information technology issues will only grow \nin importance as time goes by. Congress will be seeing more and more \nissues coming before it involving these new information technologies. \nWe'd better be prepared.\n  This concurrent resolution is a good beginning step in that \ndirection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6244-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6245-S6246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 262--RELATIVE TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Gregg) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 262\n\n       Whereas violations by the People's Republic of China of \n     United States intellectual property rights cost the United \n     States economy an estimated $2,300,000,000 in 1995;\n       Whereas in 1991, 1992, and 1994, the office of the United \n     States Trade Representatives initiated special section 301 \n     investigations of the People's Republic of China's \n     intellectual property rights violations, but did not impose \n     sanctions;\n       Whereas in 1995 the People's Republic of China entered into \n     an agreement with the United States that called for the \n     closing of, or cessation of illegal activities in, factories \n     that were pirating American videotapes, computer software, \n     CD-ROMs, compact disks, and laser disks;\n       Whereas despite the terms of the 1995 Intellectual Property \n     Rights Agreement, piracy of intellectual property rights has \n     continued in the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas while United States officials report that officials \n     of the People's Republic of China have recently raided and \n     closed a few factories engaged in piracy, in the past such \n     actions have been cosmetic and only temporary; and\n       Whereas the United States Trade Representative has \n     determined that the People's Republic of China tolerates the \n     greatest volume of intellectual property rights piracy of all \n     of the United States trading partners: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that sanctions \n     should be imposed upon the People's Republic of China for its \n     failure to comply with the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights \n     Agreement which it entered into with the United States and \n     that such sanctions should remain in effect until the United \n     States Trade Representatives certifies to the Congress that \n     the People's Republic of China is complying with all of the \n     terms of that Agreement by either--\n       (1) closing all factories that are engaged in piracy, or\n       (2) assuring such factories operate only pursuant to joint \n     ventures or licensing agreements with United States \n     companies.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been calling on the administration \nto impose sanctions on China if they do not live up to the intellectual \nproperty agreement that they willingly signed.\n  The fact of the matter is, they have approximately 31 factories that \nare turning out laser disks and CD's. They are supposed to destroy \nthese factories. I spoke to the U.S. Trade Representative. They seem to \nbe making some progress, but not enough.\n  And so, Mr. President, I will be pushing hard for these sanctions. As \nthe MFN debate comes up, I will support MFN. I also am pleased to say \nSenator Judd Gregg is a coauthor of my sanctions resolution.\n  Mr. President, in January 1992 the United States and China signed a \nMemorandum of Understanding obligating China to strengthen its patent, \ncopyright and trade secret laws and to improve the protection of United \nStates intellectual property.\n  On April 30, 1994 the United States Trade Representative, or USTR, \nannounced that while China had made significant progress toward \nimplementing the 1992 agreement--by enacting new laws on intellectual \nproperty rights--China's enforcement of those laws was weak and \nsporadic.\n  In February 1995 the United States and China reached an agreement, \nsigned in Beijing, in which China pledged to substantially reform its \nintellectual property rights and to improve market access. It is under \nthis agreement, the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, that \nthe United States and China currently operate.\n  The USTR has determined that China's overall implementation of its \nobligations under the 1995 agreement fall far short of the requirements \nof the agreement.\n  The manufacture of pirated U.S. intellectual property, particularly \ncomputer software, compact discs, laser discs and videos, continues to \nbe rampant. Moreover, China's efforts to stop the manufacture of \npirated United States products has been utterly inadequate.\n  A delegation from the office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative traveled to China on Thursday June 6 and Friday, June 7, \nto reiterate to Chinese officials the United States' resolve in holding \nChina to the commitments it made in the 1995 Intellectual Property \nRights Agreement.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky is joining that delegation today and they will \nbe meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing over the next several \ndays.\n  The United States delegation, led by Ambassador Barshefsky, is \nseeking China's commitment to close compact disc plants producing \npirated software, tighten customs controls on exports of pirated goods \nand to give greater access to the Chinese markets for United States \nmusic, film and computer software firms.\n  It is important to note that the USTR is not seeking new concessions \non the part of the Chinese Government. Rather, Chinese officials made \nall of these commitments in the Intellectual Property Agreement signed \nlast year.\n  It has been reported that Chinese officials have indicated progress \ncould be made on most of the United States demands--closing compact \ndisc factories producing pirated software and tightening controls on \nexports of pirated goods. However, Chinese officials have apparently \nsaid that United States demands of freer access to the Chinese \npublication, music and software markets may not be met.\n  Chinese officials have also balked at United States demands to open \ntheir markets and to allow United States companies to engage in joint \nventures with Chinese companies to produce legitimate copies of music, \nfilms and books.\n  Yesterday China's propaganda department reported that it had ordered \nall CD plants opened in recent months, not approved by Beijing, closed. \nChina reports that at least 12 plants have been closed.\n  Exactly how many plants have been closed, will be closed and most \nimportant will remain closed remains the subject of verification \nefforts by the USTR delegation and the subject of Ambassador \nBarshefsky's talks with Chinese officials.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky has said that ``it remains to be seen whether \nthe Chinese effort in this and other areas is sufficient to meet the \nterms of our agreement. I also want to ensure that there is an \nenforcement system in place to crack down on intellectual property \npiracy in the future.''\n  Among the seven factories which were closed last spring when the \nagreement was initially signed, all but one has re-opened. There are \ncurrently about 31 factories, operating throughout China, churning out \npirated United States computer software, compact discs, laser discs, \nvideos, movies, and other products.\n  The USTR has recently estimated that United States companies lose \nmore than $2 billion annually as a result of the pervasive piracy of \nUnited States products in China.\n  The United States software industry estimates that piracy of computer \nsoftware is in excess of 95 percent in China. The piracy of United \nStates CDs, laser discs, cassette tapes, videos, and movies is close to \n100 percent in many parts of China.\n  The USTR reports that in the past 2 years, Chinese companies have \nbegun\n\n[[Page S6246]]\n\nto export pirated products in fairly significant quantities. For \nexample, 29 compact disc and laser disc factories in China have a \nproduction capacity of as much as 75 million CDs for a domestic market \nthat can absorb only 5 million CDs.\n  Similarly, China's exportation of CD ROMs, which can hold dozens of \ncomputer software programs, and other copyrighted works, on a single \ndisc continues to increase.\n  Some of the fastest growing and most competitive industries in the \nUnited States--and ones in which we frequently have a trade surplus--\nare located in my home State of California. These companies have been \nparticularly devastated by China's failure to adequately enforce \nintellectual property rights. The California economy has also been \naffected.\n  California is the leading producer of movies, computer software, \nrecordings, video games, and other creative works.\n  California's movie and television industries employed almost 165,000 \nCalifornians last year. The combined payroll of those industries was \nalmost $7.5 billion.\n  California, while in the midst of an economic recovery, was gripped \nby a recession from 1990 through early 1995. Much of the success of \nthis recovery is largely dependent upon the continued growth and \nexpansion of California's entertainment and high technology industries. \nIndustries which produce patented and copyrighted material to be sold \ndomestically and internationally.\n  I would note that the entertainment and high technology industries \nhave also helped spurn the Nation's economy. Moreover, these industries \nhave provided more jobs and more high wage jobs in California than \nalmost any other industries.\n  These companies cannot continue to flourish, however, if their \nintellectual property rights are not vigilantly enforced and protected \nthroughout the world.\n  I understand that the United States-China relationship is a \nmultifaceted and important relationship for reasons beyond economics. \nHowever, China's effective enforcement of intellectual property \nprotections is critical to the future success of that relationship and \nis also a clear test of our resolve to enforce our trade agreements.\n  That is why I, along with my co-sponsor Senator Gregg, am introducing \nthis resolution, expressing the sense of the Senate that sanctions \nshould be imposed on China until the USTR certifies that China is \ncomplying with the 1995 agreement--whether by closing all pirate \nfactories, or by allowing such factories to operate pursuant to joint \nventure or licensing agreements with U.S. companies.\n  The USTR initiated special section 301 investigations of China's \nintellectual property rights violations in 1991, 1992, and 1994, but no \nsanctions were imposed.\n  The USTR has determined that China tolerates the greatest volume of \nintellectual property rights piracy of all of other United States \ntrading partners.\n  Therefore, I think it is imperative that we pass this resolution. The \npassage of this resolution will send a clear message that the U.S. \nSenate is firmly committed to protecting U.S. intellectual property \nthroughout the world.\n  The passage of this resolution will also let the Chinese government \nknow that the United States Senate is firmly resolved to effectuating \nand enforcing our trade agreements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6245-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6246-S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SENATE RESOLUTION 263--RELATING TO CHURCH BURNING\n\n  By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nKempthorne, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nLieberman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Pell, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Inhofe) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was held at the desk:\n\n                              S. Res. 263\n\n       Whereas there have been at least 32 fires of suspicious \n     origin at churches serving African-American communities in \n     the last 18 months;\n       Whereas these churches are a vital part of the life of \n     these communities;\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches is a very heinous \n     crime in these communities, and all across America, because \n     church burning was used during the civil rights struggle in \n     an attempt to intimidate African-Americans from exercising \n     their Constitutional rights;\n       Whereas there have been at least 60 fires and incidents of \n     desecration in houses of worship in 15 different States since \n     1990;\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches, when done to \n     intimidate any American from the free exercise of his or her \n     rights as an American, is inconsistent with the First \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees \n     every American the right to the free exercise of his or her \n     religion;\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches, when done to \n     intimidate any American from the free exercise of his or her \n     rights as an American is also inconsistent with the First \n     Amendment guarantee that ensures that Americans can freely \n     and peaceably assemble together; and\n       Whereas intentionally burning churches, when done to \n     intimidate any American from the free exercise of his or her \n     rights is a serious national problem that must be \n     expeditiously and vigorously addressed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate condemns arson against churches as being \n     totally inconsistent with American values;\n       (2) the Senate believes that the investigation and \n     prosecution of those who are responsible for fires at \n     churches, and especially any incidents of arson whose purpose \n     is to divide communities or to intimidate any Americans, \n     should be a high national priority; and\n       (3) the Senate commends the President for devoting all \n     Federal resources necessary to bring those responsible for \n     committing any act of arson against churches to justice, and \n     urges that all investigations of fires at churches which are \n     of suspicious origin are conducted in a sensitive manner that \n     reflects the special character of churches and the rule they \n     play in American communities.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yesterday, Mr. President, I came to the floor and \nspoke about what I called the domestic terrorism that we are suffering \nin this country with the burning of churches and other hate crimes in \nour Nation. I spoke at some length about it and mentioned a time that I \nwill submit a resolution pertaining to the church burnings. I am \nsubmitting that legislation now, Mr. President. I would like it held at \nthe desk until the time of adoption.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be other legislative activity \nassociated with this issue in the days to come. But as the Chair is no \ndoubt aware, since yesterday, when I first took to the floor, there has \nbeen yet another church burning in this country.\n  As I said yesterday, the people who are perpetrators of this rash of \nhate crimes and church burnings are no more than cowardly domestic \nterrorists. These are people who work under cover of darkness and \nanonymity to intimidate some and encourage others, and it is out of \ncowardice.\n  However, in spite of the objective of these actions, which it has \nbeen suggested are intended to start a race war, there is every \nindication that these arsonists are confused about the country in which \ntheir crimes are taking place.\n  Most Americans--I reiterate, most Americans--are appalled and \noutraged. The fact of the matter is, there is in this darkness some \nlight coming through. The light relates, Mr. President, to the efforts \nof Americans, from the President of the United States down to ordinary \npeople, to stand up, to speak out, to be heard and to demonstrate that \nthis kind of crime, this kind of heinous crime and this kind of \ndomestic terrorism is not to be tolerated in this America.\n  I have been encouraged, Mr. President, by some of the reports from my \nhome State. In Glenn Carbon, IL, there had been a cross burning. In one \nof the newspapers in Illinois, the headline there was ``Neighbors \nComfort Black Family Who Found Cross in Yard.'' The story goes on to \nsay that the people, white and black alike, who live in the community \ncame to the aid of the individuals who suffered the cross burning to \nindicate their support, to indicate their reassurance that the racial \nhatred that was symbolized by the cross burning did not reflect the \nfeelings of the neighborhood or of that community. I think that is a \nvery positive and powerful thing.\n  Another article, Mr. President, from the Alton Telegraph, ``Neighbors \nshow good will to victims of cross burning,'' makes the same point. \nThis article goes on to say that neighbors delivered flowers and food, \ncards, plants and other gifts to the family on Monday, people reaching \noutside of themselves to stand up against hatred, to stand up against \nracism, to stand up against the evil that this church burning \nrepresents.\n  I think therein lies the key. We can take action here in this U.S. \nCongress, the Senate and the House, and the\n\n[[Page S6247]]\n\nPresident can take action. We can all come together as a collective \ncommunity through our Government to take leadership in showing that in \nthis America this kind of criminality will not be tolerated, but we can \nonly do that, and it only takes real meaning when we are joined in our \nofficial capacity by individual, unofficial action, when the churches, \nthemselves, come together to participate in ceremonies and services and \nmarches and demonstrations in favor of unity and in favor of love.\n\n  When we really focus in on the fact that this rash of hate crimes is \njust that, a rash of evil afoot in the land, and that good people of \nall races will make it a point to be heard, not to sit back in silence \nand to allow this evil to take seed among us, but, rather, that we will \nall stand up as individual citizens to say, ``This America, in this \ntime, is putting the ugly legacy of racism and racial hatred behind. We \nwill not go back to the days when these kinds of things can happen with \nimpunity.''\n  We will engage every asset, every resource at our disposal to see to \nit that these criminals are brought to justice, that the truth is \nuncovered, that no stone will be left unturned in our efforts to \nprosecute the perpetrators of these crimes, because they are criminals. \nWe will make it very clear as a national community, all of us, that we \nwill not tolerate this kind of conduct, and that the people who have \ntried to foist this horror on our community, on our country, will be \nprosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n  Mr. President, I also say after the speech that I gave yesterday, \nwhich is already in the Record, I was just really taken personally by \nthe expressions of support, expressions of concurrence and the \nexpressions from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, people \ncoming up to say, ``We think it is just terrible what is going on. We \nwant to do something about it. We want to be heard. We want to make \ncertain that everybody understands that this kind of activity has no \nplace in America.'' I am encouraged and heartened by that, because I \nthink, if anything, that change of heart, that change of collective \nconsciousness, that change in the climate of opinion is precisely the \nvictory that reflects the moral victory that the civil rights movement \nachieved.\n  We have a mindset in this country that does not tolerate this kind of \nhorror, that not only does not tolerate it, but is ashamed by it. Out \nof our repudiation, out of our rejection of these expressions of evil, \nI believe we will find a new birth as an American community. We will \nfind a new level, frankly, of coming together and of working together, \nand of unity in this country, and will, I think, set the stage so the \nyoung people that are here today will begin to ask the question, in \ntheir time: ``I remember the days when race was a debate in the United \nStates, but we got past that. We got smarter, we matured, we moved \nbeyond that.'' That is my hope for these young people.\n  If anything, I think with the expressions of support, the expressions \nof love, the expressions of unity, the good will that is being shown \nall over this country in reaction and in response to the hatred we have \nseen, the cross burnings and the church burnings, the moral victory \nwill be ours as a Nation, and we will move forward as a Nation \ntogether, a stronger country because of it.\n  Mr. President, I understand the resolution will be adopted or can be \nadopted later this evening. I wanted to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the fact that this resolution is pending. I understand there \nwill be other legislative initiatives in this regard. I am delighted to \njoin with those, as well, because I think it is very important as a \nbody we speak with one voice, that these people who are doing this are \nnot Americans. Their activities fly in the face of the America that we \nbelieve in, fly in the face of the values that this America represents \nto the world, and that we will not allow their evil to shame all of us, \nand we will not allow them to get away with it. From that, Mr. \nPresident, I believe we will be a greater Nation, and we will have \nfound, out of this horror, some light, and from that light we will be \nable to build a stronger Nation.\n  I commend my colleagues who have already joined me. Again, thanks to \neveryone who has stepped up and said something. One other word: There \nis a tradition that the only thing that allows evil to prevail is for \ngood people to say nothing. Now is the time for good people to be \nheard. Now is the time for good people to stand up and say, ``The \nAmerica that we know and the America we believe in is an America that \ncherishes the value of brotherhood and love and unity.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me associate my remarks with my \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. I am delighted \nthat I had the opportunity to be on the floor to hear the very, very \nimportant words that the Senator from Illinois has shared with all of \nus today about this extremely important issue.\n  I am delighted that the citizens of Illinois had the intelligence to \nsend her here so that she could be a leader and a voice that all of us \ncould follow. I am delighted to support the Senator with the \nresolution, and I am delighted to stand shoulder to shoulder as we \npursue this very, very important issue in this country and put to rest \nthe racism that we see.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak following the very \neloquent words of our friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, about the wave of church burnings in the South. There is \na way in which it would be assumed that all of us here in this Chamber, \nreflecting, representing, as we do the American people throughout the \n50 States, would naturally be outraged by these church burnings. But \nthis is one of those cases where it is important not to leave the \nassumption not testified to, not to leave the feelings unexpressed, not \nto leave the Chamber as a body silent. Therefore, I commend the Senator \nfrom Illinois for introducing the resolution which she will.\n  I have asked her and she has agreed to add me as a cosponsor. At this \npoint, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, last night, as we know, a fire broke out in the First \nMissionary Baptist Church in Enid, OK, which brings now to more than 30 \nthe number of African-American churches that have been burned by \narsonists over the past 18 months, and, of course, the pace seems to be \nquickening in the last couple of weeks.\n  This outrage recalls memories of similar attacks on religious people \nand religious institutions throughout the centuries. Sadly, they \ncontinue in the other places in our world today. Christians, Jews, \nMoslems, and others have all suffered for their faith in many horrible \nways. The details of the acts of persecution vary widely, but the seeds \nof hatred that underlie the terror are sadly and tragically quite the \nsame.\n  The sheer blasphemy--I use the word intentionally--the blasphemy of \nthese church burnings must chill our souls. We do not know if the acts \nof arson are the result of some horrible conspiracy. But in some \nmeasure, it would be a little bit easier to grasp the enormity of this \nevil if it were the result of the work of a single group of criminals \nbecause we can crush such a small band of terrorists, which is what \nthey are. But, if these arsonists are not connected in some organized \nway, we have to ask ourselves again, as we have before in our history, \n``How do we fight back against the larger stain of racism that exists \nin so many individual hearts consumed by the shared desire to destroy \nthe spirit of those they hate?'' The answer, I want to suggest to my \ncolleagues today, to this conspiracy of crime and hate is to enter into \nour own conspiracy of law and love.\n  By law I mean we must--and I am confident we are using--use every \nlegal weapon in our arsenal, in society's arsenal, to investigate every \nfire and follow every lead until the perpetrators of these injustices \nare brought to justice. We must consider these to be acts of terrorism \nand use the most sophisticated techniques at our disposal to hunt down \nthose who have perpetrated them.\n  By love what do I mean? I mean reaching into ourselves and as a \ncountry enveloping the victims of the church burnings with our own \nprayers and support and acts of kindness to make up, as best we can, \nnot just for\n\n[[Page S6248]]\n\ntheir tragic loss of their houses of worship but to respond to the \nsense of fear and alienation that go with those burnings.\n  Mr. President, the ties that bind us as Americans--particularly our \nshared faith in God--are greater than this evil. By coming together \nnow, we can guarantee that these acts of evil will gain no ground.\n  In a sense, all of us who worship God and try to love our neighbors \nas God's children are the targets of these hate crimes, these \narsonists. Yes; we may have different backgrounds and come from \ndifferent denominations, but we are bound by a common faith--the same \nfaith that helped inspire the founding of this Nation, as is clear from \nthe first words of the Declaration of Independence; that the rights \nwith which we are endowed do not come from some committee of lawyers or \nconstitutional theorists; that we are endowed by these rights by our \nCreator. That is the source of our liberty, the driving idea of our \ndemocracy. Religion has always been a source of strength and purpose \nand, indeed, of unity in America. Religious people have carried some of \nthe most noble acts of citizenship and leadership across the history of \nour country.\n  So when these arsonists strike at houses of worship in America, they \nstrike at the heart of America, the source of America's strength. Those \nwho are full of such hate must fear that which poses the greatest \nthreat to them. The spirit of faith that inhabits those who worship in \nthe churches that have been burned must strike great fear in the hearts \nof those who have burned them. But the spirit of faith that has been \nexpressed in those churches is not only strong; it is, as the arsonists \nwill learn, a spirit that is unbreakable.\n  So, though the church is burned, the light of faith that has burned \nwithin that church will grow stronger and spread in the minds and souls \nof those who have worshiped there and, I believe, in the minds and \nsouls of the great majority of the American people.\n  So I look forward to the resolution coming forth and to whatever \nother ways in which this Senate can express its outrage at the acts of \narson and its sense of fellowship and brotherhood in the most profound \nsense for those who have worshipped at these churches.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6246-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 264--RELATIVE TO NATIONAL SPEAK NO EVIL DAY\n\n  Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Jeffords) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \npeople of Hudson, NH, on their town's 250th anniversary. The town's \nresidents will begin celebrating this historic occasion on June 21 with \na number of festivities including a grand ball, parade, and block party \nevents. I was proud to participate in this meaningful celebration.\n  Hudson's history first dates back to the year 1672 when families \nfirst settled in the Hudson area. On July 5, 1746, then Governor and \nCommand in Chief Benning Wentworth signed the town's first charter. As \nHudson and the surrounding areas began to grow, the first bridge was \nbuilt across the Merrimack River there in 1827.\n  Many descendants of the town's first settlers still live in Hudson. \nNear the end of the 18th century, Simon Robinson settled on the north \nside of the pond later named the Robinson Pond. Originally, the pond \nwas called Little Massabesic meaning the place of much water. Some of \nSimon Robinson's descendants still reside there. In addition, James \nHills was one of the three brothers credited with being the first \nsettlers in the town and his great-grandson settled on Alvirne, the old \n181 acre Derry Road homestead, and had several children.\n  Hudson opened their first library in 1797. The Nottingham West Social \nLibrary was founded during that year, and served the town residents for \n50 years. In 1856, the Hudson Center Library opened its doors. Then, in \n1891, Adoniram Greeley gave his private collection of 1,878 books to \nthe town. The library was renamed the Greeley Public Library and in \n1908, Alfred Hills donated money for the construction of a new library, \nthe Hills Memorial Library.\n  Today, the 20,000 people of Hudson still exhibit the Yankee \ntraditions and commonsense values of their forefathers. The first \nschool houses were built in Hudson in 1806. Since then, the school \nsystem has grown steadily to include three elementary schools, one \nmiddle school, and one high school. Alvirne High School has 1,032 \nstudents in grades 9 through 12, including 349 students from \nLitchfield. The police department has 50 officers and staff, the fire \ndepartment has 28 full-time firemen and 26 volunteer firemen. The town \nalso has a board of selectmen form of government.\n  I congratulate the town of Hudson, and all of the dedicated and \npatriotic citizens there. I am proud to be their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6249-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PLAYING IT CLOSE TO THE VEST\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr President, Richard Cohen, the thoughtful \ncolumnist at the Washington Post, recently had an op-ed piece on \ngambling in the United States titled, ``Playing It Close to the Vest.'' \nIt is a hard hitting, but factual presentation of the situation that we \nface today.\n  One of the things that I noted, was the reference to the lottery in \nMaryland. He writes:\n\n       Gambling has yet another dirty secret. It makes a lot of \n     money from those who can least afford to lose it. For \n     instance, residents of Baltimore, Maryland's poorest \n     jurisdiction, wager $316 per capita on the State lottery; for \n     Montgomery County, the State's richest jurisdiction, the \n     figure is $115. Lest you think that phenomenon applies only \n     in Maryland, look anywhere lottery tickets are sold.\n\n  The problem with the lottery is only a small tip of a much bigger \niceberg.\n  I ask that the op-ed piece written by Richard Cohen be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The op-ed follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 28, 1996]\n\n                      Playing It Close to the Vest\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       I am thinking now of one of the ``Godfather'' movies in \n     which the young Michael Corleone, having transplanted his \n     family and operations to Nevada, bluntly tells a U.S. senator \n     what to do and how to do it. That sort of thing, of course, \n     could never happen today. Instead, the gambling industry \n     merely makes political contributions and hosts fund-raisers. \n     For most politicians, that's the offer they can't refuse.\n       By way of illustration let us look at the progress of a \n     proposal to establish a national commission to study \n     gambling. This is not the worst idea to come out of \n     Washington, because not much is known about gambling's real \n     impact. Twenty years ago, only two states had some form of \n     gambling; now only two states do not. So it seemed to Rep. \n     Frank Wolf (R-Va.) and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) that a study \n     was in order.\n       That, though, was easier proposed than done. The resolution \n     passed the House, but the Senate has been a different story. \n     There, opposition of the gambling industry has slowed things \n     down, and the post-Dole leadership reportedly is hostile to \n     the study. The American Gaming Association (``Gaming?'') has \n     bought itself a trifecta of top lobbyists and has thrown \n     oodles of money into, particularly, the Republican Party.\n       Steve Wynn, owner of Las Vegas' Mirage casino company, now \n     has the sort of entry into GOP circles that was once reserved \n     for captains of industry. Little wonder. Last June, he hosted \n     a fund-raiser for Bob Dole. The take: $478,000. In June 1994, \n     he raised $540,000 for the GOP. Just possibly for this \n     reason, Newt Gingrich recently proposed that the gambling \n     commission not even have subpoena power. Just by coincidence, \n     he made this proposal in Las Vegas. Family values at work \n     again.\n       The ``gaming'' industry insists that there is really \n     nothing to study. Gambling--er, gaming--is heavily regulated \n     and state controlled and so clean that you can see mommies \n     with their kiddies at the slots in Vegas. But that, of \n     course, is the problem. It would be interesting to know just \n     how many mommies are gambling away their kids' milk money as \n     they feed the slots or, worse, video poker machines. The \n     poker machines, in particular, are known for their addictive \n     charm.\n       Gambling is a huge business. It takes in more money than \n     the movies, baseball, football, theme parks or just about \n     anything else you can name. About 70 million people attend \n     professional baseball games annually, but 125 million go to \n     casinos, where there is never a rainout, but then the sun \n     never shines, either.\n       Americans wagered nearly $500 billion in 1994 and lost \n     about $40 billion of that total. Most of the losers could \n     afford what they left on the table, but some, clearly, could \n     not. These compulsive gamblers--maybe no more than 4 percent \n     to 6 percent of all players--may well account for at least 25 \n     percent of the gambling industry's profits. They are to \n     gambling what pint buyers are to the liquor industry: a gold \n     mine and a dirty shame.\n       Gambling has yet another dirty secret. It makes a lot of \n     money from those who can least afford to lose it. For \n     instance, residents of Baltimore, Maryland's poorest \n     jurisdiction, wager $316 per capita on the state lottery; \n     for Montgomery County, the state's richest jurisdiction, \n     the figure is $115. Lest you think that phenomenon applies \n     only in Maryland, look anywhere lottery tickets are sold.\n       Here and there in this country, in weird pockets of \n     liberalism and in homes for the aged, some people can be \n     found who still care about the poor. As for the rest, we \n     mostly don't care if they spend more than they can afford or \n     if the government, through the false hope of a lottery, \n     imposes what amounts to a ``dream tax'' on those who can \n     least afford it. No more government as nanny. If people want \n     to gamble, let them gamble.\n       But let us not fool ourselves. Some of them will gamble the \n     rent money, and some will become addicted to games like Keno \n     and after a while, maybe the money that states collect from \n     gambling in going out in social services. It's one thing for \n     the mob to bleed the poor; it's quite another thing for the \n     state to do the same thing.\n       Whatever the case, little is known about gambling's impact, \n     and, it seems, the gambling industry likes it that way. It \n     pretends that what was once an industry dominated by the mob \n     is now the equivalent of a state fair. Not quite. Politicians \n     still are on the take, and the poor are still being \n     victimized. Little wonder the gaming industry is so reluctant \n     to have the feds take a look. It sells fantasy, but often \n     delivers misery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6249-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6249-S6250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VIRGINIA GIRLS STATE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to applaud the \n50th anniversary of the Virginia Girls State. Sponsored by the American \nLegion Auxiliary, the Virginia Girls State provides high school girls \nwith leadership and citizenship training during a week-long program \nheld on college campuses across the country. This program features \nlearning by doing activities which teach young women the duties, \nprivileges, and rights of American citizenship--the backbone of \ndemocracy.\n  This magnificent program reinforces to our young citizens the notion \nthat they are an essential part of their government and responsible for \nits character and success. Through the program, the young women are \ntaught the value of individual responsibility to the community, State, \nand Nation.\n  The United States of America was founded on, and will flourish \nbecause of, the principles of democracy. I\n\n[[Page S6250]]\n\nstrongly believe in the lessons of democracy handed down from our \nforefathers. The more our young people know about the Constitution and \nthe Bill of Rights, the stronger our great Nation becomes. Remember \nthat knowledge is power. Through learning, the young women of Virginia \nGirls State add to the vitality and strength of America.\n  Mr. President, as you know, there is no stronger foundation for \ndemocracy anywhere in the world than the U.S. Constitution. I commend \nthe participants, supporters and founders of Virginia Girls State for \ntheir dedication to American citizenship and democracy.\n  Again, I extend a happy 50th anniversary to the Virginia Girls \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6249-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6250-S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most impressive political \nleaders in our world today is the courageous Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, \nwho has quietly, consistently but firmly, stood for democracy for \nBurma, now called Myanmar by its present leaders, but still called \nBurma by Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  The military government there which still does not permit free \nassembly or a multiparty system, or other things that democracies take \nfor granted, to its credit, has released Aung San Suu Kyi from house \narrest.\n  Recently, the Los Angeles Times published an interview with her by \nScott Kraft, which said something about her courage and her country.\n  I particularly like his question ``How does it feel to be a free \ncitizen?'' She replied:\n\n       I'm a free citizen but the country is not free. So I feel \n     like a free citizen in an unfree country. I appreciate the \n     opportunity to be in touch with the people. That is what our \n     work is all about.\n       You know, I always felt free. I felt free when I was under \n     house arrest because it was my choice. I chose to do what I'm \n     doing and because of that, I found peace within myself. And I \n     suppose that is what freedom is all about.\n\n  I ask that the Los Angeles Times article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n Aung San Suu Kyi--Striving to Build a Democracy Amid the Harsh Regime \n                               of Myanmar\n\n                            (By Scott Kraft)\n\n       Aung San Suu Kyi had a rigid routine during the six years \n     she spent under arrest in her family's lakeside home. She \n     would rise at 4:30 a.m. for exercise and meditation, then \n     spend the day reading biographies or autobiographies and \n     listening to the radio. The only human being she would see \n     was the maid.\n       Though free for eight months now, she still spends most of \n     her days in that two-story house. But the 1991 Nobel Peace \n     Prize winner is hardly isolated. Two appointments \n     secretaries, one for foreign dignitaries and the other for \n     fellow party members, have guided thousands of visitors to \n     meet her.\n       ``I'm afraid I can no longer keep to a strict timetable,'' \n     Suu Kyi says. ``I can't get up at 4:30 anymore because there \n     are times I don't get to bed until 2 a.m. If I got up early, \n     I wouldn't be able to operate full-steam for 12 hours.''\n       Many here hoped her release was a first step toward \n     democracy in Myanmar. But the military regime, which \n     nullified her party's victory in the 1990 elections, still \n     runs the country. It is stage-managing a constitutional \n     convention while trying to attract foreign investment.\n       Suu Kyi is biding her time and rebuilding her party \n     network. Her weekdays are filled with appointments and on \n     weekends, hundreds of supporters gather outside the gated \n     compound to hear her speak and answer their questions. Soon, \n     she says, the government will come to its senses.\n       Even as the government tries to ignore her, Suu Kyi, 50, \n     remains the most-respected political figure in Myanmar. Her \n     father, Aung San, is considered, even by her detractors, as \n     the greatest hero of Burmese independence. He was \n     assassinated in 1947, when she was 2.\n       Suu Kyi left Burma in 1960, at age 15, and later received a \n     degree from Oxford University. She married a Briton, Michael \n     Aris, who is now a professor and specialist in Tibetan \n     studies at Oxford. In 1988, she returned to Burma to tend to \n     her ailing mother and became a leader of the pro-democracy \n     movement.\n       Aris and the couple's two sons, Kim, 18, and Alexander, 22, \n     who are in school abroad, usually visit Suu Kyi at holidays, \n     as they did during her years of house arrest, if the \n     government grants them visas. Suu Kyi is prevented from \n     leaving Myanmar only by the certainty that she would never be \n     allowed to return.\n       In person, Suu Kyi is low-key and polite, though her \n     determination is evident. She always refers to the country as \n     Burma and the capital as Rangoon, purposefully ignoring the \n     government decree that this nation be called Myanmar and the \n     city, Yangon.\n       She meets visitors at home in a square room surrounded by \n     1940s-era photographs of her family and a wall-sized painting \n     of her father. ``The painting is a bit Andy Warhol, don't you \n     think?'' she says, ``But it's really a very good likeness.''\n       Q. How would you assess the eight months since you've been \n     released? What are the positive developments and the \n     disappointments?\n       A. Well, in politics, I don't think you ever get \n     disappointed as such. It's an occupational hazard that things \n     don't always turn out as you would wish them to. You hope for \n     the best and prepare for the worst. That's politics.\n       The most positive aspect of things since my release is the \n     fact that our party has become far more active. We've been \n     reorganizing and reconsolidating. We've been subjected to a \n     lot of restrictions. There continue to be intimidations and \n     harassment.\n       But we still have the strong support of the people and we \n     manage to get along with our party building.\n       Q. Many in the West thought that when you were released, \n     everything would begin to improve.\n       A. I don't think it's as simple as that. There are some \n     people who say I was released because the government thought \n     the National League for Democracy was dead. But in fact, it \n     is far from dead. There have been miscalculations like that \n     in the past by this government.\n       In the 1990 elections, the government thought we might win \n     a plurality but not an absolute majority. In fact, we got \n     82%, with the result that those elections have been totally \n     ignored and our members persecuted.\n       Q. So you aren't disappointed in the slow pace of change?\n       A. I wouldn't say ``disappointed'' is the word. There is so \n     much happening within our party that it does compensate for \n     what is not happening on the other side.\n       Of course, we know that the best thing for the country is \n     national reconciliation, which can only take place through \n     dialogue. And we hope that it will take place sooner rather \n     than later. But that doesn't mean we just sit and hope. We \n     have other work to do and we carry on.\n       Q. So you aren't impatient with the pace of things?\n       A. If you are very busy, you have no time to be impatient. \n     If you ask us when do we want democracy, well, we want it \n     now, of course, I feel just as strongly about that as anybody \n     else. But because we are so occupied with our numerous jobs, \n     we are not that impatient.\n       Q. Do you think the current constitutional conference, in \n     which your party is not participating, is a step in the right \n     direction?\n       A: No. That constitution is not headed for democracy. In \n     the first place, they are not allowing political parties to \n     operate effectively, and without political parties operating \n     effectively there can be no multiparty democracy.\n       The constitution they are writing really doesn't mean \n     anything. A constitution is just a piece of paper unless it \n     has the support of the people, and many a country has gone \n     through many a constitution that is unacceptable to the \n     people. Such constitutions do not last.\n       Q: So what can you do to get this government to change \n     direction?\n       A: It is the will of the people that the country should \n     become a democracy, and I'm sure the people will join me in \n     guiding the country to its democracy. We will do what we can \n     as a legally registered party. We will use political means of \n     reaching our goal. This is our constant.\n       Q: So you are talking about passive resistance.\n       A: We don't really believe that the way to bring about \n     democracy is by encouraging popular uprisings. We believe \n     that democracy will come through the strength of the \n     political will of the people, expressed through political \n     parties.\n       Q: How does it feel to be a free citizen?\n       A: I'm a free citizen but the country is not free. So I \n     feel like a free citizen in an unfree country. I appreciate \n     the opportunity to be in touch with the people. That is what \n     our work is all about.\n       You know, I always felt free. I felt free when I was under \n     house arrest because it was my choice. I chose to do what I'm \n     doing and because of that, I found peace within myself. And I \n     suppose that is what freedom is all about.\n       Q: Do you think that it is possible the government thought \n     it could make you a nonperson by releasing you?\n       A: Sounds likely, doesn't it? Yes, it seems likely.\n       Q: The government often points out that you are married to \n     a foreigner. How important is that criticism to the average \n     Burmese?\n       A: I don't think it means very much. If I were married to a \n     Burmese, they'd probably attack my husband's family for other \n     reasons than that he was foreign. Don't forget that they are \n     also attacking--very, very viciously--other party leaders \n     who are not married to foreigners.\n       Q: Is your husband able to visit you?\n       A: He came for Christmas, but last year he was refused a \n     visa for the Easter holidays. So he comes if he gets a visa.\n       Q: You have frequently called for dialogue with the \n     government.\n       A: Yes, we believe in dialogue and we will always believe \n     in dialogue because that's the way all political problems end \n     up.\n\n[[Page S6251]]\n\n       Q: Has the government made any overtures to you?\n       A: Our party has a policy that we will make no statements \n     about dialogue until we decide we are ready to bring out an \n     official version.\n       Q: So you're saying . . . ?\n       A: What I'm saying is that I'm not answering your question \n     (laughs).\n       Q: If there is an election based on the government's new \n     constitution, would your party participate?\n       A: We don't even know whether there is going to be a \n     constitution or what sort of constitution. In any case, I \n     don't think we should be talking about the next elections \n     when the issue of the last elections has not yet been \n     resolved.\n       Q: Currently, the government is promoting foreign \n     investment, and many companies, including Unocal in Los \n     Angeles, have investments here. What's your message to those \n     companies?\n       A: We have always said--very, very clearly--that Burma is \n     not right for investment. The climate is not right because \n     the structural changes necessary to make an investment really \n     profitable are not yet in place.\n       We have now acquired in Burma a small group of very, very \n     rich people. We did not have such people eight years ago--\n     people who could go to a hotel and spend $1,000 on a meal. \n     That was unheard of. And the gap between the haves and the \n     have-nots is increasing. That does not make for social \n     stability.\n       Q: Do you think the government's hold on power will be \n     strengthened as it opens up the economy?\n       A: Well, it's not a free market. Some are freer than others \n     in their access to the market. The mechanism necessary for a \n     really healthy open economy does not yet exist. And one of \n     the most important parts of that is the rule of law. You have \n     to know where you stand. . . . Without that, there can be \n     neither credibility nor confidence. And every businessman \n     must agree that good business cannot be done without \n     credibility and confidence.\n       Q: What do you do to discourage investment?\n       A: It's not just what I say and it's not just the support \n     there is abroad for the movement for democracy. Potential \n     investors who really study the situation in depth, who don't \n     just take a superficial view, will come to their own \n     conclusion that the time is not yet right.\n       They may want to put a little bit here so they can have a \n     toe hold, waiting for the day when Burma takes off. Of \n     course, that day will be when democracy comes.\n       Q: In your heart, when do you think that will come? Are we \n     talking five years?\n       A: I can't really say. But certainly I don't think it will \n     be that long.\n       On the other hand, I know there will be a lot of problems \n     to deal with once we have democracy. In fact, I think we'll \n     probably have more problems after we have democracy than \n     before. This is always the case when a system changes from an \n     authoritarian system to an open and transparent one.\n       Q: You tell the crowds that democracy is no panacea.\n       A: Yes, I tell them that under a democracy, we will have to \n     be prepared to take responsibility for our country's \n     problems. Once they have democracy, they can no longer blame \n     the government because they are really the government.\n       Q: But won't there need to be pressure to bring about \n     change here?\n       A. There is international pressure. But of course what is \n     more important is that there is pressure from within.\n       The Burmese people are tired of authoritarianism, and they \n     have seen for themselves that the authoritarian system has \n     not done the country any good at all. Our standards of \n     education are falling. Standards of health are falling. The \n     face that we have new hotels does not make up for the fact \n     that our children are less well-educated.\n       Q: Were you surprised, after your release, that there was \n     still strong support for you? Did you worry that you might \n     have been forgotten?\n       A: No, no. I was not that surprised. It's nothing to do \n     with me. It has more to do with the desire of the people for \n     a system that gives them both liberty and security. This is \n     what people want, isn't it? People want to be free and at the \n     same time they want to be secure.\n       Q: And you personally?\n       A: It's not me they are supporting in particular. The \n     government seems to think it's me personally that the people \n     are supporting. This government always gets things wrong.\n       We won the election in 1990 because the people wanted \n     democracy. It was not because of me.\n       Q: Do you worry about your safety?\n       A: No, I don't worry very much at all. It's not because I'm \n     all that courageous or anything. It's just that there is no \n     point in it. If they want to do anything to me they can do it \n     any time they like.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6250-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COLLEGE NATIONAL FINALS RODEO\n\n Mr. BURNS.

These fine young men and women are at \nthe heart of the sport of rodeo and deserve to be commended for their \nhard work and determination.\n  The CNFR is especially important to all these young riders because of \nthe great opportunity for college scholarships and prizes. For many, \nthis competition will determine which school they will be able to \nafford, if any. These generous scholarships are provided by the U.S. \nTobacco Association and they should be given applause for their work to \nstrengthen the sport and help these young riders obtain a college \neducation.\n  The city of Bozman has also contributed a great deal to the CNFR. \nCelebrating the 25th anniversary of hosting the rodeo, the Brick \nBreeden Field House has provided the perfect location for the finals \nand hopefully will continue to do so well into the future.\n  You have good reason to be proud of your sport and what you do. As \nthe only original America sport, you are carrying on a tradition that \nwas started over 100 years ago. When the cowboys of the Old West were \ndriving their herds across the plains, little did they know that their \nfriendly competitions would become a multimillion dollar sport. Your \ndedication to the rodeo honors them and their hard work and commitment \nto the land.\n  My hats off to you and the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6251-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6251-S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AND IN THE LONG RUN--WE SHOULD WIN\n\nMr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently the New York Times carried \nan item in its business section, written by Richard H. Koppes, deputy \nexecutive officer and general counsel of the California Public \nEmployees Retirement System, the Nation's largest public employee \npension fund with almost $100 billion in assets.\n  What he writes makes a huge amount of good sense.\n  He calls on corporate America to look long term rather than short \nterm. Both in politics and in business we have the tendency to look \nshort term.\n  I ask that the New York Times article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 19, 1996]\n\n                   And in the Long Run We Should Win\n\n                         (By Richard H. Koppes)\n\n       Last Thursday, President Clinton put the spotlight on \n     excessive corporate profits and exorbitant layoffs by holding \n     a party at the White House to congratulate those companies \n     that ``do well'' by their employees and their shareholders.\n       The Administration, however, may want to take to the \n     woodshed the real culprits of corporate greed: the boards of \n     directors that have allowed ``the hollowing out'' of \n     America's corporations to obtain short-term increase in stock \n     prices.\n       That statement may be surprising, coming from the Nation's \n     largest public pension fund and one of this country's \n     strongest advocates for good performance. But contrary to \n     assumptions being made in some board rooms of the United \n     States, Calpers, the California Public Employees Retirement \n     System, is not pushing to bump up short-term stock prices. We \n     are a company's long-term patient capital and are troubled \n     when companies sell out to short-term Wall Street traders.\n       So let me set the record straight: Calpers opposes layoffs \n     to lift stock prices in the near term. This is wrong and will \n     not work to create wealth over the long run. One public \n     pension fund official put it best recently when he said, \n     ``You can shrink your way to profitability in the short term, \n     but it isn't the road to greatness in the long run.''\n       Calpers doesn't condone what's going on. We won't \n     participate in that kind of greed. And we intend to be a \n     constructive voice to change it, by demanding high-quality, \n     independent directors.\n       How did America's corporations get to this point? To \n     understand, we need only examine the evolution of the balance \n     of corporate power over the last decade.\n       When investors began to zero in on corporate governance \n     issues in the early 1980's management held most of the power \n     that might rightfully have belonged to the company's \n     directors and its share owners.\n       As corporate governance activism grew, share owners, from \n     the short-term Wall Street traders to the long-term investors \n     like Calpers, became increasingly influential, and managers \n     began to heed their share owners' bidding. Some managements \n     over-responded to the point that they were willing to slash \n     human assets to improve stock prices.\n       Either way, the balance of power is out of whack, this time \n     have swung too far toward share owners. Institutional \n     investors recognize it is not their role to govern the \n     company. That is the responsibility of the board. Only the \n     directors can insure that neither management nor share owners \n     hold an unequal share of the power.\n       How do they do that? They can learn a lot from the Chrysler \n     Corporation and what transpired when Kirk Kerkorian \n     vigorously sought to distribute more of Chrysler's $7.5 \n     billion in cash to shareholders last year.\n\n[[Page S6252]]\n\n       Chrysler is led by a strong, independent board that is \n     strategically focused and knows the business. It could resist \n     Mr. Kerkorian's proposal because it engaged its directors, \n     managers and investors in debating what was best for the \n     company. ``None of our institutional owners asked us to \n     change directions,'' Chrysler's chairman, Robert J. Eaton, \n     said in recent speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. ``Not \n     one of them told us to compromise the future for the sake of \n     today.'' In the last five years, Chrysler has added more than \n     15,000 hourly workers while creating impressive shareowner \n     value. At its own pace, it has moved to give share owners \n     more money, including another dividend increase last week.\n       The approach taken by Chrysler's board thus serves as a \n     model for how to remedy the needles ``hollowing out'' of the \n     corporation. Strong, independent boards must be formed with \n     directors who will individually and collectively ask \n     questions about proposed layoffs to satisfy themselves that \n     the layoffs are motivated by a strategic plan for long-term \n     growth, not a desire to increase the stock price.\n       What critics of public pension fund investors do not \n     realize is that we don't care about next quarter's stock \n     price or even this year's stock price. At the company's \n     patient capital, we hold our positions for a decade or \n     longer.\n       Therein lies Calper's next stage of corporate governance \n     activism. We will be looking for measures of performance that \n     are based not simply on quarterly earnings and the most \n     recent rise in the stock price.\n       We will be examining how a corporation is positioned for \n     the long term. Part of that screen will be an evaluation, for \n     example, of whether executive compensation is rewarding \n     short-termism and whether the company has placed true value \n     on its workers.\n       Calpers will continue its focus on board structural issues \n     with an expansion into board performance, evaluating \n     directors individually and collectively. Among the key \n     questions it will ask is whether the position of board \n     chairman or chairwoman is separate from that of the chief \n     executive. If the positions are combined, is there an \n     independent director as lead outside director to act as a \n     counterbalance to the power of the chief executive? We will \n     also want to know if directors own enough stock to make \n     themselves meaningful owners.\n       When we meet with directors, we'll be asking them what they \n     have done to add value to the their company. We will look at \n     issues that affect their own objectivity and their ability to \n     devote sufficient time to board work: the number of boards \n     they serve on and whether they represent cross-directorships, \n     for example.\n       We shouldn't let the underperformers with bloated payrolls \n     off the hook. But Calpers and many other institutional \n     investors will continue to advocate real long-term growth and \n     recognize, as Mr. Clinton did on Thursday, those who resist \n     short-termism. We will listen to quality boards that commit \n     to actively pursue long-term growth.\n       With this structure in place, America will see an end to \n     what's been called the ``looting of corporate America's human \n     capital.'' It can't happen soon enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6251-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE 1995 FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EN ROUTE FACILITY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nEnvironmental Education Amendments Act, a measure which I am proud to \ncosponsor. I was also proud to support the original enacting \nlegislation in 1990. This bill is designed to extend the life of the \nNational Environmental Education and Training Foundation [NEETF], which \nwas established in 1990 to meet critical environmental needs in the \nvery best way we know how. It relies on solid, reputable science to \nbring broad-based environmental education to citizens and workers \nacross the country and around the world.\n  Specifically, the Foundation serves as a link between public and \nprivate resources. It administers a matching grant program to \nencourage, leverage, and manage private gifts for environmental \neducation. Those funds are spent on school projects, after-school \nactivities, worker training, and adult education.\n  In my home State of New York, the Foundation has sponsored \napproximately 80 projects, which I expect will have tremendous impact \non the participants and many others. One grant was awarded to the High \nSchool for Environmental Studies Project, sponsored by the Council on \nthe Environment of New York City, to infuse environmental awareness \ninto all subjects in the 9th through 12th grade curricula. The NEETF \nalso sponsored a bilingual program addressing environmental issues \naffecting Harlem residents through the waste reduction demonstration \nproject, which is part of the Harlem environmental impact project. In \nCortland, NY, NEETF operates an environmental education after-school \nprogram for elementary students. These projects share a common theme: \nThey are visionary and proactive efforts to make citizens better \ninformed about issues which affect them.\n  In the June 10th issue of US News & World Report, Michael Satchell \nwrites about the growing criticism of environmental education in this \ncountry. Although some 20 States now require or strongly encourage \nenvironmental education, the quality of the education is spotty and the \ncriticism from some camps has been overly pointed. The answer is not to \nabandon environmental education; there are identifiable risks about \nwhich the public deserves honest information. Rather, we should \nencourage fair, credible education based on solid science--a philosophy \nwhich is very much consistent with the mission of the NEETF.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6252-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6252-S6253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATIONS TO SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S TAMPA TELESERVICE \n                                 CENTER\n\nMr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for years, many of us have urged the \nFederal Government to revamp the way it provides services. Three years \nago, Vice President Al Gore made this mission his own. And in that \ntime, the National Performance Review--better known as Reinventing \nGovernment--has brought about notable improvements in the way our \nGovernment does business.\n  Today, I am very proud to recognize one of the brightest stars in the \nReinventing Government initiative: the Social Security Administration's \nTampa Teleservice Center.\n  Last month, Vice President Gore selected the Tampa Teleservice Center \nas a recipient of his Hammer Award. Mr. President, the Hammer Award \nrecognizes both individuals and teams of Government workers who have \nmade a significant contribution to the National Performance Review \nprinciples\n\n[[Page S6253]]\n\nof putting customers first, cutting red tape, empowering employees, and \ngetting back to basics.\n  Mr. President, the Tampa Teleservice Center's commitment to serving \nclients in a timely, helpful, and courteous manner is exactly the kind \nof service that Reinventing Government intended.\n  In a cynical era where Government agencies are frequently accused of \nbeing unresponsive, the Tampa Teleservice Center is proof that services \ncan be delivered quickly and skillfully. Over 90 percent of the calls \nit receives each year are handled to completion, with no need for \nfurther contact.\n  That's an incredible record. And perhaps the most impressive part is \nthat the Social Security Administration has improved its performance so \nmuch that is now rated as the best in telephone customer service from a \nlist of nine service providers--including respected companies like \nNordstrom L.L Bean, Disney, and Federal Express. these companies are in \na league of their own when it comes to customer service, and even they \nare not in the Social Security Administration's league.\n  This achievement is particularly impressive when one considers the \ndifficult task assigned to Social Security telephone agents. The sheer \nvolume of calls that these agents handle is daunting. So is the complex \nnature of many of the customers' questions.\n  The Tampa Teleservice Center is to be commended for its skill in \nhandling this difficult task. Last year, its agents assisted over one \nmillion satisfied customers.\n  I join Vice President Gore in saluting this significant achievement. \nThe workers of the Social Security Administration's Tampa Teleservice \nCenter truly embody the best principles of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6252-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONVERSION OF POSITIONS IN THE U.S. FIRE ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I understand that perhaps there had been \nsome misinformation about passing a resolution with regard to the \nchurch burnings that have been occurring. We all agree this is a \ndespicable act and one that the Senate wants to speak on in a \nresolution.\n  I have discussed this matter with the distinguished Democratic \nleader. It is our intent to work together to see if we cannot come to \nan agreement on whether there would be a bipartisan bill tomorrow so \nthat we can express ourselves and express the Senate's feeling on this \nvery important matter. It is our intent to pursue that with those who \nhave offered resolutions to address this issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me express my hope that we can do \njust as the majority leader has suggested. There is great interest in \nthe Senate in putting this body on record in a way that will allow us \nto express ourselves on these hideous fires. We can do that, and I hope \nwe can work together to find a way, a resolution, that will allow us to \ndo that as early as tomorrow. I intend to talk to Senator Moseley-Braun \nand Members on my side. We will work with the majority leader to see if \nwe can make that happen.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note that Senator Hutchison, the Senator \nfrom Texas, has been very interested in this. She will be involved in \ntrying to work that issue out. Also, Senator Faircloth has some \nlegislation in this area. We will be working on this together to get it \ndone in a very quick fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6253-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6253-S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1745\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on \nTuesday, June 18, 1996, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 433, S. 1745, the DOD authorization bill for debate only \nprior to recess.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, let me \njust point out that when we considered the scheduling of the State \nDepartment authorization bill some time ago--in fact, as I understand \nit, it was December 7, 1995--I had an opportunity to conduct a colloquy \nwith the majority leader at the time, Senator Dole. I asked him if it \nwas his intention to bring up the chemical weapons convention at some \npoint during the second session of Congress. His answer was that it was \nhis intention to consider the convention in a reasonable time period, \nonce the convention is on the Executive Calendar.\n  It has been on the calendar now since April 30. I fully appreciate \nthat the distinguished majority leader is just beginning to put his \nplans for the legislative schedule together and I would not expect that \nhe would have a date certain, but I ask the majority leader whether the \nchemical weapons convention could be considered, and if it is his \nintention to consider the treaty at some point in the future as we take \nup this particular bill that is very important to many of our Members, \nand I think some clarification with regard to his intent would be very \nhelpful.\n\n[[Page S6254]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the distinguished \nDemocratic leader. I think that is a reasonable request.\n  He is right. I have been on the job as majority leader for a little \nmore than 24 hours, and there are a lot of issues that we are working \ntogether on. We are making some progress on those. We will continue to \nwork on the health care reform, and we have not been able to get the \nbudget resolution passed so we can move on to the appropriations \ncalendar.\n  This is an issue that I had done some work on as the whip, just \ntrying to get an agreement on some other issues, including the missile \ndefense issue. I had never really discussed it, in terms of its \nrelationship to the DOD authorization bill. I know that there are a \ncouple of Senators who have some concerns about it. I have not had a \nchance to sit down and be briefed with them.\n  I have a meeting of our committee chairmen scheduled for early next \nweek, Tuesday. I would like to ask the chairman of the committee \nexactly what his situation is on this legislation. It is obviously very \nimportant. The chemical weapons convention is something that we are all \nconcerned about. I think it should be given proper consideration. I \nhate to use the words reasonable time, because that is what the leader \ndid use in his response to your question at that time, and I believe it \nwas reported out of committee on April 30.\n  It is not my intention to withhold this convention, but I do want to \nunderstand what the problems are, how much time we would be talking \nabout in bringing it up. As the Senator knows, we have a limited number \nof days in which to do a lot of important work. But I will say this, I \nam going to talk to those Senators, hopefully tomorrow if they are \nhere, but certainly early next week. And I will get back to the \nDemocratic leader and we will talk about how we can work out an \nagreement on this issue.\n  I cannot make a commitment on a date certain at this time because I \ndo not know what the situation is. If you will give me the benefit of a \nfew days, I will try to give a more responsive answer at that time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, under the circumstances think that is an \nappropriate answer and I appreciate the majority leader's willingness \nto work with us in finding a mutually acceptable time.\n\n  With that, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank very much the distinguished Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/13/senate-section/article/S6253-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 18, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
