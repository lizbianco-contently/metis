Mr. President, yesterday President Clinton announced \nthat the United States would establish diplomatic ties with the \nGovernment of Vietnam. I want to commend the President for having the \ncourage and the vision to begin a new chapter with a nation that was \nonce our enemy.\n  It has been 20 years since the last U.S. helicopter lifted off the \nroof of the American Embassy in Saigon, a tragic ending to a long and \npainful war. For years afterward, relations between our two nations \nhave remained hostile and the question of what happened to the American \nsoldiers missing in action in Southeast Asia remained unanswered.\n  But times have changed. The Vietnamese leaders who viewed the United \nStates with suspicion and distrust have been replaced by a new \ngeneration of leaders, one that has demonstrated a desire to cooperate \non the POW/MIA issue and a number of other questions having to do with \nrelations between our two countries. With their help, we have been able \nto make much progress toward our goal of a full and accurate accounting \nof our soldiers who did not come home when the war was over.\n  I understand that the prospect of restoring diplomatic ties with \nVietnam is painful to many Americans, particularly those who have \nfriends and family members among those who remain unaccounted for in \nVietnam. But experience has shown us that it is precisely by expanding \nour ties with Vietnam that we are most likely to learn what happened to \nthe soldiers who never returned.\n  Consider the President's decision on February 3, 1994, to lift the \ntrade embargo against Vietnam. At the time, some Members of Congress \nand some in the veterans community expressed concern that lifting the \nembargo would reward Vietnam prematurely and discourage their further \ncooperation on the POW/MIA issue.\n  Instead, as we all now know, just the opposite has occurred. Just 2 \nmonths ago, officials from the Departments of State, Defense, and \nVeterans Affairs traveled to Asia for high-level talks with their \ncounterparts in both Vietnam and Laos. During that trip they were \npresented with more than 100 documents, which the Defense Department \nhas called the most detailed and informative turned over to date. \nMoreover, our officials characterize the cooperation they had received \nfrom the Vietnamese as excellent.\n  Well, this progress has not gone unnoticed by those who remain \ncommitted to a full accounting of our POW's and MIA's. For example, the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, one of the Nation's most influential veterans \ngroups and an organization whose membership includes 600,000 Vietnam \nveterans, released a statement on June 13 regarding the issue of \nnormalizing relations with Vietnam. In that statement, the VFW \nannounced it will support the establishment of diplomatic ties with \n\n[[Page S 9728]]\nVietnam, provided such ties would enable the United States to make even \nfurther progress toward a full accounting of the missing.\n  It is also telling that normalization of relations with Vietnam is \nstrongly supported by three of my colleagues who are distinguished \nveterans of the Vietnam war and who served with me on the Senate Select \nCommittee on POW/MIA Affairs: Senator John Kerry, the chairman of the \ncommittee; Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam for 6 \nyears; and Senator Bob Kerrey, the recipient of the Congressional Medal \nof Honor for heroism in Vietnam. Having devoted countless hours to this \nissue, all three concluded establishing diplomatic ties with the \nVietnamese will lead to greater cooperation in resolving our remaining \nPOW/MIA cases.\n  Normalizing relations with Vietnam does serve our national interest \nin another very important respect. Other nations have already created a \ndiplomatic presence in Vietnam, and some have even entered into trade \nagreements with the Vietnamese Government. This puts U.S. businesses at \na competitive disadvantage in one of the fastest growing markets in all \nof Asia. Establishing a formal presence in Vietnam will help this \ncountry even out the playing field with their international \ncompetitors, leading to greater exports and greater job creation.\n  The President has recognized that our relationship with Vietnam \nshould be based on today's national interests, not yesterday's \nanimosities. I fully expect his bold decision will help us find the \nanswers about our missing servicemen that their families and we have \nlong awaited.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9727-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Madam President, I rise today to talk about two men; \none is a Nazi doctor, the other is his pursuer. Before I get into that, \nI want to thank my father-in-law and my mother-in-law, Dr. Ken Garber \nand Betty Lee Garber, for bringing this matter to my attention.\n  This is a painful subject to talk about for many, particularly as we \nlook at what is going on in Bosnia and some of the ethnic cleansing \nthat is happening there. We talk about Vietnam and our missing in \naction. Looking at history and digging up the past is not always a \npleasant experience but one which I believe is absolutely necessary in \nthis case and one that I come to the floor to talk about and will be on \nnotice to come back to if it is necessary to talk about it again.\n  The Nazi doctor I am going to talk about this morning is Dr. Hans \nSewering. He is just not a normal doctor in Germany. This is a doctor \nwho was the head of the German Medical Society for 17 years--17 years. \nHe was a State senator in the State of Bavaria for 20 years, a very \nwell-known person in Germany.\n  How this came to the attention of his pursuer 2 years ago, Dr. \nMichael Franzblau from Marin County in California, was that Dr. \nSewering was nominated, in fact elected, to become the president of the \nWorld Medical Association,\n the affiliate of the American Medical Association in the United \nStates.\n\n  It came to the attention of Dr. Franzblau that Dr. Sewering was \naccused of crimes during the Nazi reign.\n  And who is Dr. Sewering? Dr. Sewering joined the SS in 1933. Nine \nmonths later, he joined the Nazi Party. When he graduated from medical \nschool, he went to work in Munich at the tubercular clinic of \nSchoenbrunn near Dachau in 1932.\n  During that time, under his administration, Dr. Franzblau, and other \nmedical historians, are suggesting that he sent over 900 disabled \nchildren to a ``healing center''--a healing center--6 to 10 kilometers \naway, not far down the road, from the tubercular clinic that he ran. \nOver 900 children were sent to a healing center.\n  What was this healing center? It was a euphemism for a ``killing \ncenter,'' where disabled children were deliberately starved and given \nbarbiturates to kill them ``efficiently,'' with little cost to the \nstate.\n  The center was run by a Dr. Helmut Pramueller. Dr. Pramueller in 1949 \nwas convicted by a German court. They found him guilty of murdering \n6,000 children who were ``unfit'' because of their disabilities, which \nranged from epilepsy to mild mental illnesses to physical disabilities. \nBy the way, Dr. Pramueller, for killing 6,000 children in this \n``healing center,'' was sentenced to 6 years in prison. He got 1 year \noff for good behavior.\n  But Dr. Sewering was never prosecuted. The reason for that is that \nthe evidence was not made available. In fact, the only evidence we have \nbeen able to ascertain through the work of Dr. Franzblau, and others, \nis one documented case of which Dr. Sewering sent a 12-year-old girl, \nBabette Frowiss, to the ``healing center'' from his tubercular clinic \nat the Schoenbrunn. We have the document, with his signature on it. It \nsays:\n\n       She is no longer suitable for Schoenbrunn. She will be sent \n     to Egfling-Haar--\n\n  The name of this killing center--\n\n       the healing center.\n\n  It was well known in Dachau, the vicinity of where these centers \nwere, that this ``healing center'' was, in fact, a place where children \nwere starved and killed ``efficiently.''\n  But nevertheless, we have that document, the origins of which we do \nnot know. It has been authenticated as a real document, but we cannot \nfind any other documents. In fact, the German Government will not make \navailable any of these documents. Some even insist that they are not \navailable or that they do not exist or, if they do, they just cannot \nfind them. But in any case, they are not around, and the prosecutors in \nMunich that Dr. Franzblau is trying to get to prosecute this case \nrefuse to look into it.\n  Another curious angle to this question is four nuns. The tubercular \nclinic at Schoenbrunn where Dr. Sewering worked was run by Franciscan \nnuns, the Franciscan order. There were four nuns as of 2 years ago, \nwhen Dr. Sewering was nominated to presidency of the World Medical \nAssociation, who were there at the time. When Dr. Sewering was elected, \nand then withdrew his nomination in election, these four nuns issued a \nstatement basically indicting Dr. Sewering and what went on at the \nclinic and at Egfling-Haar, at the healing center, the killing center.\n  You might think that if you were the prosecutor in Munich who was \nconcerned about sending children to their death by such a horrendous \nmeans that you would take the time to interview these nuns who released \nthis statement. Well, the prosecutor has not done so. Despite \nprotestations from Dr. Franzblau, and others, he has refused to \ninterview them. He has refused to pursue the documents that can \nultimately convict Dr. Sewering of his crimes. And Dr. Franzblau \npersists in his trips over there to get them to pay attention to this, \nbut this is an uncomfortable thing to talk about, and this is a very \npowerful man in Germany. Seventeen years the head of the medical \nsociety and they have refused to go after him.\n  Dr. Franzblau is taking matters into his own hands. On Friday, this \nwill be published in the New York Times. The Friday morning New York \nTimes will have this full-page advertisement. It says:\n\n       We accuse the German State of Bavaria of harboring and \n     protecting a war criminal.\n       The German State of Bavaria has protected Dr. Hans Joachim \n     Sewering for 50 years.\n       Dr. Hans Joachim Sewering is accused of participating in \n     the transfer of 900 German Catholic children from Schoenbrunn \n     Sanitarium to a ``Healing Center'' at Egfling-Haar, where \n     they died.\n       Four nuns made this allegation in January 1993.\n       They were eyewitnesses to these crimes and broke their vow \n     of silence 50 years after the fact at the suggestion of the \n     Bishop of Munich.\n\n\n[[Page S 9729]]\n\n  Yes, they remained silent for 50 years, but after this man was \nelected to the World Medical Association presidency, they spoke up at \nthe urging of the Bishop of Munich.\n\n       Dr. Sewering, age 78, still practices medicine in Dachau.\n       Dr. Sewering must be brought to the bar of justice now.\n       The relatives of the murdered children ask for justice.\n       The German people will be cleansed of this stain on their \n     honor by the successful prosecution and conviction of Dr. \n     Hans Joachim Sewering for murder and crimes against humanity.\n\n  And they ask:\n\n       If you believe, as we do, that Dr. Sewering should be \n     brought to justice, please act now by faxing or writing to \n     the German Consulate. . .\n\n  At their number.\n  I hope that Senators listening to this, if they believe as I believe \nthat the German Government owes more diligence in pursuing this, that \nthey sign on to a letter that I will be sending to the German \nGovernment asking them to find these documents and to interview these \nnuns so we can pursue this case. It is the least they can do. It is the \nleast they can do for 900 children starved to death because of their \ndisabilities.\n  I come here to the U.S. Senate not casually. I know this is a very \nimportant place to make these kinds of statements, but this is an \nabomination. The children who were murdered deserve justice, their \nfamilies deserve a full accounting, and Dr. Franzblau, 25 of whose \nrelatives were incinerated in a synagogue in Poland, deserves the \nsatisfaction of knowing that his efforts were not in vain.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss that portion of S. \n343 covering the Superfund. As we know, Senate bill 343 establishes \nrequirements to do risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis and \nincludes Superfund cleanups that exceed $10 million in total costs.\n  The administration, however, and some Senators, want this section \nremoved from the bill on the grounds that the application of cost-\nbenefit analysis to Superfund through the regulatory reform process is \nsomehow inappropriate. I think it is fair to say there is also a \nquestion of jurisdiction relative to the various committee references \nthat this bill would ordinarily go to that portion--at least under \nSuperfund. I am speaking of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  However, laying that aside, because of the statutory requirements in \nthe Superfund requirements itself, risk and cost-benefit analysis, in \nmy opinion, are precisely the right tools that the Government should be \nusing to carry out the requirements of that law.\n  Provisions in the Superfund law specifically require cost-benefit and \nrisk analysis. Superfund requires that the President select appropriate \nremedial actions that ``provide for cost effective responses'' and to \nconsider both the short-term and the long-term cost of the actions.\n  Superfund requires the President to publish a regulation called the \nnational contingency plan [NCP], to carry out the requirements of the \nstatute.\n  Now, the NCP must contain, one, methods for analysis of relative \ncosts for remedial action; two, means for assuring that remedial \nactions are cost-effective over time; three, criteria ``based on \nrelative risk or danger'' for determining priorities among releases of \nhazardous substances for the purposes of taking remedial action.\n  Now, the national contingency plan also requires a baseline risk \nassessment to be performed for every remedial action. This means that \nfor every Superfund cleanup, a risk assessment is done right now.\n  Superfund requires the President to identify priority sites that \nrequire remedial action through a hazard ranking system that must \n``assess the relative degree of risk.''\n  Unlike other environmental statutes, the Congress explicitly wrote \nprovisions into this law that cost and risk were to be taken into \naccount. Yet, the same entrenched bureaucracies that have been running \nup the costs of these remedial actions for years now say we simply \ncannot have reform.\n  But that is what we hear publicly. Within the administration there is \na clear recognition that cost-benefit and risk analysis, however, do \nbelong in the Superfund Program.\n  I refer to a memorandum prepared by the Council on Environmental \nQuality. In that memo, the administration correctly pointed out the \nblatant inconsistencies between its posture regarding this section of \nS. 343 and its position on regulatory reform, as well as reform of the \ncleanup statutes.\n  The memo states that opposition to the intent of the cleanup \nprovisions of S. 343 is ``inconsistent with several administrative \npolicies.''\n  Further, ``The administration has repeatedly testified that cost-\nbenefit analysis is a `useful tool' in making cleanup decisions.''\n  It also says, ``EPA, DOD, and DOE, have made well-publicized \ncommitments to more realistic risk analysis in cleanup activity.''\n  Executive Order 12866 requires cost-benefit analysis for regulations \nover $100 billion. Many cleanups exceed that amount and the total cost \nof cleanup activities approaches or exceeds $400 billion.\n  Quoting, ``It will be hard, politically and logically, to defend \napplication of the cost-benefit comparison to the former decisions and \nnot the latter.''\n  The administration also incorrectly states in that memo that \nsupplementing existing decision criteria with cost and risk \nconsiderations allows an illegal departure from statutory standards in \ndeveloping more reasonable alternatives.\n  As indicated before, remediation under Superfund is currently \nrequired to base its decisions on risk and cost considerations. Senate \nbill 343 has been amended to clarify that statutory provisions cannot \nbe superseded.\n  Critics of this section argue that these reforms should be addressed \nin the Superfund reauthorization. Superfund authorization expired last \nyear, and the taxing authority expires this year.\n  I know many of my colleagues and other members of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee have been working hard, but Superfund \nreauthorization may not be completed this year. That is a real \npossibility.\n  So, in conclusion, I would like to share with you the realization \nthat the Superfund cleanup provisions of Senate bill 343 are entirely \nconsistent with the existing law, and the planned administrative \nreforms that the Clinton administration is putting in place even now.\n  Superfund is not a level playing field. Federal and State regulators \nhave ignored risk and cost considerations throughout this process, in \nspite of the statutory requirements to consider these factors.\n  The program is badly broken largely because the degree and costs of \ncleanup have proceeded virtually unchecked for years.\n  Further, simply having these provisions in this bill has brought \nabout a new willingness on the part of the regulators to be more \nrealistic in the remedial action selection process.\n  Finally, the Superfund provisions of S. 343 are consistent with the \nlaw, are a needed reform of the remedy selection process, and are an \nappropriate and necessary reform of one of the most expensive \nregulatory programs we have experienced in history.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, just a few words about various things. \nFirst, with regard to the efforts of Senator Hatch, Senator Dole, and \nothers, on both sides of the aisle, including Senator Johnston, with \nregard to regulatory reform, I think it is very vital that we continue \nour efforts in a bipartisan way on this issue. It is a very simple \nissue out in the land. People are pretty well fed up with the quality \nand quantity of regulations over the years that have been ground out by \nthe Federal Government.\n  It is long past time that we did something to interject common sense \nand sound science into the regulatory process, and the bill that \nSenator Dole, \n\n[[Page S 9730]]\nSenator Hatch, and Senator Johnston put together will really go a very \nlong way in doing that.\n  We have tried to ensure that Members on both sides of the aisle make \ntheir concerns known about various provisions in the legislation. We \nhave worked very hard to include everyone. It is time to start walking \nthe walk instead of talking the talk. So I hope we will continue our \nvigorous efforts.\n  We have seen in Wyoming so many issues with regard to coal mining. We \nare the largest coal-producing State in the Union; yet, we would have \nEPA come to our State where we have laws that are more strict than the \nFederal Government, and come to the mining area and set up air quality \nmonitors for things like ``fugitive dust,'' in an area where the wind \nblows 60 miles an hour three times a week and will peel the vegetation \nright off the prairie. They set up their monitors and tell us about \nregulating and reducing fugitive dust. This is absolutely absurd. It \nreflects no common sense. Some EPA regulators are people of zeal, \nwithout any intellectual understanding of others or of their situation. \nRemember, too, that this community of Congress is populated by \nprivileged people, many of whom have never met a payroll, many of whom \nknow nothing about real life or how to work--really work--digging a \nditch, tamping concrete forms, working for a construction company, \ncowboying--enough. I think it is time to give them a wake-up call, and \nI think we will do that.\n  Hopefully, we will, at the same time, try to deter the trend in this \ncountry that has been to try to get every single chemical out of every \nfood, drink, and tube of lipstick known to man or woman. That type of \nactivity causes our society to shoulder exorbitant costs that are just \nnot necessary--$140 billion year on pollution control. We must decide \nhow much will we spend to get the last 5 percent of the pollution out \nof the smokestack or the waste stream, because it is those expenditures \nthat are so excessive.\n  We are being forced to recognize that the really tough choices are \nnow unavoidable.\n  The administration and the environmental groups have been critical of \nour efforts to mandate that risk assessment and cost benefit analysis \nbe used by the bureaucracy. But even the Washington Post stated in a \nrecent editorial: ``Surely it makes sense to do the kind of analysis \nthat weighs one health threat against another, and shows where \nreductions in pollution will pay off most effectively in lower rates of \nillness and death.'' And the Post editorial goes on to correctly \nrecognize that the regulatory reform bill ``. . . addresses defects . . \n. that are real.'' And ``within it lies the genuine opportunity to \nstrengthen the protection of the country's air and water.''\n  I find it disturbing that the environmental groups have run radio ads \nattacking Members of Congress who support this legislation. These ads \ngreatly oversimplify the issues we are considering and as usual the \nenvironmental groups are using fear and emotion to try and turn the \npublic against regulatory reform efforts. So when I hear groups say \nthis is a back door assault on our environmental and health laws I \nrecognize that they are resorting to what Senator Gary Hart used to \ncall ``Mau Mau politics.''\n  This kind of activity is real quite uncalled for.\n  I am fond of saying that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, \nbut nobody is entitled to their own facts. And the fact is that \ninjecting sound science into the regulatory process can enhance our \nefforts to protect the public\n health and the environment.\n\n  We have a real opportunity to stop the tendency that Federal \nregulators have to overreact to any newly discovered dangers by \ndiverting disproportionate financial and human resources into hastily \nconceived remedies. We have seen examples of that with superfund, or \nthe asbestos in schools program and in so many other areas.\n  In the case of asbestos in schools we were told we had to get the \nasbestos out or we were going to kill or injure all the children. So \nCongress rushed to pass a law and the regulators issued regulations and \nwe began a rush job to get the asbestos removed. But what we ended up \ndoing was to release more asbestos into the air and to cost the \ntaxpayers millions of dollars in remediation costs. And more \nimportantly, we have inadvertently exposed more children to more \nasbestos and greater risk than if we had simply left it in place and \ncontained it. So that is the type of thing that we want to avoid in the \nfuture and risk assessment and cost benefit analysis will help do that.\n  Some in Congress and in the bureaucracy have tried to provide the \npublic with a risk free environment. That is a purely quixotic \nexercise. We cannot afford to provide a risk free environment and in \nfact it is not possible to do that in the real world. So let us \nrecognize that and get on with the business of making certain that \nlogical and well informed regulatory\n decisions are made in the future. We cannot do that without passing \nlegislation such as the Dole bill and I am so very pleased that we are \nfinally going to do something constructive with regard to regulatory \nreform since we can no longer afford to live with the status quo.\n\n  We will hear a metric ton of the tired old rhetoric about how we must \nprotect the children and save the babies. How if we tinker with the \ncurrent regulatory regime we will cripple the bureaucracy and cause \nregulatory gridlock. We will hear that it is arrogant to assign a value \nfor human life, or that this is just an attempt to let industry and \ncurses--big business--off the hook. But Mr. President, this is \nbeginning to sound like the boy who cried wolf too many times. The \nAmerican people are more sophisticated than that. They have heard these \ntired old phrases time after time. They are beginning to tune it out. \nThey are suffering from what one journalist calls ``environmental \ncompassion fatigue.'' So I trust the larger majority of Senators will \nnot view this as a partisan issue or as an industry versus \nenvironmental group issue. But as a chance to help everyday citizens to \nget sensible and understandable regulations, based on real costs, \nrisks, and common sense--in order that we can restore some of the \ncredibility that the Federal agencies and Congress have lost over the \nyears. This debate is about change. Bureaucrats don't like change. And \nthis administration doesn't like any change that they didn't think of \nfirst.\n  But we must overcome this aversion to constructive change with \ngoodwill, facts, common sense, and perseverance. So I trust my \ncolleagues will put aside partisan rhetoric and fear mongering and we \nwill all join together to truly reform our regulatory system for the \nbenefit of a majority of the American people. They do not expect \nanything less from us, and I do trust we will not disappoint them.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9729-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9730-S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    VIETNAM AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, with regard to Vietnam, I fully \nunderstand the heartfelt emotions and strong feelings which surround \nthe normalization. Obviously we do, especially the delicate and painful \nissue of the POW/MIA's.\n  Nobody, nobody in their right mind wants Americans who fought for \ntheir country to be forgotten or abandoned, and in no way do I nor do \nany of my colleagues in this body want our Nation to forget any \npossible remaining POW/MIA's.\n  I have always said this. If there is proof of any Americans--any of \nthem--being held against their will--proof--we should get them out \nright now.\n  I was involved in this process many years ago with Senator Cranston, \nmy friend from California. We held hearings. I will never forget the \ngentleman, or I will say the chap, whatever lesser degree I can work \nup, who came before the Senate and said he had 287 minutes of a movie \nof someone in a cage imprisoned in Vietnam. We said, well, we would \nhope that you would produce that. He said, I will for 2 million bucks.\n  I think that is the closest I came to fisticuffs, at least in these \nrecent times, with that person. Absolutely absurd and disgusting. He \nsaid he had these films and, of course, he did not, and then, of \ncourse, we had pictures of people in uniform with weapons, and then \nupon close examination we would find they were taken in Hawaii or some \nother country in Southeast Asia. Absolutely absurd and disgusting.\n  We said, ``You show us where they are and we will get them.'' I just \nbelieve we need to be very honest where we are with this gut-wrenching \nissue. \n\n[[Page S 9731]]\n\n  Last year, I applauded the President's decision to announce the \nlifting of the trade embargo, especially in view of the fact that this \nhas been such a painful issue for him, due to the previous campaign \nscrutiny of his antiwar efforts during the Vietnam conflict. I am \npleased that he did not shirk from the responsibility of doing what he \nfelt was right, even though it was not necessarily popular with all the \ngroups.\n  I visited Vietnam with some of my distinguished colleagues and saw \npersonally the vast improvements taking place. Firsthand, I saw the \ncontinued progress in the area of human rights.\n  In my opinion, the best way to encourage the Vietnamese to continue \nalong this path of redemption is by establishing these full diplomatic \nrelations with the Vietnamese Government.\n  As a veteran myself, it is time to continue to march forward \nregarding this issue. Ever more effectively and positively we will \nlearn about more of the POW/MIA issue, if business people, diplomats, \nmilitary, American visitors travel and talk with Vietnamese all over \nthat country.\n  Much will be gained by a larger United States presence in Vietnam. \nGaining information about POW/MIA's has been exceedingly difficult \nwithout an embassy or other contacts since 1975.\n  Remember that, as we stiffed Vietnam for 18 years, we received \nnothing--nothing--in the way of cooperation, nothing in the way of \ninformation. Ever since we loosened our grip, much has come forward.\n  While we speak of the POW/MIA's with great, great compassion, it \nwould be interesting to me to know what happened to the 86,700 people \nmissing in action from the Second World War. Who is out speaking for \nthem, and raising money in the process? Or the 9,000 or 8,700 missing \nin action from the Korean war. Who is speaking for them?\n  There had been an unfortunate test case of keeping the issue alive, \nwith some groups, at least, with regard to their own personal \ngratification, and of course the aspects of the fundraising.\n  It is going to be a good thing. I commend the President. We will now \nbe the 161st country to recognize Vietnam. Hear that. Normalization of \nthe United States and Vietnam puts the United States on the list at No. \n161. Because currently, 160 countries, including all of our major \ntrading partners, have full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, \nproviding their country's companies and citizens with a key political \nentry for vital decisions of procurement, vital decisions as to travel \nand intercourse among nations.\n  I want to commend the VFW. I am a lifetime member of the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, who said last month that, ``We are of the opinion if \nnormalizing relations with Vietnam furthers the process toward the \nfullest possible accounting''--meaning POW/MIA's-- ``then we would \nsupport this decision.''\n  I want to commend our sturdy friends, John McCain, John Kerry, Bob \nKerrey, for taking the courageous position they have on this issue. \nWould it not have been for them, it would not have come to this point. \nAll three serve as a remarkable testimony toward doing the right thing, \nputting the past aside, moving forward. That is what life is all \nabout--change, moving forward, maturing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9730-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ABBY SAFFOLD\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, finally, just a word about this \nremarkable woman who leaves our midst in the Senate family. That is \nAbby, known to most Members as Abby.\n  Abby Saffold, schoolteacher, parole officer--I think perhaps she was \nthat while she was in the Senate, as I think of it--for in many cases, \nas we would come in the door and we would say, ``When is the next vote, \nAbby? When are we going to get out of here Friday,'' and ``What is next \nweek's schedule?''\n  There she was, with that very genial and very, very steady manner, \nsharing her remarkable expertise of the Senate. She was trained well by \nSenator Robert Byrd and others. She did it all, and she did it very \nwell.\n  I would just like to wish her well and say that the most single \nparticular thing for me about Abby was, whether I was in the minority \nor the majority, I was treated exactly the same--with courtesy, with \nintelligence, with good, rich, knowledge of the Senate.\n  I think that is the tribute to her, because there are those--not just \nstaff, but those of us who are known simply as principals--who, when we \nare riding high in the majority, really do lay it on. Then, when we get \nin the minority, we kind of whimper and whine a bit. I have been in \nboth places.\n  To Abby, the tribute is the courtesy that she extended to all, \nregardless of party, regardless of philosophy, and I certainly wish her \nwell. Knowing her, she will be doing some things that will be very \npleasing and important and satisfying to her. God bless her. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to comment on something that \nthe President did yesterday.\n  The President normalized relationships with Vietnam. The President, I \nthink, did the wrong thing. The President is not a veteran of any war. \nI have never been in military service. I do not presume to understand \nwars. But I do understand the commitments we made to the people who \nhave been drafted and volunteered; that is, if they are missing in \naction, our Government is going to take all action necessary to make \nsure that we get information about them, and also, if you are taken as \na prisoner of war, we are going to do everything we can to get you out. \n``Ye shall not be forgotten nor forsaken.''\n  But yesterday there was a deafening roar that we heard all the way \ndown here in the Nation's Capital--and that roar came from Wall Street. \nNo. It was not about the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest \nrates. It was because the Dow went through the roof, and it was because \nyesterday President Clinton announced that he will take steps to \nnormalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam. And that is because it is \ndriven not so much by a commonsense approach but because of corporate \nand commercial interests in America, and the profit motive was stronger \nthan our humanitarian motives.\n  Of course, that sent the tickertape cascading through the canyons of \nsteel. The champagne flowed freely throughout corporate America. The \npowerful forces of business and profit have won an important battle \nover America's obligation to account for our missing servicemen. The \nonly thing flowing among the MIA families who have not had answers was \nresignation and despair yesterday.\n  This is a President whose term is marked by broken promises. I \nbelieve that when history recounts the Clinton years, many will reflect \nand call him ``Broken Promise President.''\n  That is what he has done on this issue. Yesterday President Clinton \nbroke another promise, and he made a grave mistake by doing it. His \ndecision is wrong because it displays a gross injustice to Americans \nwho have fought to defend our country's freedom. It displays an \ninjustice to their families, who have waited vigilantly and who have \nendured a pain of uncertainty for the past 22 years.\n  The President's action also reveals a dismal commitment to the men \nand women who are and have been members of the military, loyally \nserving their country because of this promise we have made to them that \nwas not kept, that we shall not forsake nor forget them.\n  We are going to have a State Department authorization bill before \nthis body perhaps next week, and I will have more to say about that \nthen. But I want to make just a few comments because I was on the POW/\nMIA Committee.\n  I said 3 years ago that on this issue of commercial ties and \ndiplomatic recognition, that there was a steamroller moving through \nthis town headed directly toward normalization of relations with \nVietnam. This was despite the fact that an investigation was still \n\n[[Page S 9732]]\nunder way into the POW/MIA issue by the select committee that I served \non.\n  Corporate America is driving the steamroller. The avenues of its \ntravels were largely underground. They were barely seen by the public. \nGovernment officials in all agencies in both branches of Government \nwere busy paving the way for further advancement.\n  The one potential roadblock was a resolution of the POW/MIA issue. \nBut the roadblock was no match for the steamroller. The Select \nCommittee on POW/MIA's was never able to reach a consensus on the issue \nof the possibility that men remain in Vietnam. Moreover, there was \nnever a thorough, independent evaluation of each MIA case. There were \nlots of promises but never an evaluation case by case.\n  There was also great hyperbole about Vietnam's extensive cooperation \nin resolving MIA cases. It is coming from the same ones who got all \nexcited when the Vietnamese gave up pilot helmets and artifacts and \ngenerally useless photos and other information.\n  Madam President, that was pure bunk at that time. Vietnam has \ncooperated in resolving MIA cases about as much as the Japanese \ncooperate with us in world trade. There sure has been a lot of \nactivity, but it is all atmospheric--lots of scurrying around, lots of \ndigging, lots of busy work. But look at the facts.\n  Since our select committee finished its work, only 37 sets of remains \nhave been recovered and positively identified. Eight of those were in \n1993, 26 in 1994, and only 3 this year. We are still listing 2,202 as \nmissing. So where is the progress?\n  The President said the following yesterday about the alleged \ncooperation of the Vietnamese, and I quote: ``Never before in the \nhistory of warfare has such an extensive effort been made to resolve \nthe fate of soldiers who did not return.''\n  If I could borrow from the President's words, I would have said it \nthis way: ``Never before in the history of warfare has such an \nextensive effort been made to resolve the fate of soldiers who did not \nreturn and yet so little accomplished.''\n  Those who have jumped on the steamroller argue that the best way to \nlearn about the fate of the missing is to establish a presence in the \ncountry. I think that is a specious argument. It is devoid of rigorous \nanalysis. That is a theory made out of whole cloth. There is no \nrational basis for it. In fact, it is simplistic.\n  The only thing that we will get out of the presence in Vietnam--in \nthe absence of full accounting--is a bunch of business deals.\n  The only time Vietnam ever gave us any data on MIA's is when we \nplayed hardball like we think we ought to play hardball with the \nJapanese on trade.\n  During the select committee's investigation, we learned that the \nVietnamese had at least three categories of information.\n  The first level is archival. This information is in museums and the \nlike. Even the Vietnamese citizens have access to much of this \ninformation. This would include photos and helmets like we were given \nin the fall of 1992, and which some people went gaga over. This first \nlevel of information is, obviously, the least useful.\n  Next, there are the provincial wartime records of shootdowns. This \ninformation is an accounting of the date, the time, and the location of \neach shootdown of an American plane. It is recorded out in the \ncountryside at the provincial level. It also provided data on the type \nof aircraft and the status of pilots and the crew.\n  These are official unit records of the antiaircraft corps of the \nVietnamese military. The utility of this information is, among other \nthings, that it would allow us to crosscheck the status of our MIA's \nwith our own records.\n  Finally, there is the national security information. These are the \ncentral committee-level documents, kind of like the Politburo \ndocuments. These contain, in essence, Vietnamese national secrets on \nUnited States prisoner-of-war information and activities.\n  Before our committee learned of these levels of information, Vietnam \nconsistently denied their existence. So did our crack investigative \noutfit on this issue, the Defense Intelligence Agency. Yet, somehow, as \nwe pressed on, some of this information started to appear.\n  In April 1992, when a delegation from the select committee went to \nIndochina, the Vietnamese denied to us the existence of the archival \nmaterial.\n  But just 6 months later, helmets and photos were sprouting everywhere \nand it was because the Vietnamese were being told give us data and then \nPresident Bush would lift the trade embargo.\n  Of course, the trade embargo was not lifted because all of the data \nthat supposedly showed their cooperation was not very useful in \nresolving cases.\n  A year later, when President Clinton decided not to lift the economic \nembargo, lo and behold, we started getting some information from the \nprovinces on shootdowns. But that information has remained spotty, and \nit came not through official channels but through humanitarian \nchannels, the Military Joint Task Force full accounting.\n  The point again is when we play a little hardball, the data flows. \nWhen we do not, it does not.\n  As for the national security information, the Politburo information I \nwas talking about, we have seen none, and this is notwithstanding the \nfact that our Government turned over to Vietnam millions of pages of \nour own declassified national security data on their prisoners and \nmissing in action, as we should, as a result of the 1972 peace \nagreement.\n  Establishing a presence and establishing big business in Vietnam is \nnot going to get us access to those national security records. Anyone \nwho thinks that it is, Mr. President, is naive. And unless we press for \nit, unless we get access to it, there is no way that we can say we have \ndone everything we can for a full accounting of our missing in action.\n  Mr. President, yesterday is a dark day for America. It was the day \nthat President Clinton put an end to our Nation's pledge to those lost \nin battle, a pledge that says, ``Ye shall not be forgotten nor \nforsaken.'' This is a wound to the body politic that will not quickly \nheal.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9731-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9732-S9733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              ALZHEIMER'S\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, recently, it was announced that an \ninternational research team had discovered a gene that causes the most \naggressive form of Alzheimer's disease. This is a tremendous \nbreakthrough. This discovery could lead to solving the mystery of what \ngoes wrong in the brain to cause Alzheimer's, and is a prime example of \nthe need for medical research.\n  Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease that \nattacks the brain and results in impaired memory, thinking, and \nbehavior. There have been other breakthroughs in the treatment and cure \nof Alzheimer's, as well as other neurological diseases. Other genes \nhave been identified that lead to Alzheimer's; the first animal model \nof Alzheimer's disease--a transgenic mouse--has recently been produced, \nand is already being used to test drugs to slow the progression of the \ndisease. Furthermore, Cognex, approved in 1994, is the first drug for \ntreating Alzheimer's symptoms, and a combination of genetic testing and \npositron emission tomography [PET] scanning may yield an early \ndiagnostic test for Alzheimer's. None of these discoveries could have \noccurred without funding for the research programs and scientists \ndedicated to finding cures for these devastating diseases.\n  Four million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. The cost for \ncaring for these men and women is $60 billion a year, making \nAlzheimer's the most expensive uninsured illness threatening American \nfamilies. The disease is excluded from coverage by Medicare and most \nprivate insurance; therefore, the burden of the expenses is borne by \nthe patient's family. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that at the \nrate of current research activities, researchers could reach their goal \nof delaying the onset of the disease by 5 years, reducing by half the \nnumber of people with Alzheimer's, and saving the country up to $50 \nbillion a year. It is just common sense that investing in a cure now \nwill result in huge savings in the long run.\n  I read with satisfaction William Safire's New York Times op-ed this \npast May, in which he encouraged investment in medical research. He \ncalled investment a no-brainer. Mr. \n\n[[Page S 9733]]\nSafire also called GOP proposals to cut funding to the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH] shortsighted. I agree. The most effective \nway to curb the country's ever-growing medical costs is to cure or \nameliorate the diseases that drive people into hospitals.\n  I would like to commend the Alzheimer's Association for their \ntireless efforts on behalf of the victims of Alzheimer's and their \nfamilies, as well as their dedication to acquiring funding for \nresearch. The association estimates that Alzheimer's could affect over \n14 million Americans by the middle of the 21st century. The costs will \nbe astronomical, and it will be the future generations who will have to \npay. The association further states that the disease has not yet \nfinancially overwhelmed the country because the families are providing \nalmost all of the\n care. If this caregiving falls apart our annual health care costs will \ngo up by more than $54 billion.\n\n  The ultimate return on our investment in Alzheimer research depends \non scientists' ability to continue the search for new pieces of the \npuzzle. That is now threatened by the GOP budget proposal. For the past \n2 years, public funding for Alzheimer's research has not even kept pace \nwith inflation. The results have already proved harmful to research. \nLess than one in four high-quality applications for grants for \nAlzheimer's research is being funded. And individual grant awards are \nbeing cut by 10 to 20 percent. The number of epidemiological studies, \nthat is--who gets Alzheimer's and why--has been reduced. Entire lines \nof investigation are being put on hold or lost forever as scientists \nturn to other fields of study. Funding for 28 Alzheimer's Disease \nCenters [ADC's], has been cut back. Finally, the National Institute on \nAging has abandoned plans for new satellite clinics to serve rural, \nminority, and low-income communities and to increase their \nrepresentation in research.\n  The Federal investment of $311 million in 1995 is less than $78 per \nperson with the disease, or about $1 for every $321 the disease now \ncosts society.\n  I have been a long-time supporter of NIH funding. It is my belief \nthat medical research is the key to eliminating disease and making our \nhealth care system less costly and more effective. In fact, a recent \nNIH report estimated that approximately $800 million invested in \nclinical and applied medical research would realize a 1-year savings of \napproximately $6 billion.\n  The gene discovery, announced yesterday, will aid in the fight \nagainst Alzheimer's disease. These breakthroughs do not occur often \nenough. We, in Congress, have the responsibility to provide researchers \nwith the funding to enable them to continue their indispensable work.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9732-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Madam President, I will speak to these amendments as soon \nas the distinguished Senator from Minnesota has completed. I ask \nunanimous consent I be next recognized--except for the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but \nlet me just indicate we are working here in good faith. We have not \nseen these amendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have not either.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I hope we will have an opportunity, first, to look at \nthe amendments; second, let me just say, I hope--I know we are working \nunder the rights that every Senator is accorded under parliamentary \nprocedure. But, again, we filled the tree, and I think we all \nunderstand the reasons for filling the tree. I hope we can have some \ngood debate and have the opportunity to lay down amendments.\n  I was prepared to lay an amendment down--not fill the tree--and have \na good debate about it.\n  The Senator from Utah has asked me to withdraw or delay the offering \nof that amendment. I have done so. Now I find that after I have \nconceded to do that we allow the Senator from Delaware to offer an \namendment, and now we have not one amendment but four amendments simply \nto fill the tree.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Certainly. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to accommodate the distinguished minority leader. \nHe has been so gracious this morning. We are trying to work out the \namendment, and we will certainly do so. But we would be happy to set \nthese amendments aside in favor of the amendment of the distinguished \nminority leader. So it is not a problem. We will be happy to \naccommodate the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is not necessary.\n  I would just call attention to the fact that I think it is important \nfor us to work through these things and not to deprive either side.\n  Mr. HATCH. We intend to work in good faith with all Members on the \nfloor, and we will do our very best to do so. As you know, this bill is \na tough bill and there is a lot of controversy on both sides of the \nfloor, although I think we are resolving those controversies. I think \nwe are doing it in the ordinary course. We continue to try to resolve \nall the conflicts that might exist between our two sides. But we will \ntry to cooperate with the distinguished minority leader. We want to \nmove ahead on amendments today and get as much done as we can.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, do I understand then that the Senator \nfrom Utah would be amenable to setting aside what was just accomplished \nhere so that the minority leader could go ahead with the amendment that \nwe have prepared?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. We will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, further inquiry, can we have copies of \nthe amendments?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized to speak for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

There had been a deal struck by some parties on Thursday \nnight, and it was coming over to the Senate from the House Friday \nmorning around 10. It was about 120 pages long. We had not had an \nopportunity to examine it. There were some I think who wanted to just \nvoice vote it. But at a minimum, we wanted an opportunity to propose \nseveral amendments and to have debate on each of them.\n  Madam President, the position that I took then and I think Senator \nMoseley-Braun took as well--she certainly can speak for herself--is \nthat when it comes to major spending bills, \n\n[[Page S 9739]]\nI have always said we should have recorded votes. That is critically \nimportant. We should not have voice votes on large spending bills that \nare this crucial. By the same token, when you have a bill with $16 \nbillion in spending cuts, and there are changes made from what we had \npassed in the Senate, changes made at the last second--then clearly it \nis important to talk about those changes, to talk about the priorities \nreflected in these cuts, what kind of programs are going to be cut, how \nthey are going to affect people in the country and what the \nalternatives are.\n  So we talked some about our amendments. I focused on the Low-Income \nEnergy Assistance Program. I will not take a long time on that right \nnow. I spoke about that at some length on Friday. I talked about a very \nimportant Medicare Counseling program for senior citizens to make sure \nthey do not get ripped off. And all too often that happens by insurance \ncompanies on supplementary coverage to Medicare. I talked about an \nimportant job training program for homeless vets, and other job \ntraining funds for dislocated workers. And Senator Moseley-Braun talked \nabout school infrastructure and all the problems that go with the lack \nof investment in schools and lack of investment in children.\n  As it turns out late Thursday night some of the funding we had \nrestored in the Senate was then cut again. This was a deal that we did \nnot think was such a good deal. What we said was that we at least ought \nto have the right to propose amendments, have debate and have those \nvoted up or down.\n  Madam President, at the end of this debate on Friday the majority \nleader pulled the bill from the floor, and said that it would not come \nback up except under a unanimous-consent agreement but certainly with \nno amendments. We are talking about a $16 billion spending bill, and he \nwas insisting on no amendments. I sure think there is enough time for a \nfew amendments. We made it very clear yesterday that we would agree to \nthe four amendments. I have three amendments. Senator Moseley-Braun had \none amendment. I think we were going to limit the debate to 1 hour on \neach amendment, equally divided, and we would stack votes for the next \nday. And I think we would have 40 minutes for summary of each amendment \nbefore votes, 10 minutes for each one. I was surprised that proposal \nhas been turned down, because I thought it was eminently reasonable.\n  I must say to you, Madam President, that it seems to me that there \nmust be something more at stake here. I do not understand what the \nmajority leader is worried about. I mean I suspect that he would have \nthe votes to defeat these amendments, though I do not think these \namendments should be defeated. Certainly, this is all about the whole \nquestion of the way the legislative process works.\n  Madam President, I quote from a piece today in the New York Times \nabout what is going on in the House:\n\n       Draconian cuts; Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n     Resources yesterday did their work . . . eliminating jobs \n     programs, programs in the Department of Energy like the Low-\n     Income Energy Assistance, Head Start, Safe and Drug-Free \n     Schools, assistance for the homeless, enforcement of \n     environmental laws, job training programs for summer youth.\n\n  Madam President, in our amendments these are the very priorities we \nwant to call into question. I believe that this rescissions bill was \njust a glimpse of what is to come. These are truly distorted \npriorities.\n  And what is especially troubling is that there are alternatives to \ncutting these high-priority programs. For example, we do not see \nrescissions in any of the wasteful spending within the Pentagon. We \nwanted to transfer a little money out of the travel and administrative \nbudget of the Pentagon; over 60 percent of all the Federal Government's \ntravel and administrative funds is in this one agency; billions and \nbillions of dollars, to make sure people do not go cold in the winter; \nto make sure there is some support for dislocated workers. We wanted to \nat least attempt to restore funding for that, offsetting the cuts with \ncuts elsewhere. The dislocated worker funding is also key to many \nAmericans. For example, we see bases being closed throughout the \ncountry. We see people losing their jobs. And we are not going to \nprovide people the opportunity to have retraining and find other work? \nWe are unwilling to provide a little bit of a support for elderly \npeople by way of consumer protection when they purchase health care \npolicies? We are not interested in any support for homeless vets when \nit comes to some job training or cutting that? But when it comes to \nsubsidies for oil companies, coal companies, tobacco companies, that is \nnot on the table. When it comes to looking at some of the waste within \nthe Pentagon and transferring some of that funding to some of these \nprograms, that is not on the table.\n  Madam President, let me be very clear about it. Our proposal was \neminently reasonable.\n  We wanted to have some debate on key parts of this bill, which makes \n$16 billion worth of cuts in Federal spending. We agreed to some time \nfor each amendment. It was limited time. We wanted to talk about the \npriorities of these cuts, and propose some alternatives. My \nunderstanding is that the majority leader has now dismissed even that.\n  Madam President, I do not think four amendments, a total of about 4 \nhours, is too much time to spend in the legislative process on a $16 \nbillion rescissions bill. I do not think democracy works well when we \nshut off this debate and discussion. I do not think people in the \ncountry really know what we are doing when we shut off this debate and \ndiscussion. Frankly, I think that is the issue.\n  I am determined, given the reasonableness of our proposal, that we \nwill have an opportunity to have these amendments considered, and we \nwill have debate, within limits, and people will vote up or down, and \npeople in the country will know that we are cutting funds for job \ntraining for dislocated workers, low-income energy assistance, \ncounseling programs for older people about consumer protection to make \nsure they do not get ripped off when they purchase health care \ncoverage, job training for homeless vets, and basic repair of schools \nfor kids.\n  That is what we are doing. And now look at what the House \nAppropriations Committee is doing. This rescissions bill is just a \nglimpse of the distorted priorities that are now being put into effect \nin this Congress. Americans do not want to see their fellow citizens \nwho have been laid off because of retrenchment or because of base \nclosures without an opportunity to have job retraining. They do not \nwant to see low-income people going cold in cold-weather States. They \ndo not want to see senior citizens without consumer protections. They \ndo not want to see homeless vets without some support. They do not want \nto see kids without some opportunities, learning in decent schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And I think the majority leader may be worried about \nthat. So I am ready for the debate on these amendments, and I hope we \nwill be able to work out some agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9738-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9739-S9770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I just want to make a few opening \ncomments on this bill before the Senate. It is a very important bill. I \nconsider it one of the most important bills in the last 60 years. It is \ngoing to make a difference as to whether or not we are going to be \nregulated to death or whether regulators are going to have to meet \ncertain standards and norms of common sense before they overregulate \nus, or should I say before they regulate us properly.\n  This bill would force them to have to do what is right. It will also \nforce Congress to be a little more specific in its legislation so that \nwe do not always have to rely on regulations. It will make the system \nmore honest.\n  This bill is about common sense, and I think most Americans would \nagree that the Federal Government is out of control in terms of the \nburdens it places on them. A lot of people in this country believe \nthat. We know that the \n\n[[Page S 9740]]\ncost of regulations is eating us alive. It is between $6,000 and \n$10,000 per family in this country.\n  Now, many of them are essential. We acknowledge that. This bill will \nprotect the essential regulations. And that is as it should be. We also \nknow that some of these regulations are restrictive of freedom, some of \nthem are taking properties away from people, some of them are just \nplain, downright offensive, and some of them are stupid.\n  In that regard, let me give my top 10 list of silly regulations--this \nis my fourth top 10 list of silly regulations --just to kind of bring \nhome to everybody how utterly ridiculous some of the interpretations of \nregulations and the regulations themselves are in this country.\n  No. 10. Fining a man $10,000 because he filled out his tax forms with \na 10-pitch typewriter instead of a 12-pitch typewriter. That is \nridiculous. But that is what happened.\n  No. 9. Medicare will pay for a pacemaker but will not pay for a \nnewer, smaller version of the pacemaker that actually would be less \nexpensive because that specific version has not been approved by the \nFDA, even though it has been in clinical trials. It is ridiculous. And \nthe old procedure costs a lot more compared to the new one.\n  No. 8. Fining a company $5,000 for accidentally placing the answer to \nline 17 on line 18 in an Environmental Protection Agency form. Now, who \nwould not be upset with that type of ridiculous assessment by the \nregulators?\n  No. 7. Prosecuting a rancher for ``redirecting streams'' when he has \ncleared scrub brush removed from his irrigation ditches. The ditches \nhave been in use since the beginning of the century, and they have \ncleaned them all the time. But they prosecuted him for ``redirecting \nthe streams.'' Utterly ridiculous.\n  No. 6. Spending nearly $3 million to protect the habitat of the \nendangered dusty seaside sparrow and then managing the land poorly, \nthus allowing this sacred bird to become extinct. Spend $3 million, \nwreck the land, and the bird becomes extinct anyway. Ridiculous.\n  No. 5. A wrecking company's owner was convicted of a felony and \nsentenced to 3 years in jail. What was his crime? His crime was failing \nto inform bureaucrats that when his company demolished a building, a \ntotal of one single pound of asbestos was released into the atmosphere. \nThree years in jail. That is more than ridiculous.\n  No. 4 on this top 10 list of silly regulations for today: Requiring a \nfarmer to suspend all economic activity on 1,000 acres of land because \none red-cockaded woodpecker was found. I do not know about you, but my \ngoodness gracious, it is time to put an end to this type of silly \nregulation.\n  No. 3 on the list of the silliest regulations, on our top 10 list for \ntoday, fining a business $250 for failing to report that no employee \nhas been injured in the preceding year.\n  No. 2. Withholding approval of a medical waste container for almost a \nyear only to determine that the product did not need FDA review. \nRidiculous.\n  Let us look at No. 1 on our list of 10 silly regulations.\n  No. 1. The FDA took 7 years to approve a medical device which helped \npremature newborn infants breathe. It then made the company withdraw \nthe product from over 250 hospitals because the agency found \ninadequacies in the company's documentation of its manufacturing \npractices. None of this documentation affected the safety of the \nproduct. Physicians later verified that children who could not get this \nproduct died.\n  Now, unfortunately, because of silly regulations, thousands of people \nare dying in this country, and many, many more people are being \noppressed and mistreated in this country.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is being suffocated under a mountain of \nred-tape. Unnecessary, inefficient, and wasteful regulation stifles \nbusiness, slows the economy, and costs our fellow Americans their jobs. \nIt has gotten to the point where the words Americans fear most are, ``I \nam from the Government and I am here to help you.'' Amazingly enough, \nthere are still those who attempt to argue that the Federal bureaucracy \nis just fine. They are satisfied with the status quo. We are not.\n  Overregulation is often just plain ludicrous. We have had some fun \ndescribing some of the goofy rules that the Feds think we just have to \nhave. But the fact is these regulations are frequently not funny at \nall. They hurt people. They cause deaths--the very people they are \nostensibly supposed to be helping.\n  For example, the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem struggled for 4 \nyears to get approval for a Head Start program in a newly renovated \nbuilding. Most of the time was spent arguing with the bureaucrats about \nthe dimensions of rooms that did not satisfy the guidelines. ``An \nentire generation of Head Starters missed the facility,'' said Kathy \nPhillips from the church. ``The people in Washington want to tell you \nthis or that can't be done. I told them, `I know you're talking about \nfive pieces of paper, but we're talking about children.''' When \nregulations hurt children, it is time to change the regulations.\n  In another case, an OSHA inspector noted that a worker wearing a dust \nmask had a beard, violating a rule that requires a close fit between \nface and mask. The dust was not heavy or of hazardous content, and even \nwhen used over a beard, the mask filtered out most of what there was. \nBut the rule was clear and, like most rules, did not distinguish among \ndiffering situations. Nor did it matter that the worker was Amish. \nGiven a choice between abrogating his religious beliefs or quitting his \njob, this Amish worker quit his job. Thus, in seeking to protect a \nworker, OSHA really cost him his job. Now, that is ridiculous.\n  The rigid nature of regulations is evident in the example of Tony \nBenjamin, the father of eight, who after reading about lead poisoning \nmade a mistake to look to the Government for help. He had his children \ntested and found the youngest had lead levels almost at the danger \nthreshold. He got a lead detection kit and, as is common in old houses, \nfound lead beneath the surface of his walls. The State official said \nnot to worry because Mr. Benjamin had recently painted over the old \ncoat.\n  But the child's test results had been filed with the city health \ndepartment. One day, unannounced, the city inspectors arrived and \nstamped the word ``violation'' in red ink on every nick in his paint, \nand after finding 17 nicks, declared his home a health hazard. Mr. \nBenjamin was told to move his family out of their home and strip and \nrepaint it in large sections. If he failed to comply immediately, he \nwas told, he could be fined over $8,000. Mr. Benjamin could not afford \nto do what the inspectors demanded. Certainly he could not vacate his \nhome with his eight children. Where could they go? Meanwhile, the \nyoungest child's lead level dropped well below the level considered \ndangerous, but the law still required abatement, clearly without \nexception. When a family can be thrown out of their own home without \ngood reason, no one can tell me that this system is working.\n  Another situation involves a man who tried to defend himself against \na grizzly bear. Bears had eaten about $1,200 of the man's sheep in one \nsummer. However, the grizzly bear was listed as endangered, and he \ncould do nothing. One night he heard bears attacking. And in his \nfrustration, he came out of his house with a rifle and shot at the \nbears. Then another bear he had not seen moved to attack him so he shot \nit. The next day he went out to look for the dead bear. Instead he \nfound it was very much alive as it started to charge him again. He shot \nit in self-defense, killing it. As a punishment for defending himself \nhe was fined $4,000 for ``taking'' the bear which had attacked him.\n  Regulations also impose burdensome costs on hard-working people, \nburdens that make survival almost impossible. In one case an auto parts \nstoreowner failed to display a sign indicating that his store accepts \nwaste motor oil for recycling. For his crime, he faces a $10,000 fine \nand a 1-year prison term. The owner said that the sign was down because \nthe windows were being washed. Well, think about it for a minute. You \nown a business. You are up against a fine of 10 grand and a year in \njail for failing to post a sign for 1 day while you are washing the \nwindows. What is wrong with this picture?\n  What is happening to us in America? Convicted, violent criminals, \nmurderers and rapists are getting out of prison through the revolving \ndoor in \n\n[[Page S 9741]]\nour justice system, yet a regular guy, who happens to be cleaning his \nwindow, is treated like a criminal. I say to my colleagues that if we \nallow this kind of distorted societal value system to continue, our \nnegligence as holders of the public trust far exceeds anything this \nbusiness owner could be cited for.\n  Other times the immense mountain of paperwork buries business alive. \nI spoke earlier about Mr. Dutch Noteboom, age 72. He has owned a small \nmeatpacking plant in Springfield, OR, for 33 years. The USDA has one \nfull-time inspector on the premises, one full-time inspector, and \nanother spends over half of his time there. The level of regulatory \nattention is somewhat surprising since Mr. Noteboom has only four \nemployees. But the rules require there be at least one inspector \nwherever livestock is slaughtered.\n  Mr. Noteboom said, ``I am swimming in paperwork, but I don't even \nknow a tenth of the rules--you should see all these USDA manuals.'' \nNow, do we really need an inspector for every two employees?\n  These silly regulations could even stop well-meaning Government \nemployees from being able to exercise common sense. In the late 1980's, \nDr. Michael McGuire, a senior research scientist at UCLA found himself \nin trouble. His lab, which sits on 5 acres, is funded by the Veterans \nAdministration. Its lawn needs to be cut. When the lawnmower broke, Dr. \nMcGuire decided to go out and buy another one. He filled out no forms \nand got no approvals. During a routine audit, the auditor asked why the \nlawnmower was different. Dr. McGuire told the truth, and thus launched \nan investigation that resulted in several meetings with high-level \nFederal officials. ``I couldn't understand,'' Dr. McGuire notes, ``why \nimportant agency officials would spend their time this way.'' No \nkidding. I do not understand it either.\n  Finally, after months, they rendered their findings. They could find \nno malice, but they determined Dr. McGuire to be ignorant of proper \nprocedures. He received an official reprimand and was admonished to \nstudy VA procedures about the size of an encyclopedia.\n  Oh, one more fact about this case. Dr. McGuire bought the lab's \nlawnmower with his own money. Now, can anyone believe that this is a \nuseful and productive way to spend taxpayer money--to find fault with \nDr. McGuire who did it on his own with his own money to help keep the \nlawn cut?\n  Well, Mr. President, I want to emphasize that the cost of regulation \nis not limited to a few unfortunate individuals. These examples of \nbureaucratic abuse, of mismanagement add up to a staggering cost for \nall Americans. The Americans for Tax Reform Foundation estimates that \nthe average American works until May 5 just to pay their taxes. \nHowever, when the hidden costs of Government, the regulatory costs, are \nadded in, it is not until July 10 that the people even start to earn \nmoney for themselves.\n  So we are working from January 1 to July 10 to even make a dime for \nourselves. Monday was July 10, Mr. President. Until this week started, \nthis very week, every single day that an average American had spent at \nwork so far this year has been to pay for their Government. It was only \nthis morning that they could expect to keep one penny of what they \nearned. Such a tremendous drain on hard-working Americans cannot be \njustified when the money is being spent on some of these ridiculous \nregulations I have mentioned today. They are just a few of literally \nthe thousands and hundreds of thousands of them that are ridiculous and \ndo not work.\n  This bill will eliminate the wasteful, absurd, and harmful \nregulations while keeping those that truly protect America. Those \nregulations that contribute to the greater good will not be affected by \nthis bill. This bill will not summarily overturn environmental laws, \nantidiscrimination laws, or health and safety laws. Such allegations \nare pure hogwash.\n  But as we have noted from these few examples, the true worth of many \nrules should seriously be questioned. That is what this bill does. It \nrequires the Federal Government to justify the rules and regulations \nthey expect us to live by. And, in my book, that is not too much to \nask. So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation. \nAnd I appreciate being able to just make this short set of \nillustrations as to why this legislation is so important here today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have had some discussion on both sides \nof the aisle on various issues. The minority leader would like to call \nup his amendment. We were first thinking in terms of setting aside \nthese amendments that I have called up on behalf of Senator Roth. But \nthe way we will approach it is this way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we withdraw those amendments and that \nthe yeas and nays that have been ordered be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 1498, 1499, 1500, and 1501) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I understand it, the parliamentary \nsituation is that the bill is now open for amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the minority leader.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1502 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n(Purpose: To protect public health by ensuring timely completion of the \n U.S. Department of Agriculture's rulemaking on ``Pathogen Reduction: \nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems'' (proposed \n           rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 6774, et al., February 3, 1995)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah for his cooperation and the accommodation he has shown us in \naccommodating the interests of all concerned here.\n  I call up an amendment that is at the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1502 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 5, strike out ``or''.\n       One page 19, line 7, strike out the period and insert in \n     lieu thereof a semicolon and ``or''.\n       On page 19, add after line 7 the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(xiii) the rule proposed by the United States Department \n     of Agriculture on February 3, 1995, entitled ``Pathogen \n     Reduction: Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) \n     Systems'' (proposed rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 6774, et al.).''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the amendment that we have just offered \nhas one specific purpose, and that is to protect the ability of the \nDepartment of Agriculture to issue its proposed rule requiring science-\nbased hazard analysis and critical control point, or HACCP, systems in \nmeat and poultry inspections. The rule is critical, for it will improve \nthe quality of our Nation's food supply and help prevent a repeat of \nthe E. coli bacterial contamination. But it is not just E. coli; it is \nsalmonella, it is listeria, it is a number of other foodborne illnesses \nthat as a result of recent experience has clearly demonstrated the need \nfor a new system.\n  Last year, 2-year-old Cullen Mack, of my home State of South Dakota, \nfell ill from eating beef contaminated with E. coli bacteria. As a \nresult of experiences like Cullen's, I held a number of hearings in the \nAgriculture Committee on the tragic 1993 outbreak of E. coli.\n  I held numerous follow-up hearings in which industry, producers and \nconsumers all repeatedly called for improving and modernizing the meat \nand poultry inspection systems. Later, the Department of Agriculture \ndeveloped regulations to address recurrences of this problem. The rules \nwould modernize the meat inspection process using sensitive scientific \ntechniques to detect contamination and prevent spoiled \n\n[[Page S 9742]]\nmeat from making its way into our food supply.\n  Not only would the public benefit from tough new meat inspection \nrules, but so would farmers and ranchers who raise the livestock and \nrely on the assurances that their products will reach the market in the \nbest condition possible. Consumers and agricultural producers should \nnot be asked to delay these essential reforms--reforms the entire \nagricultural and consumer community have been calling for for several \nyears.\n  Unfortunately, this bill, even with the Dole amendment adopted \nyesterday, could lead to unacceptable delays in the issuance and \nimplementation of this rule.\n  The problem is really very simple, Mr. President. In an attempt to \nreform the regulatory process, the bill overreaches and provides \nnumerous opportunities to those who would seek to delay the rule, \nprevent it from being issued, or attempt its repeal. Such a result is, \nfrankly, unacceptable and, I believe, would lead to the long-term \ndetriment to the American people and American agriculture.\n  Yesterday, we debated the Dole amendment, which purported to address \nthe problem. Unfortunately, it did little in that regard. It simply \nestablishes a 180-day grace period for the regulation, at which point \nthe agency must still comply with all of the provisions of the bill. It \nsays for 180 days the effects of this legislation will not be addressed \nas it relates to the regulations. But after that, everything the bill \ncalls for is every bit as much in effect as it would have been had the \n180-day period not been in existence at all. It delays it for 6 months. \nIt does not exempt the rule from the many requirements of the bill. \nAnd, as a result, that delay is really no fix at all.\n  So merely delaying compliance of the burdensome processes of the \nbill, which ultimately must be met anyway, is no solution. Moreover, \nonce the rule is promulgated, the petition and judicial review \nprocesses would still apply. Therefore, the rule will be susceptible to \nthe extensive challenges available through the petition processes and \nthrough litigation. All of this for a rule that has already gone \nthrough the lengthy rulemaking process, and for a rule that is so \nessential to protecting public health.\n  In short, Mr. President, a 180-day delay does not solve the problem.\n  In addition to these concerns are those that Secretary Glickman \noutlined in his letter of July 11. In that letter, Secretary Glickman \nvoiced strong opposition to S. 343 because it would unnecessarily delay \nUSDA's food safety reform, among many other things.\n  The letter explains the Secretary's view that the peer review \nrequirement in S. 343 will delay USDA's food safety reform by at least \n6 months.\n  As I read Secretary Glickman's letter, he is concerned that the bill, \nas amended by the Dole amendment, requires that risk assessments \nunderlying both proposed and final regulations be peer reviewed prior \nto becoming final. In other words, before USDA can issue a final \nregulation reforming our meat and poultry inspection systems--a \nregulation that has been in the works now for more than 2 years and is \nbased on more than 10 years of science-based reform efforts--the bill \nwould require that the rule go through a lengthy review by scientists \nbefore it could be issued in its final form.\n  According to the Secretary, this peer review requirement would \nresult, as I said, in a 6-month delay in this essential food safety \nreform.\n  My good friend and colleague, Senator Johnston, has stated that he \nbelieves there are exemptions in the bill to deal with the peer review \nissue. It is my understanding from reviewing the bill and from \ndiscussing the matter with others that it is unclear whether USDA's E. \ncoli rule, the HACCP rule, would fit the exemption and whether it \nwould, therefore, avoid the delays associated with the peer review \nprocess.\n  Like any legal ambiguity, this provision invites litigation and \nshould be corrected here on the floor before the bill becomes law.\n  If it is the intent of the authors of this legislation to exempt the \nE. coli regulation from delay caused by the peer review process--and \nfrom the other onerous processes in the bill--then they should simply \nvote for my amendment. My amendment would solve all of these problems \nby simply stating that the E. coli recall, the HACCP rule, cannot be \nconsidered a major rule for the purposes of this bill. It ensures that \nthe bill cannot be used to delay this important rule.\n  The Department of Agriculture has already gone through a great deal \nto develop this regulation. USDA published the proposed rule in \nFebruary of this year with a 120-day comment period. USDA also extended \nthe comment period at the request of a large number of commenters.\n  Given this extensive comment period, if USDA suddenly declared an \nemergency exemption to avoid the peer review delay, it would simply be \nopening itself up to certain litigation, and even greater delay.\n  I also note that USDA attempted to publish emergency food safety \nregulations a couple of years ago. To provide consumers with \ninformation on how to avoid food-borne illness from pathogens like E. \ncoli and salmonella, USDA issued emergency regulations requiring safe \nhandling labels on meat and poultry products. These safe handling \nregulations were issued without notice or comment. USDA was sued and \nlost and had to go through the rulemaking process before the labels \ncould even be required. The result, then, of that ``emergency'' \nprovision was delay.\n  Mr. President, all we are seeking here is some common sense, some \nbalance, some way in which to ensure that we can accomplish the goals \nset out in the bill, but to do so with a recognition that there is a \nsensitivity to many of the rules that are currently about to go into \neffect, rules that directly affect the public health and safety of \nmillions of Americans, that ought not to be encumbered, that ought not \nto be thwarted in any way, as we go through what we consider to be \nreform in rulemaking overall.\n  The Secretary felt so strongly about this issue, Mr. President, that \nhe has issued yet a second letter that I would like to read into the \nRecord. It was submitted by James Gilliland, general counsel at the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and was addressed to me. It simply states:\n\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing relative to the \n     amendment Majority Leader Dole offered to S. 343 on the floor \n     of the Senate yesterday. The amendment, which was adopted by \n     a unanimous vote of the Senate, added ``food safety threat'' \n     to the emergency exemption in the cost-benefit analysis \n     subchapter of S. 343.\n       I appreciate the Majority Leader's efforts to ensure that \n     the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) efforts to reform the \n     federal meat and poultry inspection system are not delayed by \n     S. 343. However, the amendment does not provide an emergency \n     exemption for the Department's food safety reform proposal \n     and will not alleviate the delay that S. 343, in its current \n     form, would have on the Department's efforts.\n\n  So, Mr. President, here again, we have it from the Secretary of \nAgriculture, from the Department of Agriculture, simply asking us to \nconsider the consequences of what this bill could do to a process for \nmeat inspection that has been under way, under consideration, proposed \nnow for over 24 months. It would stop in its tracks the efforts made by \ntwo administrations, really, to put all of the science and the new \nknowledge and the processes that we have to make food inspection more \nmeaningful and more effective into place. We do not want to do that. I \ndo not believe anybody in the Senate wants to encumber the Secretary's \nefforts to ensure that meat safety can be provided to an even greater \nextent than it has been in the past.\n  My amendment will ensure that the Secretary has the latitude to \nprovide for the culmination of this long effort and in a successful \nway, in a way that we all want. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, the very distinguished leader of the Democratic \nParty in this body, has to say about bringing common sense and some \nsensibility to regulation. I do not want to speak just to his \namendment. But I think the points he is trying to make are the very \nbasis for the legislation before us.\n  Although I might disagree with his amendment or whether it is needed, \nI want to give an example, as I have been trying to do each of the last \n2 days, of \n\n[[Page S 9743]]\ninstances in which regulations have had a very negative impact in my \nState, a very unfair impact on certain individuals--individuals and \nsmall businesses, people that cannot afford to pay the legal fees to \nfight the harassment they get from Government bureaucrats, or where \nthere is a misapplication of regulation, or where there is what I am \ngoing to mention today, disputes between Government agencies.\n  It is one thing to have a very egregious regulation that may be \njustified making an impact negatively upon what an individual might \nwant or might not want to do. But it is quite another thing to have one \nGovernment agency say you can do something and another Government \nagency come along and say you cannot do it, and then not even be able \nto get a resolution to the dispute between the two agencies. And then \nwhat is even worse--in the case I want to recite for you--is that there \nare four Government agencies that have four different definitions of \nwhat a wetland is, and then you are negatively impacted.\n  Some say you can go ahead and do something, and another Government \nagency comes along and says ``No, we are going to fine you for what you \ndid,'' and you cannot make use of your land.\n  Then it is really quite perplexing for the farmer who moved ahead on \nthe basis of two Government agencies saying he could do something, and \nthen after a third and a fourth Government agency said he could not do \nit, one of the first two Government agencies that said he could do it \nchanged their mind and said he could not do it.\n  Now, when I say we ought to have common sense brought to regulation \nwriting and in the enforcement of regulation, the very least that a \ncitizen ought to be able to expect out of his Government is to get an \nanswer and to get a resolution of a problem, and to get a quick \nresolution of the problem.\n  Persons ought to expect in the first place they would not have two \nGovernment agencies, one saying you could do something and one saying \nyou could not do it. Or you would at least think if that is the way it \nis, those two Government agencies ought to get together and say ``Yes, \nyou can do it,'' or, ``No, you cannot do it.''\n  We have such a morass of regulation and we have so much conflicting \nregulation that we actually have citizens of the United States that \ncannot get a resolution, cannot get agreement among Government \nagencies, and then it is even difficult to get an answer to your \nproblem when you spend a lot of money on legal fees and appeals.\n  Now, that is the regulatory state on a rampage that is looking out \nfor its own interest and not the interest of the citizens that it is \nimpacting.\n  There is not common sense in a lot of regulation writing, and we, in \nrural America, have found really a lack of common sense when it comes \nto Government regulation of wetlands.\n  I want to highlight another case in my State that illustrates this. \nRemember, yesterday, I spoke about the country cooperative elevators \nthat are impacted from the air quality standards of EPA, where they \nwant to regulate what only occurs about 30 days out of a year as if it \nwere happening 365 days, 24 hours a day, and costing these small \ncooperative businesses up to $40,000 to fill out a 280-page form that \nonce they get it filled out only 1 percent of the elevators in my State \nare going to be impacted by the regulation in the first place.\n  The day before, I spoke about how EPA caused a small business in my \nState--the costs of legal fees and lost business $200,000--to defend \nhimself against a criminal charge that was brought by EPA, by a paid \ninformant who was a disgruntled former employee, and there was not any \ncase there. Misinformation.\n  They came on this businessperson, a quiet morning at 9 o'clock in the \nmorning, with their shotguns cocked, wearing bulletproof vests, \nsticking the gun in the face of the owner and in the face of the \naccountant, all on misinformation, and costing the business $200,000.\n  Now, that is what is wrong with regulation. There are people in this \nbody that want Government regulation and they do not care about the \nadverse impacts upon the small businesses of America and the farmers of \nAmerica from adverse regulation.\n  This bill before the Senate is to bring common sense to this \nprocess--nothing more, nothing less.\n  In the instance I want to recite this morning, it all started in \nApril 1989. A young family purchased a 284-acre farm in Mahaska County, \nIA. I presume from the description of how this problem evolved, this \nwas probably not a very expensive farm. It was probably a farm that \nonly a young person could afford to purchase. Remember, in my State, \nless than 5 percent of the farmers are under 30 years of age. We lost a \nwhole generation of farmers because of the agriculture depression in \nthe 1980's. The average age of the farmer in my State is 61 years of \nage.\n  Do we want young farmers to start farming? Do we want them to start \nthis business where they will produce for the consumer of America the \ncheapest food of any consumer in the world, because we city slickers \nonly spend 8 percent of disposable income on food? There is no other \nconsumer anywhere in the world that has that cheap of a buy or that \nquality of a buy. Or do we want corporate farming to take over America, \nwhere there are no young farmers who have the ability to get started?\n  We have a harassment by a Government agency here that I am going to \ngive an example of that is an impediment to young people getting into \nfarming, because this farm was in a state of disrepair. That is why it \nwas cheaper for this person to buy.\n  The drainage system needed improvement. There was a stand of timber \noccupying part of the land. He wanted to make some improvements once he \npurchased it. He did the right thing. Before messing with Government \nregulation, because we really cannot understand Government regulation, \ngo to some friends at the Soil Conservation Service and check with \nthem, because for 60 years, the Soil Conservation Service provided \ntechnical help to the farmer. The farmer considered the employees of \nthe Soil Conservation Service to be people that would level with or \nhelp you.\n  Now, of course, these employees of the Soil Conservation Service are \nseen as regulators. Farmers do not want them on their farm. You do not \ngo to their office to ask questions any more because some Federal \nregulator is going to come down on you if there is some suspicion that \nyou might do something that was wrong. Yet we have reduced dramatically \nthe amount of soil erosion in America because of the cooperation \nbetween the family farmer and the Soil Conservation personnel.\n  Even in 1989, this farmer did the right thing, because he does not \nwant to do something to his land and have the Government regulator come \nin and say ``You did this and should not have done it.'' So he did the \nright thing and checked with them ahead of time before making the \nnecessary improvements to his drainage system and before clearing some \nof the trees. He checked with the Soil Conservation Service. The \npersonnel at the SCS authorized his plans.\n  Also, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the State agency \nwhich issues farmers flood planning permits, also authorized what he \nwanted to do.\n  With the blessing of two Government agencies representing both State \nand Federal governments, this young farmer cleared trees and improved \nthe drainage on his new farm.\n  However, in just a few months, October 1989, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, a Federal agency, visited the farm. They discovered and \nalleged that a wetland had been filled without a permit. A follow-up \nletter by the Corps directed the farmer to obtain an after-the-fact \npermit or be fined up to $25,000 per day. Mr. President, $25,000 per \nday--that is what the average farmer lives on in Iowa for a whole year.\n  A short time later, the Fish and Wildlife Service visited the farm \nand determined that more than 100 acres of wetlands had been impacted. \nNow, of course, this farmer was shocked to discover wetlands on his \notherwise dry farm, especially since the Soil Conservation Service had \nalready approved his actions.\n  The farmer agreed to a wetlands delineation by the corps. The corps \nused what is now not used by the corps, a 1989 wetlands manual, and \naccording to this manual, you had to have water within 4 feet of the \nground surface for it to be classified as a wetlands.\n And at no time has there been water at that \n\n[[Page S 9744]]\nlevel. However, they did find, under another provision of the wetlands \ndelineation, the presence of hydric soils, and so they declared 95 \npercent of the farm wetland.\n\n  Since the farmer thought this conclusion was absurd, he decided to \nappeal to the Soil Conservation Service, another Federal agency, \nbecause of that agency's long history of working with farmers and \nbecause they said he could go ahead and make these improvements.\n  Now, this is what is really frustrating to the farmer. This time \naround, when he went back to the SCS office, he found that the SCS \noffice was more interested in cooperating with the Corps of Engineers \nthan they were with the farmer. Even though they originally said that \nhe could clear the land and improve the drainage system. This time the \nSCS was not the friend of the farmer. They found his 284-acre farm had \n150 acres of wetlands. This determination was made in the face of \ncompelling evidence to the contrary.\n  An extensive engineering study on the farm shows that normal flooding \nfails to inundate the farm for the 7 days required under the 1989 \nmanual--which manual is no longer used. Furthermore, evidence from 23 \nmonitoring holes showed that the water depth on the farm is normally 4 \nto 5 feet and not the 7 days on the surface that you must have under \nthat manual to have a wetlands delineation.\n  So the farmer used this evidence from this extensive engineering \nstudy to appeal, then, to the Soil Conservation Service State office. \nAlthough the regulations required the Soil Conservation Service to \nrespond to an appeal request within 15 days, they took more than 150 \ndays to respond.\n  You know, 150 days is a whole cropping season on Iowa farmland--a \ngrowing season. They cannot even respond in the 15 days. Then you \nwonder why we need a regulatory reform act? It ought to be very obvious \nwhy we need one.\n  Now, surprisingly, when the SCS, the Soil Conservation Service, did \nrespond, do you know what they said? They said they did not have enough \ninformation to make a decision. But the Soil Conservation Service had \nenough evidence to agree with the Corps of Engineers that 150 acres of \nthis 284-acre farm had wetlands on it--after, months before, they said \nyou can go ahead and make these improvements. They said they did not \nhave any information, after both the Corps and the SCS had already made \ndeterminations of wetlands based on the exact same information.\n  Based on this case, it seems to me it is very easy to understand why \nthe American public has become cynical about its Government. All people \nwant for the high taxes they pay in this country, plus all the money we \nborrow--saddling the next generation of children and grandchildren with \na big cost--they may not like the Government they get, and they are not \ngetting what they are paying for, but they would at least like to see \ntheir Government work. Instead, what we have is a bureaucracy \ncharacterized by overlapping jurisdictions, where one official can \nauthorize an action that another will condemn you for later.\n  There is also a lack of flexibility and common sense in interpreting \nand enforcing regulations. The average citizen can find himself subject \nto the whims of a powerful yet irrational Federal bureaucracy. During \nthe last 2 years this young Mahaska County farmer I am referring to \nhere has spent his own time and money attending countless numbers of \nmeetings, hearings and appeals. His farm has been visited by Government \nofficials on 7 different occasions. And he still does not have an \nanswer. This all started in 1989 and here it is 1995. He spent \nthousands of dollars defending himself against Federal regulators, and \nthe U.S. Government has spend thousands of taxpayers' dollars to \ndeprive this farmer of the economic use of his property, yet this case \nremains unresolved.\n  The consequences are severe for this young farmer. He was deprived of \ndisaster assistance during the floods of 1993, and is not eligible for \nFederal crop insurance. So the Government is depriving this farmer of \nbenefits, even though a final resolution of his case has not been \ndecided, and apparently this young man, then, is presumed guilty under \nthese other Federal programs, until he proves himself innocent.\n  This type of overreaching by the bureaucracy must stop. S. 343 will \nforce agencies to more carefully promulgate regulations, paying \nattention to the costs and benefits of their actions. Maybe this \nexample will help us put in perspective the need for the cost and \nbenefit analysis that is in this legislation.\n  This Government regulation has tremendous costs for this young farmer \nthat I just referred to. There is nothing wrong with a Government \nagency, if it is going to have a Government policy, to make sure that \nthe costs of that policy are not greater than the benefits. Or, under \nthis legislation, if there is a determination that the cost is still \ngreater than the benefit, at least you ought to choose the least costly \nmethod of accomplishing our goals. So, maybe this will cause these \nagencies to hesitate and contemplate, before they move ahead and \ninfringe on the rights of our citizens. Hopefully, S. 343 will force \nthese agencies to use more common sense in the future, and avoid \nsituations like the one experienced by the young farmer in Mahaska \nCounty.\n  If the Corps of Engineers, if the Fish and Wildlife Service, if the \nSoil Conservation Service, and if the Iowa Department of Natural \nResources want to show that they are concerned about the impact their \nregulations have, if they want to show the public that Government \nworks, if they want to show the public that Government is good, if they \nwant to show the public that Government is responsible, if they want to \nshow the public that Government is cost effective, if they want to show \nthe people that Government is humane, it is very easy to do. Just help \nthis young farmer in Mahaska County, IA, to get a resolution to his \nproblem.\n  Do you know what we think? We think the reason he is not getting his \nappeals decided is because he is right and the Government is wrong and \nthey do not want to issue an OK to this guy, that he was deprived of \nsomething, because it would set a precedent.\n  A politician who does not admit he is wrong is destined to a rude \nawakening someday. And regulators that fails to admit they are wrong \nare subject to a rude awakening someday as well.\n  I hope that we have an opportunity through this legislation to give \njustice to our young farmers of America and justice to all young \nAmericans.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the minority leader. I have stated several times in the Chamber the \nimportance of regulatory reform and the importance of the legislation \nthat we are considering here. I know it does not get all the inches in \nthe newspaper and all the TV time because it is bland, dry, arcane, all \nthe words you can put together to make it uninteresting. Yet I would \nsay this. I think this is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation--it affects more Americans directly--than any legislation \nwe will take up this year except for probably the appropriations bills.\n  The rules and regulations that are put out pursuant to the laws that \nwe pass here affect every single man, woman and child, every business, \nevery activity that we conduct in this country. I believe very strongly \nin the need for regulatory reform for every person and business in \nAmerica, but it must be done sensibly and it must be done with balance.\n  Regulatory reform, to be true reform, should fulfill two principles. \nFirst, it should provide regulatory relief for businesses, State and \nlocal governments, and individuals. And, second, it also should provide \nthe necessary protections to the safety, health and environment of the \nAmerican people.\n  Now, that is the balance.\n  S. 343 does not, in my opinion, provide that essential balance of \nregulatory relief and protection of the American people. That is why in \nthis specific instance I support the minority leader's amendment on the \nUSDA E. coli meat and poultry inspection rule.\n  Now, what is the problem? E. coli, what does that mean? Most people \nwould not even know what you are talking about. Yet, according to USDA, \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service, \n3,000 to 7,000 people die each year--not just made ill but 3,000 to \n7,000 people \n\n[[Page S 9745]]\ndie each year--from foodborne illnesses like E. coli, and another 3 to \n7 million people get sick every year from such illnesses. Just from the \nE. coli bacteria alone, the estimates are, about 500 people die per \nyear, year in, year out, year in, year out--500 fatalities.\n  We have had testimony before our Governmental Affairs Committee; we \nhave heard the stories of those who have lost loved ones to E. coli. \nRainer Mueller testified before our committee about his son's death \nfrom eating an E. coli contaminated hamburger, painful death. It could \nhave been prevented if we had better inspection standards in the first \nplace.\n  Nancy Donley came to Washington to tell the story of her son Ellis \nwho also died from eating E. coli contaminated meat. The tragedies are \nreal.\n  Now, is anyone immune from this? Other figures indicate that about 4 \npercent of the ground beef in supermarkets has E. coli bacteria present \nin it--4 percent. Just on an average, that would be 1 out of every 25 \nhamburger patties that you pick up or 1 out of every 25 steaks that you \npick up out of a supermarket has E. coli bacteria.\n  Why is the problem then not more severe? Because we cook that meat \nand that kills E. coli. But in the raw state it has E. coli, and if it \nis not cooked enough you can come down with it. This can cause death, \nparticularly among children.\n  Now, in the State of Washington, we remember the problem out there \nwhere 3 children died, 500 were sick from contaminated hamburgers from \njust one fast food outlet back a couple of years.\n  How do we prevent this? USDA is finally modernizing its inspection \nmethods to be able to detect deadly bacteria like E. coli. The new \nproposal is called hazard analysis and critical control point [HACCP]. \nThat will be the rule which will bring our Nation's meat and poultry \ninspection system into the 20th century.\n  Now, the proposed rule, the public comment period for which just \nclosed, was wanted by the meat industry and has wide public support. It \nwas pushed for by the meat industry. And the public certainly wants it. \nIt will prevent deaths and illnesses, and we should not put this off.\n  The minority leader's amendment would exempt this critically \nimportant rule from the burdensome requirements of this bill. I support \nthis amendment in order to show how important rules that are already \nunderway will be delayed and can be stopped by the regulatory reform \nbill before us.\n  The situation with this rule reminds me of the regulatory moratorium \nthat we had before us a short time ago except now we are calling it \nregulatory reform. Rules that are in the pipeline and will be final \nsoon must go back to square one. Forget that the Department of \nAgriculture has already done a cost-benefit analysis. It now will be \nsubject to all the requirements of S. 343--new rulemaking procedures, \nnew decisional criteria, opportunities for lawyer after lawyer after \nlawyer to sue the agency and stop the rule, petitions for the agency to \nreview the rule, and so on. Unending legal battles and litigation.\n  The potential delays for this rule are real but so also real are the \nadditional deaths and sicknesses suffered by Americans who thought they \nwere eating safe meat. And, indeed, every American deserves to have the \nmeat they eat be safe. And yesterday the majority leader offered an \namendment which was accepted to specifically include food safety rules \namong those rules covered by the bill's exemption provision. And \nyesterday the point was repeatedly made that there already was included \nin the bill an exemption from analysis requirements of the bill for \n``health, safety or emergency exemption from cost-benefit analysis,'' \nwhich is the title of that section of the bill, but that is only for a \n180-day period. Then the rule could be subject to judicial challenge if \nthe agency had not completed all the analysis, and we would, indeed, be \nback to square one again.\n  The problem is that section does not really exempt anything in the \nbill. It only provides for a 180-day grace period after issuance of the \nrule,\n that is, it gives an agency an additional 180 days to comply with all \nthe many requirements of this bill and all the legal challenges that \ncan go along with that. And that is it. At the end of the 180 days, all \nof the onerous requirements of S. 343 kick in again, no exemption \nthere----\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. GLENN. No. I would rather finish and then answer questions.\n  Just new opportunities for challenges, uncertainty, and delay. What \nwill happen to the implementation of the rule when it faces these \nprospects? Regardless of the majority leader's amendment, the E. coli \nrule will be caught in the vise of S. 343 and public health will be in \ndanger. The minority leader's amendment is a first step in protecting \nthe health of the American people, but it certainly is not enough. S. \n343 will catch other important rules, and overall it will make the jobs \nof the agencies to protect health and safety and the environment much \nmore difficult.\n  S. 343 simply does not fulfill my two principles for regulatory \nreform: Regulatory relief and protection for the American people. That \nis why I, along with Senator Chafee and many others, have introduced S. \n1001, which I believe is a balanced regulatory reform proposal. Our \nbill would not shut down important rules such as USDA's meat and \npoultry inspection rule. Our bill would require cost-benefit analysis \nand risk assessment, but it would not force agencies to choose the \ncheapest, least-cost rule. It would not let the lawyers drag the \nagencies into court over every detail, every step along the way. It \nwould not create several petition processes that could be used to tie \nup agency resources in litigation. But it would provide for sensible \nreform and it would allow the agencies to perform their important \nduties.\n  Let me add that our bill also would not catch rules that are almost \nfinal, like the meat and poultry infection rule. Our bill has an \neffective date of 6 months from enactment, which gives the agencies \ntime to gear up for the many requirements of this legislation. That \nmakes sense. That is what we should be doing here, working toward \ncommonsense reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I strongly encourage \nthem to take a hard look at our alternative proposal for regulatory \nreform, S. 1001. It makes amendments like this unnecessary. But I urge \nmy colleagues to support the amendment put in by the minority leader.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielding for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I simply wanted to tell the Senator that \nI agree with him that on the 180-day period on the emergency situation, \nthe period is too short. We are requesting --I put in a request to the \nother side of the aisle that we extend that 180 days to 1 year.\n  I think your suggestion is a good one and an appropriate one, and we \nwill deal with that separately. That does not concern this amendment at \nthis point.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Daschle amendment. \nJust before making comment on that, I was listening to my good friend \nfrom Iowa talk about the rules and regulations going back some years \naffecting some of his constituents. I think all of us, during the \ncourse of this debate, have heard examples of rules and regulations \nthat have been untenable and inexcusable. I think we have to be very \ncareful even in the course of this debate and discussion because often \nwhen we go back and review the specific rule, regulation, or \nenforcement action that has been talked about, that has been addressed \nand has been altered and has been changed.\n  If you take the examples of OSHA, that performs 100,000 inspections a \nyear, and they are 99.9 percent good inspections--sound, reasonable, \nrational--you are still going to have 100 that do not make it. I think \nwe understand that. But we have a measure of lives that have been saved \nand the quality of life that has been improved by OSHA, for example, by \nwork safety regulation, on the other side. So we will have a chance, as \nwe have during the course of this discussion and debate, to consider \nthat factor. \n\n[[Page S 9746]]\n\n  Those regulations that we heard about from the Senator from Iowa, of \ncourse, were issued in a previous administration. And I think any of us \nwho, for example, have watched the difference between the \nadministration of OSHA, particularly in the last 2 years under an \nexcellent administrator, Joe Dear, can see the dramatic change, that \nthe focus and attention has not been on the issuance of paper citations \nand rules and regulations, but really reaching at the core of what OSHA \nis really all about.\n  I was amused at the start of this debate when before our committee, \nthey were talking about the rules and regulations, and how by and large \nthose rules and regulations had accumulated under previous \nadministrations. And it has been this administration that has been \nworking both to try to reduce the complexity of the rules and \nregulations, simplify the process, and still move ahead in the areas \nabout which I am most concerned; that is in the health and safety \nareas--in OSHA, the FDA, and in mine safety.\n  For example, the Delaney clause--I will have more to say about that \nlater--should be updated, not repealed. And OSHA should be helped, not \nparalyzed, if we want to ensure that we are going to take the best in \nterms of modern science and industrial techniques in order to make our \nworkplaces safer for American workers.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the Daschle amendment, which I hope \nwill serve two purposes: To keep this bill from blocking an important \nregulation and to illustrate one of the fundamental flaws of S. 343 \nthat is so extreme and antiregulatory that it will block good and \nessential regulations that Americans want.\n  I would like to begin by telling a story about a constituent of mine, \na 40-year-old woman named Joan Sullivan. Earlier this year, on February \n4, 1995, Joan Sullivan did something almost every American does many \ntimes a year. She ate a hamburger. She did not know that such a simple \nact would lead her to the edge of death, to weeks of incapacitation, \npain, and suffering, and to catastrophic medical expenses. Joan \nSullivan had no idea she was risking her life when she sat down to eat \nthat night, but she was. The meat she ate was tainted by a \nmicroorganism, E. coli, a bacterium that is found with increasing \nfrequency in the Nation's meat supply.\n  When Joan ate that tainted hamburger she contracted an infection of \nastonishing virulence that came within a hair's breadth of killing her. \nJoan Sullivan was admitted to her local hospital emergency room with \nsevere stomach pains, constant diarrhea, and vomiting. When her \ncondition worsened, she was transferred to one of America's greatest \nmedical institutions, the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, \nwhere her condition was diagnosed as hemolytic uremic syndrome.\n  Desperate measures to save her were undertaken. A tube was placed \ninto Ms. Sullivan's chest without any anesthetic, according to her \ntestimony, and inserted into one of her heart's major blood vessels in \norder to administer a blood-cleansing treatment. After a month in the \nhospital, 20 treatments, and the concentrated efforts of dozens of \ndoctors, nurses, and technicians, Joan Sullivan's life was saved. But \nthe cost in terms of her suffering and her family's time and anxiety \nand in the dollars spent on her care were enormous. Her medical bills \nalone have totaled approximately $300,000.\n  What happened to Joan Sullivan has happened to hundreds of other \nAmericans, but many have not been as lucky as she. Many of the victims \nof E. coli poisoning, especially children, do not survive the \ninfection. Although 5,000 to 9,000 Americans die every year from \nfoodborne diseases, the FDA estimates that another 4 million--4 \nmillion--are made ill at a cost to consumers of about $4 billion a \nyear.\n  That is why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is preparing a new \nregulation on meat and poultry handling and microbe sampling. The key \nto the proposed rule is the requirement that meatpackers and processors \ncarry out microbiological tests once a day to be sure that their \nhandling procedures are effective. USDA estimates that the rule, \nincluding its testing requirements, will save consumers $1 to $4 \nbillion a year by preventing salmonella, E. coli, and other foodborne \nillnesses.\n  This is a rule that is urgently needed and Congress should do \nwhatever it can to expedite. But the pending bill could set back the \nUSDA's efforts by years, blocking the rule until the agency can jump \nthrough all of the procedural hoops and red tape associated with the \nbill's extreme risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis, and allowing \nbusinesses to challenge the rule after its issuance for failure to meet \nthose requirements.\n  The supporters of this misguided bill keep arguing that they are for \ncommon sense. Well, common sense tells me that if the USDA has already \ndone a risk assessment under the Executive order, and has already done \na cost-benefit analysis estimating that the benefits will be four times \ngreater than the cost, then it would be foolish, wasteful, and \ndangerous to make them go back and do the analysis again.\n  How much time and money will the agency waste unnecessarily while \nCongress forces it to comply with this bill's one-size-fits-all \nprocedures?\n  Is it common sense to demand that the USDA explore the regional \neffects of the rule or whether it has analyzed the extent to which the \nindustry can control the problem of E. coli contamination through \nvoluntary measures? That is not common sense, that is common nonsense.\n  The bill's overly complex and rigid requirements add nothing at all \nto the agency's efforts to control this serious threat to public \nhealth. The bill's exemption for health and safety threats, as amended, \nclearly excludes rules dealing with E. coli contamination from the \ncost-benefit and risk assessment rules, at least when the rules are \nfirst promulgated. But it is clear that a meatpacker could still \npetition to force the agency to schedule the rules for the look-back \nreview because the bill's analytical requirements have not been \nsatisfied in every detail.\n  A hostile USDA Secretary in the next administration, by failing to \ncomplete the review, could effectively repeal the rules, leaving the \npublic unprotected again.\n  This is a very real worry. There are elements of the meat industry \nand a number of Republicans who are supporting an effort in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives to block the USDA's meat handling and sampling \nrule. The majority leader, and others, have been embracing this rule in \nthe Senate. But the House Appropriations Committee has voted to send \nthe rule into the limbo of negotiated rulemaking from which it may \nnever emerge.\n  It is important that the Senate speak out in favor of protecting the \npublic from E. coli and other meat and poultry diseases, to ensure this \nbill does not jeopardize the public health. We can prevent tragedies \nlike Jean Sullivan's from happening, and we have a duty to do so. I \nurge support for the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. President, what we talked about during the period of the last day \nor two has been E. coli, as if this was the only kind of problem. Let \nme mention briefly why the Daschle amendment is so important not just \nwith regard to the proposal that has been made by the majority leader \non the E. coli issue.\n  Under the Dole amendment, the food safety rules can be exempt from \nthe red-tape and delay in S. 343 only if the agency, for good cause, \nfinds that conducting the cost-benefit analysis is impractical due to \nan emergency of health or safety that is likely to result in \nsignificant harm to the public or natural resources. Industry can \nchallenge this finding and block the final rule under the ample \njudicial review authority in section 625.\n  So even if you find out that a Secretary is able to move into a \nfaster mechanism to try and address E. coli, you still have all the \nother procedures of S. 343 that can reduce protections for the public.\n  Under section 622, the agency is required to complete the analysis \nwithin 180 days of the rule's publication. I understand that that is \ngoing to at least be addressed in another amendment, but that is only \nreally a part of the problem.\n  In addition, various meat suppliers and packing houses would be \nempowered to seek a waiver from the rule's requirements under the new \nspecial interest waiver authority in 629. This section allows industry \nto petition for the so-called alternative method of \n\n[[Page S 9747]]\ncompliance. This approach allows the rule to be issued but would \ndramatically undermine its effectiveness.\n  Once the rule is issued, industry can petition under the rollback \nauthority in the legislation. Industry could seek the weakening of the \nE. coli rule on the basis that it does not meet the rigorous decision \ncriteria in 624, and the rule automatically sunsets within 3 years if \nthe agency fails to complete the review.\n  Once the rule is issued, industry can also file a petition under the \nauthority of new revisions to section 553 of the Administrative \nProcedure Act that empower special interests to seek repeal of rules. \nThe agency must respond within 18 months. Failure to respond, or a \ndenial, could be litigated immediately under the new legislation.\n  Mr. President, the problem with S. 343, quite frankly, is we are \nopening up the door for all of the industries in this area. We are \ninterested in their interests, we are interested in their productivity \nand their financial security, but make no mistake, all of the rules and \nregulations and the procedures and the look-back procedures are all \nopening up the door for the industries to come in and alter and change \nhealth and safety procedures, the whole series of add-ons that have \nbeen spelled out in detail by Senator Glenn and Senator Levin.\n  But I want to just point out, Mr. President, that the amendment of \nthe Senator from South Dakota makes sense in trying to address real \nprotections. The Dole amendment took it part way. The Daschle amendment \naddresses these other measures, which were not closed in the Dole \namendment, which ought to lend credence to the concern of many \nAmericans about what is happening on the floor of the U.S. Senate in \nterms of their health and their security and their well-being.\n  Let me mention just a few other of the health regulations endangered \nby this bill. We have not addressed those. We have the E. coli \namendment. But among other regulations that are in the pipeline are the \nimproved quality of mammography standards to ensure better diagnosis \nand early treatment for the millions of women at risk for breast \ncancer.\n  The Mammography Quality Act passed virtually unanimously in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives. The reason that it passed \nunanimously is because we found out after long and extensive hearings \nthat in too many instances the various machineries that were being used \nto test women were not of sufficient accuracy and the people who were \nusing those pieces of equipment had not been adequately trained.\n  As a result of extensive hearings and review, we have now required--\nRepublicans and Democrats--that we are going to have the issuance of \nthose standards which are going to give, hopefully, the actual \nscientific results to the people who are going to take the mammography \nexaminations. Too many women in our society going through the existing \nsystem would get a stamp of approval when the training and the \nmachinery were not adequate and they would fail to take the other kind \nof preventive steps and endanger their own health.\n  It was on that basis that we made these national standards, because \nthe women in California should be protected as well as the women in \nMassachusetts. But still we find out that the new standards--and they \nare now being issued--they would be at risk. For what reason? For the \nvarious reasons that are outlined in this bill. I will take just a \nmoment. We have gone through this, and the leaders have gone through \nthis in great detail.\n  Not only do you have the mammography standards that are going to \nprovide lifesaving information for women in terms of breast cancer, but \nyou have the Comprehensive Seafood Safety Program. We had extensive \ndebate in the last Congress about how we were going to make progress in \nterms of the safety of seafood.\n  The consumption of seafood has gone up dramatically in this country, \nand many of the attendant problems we found in terms of meat and \npoultry also affect seafood. I represent a State that has a great \nmaritime tradition and is one of the leading States in the country in \nterms of harvesting seafood. The fishermen want this kind of protection \nbecause it is important in terms of the integrity of the product, and \nthe people want that.\n  But there are some within the industry, and the record is replete--\nnot out here but in the hearings that were held in FDA and our own \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources--about the industry group that \ndoes not want those regulations.\n  We spent a lot of time developing that program in terms of safety. \nMake no mistake about it, it may be E. coli today, but soon it will be \nsomething else related to the safety of seafood products.\n They do not have a special amendment. They do not have a Dole \namendment. There is nothing out here in terms of mammography for the \nwomen of this country being proposed to protect them or to protect \nothers with regard to seafood safety.\n\n  What about the rule to prevent iron poisoning of children by \nstrengthening the packaging requirements for iron supplements? There \nare 10,000 incidents a year affecting children, many of them resulting \nin deaths, as a result of the ingestion of iron supplements. We have \nregulations that are about to be promulgated on the basis that they \nwill save scores of children's lives a year. And they will be delayed. \nAnother rule will prohibit the use of lead in food cans to protect \ninfants and children from exposure to substances that may contribute to \nmental retardation, which is one of the major problems that we have in \nmany areas of the country, in urban as well as rural communities. And \nanother rule deals with lead in paint, where we have older rural \ncommunities that have used lead paint in their buildings, and in older \ncommunities, industrial communities, that not only have it in their \nbuildings but also have it the playgrounds in their communities. We \nknow the direct correlation between ingestion of lead and mental \nretardation and slow development, particularly of children.\n  One of the problems the Government intends to address is that the \nimportation of various foods from many different countries around the \nworld is still in cans which have a high content of lead. And in trying \nto respond not by limiting the opportunity for the consumer to be able \nto consume those products but to make those cans safer, we have rules \nand regulations to try and deal with those--children are at risk. And \nanother rule in the works would regulate the level of diesel emissions \nin the mines, where miners work in the confined spaces. The regulations \nwhich are about to be issued in those areas, which have been examined \nand have taken review year after year, are about to be sidetracked.\n  Mr. President, I could continue--and will later on in this debate--to \ngo through various other rules and regulations about to be issued on \ntoy safety, because choking on small toys and small parts of toys is \nthe leading cause of toy-related deaths. Between January 1980 and July \n1991, 186 children choked to death on balloons, marbles, and small \nparts of toys. More than 3,000 children are treated in hospital \nemergency rooms because they swallow or inhale a small toy.\n  Congress enacted the Child Safety Protection Act last year. The law \nrequires hazard labeling and bans balls that are small enough to choke \na young child, and it requires the reporting of choking incidents. The \nConsumer Product Safety Commission has proposed rules to implement the \nreporting requirements and interpret other provisions of that.\n  Now, we say we are going to wipe those things out. We have heard the \ndaily list of 10 rules and regulations do not make any sense. What are \nyou going to tell those parents about toys? Who is going to make the \nrules and regulations? Do you expect the parents to understand blocking \nthese rules? There is a need for this kind of review and examination \nand the collection of information.\n  So whether you live in Boston, or in Palo Alto, or wherever you live, \nif those parents' kids are going to play with a toy, they are going to \nbe protected. But under the rules and regulations, they are going to \nhave to do a thorough examination to see whether there is a \ngeographical difference, whether there can be voluntary compliance.\n  We are talking about small children and they are talking about a \nstudy for voluntary compliance. Market based \n\n[[Page S 9748]]\nmechanisms. Market based mechanisms for children's toys? We are \nexpecting the agency to do a review on that?\n  Now, Mr. President, we talk about common sense. What they are \nproposing makes no sense.\n  You have baby-walker safety. Baby-walkers account for a high number \nof injuries annually, more than any other nursery product, sending \napproximately 25,000 infants to hospital emergency rooms in 1993 alone. \nEleven children died in walker-related incidents in the past 5 years. \nIn response, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has begun \nrulemaking to address the hazards associated with baby-walkers. Those \nare going to be delayed. How many other children are going to be \nimpacted by a failure to be able to get this kind of safety?\n  Mr. President, the list goes on. I mentioned the iron toxicity \nprevention. FDA has proposed a rule to prevent the many needless deaths \nand serious injuries that occur when children accidentally ingest too \nmuch iron by eating too many iron tablets or supplements. Iron toxicity \nis the leading cause of poison deaths in children today. From 1986 \nthrough 1992, over 100,000 children were poisoned. Many suffered \npermanent injury, and at least 33 died. This rule would limit the iron \npotency of vitamins intended for children to require a warning label \nand childproof container.\n  What Member of the Senate has heard from a parent saying, ``Look, \nthat kind of rule and regulation is outrageous, and that rule and \nregulation that is going to protect my child is just Federal \nbureaucracy. We want you to stop that''? Do you think the parents are \ngoing to be able to provide that adequate protection?\n  I see others of my colleagues on the floor who want to address this \nissue, as well as other issues. These are just examples. You might talk \nabout the E. coli regulation. We could have a thousand other \namendments. That is the trouble with the bill. For each and every one \nof these, you need another amendment to protect it. When you have the \namendment accepted by the overwhelming majority, people might say we \nhave addressed that particular problem. It takes the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, to get a chance to look through that to try and \nrecognize that only half the job has really been done. I daresay that, \neven with the acceptance of those amendments, we are still leaving at \nrisk many of the children, the most vulnerable, and the workers, the \nparents, and millions of families all across this country that rely on \nthe Government for help in the areas of health and safety, who do not \nhave the expertise and ability and scientific information to be able to \nmake these judgments in the interest of their family.\n  Sure, there have been mistakes. Sure, there have been the issues of \nregulations which are untenable and wrong. But it seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, that we ought to be concerned about those and consider how \nwe can constantly work and try and find ways to work with the private \nsector, the public sector, the agencies to try and make it better, \nrather than have a whole scale alteration and change which is going to \ndramatically--and I say dramatically--put at greater risk the health \nand safety of the American people.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor and support \nthe Daschle-Bradley amendment even though I am disappointed that it is \nnecessary to offer the amendment. But we do need to offer the amendment \nbecause, once again, our Republican colleagues seem to be more \nresponsive to the special interests than the public interest. It is \nunacceptable for this body to put thousands of lives at risk in the \nname of regulatory reform. Yet that, in my view, is what this bill \ndoes. Let me give you an example.\n  An estimated 4,000 people die each year as a result of meat and \npoultry tainted with harmful bacteria. Another 5 million become ill, \nbut survive. These numbers are too high. You would think the Federal \nGovernment would feel an obligation to respond to that problem. This \nbill is a response. But it is the wrong response. It weakens our \nability to regulate food safety rather than strengthen it.\n  In 1995, the sale of unsafe meat and poultry is unacceptable and \ndeplorable. It is a scandal that meat today is inspected by the same \nstandards first developed in the early 1900's. That is right, today's \nmeat inspection process is nearly the same as it was 100 years ago--\ninspectors must rely on sight and smell.\n  USDA recently proposed rules that would finally bring meat and \npoultry inspection into the 20th century. Scientific testing would be \nused to prevent contaminated food from reaching American consumers.\n  These changes would save thousands of lives and prevent millions of \nAmericans from suffering the ill effects of this harmful bacteria.\n  Death from E. coli poisoning can be excruciatingly painful. Symptoms \nrange from diarrhea and vomiting, to extreme headaches, to neurological \ndamage. Body functions often shut down one at a time. Blood \ntransfusions are necessary. Death is common for children and survivors \ncan suffer from the aftereffects of this poisoning for years.\n  Last year, I introduced the Katie O'Connell Safe Food Act with \nSenator Bradley. Katie O'Connell was a 23-month-old girl from Kearny, \nNJ, who died as a result of eating a fast-food hamburger infected with \nE. coli bacteria.\n  This act sought to prevent future tragedies like that suffered by \nKatie O'Connell and her family. I am pleased that after many years, the \nUSDA proposed new standards that would do just this.\n  There are thousands of Katie O'Connell's across the Nation whose \nlives could be saved if we had a proper system in place to assure the \nsafety of our food.\n  We owe it to our children and their families to ensure the safety of \nour food system. But the so-called regulatory reform bill before us \nnow, even with the Dole amendment, will delay this long-awaited \nimprovement in our meat and poultry inspection system. It will \nencourage challenges to rules which have already taken too long to be \ndeveloped. It will delay USDA's ability to issue regulations which we \nneed and most Members of this body want.\n  Regulations that are vital to the public health ought to be protected \nfrom additional delay. That is what the Daschle-Bradley amendment does. \nAnd that it why I support it.\n  Let us use some common sense and pass this amendment in the name of \nprotecting the public health and safety.\n  Mr. President, let me close by saying that I hope we will have the \nopportunity to examine other amendments that will put the public health \nahead of the special interests.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1503 to Amendment No. 1502\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that risk assessments conducted to support \n    proposed rules may be used to support final rules that are not \n      substantially different with respect to the risk addressed)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, and Mr. Roth, proposes an amendment numbered 1503 to \n     amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed on page 1, lines 5 through \n     9 insert the following:\n       ``(10) Notwithstanding section 632, if the agency head \n     determines that--\n       (A) a final major rule subject to this subchapter is \n     substantially similar to the proposed major rule with respect \n     to the risk being addressed;\n       (B) a risk assessment for the proposed major rule has been \n     carried out in substantial accordance with section 633; and\n       (C) a new risk assessment for the final rule is not \n     required in order to respond to comments received during the \n     period for comment on the proposed rule; the head of the \n     agency may publish such determination along with the final \n     rule in lieu of preparing a new risk assessment for the final \n     rule.\n       (11) Notwithstanding any provision of the Comprehensive \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 and the amendments made by such \n     Act, including section 9 of such act, any rule for which a \n     notice of proposed rulemaking was \n\n[[Page S 9749]]\n     filed before April 1, 1995 shall not be subject to the provision of \n     this subchapter or subchapter III except for section 623 \n     (relating to review of rules).''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I invite the attention of my colleagues, \nparticularly the Senator from Massachusetts, and the minority leader, \nif he is listening on his squawk box, and others, to this amendment, \nbecause it fixes the problem.\n  The problem, Mr. President, was well pointed out by the Secretary of \nAgriculture in his letter to Senator Daschle. What he said, with \nrespect to this ongoing HACCP rulemaking, is that affects the 9,000 \nfederally inspected slaughter processing plants in this country; that \nthey have virtually completed a rulemaking; that that rulemaking has a \ncost-benefit and has a risk assessment that has been peer reviewed, and \nit is ready to go into operation. The Secretary says we should not have \nto go back and do that over again. It would give us a 6-month delay. A \nlegitimate problem.\n  Now, what this amendment does, Mr. President, is fixes that problem, \nnot only with respect to HACCP, but with all other Federal agencies, \nbecause it says that where there is a final rule, which is \nsubstantially similar to the proposed rule, where a risk assessment for \nthe proposed major rule has been carried out in substantial accordance \nwith section 633, and a new risk assessment for the final rule is not \nrequired in order to respond to comments received during the period for \ncomments on the proposed rule, the head of the agency may publish such \ndetermination along with the final rule in lieu of preparing a new risk \nassessment for the final rule.\n  So that, in other words, if you have already done your risk \nassessment, in substantial compliance--not exact compliance--\nsubstantial compliance of section 623, which it is my understanding \nthat that risk assessment has been carried out, you are exempt, not \nonly for HACCP, not only this agency, but for all agencies.\n  Now, if that is not absolutely clear with respect to HACCP, let me \ngive the clincher. The next paragraph, notwithstanding any other \nprovision, if your notice of proposed rulemaking was filed before April \n1, 1995, you ``shall not be subject to the provisions of this \nsubchapter or subchapter 3 except for section 623.''\n  What that means is, if you have your notice of proposed rulemaking \nout, prior to April 1, as they did in agriculture, with the HACCP \nrules, you are exempt from everything except the petition process and \nthe look-back.\n  That means the rule will go into effect as soon as proposed. It will \nstay in effect.\n  Now, if anyone wants to petition, what has to be done in order to get \na petition granted, is to bear the burden of establishing, using the \nwords of the statute, ``that there is a substantial likelihood that you \nwould not be able to meet the standards of section 624.''\n  What are the standards of section 624? That the benefit justifies the \ncost, and that you have used the least-cost reasonable alternative that \ncomplies with the statute, unless considerations of health, safety, the \nenvironment, require a more expensive alternative, or unless scientific \nor data uncertainties require a higher standard.\n  Mr. President, if you are able to show that, if the petition is \ngranted, only then do you do the risk assessment and cost-benefit \nanalysis, only then do you have a new rulemaking, and there would be 3 \nyears, plus an extension of 2 years as provided, a total of 5 years, in \norder to complete that process.\n  In the meantime, the rule is in effect.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a series of questions?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Does this take care of the danger of the E. coli rule \nbeing repealed by the look-back or sunset provisions? I believe you say \nit would still have to comply with look-back and sunset; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What would happen is the rule goes into effect. If you \nfeel that that rule--the benefits do not justify the cost, and can show \na substantial likelihood that that is so, then you could petition. If \nthe agency agrees with you, then they would put you on the schedule for \nhaving a risk assessment and a cost-benefit analysis.\n  You do not throw out the rule in the meantime. You simply go through \nthe scientific procedures.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand. In other words, the rule is in danger of \nbeing repealed by the look-back or the sunset procedures and is not \nexempted from the petition for waivers, according to your explanation--\nI would like to ask another question.\n  I believe, as I listen to my friend explain this, that the E. coli \nrule would have to comply with section 623 of the Dole bill and it \nseems to me that this in fact substitutes current law with this new \nlaw.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is just not true.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say that my friend admits, in fact, there is a danger \nthat the----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I did not admit that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me, my friend says, yes, it is subject to the \nlook-back procedures.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. But not in danger of being repealed. Those were the \nwords of the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one more question.\n  My last question is, Did you work with the minority leader on this? \nIs Senator Daschle in agreement with your substitute amendment?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What Senator Daschle wants is to specifically exempt \nthis rule, the HACCP rule, from any consideration of cost-benefit \nanalysis or risk assessment.\n  We oppose that because we believe that any rule that is--HACCP will \ngo into operation. But if someone can show that HACCP was not properly \ndone and that it cannot meet the cost-benefit analysis, that the \nbenefits do not justify the cost, then all we say is that you can deem \nthe scientific panel, get the best science, and do it right, but the \nrule stays in effect in the meantime.\n  There is not a danger of will rules repeal, as if people are not \ngoing to be protected. There is a likelihood that if they have not done \nit right, they would have to do it right.\n  Now, what is wrong with putting science in control, if they have done \nit wrong in the first place? What is wrong with that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator asking a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend there is great disagreement over the \nvery premise of this bill. Those that oppose it think it goes way too \nfar, that the pendulum is going to swing to the side of the special \ninterests in this country, to the detriment of the people who rely on \nus to protect the food supply.\n  I assume the answer to my question is that Senator Daschle does not \nsupport your substitute amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, there is no answer to those that say the \nbill goes too far, it protects special interests.\n  We are dealing with a technical amendments bill that involves a lot \nof provisions. You cannot answer an argument that says it goes too far \nand it enshrines special interests. It does not. The Senator has not \nshown me where it does. All I am saying is that this rule goes into \neffect.\n  By the way, the Senator from California, I believe, is a cosponsor of \nthe Glenn substitute. Did the Senator know that the Glenn substitute \nwould have the very effect that the Secretary of Agriculture complains \nabout?\n  Under the Glenn substitute, you would be required to go back and do a \ncost-benefit analysis because it has not been done in accordance with \nwhat the Glenn substitute says.\n  We get this micromanaging of this bill where they ``fly-speck'' our \nbill and look at it and show--find ghosts where none exists, and then \nthey propose legislation that has the exact same fault, sometimes worse \nfaults.\n  But, that is fine.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. We are changing that. We realized that was a fault in \nours, and we are changing that. The other bill, S. 343, has not been \nchanged.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We have changed it right now.\n  Mr. GLENN. Not in that regard.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, again, we have this problem on this bill \nthat the opponents of the bill will not take yes for an answer. \n\n[[Page S 9750]]\n\n  Secretary Glickman writes a letter and says, ``We have a problem, \nthat we have gone through this extensive rulemaking, we do not want to \nhave to do it over again.''\n  We say, ``Yes, Secretary Glickman, you have a problem. You should not \nhave to do it over again. Not only should you not have to do it over \nagain, but nobody in the Federal Government ought to have to do it over \nagain.''\n  We proposed two fixes. If you started your rule prior to April 1 with \na notice of proposed rulemaking, you are exempted. Or, if you have \nalready done it and it is in substantial accordance with the section, \nyou do not have to do it again. On both scores, this proposal for safe \nmeat and E. coli, about which I am just as concerned as any member in \nthis body--look, to say we are not concerned about health because we \nwant scientists to do it right is to turn logic on its head. It is to \nturn the argument 180 degrees around. It is because we want it to be \ndone right that we propose this bill. We do not want to have to do it \nover again. We do not want to delay. This amendment fixes the problem.\n  Now, the reason we oppose the Daschle amendment is, in effect, what \nSenator Daschle says; citing the same problem, he says, just exempt \nHACCP altogether from these requirements.\n  Well, you could come along and say, Well, this rule or that rule \ninvolves health or safety and it ought to be exempted.\n  Mr. President, we are not diminishing safety by this bill. To the \ncontrary, we are requiring that the benefits ought to justify the cost, \na very simple proposition. Why do we propose that? Because, across \nFederal agencies, we have seen terrible examples of waste, ignoring our \nown scientists, not even knowing what regulations cost, dealing with \nrisks that do not exist.\n  With respect to this clean meat inspection, inspection of poultry \nhouses, inspection of slaughterhouses--that regulation is going to go \ninto effect under the second-degree amendment. We have fixed the \nproblem. I wish the opponents to this measure would at least \nacknowledge that we are fixing the problem and not give us these \narguments like: Oh, this is a special interest bill. Oh, you want dirty \nmeat for your children.\n  Mr. President, it is just not true. Let the opponents to this measure \nspeak to this measure. Do not speak to something that is irrelevant, \nlike whether special interests are being taken care of. This is not a \nspecial interest. This second-degree amendment is proposed specifically \nbecause the Secretary of Agriculture said he had a problem, and it \nfixes that problem. If there is another problem, let us deal with that \nin a separate amendment. We have had over a hundred changes accepted to \nthis bill already. It is a tight bill. It is a good bill. It is a \nworkable bill. And this amendment makes it better and I hope my \ncolleagues will accept it.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope, in the course of the next half-\nhour or so, I can be very specific in my critique of the Dole bill, so \nmy friend from Louisiana can see that I am coming at it after a great \namount of thought.\n  I support the Daschle amendment because the Daschle amendment says, \nvery simply, in plain English: We are moving ahead with that rule on E. \ncoli. The Johnston amendment that he is substituting for the Daschle \namendment deals with a broader issue. Fine.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I might complete my thought, then I will be happy to \nyield.\n  We believe that the Daschle amendment is necessary so this HACCP rule \nwhich I refer to as the E. coli rule, that is about to take effect, can \nmove forward now and be exempted from the bill. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  If you want to deal with the issue in a broader way, we can look at \nthe Johnston language. But it does not mean that the Daschle language \nis not needed if you are concerned about E. coli and want to see the \nrule move forward unencumbered by language that my friend took about 10 \nminutes to explain. It is still confusing. We think the Daschle \nlanguage is clear. Just move forward with the rule, exempt it, and let \nus get a safe meat supply.\n  That is why I support the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Now will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does my friend from California understand my amendment \nallows the E. coli rule to go forward the same as the Daschle amendment \ndoes?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It does not exempt the E. coli rule, in your own words, \nfrom the waiver provisions----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, it does.\n  Mrs. BOXER. From the sunset provisions, from the look-back \nprovisions; and also, from what I gather from my friend's explanation, \nit still has to comply with Section 623 and the spirit of the new law. \nThat is what I understood from my friend.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I may explain very carefully----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Therefore I believe the Daschle amendment is necessary, \nin a simple way, so I can look the people in the eye and say: That rule \nto protect you from E. coli is moving forward, period. And it is not \ngoing to be repealed because of actions by a special interest lobby \nthat forces it to be repealed. I stand by my strong belief that the \nDaschle amendment is necessary.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Now, does the Senator understand--let us see where we \nagree and disagree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator understand that under the Johnston \namendment, the E. coli regulations will go forward; be promulgated \nwithout delay?\n  Mrs. BOXER. As I understand my friend's comments, and I would have to \nhave them read back to me to be certain, he said that you have to make \nsure, in your generic description, that the spirit of section 623 was \ncomplied with.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No. There are two bases on which this would be, that E. \ncoli would go forward. First, that you had substantially complied with \nthe risk assessment under section 633.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Section 633.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Or--understand ``or''--or that your notice of proposed \nrulemaking was put out before April 1, 1995. And this was put out \nbefore April 1, 1995. Therefore, it is exempt from the proposal.\n  Are we together on that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is not exempt from the look-back. It is not exempt \nfrom the sunset. It is not exempt from the waiver.\n  I would say to my friend, if the April date is consistent, it may \nwell move forward. I concede that. However I believe some of my \ncolleagues have raised questions about the April date.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. So we are in agreement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not know the exact date of the rule, but if my \nfriend says it, I would agree. I have no reason to think he would not \nbe honest on that point.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Do we also understand that in order to petition to have \na risk assessment on this, that during all of that time, that the rule \nstays in effect? Are we in agreement on that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I understand exactly what my friend said. It is \nsubject to the look-back, the waiver, and the sunset provisions of the \nlaw.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Do you also understand that, as far as the sunset \nprovisions, those are only rules that the Secretary himself will pick \nout? In other words, you do not sunset all rules, it is only such rules \nas he picks out for reexamination? And that is only if Secretary \nGlickman says he has to go redo his own work. Does my colleague \nunderstand that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand my friend perfectly. The fact is, Secretary \nGlickman is here today and could be gone tomorrow. We do not legislate \nbecause Secretary Glickman is a good guy. We legislate for whoever \nhappens to be Secretary of Agriculture.\n  I am going to take back my time, if I may, because I have a long \nstatement on this bill. I have time constraints.\n  I know my friend speaks in total good faith but I hope he knows I \nalso speak in good faith. I am concerned about E. coli because kids die \nfrom it and old people die from it. And I want to go to the route that \nwill exempt it from this legislation. Legislation that is so \ncomplicated that two Senators have different ideas about what it means \nany day of the week. That says to me: Court cases. That says to me: \nLawyers' dreams. Why not go with Senator Daschle's approach? You have a \nproblem. You have a rule. Put it into place, exempt it from this bill.\n \n[[Page S 9751]]\n\n  If people do not want to vote for that, God bless them, that is their \noption. I respect them. But no manner of questions to this Senator is \ngoing to change my mind that the most direct way to protect people from \nE. coli is to support the Daschle amendment.\n  I want to get into the general subject of this bill. I think that all \nAmericans agree there are tremendous benefits that come from our health \nand safety laws. If you look at some of our rivers, where there was no \nsign of life and they have been rejuvenated, it is because of our \nNation's laws.\n  If you look at the quality of air in certain areas where we are \nreaching attainment levels, areas where kids are now born with a \nhealthy ability to breathe, a lung capacity that they deserve, it is \nbecause of the Clean Air Act. I could go on and on and cite case after \ncase, of where we have reaped benefits from our health, safety and \nenvironmental laws.\n  I also completely agree that there are instances where Federal \nagencies have ignored the costs of regulation on business and \nindividuals. And those people feel they were treated unfairly, and in \nmany cases it is true. In other words, I believe that we need to \nreadjust the balance. There is no question about that. And that is why \nwe need regulatory reform. The point I want to make is, while saying we \nneed regulatory reform, I want to underline that we do not need, want, \nand should not pursue, regulatory repeal.\n  What the Dole bill will do by coming up with these incredible hurdles \nthat agencies have to go through in order to protect health and safety, \nin essence, will be the repealing of our laws. We are making it so \nimpossible for them to go into effect that our people could be left \nunprotected.\n  The Dole bill is basically a repeal. The Glenn bill cosponsored by \nRepublican John Chafee--is regulatory reform. Yes. That is why I have \nmy name on that bill. And I am proud to have my name on that bill. You \nare going to see some interesting folks crossing party lines on this.\n  We need regulatory reform that provides reasonable, logical and \nappropriate changes in the regulatory process, that will eliminate \nunnecessary burdens on business, State and local government, and \nindividuals. But we need regulatory reform that maintains our National \nGovernment's ability to protect the health and safety of the American \npeople.\n  Why do I say ``National Government?'' It is because I believe a child \nin California that bites into a hamburger that could be tainted \ndeserves as much protection as a child in Mississippi or Pennsylvania \nor New York. All the children of this great country deserve that \nprotection. All the people of this great country deserve those national \nstandards. If I travel to another State, I do not have to worry about \nordering a hamburger because that State did not enact good law. I want \nto know there is a national standard, that there is a national \ninspection service.\n  I am committed to doing away with regulations that have outlived \ntheir usefulness, or have created needless redtape or bureaucracy.\n  I am equally committed to making sure the American people's basic \nneeds are protected--the food they eat, the air they breath, the water \nthey drink--because you may have a great job, you may have a great \nfuture, you may have a wonderful family, and yet, if something like \nthis happens--where a family member is killed or maimed or hurt by \nbacteria in meat or bacteria in the water supply, it does not mean \nmuch, folks.\n  I want to share a chart with you. It is interesting because this \npublic opinion poll was taken, as I understand it, by one of the \nRepublic pollsters, Luntz Research and Strategic Services in March \n1995. I think this is a warning, a warning to those who would just say, \nthrow out our regulations.\n  ``Which should be Congress' higher priority: cut regulations or do \nmore to protect the environment?''\n  Twenty-nine percent of the American people, ``cut regulations''; 62 \npercent, ``protect the environment.''\n  And the pollster goes on to comment, ``This question here is a \nwarning. Environmental protection is a higher priority than cutting \nregulations.''\n  It is clear. So what does this mean? It means that there cannot be a \nfrontal assault by politicians on environmental regulations and food \nand safety regulations because a frontal assault would be so unpopular, \nthose people would be booted out of office in 5 minutes.\n  So what do they do? They come up with back-door solutions. I think \nthe Dole bill is a back-door solution of this kind. Call it regulatory \nreform, hide behind words like ``bureaucrat, overregulation, cost and \nbenefit studies,'' and strip protections from the American people. When \nI talk about protection, I mean the most basic protection, the most \nbasic rights to safe water, clean air, and so on.\n  I want to share with you some of the editorials and stories that have \nbeen appearing in the newspapers about regulatory reform and the Dole \nbill, the bill we are trying to make better by amending it, the bill \nfor which we have a substitute called Glenn-Chafee bill which we think \nis far better.\n  USA Today, ``Reforms aimed at health, safety rules are too risky.''\n  The San Francisco Chronicle: ``Regulatory Reform or Polluters' \nRevenge?''\n  That is how the Chronicle saw it.\n  Congressional Quarterly cover story, ``Industry, Politics Intertwined \nin Dole's Regulatory Bill: Its sweeping changes offer the campaigning \nleader a platform and generate a wave of lobbying from affected \nbusinesses.''\n  Maine Sunday Telegram: ``Senate: No `Reform' Trashes Environment.''\n  Mesa Tribune: ``Regulatory Reform, Polluters' Loophole.''\n  The New York Times talking about this bill: ``The Next Environmental \nThreat.''\n  And here is a story from Business Week: ``The GOP's Guerrilla War on \nGreen Laws, Newt & Co. Plan a Procedural Overall, Not a Direct \nAttack,'' which is exactly my point.\n  You cannot say to the people we are repealing food safety laws, but \nyou write a bill that makes it extremely hard for our agencies to \nprotect the food supply. In essence, you have repealed those laws. It \ncould not be said better than in the Business Week headline.\n  How about this? Detroit Free Press: ``Unnatural Reform, GOP Remedies \nWould be Environmental Disaster.''\n  So, when I criticize the Dole bill, I think I have a lot of support \nfor my position. When I talk about special interests being behind it, \nwhich my friend from Louisiana got so upset about, I do not think you \nneed a degree in political science to know that the pin-striped suits \nare all over this place, by the way, backing off a bill that already \npassed 15 to nothing out of the Government Affairs Committee because \nthey see a better chance to get relief.\n  That is what hurts. We had a bill passed in a bipartisan way, but all \nof a sudden we are into a whole different situation.\n  Make no mistake about it: Laws that protect our clean air and water \nand our food supply are at stake here. It is an attack on the laws and \nregulations that protect us from the medicines we buy every day, the \ntoys we give to our children, the cars we drive and the places where we \nwork. The consequences of this bill are far-reaching--they will reach \nfar into every town in America, into every kitchen in America, because \nwhen you turn on the water, and you back off of protecting that water \nsupply, you are in danger.\n  I believe that this Dole bill, in the name of efficiency, in the name \nof cost-benefit analysis, will bring us gridlock and that will assist \nthe special interests and the corporate polluters. And I did not come \nhere to protect them. I came here to protect the people in my State who \nare going to rely on us for their health and safety.\n  The Dole petition and look-back, which we talked a little bit about \nwith my friend from Louisiana, and the judicial review provisions will \nallow any well-financed ``bad actor''--what I mean when I say ``bad \nactor'' is a person in the industry who does not have principles. And \nthat is certainly not a majority, but there are some.\n  I will never forget a very long time ago when I was very young and I \nwas just getting into local politics. I went to a meeting on the issue \nof energy policy in America. And discussion on the safety of nuclear \nenergy came up. I made a statement that I was worried about the \ndisposal of nuclear waste. I felt very strongly that until we knew what \nwe were going to do with the nuclear waste, we had better not continue \n\n[[Page S 9752]]\n\nto build nuclear power plants. This was way back in the 1970's.\n  A utility industry person came up to me, drew me aside, and said, \n``You know, young lady''-- or something like that--he said, ``There may \nbe a problem. There may be a health problem from nuclear energy waste. \nBut no matter what you say, no matter what you do, it will not show up \nfor 20 years and no one can prove it was us.''\n  I will never forget that. I looked at him. I said, ``When people get \ncancer, they are going to look to the environment. They are going to \nlook to what we are doing with that nuclear waste.'' And he said, \n``They will never pin it on us.''\n  That is a bad actor. That is a bad actor. Who was I? I was just an \nindividual at this conference who was concerned. He would never say \nthat to me today. But he said it to me a long time ago.\n  So when you think about what we are doing here, you have to think \nabout the bad actors. The majority of people are not that way. They \ncare about their products. Of course, they do. But when you have a bad \nactor, you have to be sure that that bad actor gets punished. And I \nbelieve under the Dole bill, with the petitions, with the look-backs, \nwith the judicial review provisions, we will allow any well-financed \nbad actor to paralyze an agency, to prevent the agency from developing \nnew rules, to prevent them from reviewing old rules, to force a stay on \nenforcement of rules and cause the eventual sunset of rules. To me, it \nis completely unacceptable. I am not casting aspersion at those who \nlike those provisions, but to me they will lead to gridlock. You might \nas well just repeal the laws if you are going to make it so hard for \npeople to act.\n  I also believe the Dole provisions on so-called supplemental decision \ncriteria create a supermandate that supersedes current law. Now, \nsupporters of this deny it. They insist it is not the intent to \nsupersede but merely to supplement the decisional criteria in other \nstatutes. However, the bill clearly overrides other statutes including \nour health, safety and environmental laws because the standards in Dole \nwould still have to be met even if they were in conflict with current \nlaw.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Was the Senator aware of the amendment which was \naccepted yesterday, the one which was cosponsored by Senator Levin, \nwhich specifically says that the bill does not override the \nrequirements of any environmental law?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If that amendment passed, I stand corrected, and I am \nvery pleased.\n  It covers all laws then or just environmental laws?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. All requirements of laws including environmental safety \nand health laws.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Very good. Well, that is an improvement, and I am glad \nthat it passed. By the way, there will be many other amendments that \nwill improve this bill including the Daschle amendment.\n  The Dole bill, in my view, goes well beyond sensible reform by \nestablishing a goal that is absolutely at odds with our responsibility \nto improve the well-being of all the American people. It says that we \nshould protect only those values that can be measured in dollars and \ncents. It is a corporate bean counter's dream. This is my view. Forget \nabout saving lives, because you cannot put a dollar figure on a life. \nForget about getting poison out of our air and water. Forget about \npreventing birth defects, infertility, and cancer. If you cannot put a \nprice tag on it, it does not count as a benefit. And that is wrong.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator familiar with provisions of the Dole-\nJohnston bill now before the Senate which state that the head of an \nagency can choose a more expensive alternative if nonquantifiable \nbenefits to health and safety of the environment make that appropriate \nand in the public interest?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, yes, but that is so inadequate for \nwhat I am talking about and it gets back to my conversation I had with \nthe Senator on another issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thought the Senator just said it was impossible to \nconsider nonquantifiable benefits.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I said very clearly that in this bill there is no way you \ncan put a price tag on those benefits. Now, if you give a bureaucrat a \nchance to assert his or her own opinion, it is better than nothing. But \nin my opinion, it does not meet the test. I think that we should be \nable to consider that and not leave it up to some bureaucrat.\n  That is the problem I have with this bill. On E. coli, my friend says \nDan Glickman will be wonderful. Great. What if it is another \nadministration? I think we should legislate and not give up our power \nhere. And I think we do that to a great degree.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. How does the Senator suggest that we legislate with \nrespect to----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think we could be very clear and talk about it, if we \ncould, after I finish my statement, on how I think we can measure and \nquantify these benefits. If my friend is willing, I will definitely \npropose an amendment that would reach to those issues.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would invite my colleague to read the language which \nwe have put in. It provides that benefits include all quantifiable and \nnonquantifiable benefits. So they are all brought in. I think it is \nreally very clear. I invite the Senator to read that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would invite my friend to read the substitute bill \nbecause I think on this point it is much stronger when it deals with \ncosts and benefits.\n  Now, I think Senator Glenn, who is a hero already--in other words, if \nhe did nothing more in his life in the public arena, he would go down \nas a hero for what he has done in forging the advancement of space. We \nknow that. He is already a hero. He is a hero for what he does here \nalso. And as he says, maybe this is boring, but I have to say I do not \nthink it is that boring. I do not think it is boring if your kid bites \ninto a hamburger and is rushed to the hospital. Not only does it ruin \nyour day, but it could ruin your life and he could lose his life.\n  I guess I would say to my friend from Louisiana, who is questioning \nmy views on this bill, which is his right to do, we have a bill that \npassed out of the committee with a bipartisan vote, and now we are \nfacing a bill which, in my opinion, does harm to the health and safety \nrules. So I think Senator Glenn is right in what he does in relation to \ncost-benefit analysis, in relation to judicial review, and in the many \nproblems that we have with this bill.\n  I wish to talk about another area of the Dole bill that I think my \nfriend from Louisiana supports, which is the provision on toxic release \ninventory, which I think would significantly undermine a community's \nright to know who is polluting and what kind of toxics are being \nreleased into the air. The toxic release inventory is an effective cost \nsaving tool. Public scrutiny as a result of the information released \nunder the 1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act has \noften prompted industry to lower pollution levels without the need for \nnew Government regulations. The Glenn-Chafee bill has no such \nprovision.\n  In this whole area of toxic relief, my God, if we should be \nprotecting anything here, it should be a community's right to know if \nsomeone is coming in and poisoning their neighborhood. Why should that \nbe a secret? Why should they not have the information? Information is \npower, and a lot of folks who stand up here, particularly on the other \nside of the aisle, and say States rights, give it all back to the \nStates, are going to support this alternative which takes away a \ncommunity's right to know. Information is power.\n  I think the Dole bill strips away that knowledge, and I think that is \nwrong.\n  I do not think this bill is boring. Oh, yes, the proponents of the \nDole bill will get you off on little sidebars here, but the whole issue \nis true, as I see it, and I am on the Environment Committee. I served \nin the House, and I know how these bills go. You had a bipartisan bill \nthat was fair and just. Was it perfect? Probably not. My friend pointed \nout an area where it was not perfect, and they are fixing it. But it \nreally worked to provide this balance the American people deserve--\nprotection of their water, of their air, of their food supply, of \n\n[[Page S 9753]]\n\ntheir very lives, if you will, balanced with sensible regulation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will my colleague yield at that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think we have lost it in the Dole bill.\n  Yes, I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We just had a discussion about benefits and how the \ndefinition of ``benefits'' in the Dole-Johnston bill was insufficient \nand how the Glenn bill was so much better.\n  Does my colleague understand that the definition of ``benefit'' in \nthe Glenn bill is word for word identical to that which is contained in \nthe Dole-Johnston bill, save for one change? At the behest of Democrats \nwe added the words ``quantifiable and nonquantifiable \neffects.'' That was Democrats who said, ``We want to be sure it \nincludes both quantifiable and nonquantifiable.'' So they added that \namendment. Does my colleague understand that? Excuse me, we also added \nthe word ``health.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding they are not alike. If the Senator \nwould like, when I finish I can put it side by side where they are not \nexactly alike.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will allow me to come over, I have got \nthem both right here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As soon as I finish my prepared remarks I will yield time \nto my friend, and we can go through it. Right now----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am looking at it right here.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am working on it. It is my understanding it is \ndefinitely not the same. I will show it to you in a moment's time. I do \nnot want to interrupt the flow of what I am saying. So if my friend \nwill wait, I think I will be finished in just a few minutes here. We \nwill go through the side by side of both bills on that issue of \nbenefits.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I am correct, will you acknowledge that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I have great respect for him. I told \nmy friend he is correct a couple times and incorrect a couple times. \nBut I will be glad to agree with my friend when I have the writing in \nfront of me. I am going to have it for you.\n  Now, I think another key aspect of the Dole bill is how it will \naffect our ability to respond quickly to the threats of public health, \nsafety and the environment. It is interesting that the majority leader, \nSenator Dole, has responded so quickly to concern about E. coli. Now, \nif I heard my friend right yesterday, he got up and said that the Dole \nbill was not necessary, the Dole amendment was unnecessary. I thought \nthat was really interesting. Senator Johnston says to Senator Dole that \nhis amendment on E. coli is not necessary. Then I ask, why did Senator \nDole put it forward? Because it was necessary, because under the \nemergency provisions it did not say ``food safety.''\n  And yet my friends were defending the bill as it was. ``Oh, it is \ncovered.'' I heard the colloquy that went on between the Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Louisiana. ``Oh, the Dole amendment is \nnot necessary. The Dole amendment on E. coli is not necessary. We will \nvote for it.''\n  Well, I am telling you, I am glad that the majority leader offered \nthat E. coli amendment because that opens the door to all of us who \nhave other issues we want exempt as well. Critically important \nregulations on cryptosporidium and mammograms that my friend \nfrom Massachusetts talked about. The Dole bill would delay and possibly \nprevent issuance of these regulations. And although my friend from \nLouisiana said it was not necessary to have the Dole language, he voted \nfor it. Well, if it was necessary for E. coli, I say it is necessary \nfor cryptosporidium. I say it is necessary for mammograms, and other \nareas.\n  Of course, we know that the Daschle amendment even goes further on E. \ncoli because it says that rule will be exempted from this bill. And my \nfriend from Louisiana stands up and says, we did not need this Daschle \namendment because under a substitute he is offering the E. coli rule \ncan move through. But he admits that the E. coli rule would still be \nsubjected to the lookback provisions of the bill, the sunset provisions \nof the bill, and the waiver provisions of the bill.\n  So in fact we do need Senator Daschle's amendment. And I hope my \ncolleagues will vote it in. Only those rules which represent an \nemergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in \nsignificant harm to the public would be exempt under that emergency \nsection. There is no definition of the term ``significant'' or \n``likely'' in the bill.\n  Now, I say if one child dies as a result of eating contaminated meat, \ndoes that pose a significant harm to the public? It certainly is \nsignificant to the child's parents and the others who ate at the same \nrestaurant or bought meat at the same grocery store. Now I want to show \nmy friends the number of outbreaks just recently of the bacteria E. \ncoli. It is enough to make your head spin. It is all across the \ncountry--North Dakota, Ohio, Nebraska, California, and so on, and so \non, and so on.\n  As a matter of fact, on this next chart I will show you a personal \ncase. I am going to talk about it. We want to put personal faces on \nthis. We get a lot of talk about section 103 and section 202 and line 4 \nand line 6. And does the Senator know this and does the Senator know \nthat? This Senator knows one thing. We should vote for the Daschle \namendment and get that E. coli rule, moving safely on its way not \nsubject to lookback and not subject to anything else. Let me tell you \nabout this child.\n  Jesse Fendorf, Shawnee, KS. Unfortunately, Jesse was almost killed by \ninfected meat contaminated by E. coli. To deal with this, Jesse had to \nhave many blood transfusions and was on kidney dialysis for 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks. Today he is still ill. Someday it is likely he is going to need \na kidney transplant. In the meantime, no one will sell his family any \ninsurance. Now, clearly under the Daschle amendment the rule on E. coli \nwould be exempted from the nightmare of this bill. It will go on its \nway and it will not be repealed. What if we get someone over there in \nAg that decides it ought to be repealed? The least we can do for this \nchild is pass the Daschle amendment--I will show you a few more faces.\n  Here are a few more faces. Alex Donley, Chicago, IL; Katie O'Connell, \nKearney, NJ; Scott Hinkley, Saranac, MI; Lauren Rudolph. E. coli in \nfood kills more than one victim each day. Who is next? Who is next?\n  Let me tell you about this case because it happens to be a \nconstituent. Six-year-old Lauren Rudolph of Carlsbad, CA, was the first \nperson to die on the west coast Jack-In-The-Box case of 1993. She \nsuffered three heart attacks and had to be put on life support before \nshe died. Her mother, Roni Rudolph, founded STOP, Safe Tables Our \nPriority, a national consumer watch group dedicated to improving our \nNation's meat and poultry safety.\n  I mean, you look at these kids, 1990 to 1992. I am not going to say \nany more about this. Just look at this and vote for the Daschle \namendment. Do not vote to weaken it. If a woman has her mammogram read \nby someone who is poorly trained in mammography and she dies as a \nresult of not getting help, is that significant harm to the public? \nThat is what you have to deal with in the Dole bill. There is no \ndefinition.\n  I will tell you right now, if it was a Senator's wife it sure would \nbe significant. If a Senator's wife died of cancer because of a faulty \nmammogram, I am sure it would be significant. Well, to me it is \nsignificant if anyone dies because of a faulty mammogram. And yet in \nthis bill we are going to derail these safety regulations.\n  We have to ensure that one of the most fundamental needs of any \nsociety--safe drinking water--is available to all Americans.\n  Public health continues to be threatened by contaminated drinking \nwater.\n  In 1987, 13,000 people became ill in Carrollton, GA, as a result of \nbacterial contamination in their drinking water. In 1990, 243 people \nbecame ill and 4 died as a result of E. coli bacteria in the drinking \nwater in Cabool, MO. In 1992, 15,000 people were sickened by \ncontaminated drinking water in Jackson County, OR. And 1 year ago, \n400,000 people in Milwaukee became ill and 104 died as a result of \ndrinking the water from their taps which was infected with \ncryptosporidium.\n  A recent study completed by the Natural Resources Defense Council \n``You Are What You Drink'' found that from a sampling of fewer than 100 \nutilities that responded to their inquiries, over \n\n[[Page S 9754]]\n45 million Americans drank water supplied by systems that found the \nunregulated contaminant cryptosporidium in their \nraw or treated water.\n  I am going to show you just a couple more charts and then complete my \nstatement because I know my friend is ready to talk. This is a real-\nlife warning that was distributed by the Environmental Protection \nAgency as guidance for people with severely weakened immune systems in \nterms of our water supply.\n  Current EPA drinking water safety standards were not explicitly \ndesigned to assure the removal or killing of cryptosporidium. Efforts \nare now under way to resolve a number of scientific uncertainties that \nwill enable EPA to set specific safety standards for this parasite in \nthe future. Cryptosporidium has recently caused several large \nwaterborne disease outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness with symptoms \nthat include diarrhea, nausea, and/or stomach cramps. People with \nseverely weakened immune systems are likely to have more severe and \nmore persistent symptoms than healthy individuals. Moreover, \ncryptosporidium has been a contributing cause of death in some \nimmunocompromised people.\n  People who have cancer, transplant patients, people on \nimmunosuppressant drugs, little children, pregnant women--these are the \nmost vulnerable.\n  This is what is going on in communities across the country, and we \nknow people in Milwaukee died of crypto sporidium in the water supply. \nDo we want to derail a rule that will get this killer out of the water \nsupply? I am sure every Senator would say, ``Oh, no, not me; I don't \nwant to do that.'' But if you support this Dole bill, that is what you \nare doing, because you are going to subject this rule to all kinds of \nanalyses and lookbacks, petitions, sunsets, judicial reviews, and all \nthe rest of it.\n  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal, and the author said, \n``Well, we know how to deal with this problem. Drink bottled water. Go \nto the store and for a few bucks, buy bottled water.''\n  Well, that is just swell, in a country like America where we are a \ndemocracy, we are going to have an environment that is safe for the \nwealthy, for those who can buy that bottled water. That is wonderful, \nis it not? What a society that would be. What an answer that is. That \nis almost as bad as James Watt in the old days under Ronald Reagan \nsaying, ``Well, if you don't want to get skin cancer, just wear a hat \nand put sunglasses on, because we're not going to do anything more in \nthe environment.''\n  That is not what this country is about. This country is about clean \nwater and clean air. We are the best. We are the best in the world. So \nlet us not vote for a back-door repeal of these laws by making it so \nvery difficult to implement them. I do not want to see these anymore. I \ndo not want people to be scared that they are going to die from \ndrinking water out of the tap. Why would we support a bill that will \nmake it more difficult to make the water safe? It just does not make \nsense.\n  We have a sound alternative. We have the Glenn-Chafee bill. We can be \nproud to support that. It takes care of our problems.\n  So whether it is mammograms, cryptosporidium in the water, E. coli--\nwe could go on--let us not hurt the American people by supporting a \nbill that makes no sense.\n  So I am proud to stand in support of the Daschle amendment on E. \ncoli. I am proud to stand in support of the Glenn-Chafee bill, and I am \nproud to stand in opposition to the Dole bill. This may sound like a \nboring debate, but when you strip away the arcane language of these \nbills, the bottom line is the safety and health of the American people.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, an effort has been made to use scare tactics \nto insinuate, to suggest, to expressly assert that those of us who are \nsupporting meaningful regulatory reform are somehow trying to prevent \nappropriate action being taken in the case of matters that affect the \nhealth, the safety of the American people or the environment.\n  Time after time, statements have been made that we cannot take action \nto protect the American people from E. coli, admittedly a serious \nproblem.\n  The reason I say it is scare tactics is the fact that the legislation \nbefore us very clearly deals with the situation. In fact, the \nlegislation proposed, the so-called Dole-Johnston amendment provided, \nthat a major rule may be adopted and may become effective without prior \ncompliance with this subchapter if ``(A) the agency for good cause \nfinds that conducting cost-benefit analysis is impracticable due to an \nemergency or health or safety threat or a food safety threat that is \nlikely to result in significant harm to the public or natural \nresources.''\n  So I think it is important to understand the basic legislation \nanticipated that there could be situations where there were serious \nthreats to health and safety, and because of the need for action, an \nexception would be made to the general rule of requiring a cost-benefit \nanalysis.\n  Let me point out further that that language does not require that it \nbe an emergency to fall within this exception, because the language \nspecifically provides that there is an exception to the rule requiring \ncost-benefit analysis in the case of, first, an emergency that stands \non its own feet--just the word ``emergency''--or health, that likewise \nstands on its own feet. So it does not need to be an emergency as long \nas it is a question of health. And the same thing, of course, could be \nsaid about a safety threat or a food safety threat. So that is point \nNo. 1.\n  But yesterday action was taken because of concern expressed by the \nSecretary of Agriculture that there was a problem with respect to a \nrule involving E. coli. So because of that concern expressed by the \nSecretary, as well as the many statements that were made in the media, \nthe press, the Senate adopted an amendment proposed by the majority \nleader that modified the language of which we just spoke and in which \nit expressly includes an imminent threat from E. coli. The language now \nreads:\n\n       A major rule may be adopted and may become effective \n     without prior compliance with this subchapter if\n       (A) the agency for good cause finds conducting a cost-\n     benefit analysis is impracticable due to an emergency or \n     health or safety threat or a food safety threat (including--\n\n  This is the new language--\n\n     (including an imminent threat from E. coli bacteria) that is \n     likely to result in significant harm to the public or natural \n     resources. . . .\n\n  This legislation was adopted by a unanimous vote, and Senators, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, made it very clear that it was not an \nattempt in any way to prevent or threaten the issuance of a rule \naffecting E. coli.\n  Subsequently, there were concerns expressed again by the Secretary of \nAgriculture that the legislation unanimously adopted yesterday did not \ncover two situations that he saw as being burdensome or troublesome.\n  One was that under the amendment yesterday, it did not exempt his \nbeing required to take or make a risk assessment under subchapter 3 of \nthe legislation, and that as part of the risk assessment, it would \nbecome necessary to have a peer review. Such peer review, the assertion \nwas made, might delay the issuance of the rule by as much as 6 months.\n  So, once again, we are here on the floor seeking to allay this \nconcern. And that is, of course, the purpose of the Johnston-Hatch-Roth \namendment.\n  Under the Johnston-Hatch-Roth amendment, two steps are taken. It is \nspecifically provided that a new risk assessment for the final rule \nneed not be made if the final rule is substantially similar to the \nproposed rule. In other words, when you propose a major rule, there has \nto be a risk assessment made. And so if the situation is such that the \nfinal rule is very similar to the proposed rule, under this \nlegislation, it would not be necessary for a new risk assessment to be \nmade.\n  So that takes care of the problem. In fact, I point out to my \ndistinguished colleagues that this legislation or this proposal, this \namendment, very substantially modifies the burden on agencies because \nthis modification not only applies to E. coli, but is a general rule, \nso that any time in the future when the \n\n[[Page S 9755]]\nfinal rule, the final major rule, is substantially like the proposed \nrule, a new risk assessment would not have to be made for the reasons I \nhave already mentioned.\n  The amendment, of course, goes further and provides that \nnotwithstanding any provision of the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform \nAct of 1995 and the amendments made by such act, including section 9 of \nsuch act, any rule for which a notice of proposed rulemaking was filed \nbefore April 1, 1995, shall not be subject to the provisions of this \nsubchapter or subchapter 3, except for section 623 relating to review \nof rules.\n  As I understand it, the proposed notice of proposed rulemaking in the \ncase of E. coli was back in February, so the fact that this paragraph \nexempts any rulemaking where the notice of proposed rulemaking was \nfiled before that date, again, ensures that action can be taken in the \ncase of E. coli.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Louisiana for his authorship of \nthis legislation and I think, once again, we have addressed the \nproblems that have been raised. I suspect that tomorrow, we will have \nsome new problem because of the efforts on the part of some to use \nscare tactics.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that the pending regulatory reform \nlegislation, S. 343, has been poorly understood and mischaracterized at \ntimes. This legislation, the product of bipartisan compromise, the work \nof four committee chairmen, including myself, is vitally important to \nrestoring some common sense in the regulatory process.\n  Simply put, the Dole-Johnston compromise would require regulators to \nissue regulations whose benefits justify their costs, unless existing \nstatutory instructions prevent that.\n  This legislation will lead to a more efficient, a more effective \nregulatory process. But a number of recent statements misconstrue this \nlegislation. I have, of course, just been addressing the \nmisinterpretations, the scare tactics that have been used in the case \nof E. coli, which is a good example of the recent statements that have \nbeen made that are misconstruing this most important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let me take a few minutes to address some of these myths. First, S. \n343 would not roll back environmental standards and does not--and I \nunderscore the word ``not''--contain a supermandate. Section 624 of S. \n343 contains the cost-benefit decisional criteria. Section 624 clearly \nstates that the cost-benefit requirements shall supplement and not \nsupersede another existing statutory instruction.\n  Section 624 merely requires regulators to pick a regulation whose \nbenefits justify its costs, unless the statute authorizing the rule \ndoes not allow such an option. This is, in my judgment, just plain \ncommon sense.\n  Now, S. 343 also gives fair and equal treatment to environmental \nconsiderations and nonquantifiable benefits. The definition of benefits \nin section 621(2) clearly shows that in determining whether the \nbenefits of a rule justify its cost, an agency should consider \nenvironmental, social, and health benefits. The agency also does not \nhave to quantify all costs and benefits. Nonquantifiable factors count, \ntoo. S. 343 merely calls for a reasoned decision from the agency as to \nwhether the benefits of a rule justify its cost, considering all \nrelevant costs and benefits.\n  I might just point out the importance of the word ``justify.'' It \ndoes not mean that benefits have to outweigh costs. The word \n``justify'' is much less strict than that.\n  Now, to deal with emergencies where an agency must issue regulations \nquickly to respond to immediate threats to human health, safety, or the \nenvironment, S. 343 contains emergency exemption from risk assessment \nand cost-benefit requirements in sections 632(c)(1)(A) and 622(f).\n  S. 343 will not roll back environmental standards. S. 343 will not \ncause undue litigation and will not clog the courts with lawsuits. S. \n343 has limited judicial review.\n  In fact, it does not allow the normal level of judicial review that \napplies to laws as a matter of due course under section 706 of the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  Section 625 of S. 343 provides that an agency's failure to comply \nwith S. 343 may only be reviewed by a court in the context of the whole \nrulemaking record under the very, very, deferential ``arbitrary and \ncapricious'' standard.\n  A court cannot overturn a rule because an agency fails to comply with \nsome unimportant procedure in doing a risk assessment or cost-benefit \nanalysis. In other words, a court cannot nit-pick an agency for minor \nprocedural missteps in doing the required analysis.\n  Only if an agency's failure to comply with S. 343 is so glaring as to \nrender the rule arbitrary and capricious can a court overturn a rule.\n  Three, the process for reviewing old regulations under S. 343 will \nnot overload the agencies or clog up the courts with litigation. \nSection 623 of S. 343 is designed to allow for the reform or \nelimination of inefficient, outdated, or ineffective rules already on \nthe books. Again, this is a commonsense solution.\n  We should look at the old rules that do not make sense and try to \nreform them. Leave the other rules alone.\n  Section 623 allows each agency to choose any rule it thinks should be \nreviewed and place them on a review schedule. The agencies have up to \n11 years to review these rules and decide whether they should be \ncontinued, reformed, or terminated.\n  In addition, a petitioner can request that the agency review any \noverlooked major rules within the first 3 years of the schedule. But to \nlimit the number of petitions, S. 343 requires any petitioner to meet a \nvery high burden of proof. That is, that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the rule should not meet the cost-benefit test in \nsection 624 of the legislation.\n  This is a heavy burden of proof that will require substantial \nsupporting documentation. But if a petitioner cares enough about a \npoorly written rule to prove that the benefits do not justify its cost, \nor that it otherwise fails the cost-benefit decisional criteria, why \nshould we not review that rule?\n  Mr. President, section 623 is a fair, workable, and sensible solution \nto the thorny issue of reviewing existing rules.\n  In sum, Mr. President, when we look closely at how S. 343 would work, \nwe can see it would achieve its intended goal--a more efficient and \neffective regulatory system. It will give us more bang for the buck, \nallowing Americans to achieve greater benefits at less cost. S. 343 \nwill benefit everyone while providing needed protection for the \nenvironment, health, and safety. S. 343 will provide smarter \nregulation. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to begin, Mr. President, by stating my \nsupport for the consideration of appropriate regulatory reform \nlegislation in the U.S. Senate.\n  I do believe our regulatory process is in need of repair. I would \nlike to compliment the majority leader and the Senator from Louisiana \nfor trying to craft a bill that will reform a regulatory process that, \nno doubt, has and will continue to serve an important purpose, but has \ntoo often infuriated and frustrated a growing number of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I have held over 175 town meetings in my home State of \nWisconsin during the past 2\\1/2\\ years. Many times I have had \nconstituents stand up at the meetings and express their tremendous \nfrustration and anger with the regulatory process that, too often, \nreally, is impractical and impersonal and needlessly burdensome and, of \ncourse, many times, costly.\n  The regulatory process affects just about every American one way or \nanother. It may be the factory owner who is trying to comply with a \nFederal workplace safety regulation. It might be a young couple \nshopping for a car safety seat for their child. Or it may be the \nmillions of Americans who sit down every April and have the pleasure of \ntrying to decipher the Rube Goldberg guidelines and rules known as our \nFederal Tax Code.\n  It is clearly in all of our interests to make sure we have a \nregulatory structure that is effective, efficient, and sensible.\n  Mr. President, though this does not mean that we should entirely \ndismantle the regulatory process--that is not a solution, because the \nregulatory process serves as a protective watchdog over the health and \nsafety of every person in this Nation. It is responsible for \n\n[[Page S 9756]]\nhelping to ensure that we have cleaner air, cleaner water, and safer \nproducts.\n  I am constantly reminded of the need for regulatory reform by \nconstituents who approach me with their concerns with the process. \nUnfortunately, I am also occasionally reminded by other kinds of \nincidents, Mr. President, incidents in my home State that illustrate \njust how important appropriate Government regulation really is.\n  Mr. President, it was just 2 years ago, in 1993, when an outbreak of \ncryptosporidium in the Milwaukee municipal water supply left 104 people \ndead and over 400,000 people seriously ill. Over 100 people, Mr. \nPresident, died from a single incidence of a water supply that became \ncontaminated. That was a tragic reminder of how just one little crack \nin the regulatory process can have devastating consequences for a huge \ncommunity that until then had never experienced any problems of any \nproportion of that kind.\n  Mr. President, that is why I am equally concerned about the impact of \nthis legislation on future regulations. I am particularly concerned \nabout the Government's ability to protect our drinking water, as it is \nclear that cryptosporidium, considered Milwaukee's problem in 1993, is \nnow the country's problem.\n  On June 16, 1995, the Washington Post reported that cryptosporidium \nis now commonly found in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs all across this \ncountry. The Centers for Disease Control has warned that drinking tap \nwater could be fatal to Americans with weakened immune systems, which \nthe center estimates could number as many as 6 million Americans.\n  The city of Milwaukee itself now notifies at-risk populations of \ndetections of cryptosporidium in municipal water, contacting hospitals, \nAIDS care facilities, institutions that service the metropolitan area's \nelderly, informing all those with fragile immune systems, so they may \nbe able to protect themselves.\n  The city of Milwaukee is engaged in a multitier approach to \ninvestigating whether cryptosporidium is present in the drinking water: \nTesting occurs at the facility for the parasite, particulates, and \nturbidity of the water are used as indicators, and the city has \nestablished a network to monitor disease outbreaks that suggest \nindividuals have been exposed to cryptosporidium.\n  However, it is not only those with fragile immune systems that \nexperience health problems when exposed to cryptosporidium. As I said, \nover 400,000 people of all states of health became ill in Milwaukee \nitself. That is a very significant percentage of the population. And \nover 100 died following the city's cryptosporidium outbreak in April \n1993. So I have observed firsthand the lingering health problems \nMilwaukee citizens continue to face.\n  Solutions to the problem of cryptosporidium will have to address \nnonpoint sources of pollution, and both the new $50 million threshold \ncontained in the original draft of this legislation or the $100 \nmillion, and the assumptions that are made about risk characterization \nmay impair our abilities to address this problem and sufficiently \nprotect our water supply.\n  It is problems such as this that illustrate the consequences--\nsometimes fatal consequences--that are in store for the American people \nif a stranglehold is applied to the regulatory process.\n  We should also remember that there are scores of other regulations \nthat go through without controversy and should not be caught in a big \nnet that would require needless scientific evaluation and analysis that \nwould impede their promulgation.\n  Indeed, sometimes Government regulations can be deregulatory in \nnature, such as those regulations that would clarify and simplify the \nFederal Tax Code, or regulations that might be associated with Federal \nlegislation to reduce paperwork burdens for small businesses. That is \nthe direction of many of our regulations today.\n  Last year, the Federal Election Commission promulgated a regulation \nthat prohibits Members of Congress from converting campaign \ncontributions into their own personal rainy day slush funds. That is a \ngood regulation and the sort that should not be impeded by unnecessary \ncost-benefit analyses and risk assessments.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs will soon be issuing guidelines \nfor determining eligibility for certain benefits for veterans of the \nGulf war who have experienced symptoms of the mysterious illness known \nas the Persian Gulf syndrome. Again, this is a regulation that I do not \nthink anyone would want to be slowed by new process requirements.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission has thankfully kept thousands \nof dangerous toys off the market that could be harmful to children. The \nDepartment of Agriculture is considering long overdue regulations to \nimprove and modernize the Federal meat inspection system.\n  I think such changes are crucial if we are to improve the level of \nprotection provided to the American people from bacterial food-borne\n diseases that can in the worst cases result in death for our most \nvulnerable population.\n\n  There are clearly a large number of regulations that need to be \nimplemented and should be implemented in a relatively quick and \nefficient manner. Such regulations are critical for protecting the \nhealth and safety of this Nation.\n  As others have correctly pointed out, this issue has a tradition of \nbeing handled in a bipartisan fashion in the U.S. Senate. In 1982, the \nSenate approved S. 1080, the Leahy-Laxalt legislation by a 94 to zero \nmargin.\n  Then, just 3 months ago, the Government Affairs approved a bill by a \nmargin of 15 to zero that the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen, \nreferred to as a restoration of common sense.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that was considered by the committee I serve \non, the Judiciary Committee, was much more than any sort of reform \nbill. I had the feeling it was not a reform bill--it was a dismantling \nbill. A dismantling of our regulatory framework. It is not the sort of \nbill that I believe the American people would support if they knew all \nthe details.\n  I am pleased that some of the excessive provisions of that \nlegislation have been dropped and are not a part of the latest Dole-\nJohnston package. Unfortunately, the Dole-Johnston proposal, as I \nunderstand how it currently stands, does contain several provisions \nthat I believe could hamstring the ability of Government agencies to \nadequately protect the health and safety of the American people. I know \nthe Senator from Louisiana has strong feelings about this, but let me \njust mention a couple of my concerns. I will certainly listen to any \nresponses he has, as the days goes on.\n  I think the issue of judicial review and how it has been addressed in \ndifferent proposals best illustrates the difference between how you can \nimprove the regulatory process and how you can paralyze the regulatory \nprocess.\n  Let me say at the outset that I support the ability of a person \nsubject to a government regulation to ask a court to review the \nrulemaking record and determine if an agency has followed the proper \nprocedures for issuing a regulation. I have always supported the \nconcept of expanding an individual's access to our judicial system.\n  What I do not support is allowing a well-financed business interest \nwith a legion of attorneys to file continuous lawsuits to paralyze an \nagency and prevent that agency from issuing a rule that will benefit \nthe consumers, working people, children, and families of this country.\n  I find it interesting that just a couple of months ago this body \nfound itself in a frenzy to clamp down on the supposed litigation \nexplosion in product liability cases. So when we are talking about \ndefective products that a manufacturer knowingly markets, those on the \nother side want to limit an injured consumer's access to the judicial \nsystem.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am glad my friend from Wisconsin raised the question \nof judicial review because, indeed, in the original Judiciary Committee \nbill, I believe it did open up areas to litigation on procedural \nmatters on the question of compliance with the risk assessment \nprotocol. And I think it did have the possibility of tying things up in \ncourt.\n  But the present Dole-Johnston bill provides that compliance with risk \nassessment and cost-benefit may be considered by the court, and I am \nquoting \n\n[[Page S 9757]]\nnow, ``solely for the purpose of determining whether the final agency \naction''--that is the rule itself--``is arbitrary and capricious or an \nabuse of discretion.'' The key words here are ``solely for the purpose \nof determining whether the final agency action is arbitrary and \ncapricious or an abuse of discretion.''\n  The final agency action is appealable anyway, under the present law. \nThis simply makes the risk assessment protocol part of the record which \nmay be considered only in connection with the final agency action.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I know he truly has \nmade a good-faith effort to improve these provisions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point a \nletter from the U.S. Department of Justice to the majority leader, \ndated July 11, 1995, from Mr. John Schmidt.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Associate \n           Attorney General,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: This letter provides the views of the \n     Department of Justice on the judicial review provisions of \n     the substitute amendment to S. 343, the Comprehensive \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1995.\n       As the agency with responsibility for representing the \n     United States and its various agencies in the courts, the \n     Department is obviously concerned whenever proposed \n     legislation has the potential to result in a large number of \n     new cases being introduced into the court system or in an \n     expansion of issues required to be litigated in cases which \n     are filed. Any proposal that covers nearly 100 pages of \n     legislative text and imposes significant new requirements on \n     every agency in the federal government, as S. 343 does, is \n     bound to increase substantially the volume of federal \n     litigation, and the complexity of cases which are litigated, \n     unless judicial review of agency compliance is carefully \n     delineated and controlled. Unfortunately, the numerous \n     judicial review provisions contained in S. 343 provide a host \n     of new opportunities for challenges to agency actions by \n     regulated entities and other participants in the regulatory \n     process. Because these provisions would increase the volume \n     and complexity of federal litigation arising out of the \n     regulatory process, adding burdens which are inconsistent \n     with the fundamental goals of this legislation, the \n     Department opposes the adoption of the Dole-Johnston-Hatch \n     bill.\n       There are at least eight different provisions contained in \n     the substitute amendment that provide separate statutory \n     grounds for judicial review and which, in total, provide for \n     the courts to review a wide range of decisions made by the \n     agencies in the process of promulgating rules. The provisions \n     are: section 625, establishing review of cost/benefit \n     analyses and risk assessments as well as major rule \n     determinations; section 5, amending 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706, \n     establishing new standards under the Administrative Procedure \n     Act for review; section 4(b), amending 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 604 \n     and 611, establishing greater judicial review under the\n      Regulatory Flexibility Act; section 3, amending 5 U.S.C. \n     553(m); section 623(e), establishing judicial review of \n     compliance with agency regulatory review rules; section \n     623(g), establishing the right to petition the courts to \n     extend the review period for a rule; section 623(h), \n     providing that an agency decision not to modify a major \n     rule is a final agency action and thus subject to judicial \n     review; and section 623(j), providing that an agency \n     decision to continue or repeal a major rule is a final \n     agency action and thus subject to review. How these \n     various provisions relate to each other provides an \n     additional layer of complexity that will undoubtedly be \n     raised in the courts as well.\n       There are three provisions that are particularly \n     troublesome:\n\n\n          review of cost/benefit analyses and risk assessments\n\n       Section 625 provides for judicial review of an agency's \n     compliance with S. 343's subchapters on cost/benefit and risk \n     analyses. The language in the substitute appears to be a \n     significant improvement over that contained in the bill \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee; however, it will \n     continue to allow litigation over complex procedural \n     requirements to be filed on every major rule.\n       There remain two basic problems which create the potential \n     for litigation under section 625. First, section 625 provides \n     that ``failure to comply with [the rules pertaining to cost/\n     benefit and risk analyses] may be considered by the court \n     solely for the purpose of determining whether the final \n     agency action is arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of \n     discretion.'' When this section is read in conjunction with \n     the extraordinarily detailed and prescriptive requirements \n     for risk assessments and cost/benefit analyses contained \n     elsewhere in the bill, it is clear that the alleged failure \n     to comply with any of those requirements will be the subject \n     of litigation. Petitioners will surely argue that failure to \n     comply with the extensive procedural requirements is itself \n     arbitrary and capricious.\n       This concern is compounded by the second problem. The \n     decisional criteria in section 624 generally prohibit \n     promulgation of a rule unless the agency head finds that it \n     adopts the least cost alternative of the alternatives meeting \n     the applicable criteria in section 624(b) or (c). Thus, the \n     agency's choice is limited to a single alternative, not a \n     range of\n      reasonable alternatives. And while the bill dictates this \n     choice, it fails to acknowledge that the tools of risk \n     assessment or cost-benefit analysis inevitably produce \n     estimates which are subject to dispute between reasonable \n     people. Given the premise that only a single outcome is \n     legally permissible, any of the underlying estimates may \n     be outcome determinative. Thus, the combination of strict \n     decisional criteria and judicial review creates a \n     situation in which non-compliance with any of the many \n     procedural steps mandated by the legislation could well be \n     challenged as constituting an abuse of discretion.\n       Another issue that should be noted is the provision in \n     625(e) permitting interlocutory review of agency \n     determinations that a rule is not a major rule. By allowing \n     interlocutory challenges, the bill will potentially allow \n     entities to frustrate the regulatory process with piecemeal \n     litigation.\n       The Department strongly recommends language for section 625 \n     similar to that in Sec. 626 of the Glenn/Chafee alternative \n     that would limit judicial review to whether a rule has been \n     properly classified as a major rule and to whether a risk \n     assessment or cost-benefit analysis has been conducted. Only \n     with this type of provision for narrowly-circumscribed \n     judicial review can we avoid the risk of embroiling every new \n     rule in a complex new layer of litigation and judicial \n     decisionmaking--thereby undermining the goal of simplifying \n     and improving the regulatory process which is the fundamental \n     objective of this legislation.\n\n\n                        APA Standards of Review\n\n       Section 5 of the Dole-Johnston-Hatch substitute would amend \n     5 U.S.C. Sec. 706 to alter the Administrative Procedure Act \n     standards of judicial review. In particular, it would amend \n     section 706(a)(2)(F) in a manner that could be read to \n     replace the current ``arbitrary and capricious'' standard of \n     review of agency finding of fact in informal rulemaking with \n     a new requirement that there be ``substantial support in the \n     rulemaking file, viewed as a whole, for the asserted or \n     necessary factual basis.'' The practical effect of this \n     change is unclear. However, we are concerned that it would \n     make the informal rulemaking process slower and more \n     burdensome, and increase the amount and complexity of \n     litigation over agency rules, without significantly improving \n     the quality of the rules. Furthermore, it simply is not \n     necessary to amend these provisions of the APA in order to \n     meet the goals of this legislation, i.e. to ensure\n      the best available science is brought to the regulatory \n     process and to ensure that regulatory agencies consider \n     the costs and benefits of rules before they are imposed.\n\n\n             review of regulatory flexibility requirements\n\n       The Administration supports reasonable judicial review of \n     compliance with regulatory flexibility requirements. However, \n     section 4(b) of the substitute substantially rewrites the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act to impose a supermandate which \n     will foster endless and needless litigation over whether a \n     rule ``minimizes significant economic impact on small \n     entities to the maximum extent possible.'' That provision, \n     combined with the new standards for judicial review contained \n     in section 4(b), will encourage even more litigation and open \n     many rules to attack. We are particularly concerned that this \n     provision also allows interlocutory challenges to proposed \n     rules. In addition, the provision would expand review to \n     situations in which the agency neither certified the rule nor \n     prepared a preliminary or final analysis. This would arguably \n     extend judicial review beyond the Regulatory Flexibility Act \n     to general matters concerning compliance with the notice and \n     public procedure requirements of the APA, for which judicial \n     review already exists. Further, the one year period for \n     seeking judicial review is too long and invites entities to \n     layer challenges to regulations instead of bringing all such \n     challenges by the time otherwise required for APA review.\n       We are also concerned by the provision which mandates that \n     a rule be stayed if the agency has not completely complied, \n     within 90 days, with a court order to prepare a regulatory \n     flexibility analysis or take other corrective action. This \n     would apply even to technical errors, to failure to comply \n     with the deadline by just one day, and to situations where \n     ninety days would simply be insufficient time to comply. This \n     is inconsistent with APA practice which lodges discretion in \n     the judiciary to determine whether a stay of a rule or, in \n     the alternative, an extension of time to comply, would be \n     appropriate under the particular circumstances.\n       For the reasons set forth above, the Department strongly \n     opposes adoption of the Dole-Johnston-Hatch bill.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this letter from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John R. Schmidt.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that does certainly acknowledge--in \nfact, I will read the language--the fact that \n\n[[Page S 9758]]\nthere is improvement but there are still complexities involved. The \nletter states, in part, on page 2, that:\n\n       Section 625 provides for judicial review of an agency's \n     compliance with S. 343's subchapters on cost/benefit and risk \n     analyses. The language in the substitute appears to be a \n     significant improvement over that contained in the bill \n     reported by the Judiciary Committee; however, it will \n     continue to allow litigation over complex procedural \n     requirements to be filed on every major rule.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I recognize the Senator from Louisiana is \nattempting to address this. I have not finally concluded that he has \nnot addressed it completely. But the Department of Justice still \nbelieves the complexity involved here, I think it is fair to say, could \ninvite a great deal of litigation and, I fear, give quite an advantage \nto the large interests that are more likely to have the attorneys and \nthe wherewithal to fight these battles and jam up the regulatory \nprocess.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I want to be certain I understood, the Senator asked that \nthe letter be printed in the Record; is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I did ask unanimous consent it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. GLENN. I think that is good, because a moment ago the Senator \nfrom Louisiana was talking about how the judicial review requirements \nhave been cut back, yet this letter from the Justice Department points \nout eight separate areas for judicial review, and lists them very \nspecifically. They also list the areas that give them particular \nconcern: Review of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessments, the APA \nstandards of review, and the review of regulatory flexibility \nrequirements.\n  I know this is a lengthy letter. They give it in detail. But to those \nwho think we are not increasing judicial challenges with S. 343, I \nthink they should read this.\n  This is a letter dated July 11 to the majority leader. It spells out \nin great detail the specific provisions in S. 343 that will result in \nunnecessary judicial review. That is the opinion of Department of \nJustice.\n  I am glad the Senator is putting that in the Record.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  I recognize that the Senator from Louisiana made a real effort to \nimprove this process. I think he made a fair comment earlier today. It \nis not a sufficient response to his effort to simply say this bill goes \ntoo far. You have to be able to point out where it may go too far. I \nagree with the Senator from Ohio. Perhaps the guidance of the \nDepartment of Justice identifies those areas of continuing concern that \nwe have to address before we make a final judgment about whether this \nbill is in the right shape to be the vehicle for regulatory reform that \nwe all wish.\n  Let me continue. I have noticed in the 104th Congress the tremendous \ndesire in this body when it came to product liability to limit \nlitigation, to unclog the courts. That was the real focus of that bill. \nThat was the justification frankly for something I thought took away \nthe rights of a lot of people to potentially sue for damages and get \ntheir fair return and being made whole after they have been hurt by a \nproduct.\n  I notice that those who support changing our habeas corpus laws \nbelieve that a prisoner awaiting execution should be given one shot and \none shot only at having his case reviewed by a high court. So \napparently when we are ready to take a person's life away--and in too \nmany cases an innocent person's life--the other side wants to again \nlimit access to courts.\n  But when corporate America and well-financed business interests are \ninvolved, those on the other side--I want to be cautious here--suddenly \nwant to enable those interests to file lawsuit after lawsuit after \nlawsuit.\n  There is something wrong here. Do we try to unclog the courts or not?\n  When you take a close look at some of the judicial review proposals \nthat are out there, you begin to wonder what the litigation departments \nof the Federal agencies are going to begin to look like should any of \nthese proposals become law.\n  How many attorneys are the agencies going to have to hire as they \nfind themselves becoming more familiar with a courtroom than they are \nwith their own offices? How many attorneys and other staff are the \nagencies going to have to hire to deal with the mountain of petitions \nthat will pour into the agencies should the wrong bill be passed?\n  We do not know the exact answers to these questions. But considering \nthe tremendous effort that the Clinton administration has made to \nshrink the size of Government--the smallest it has been since the \nKennedy administration--considering the tremendous gains made by the \nVice President's reinventing Government effort and considering the \nlegislation passed last year that will reduce the size of the Federal \nwork force by 250,000 employees, I think we should be extremely careful \nnot to pass legislation that will nullify the progress that has been \nmade on cutting back on the size of the Government.\n  I do not want to make these Federal agencies bigger than they need to \nbe. I do not want to have to vote on larger appropriation bills each \nyear to finance new Government bureaucrats and all of these procedural \nrequirements and scientific analyses they must complete to meet the \nrequirements of this bill.\n And to get the work of the Government done. I do not think that is \nwhat the American people had in mind when they hear words such as \n``reform'' and ``efficiency.''\n\n  I am also concerned about the several provisions in this bill that \nseem to have little to do with the notion of reforming the regulatory \nprocess.\n  In fact, S. 343, the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, as \nintroduced by the majority leader on February 2, was just 32 pages \nlong. That bill contained what many believe are the key ingredients of \na strong regulatory reform bill. It contained requirements for cost-\nbenefit analyses, it contained requirements to perform risk \nassessments.\n  It had judicial review and it had a mechanism for those who are being \nregulated to petition an agency to review an existing regulation.\n  Interestingly enough, the underlying legislation we are considering \ntoday has bloated to nearly 100 pages. It still has cost-benefit \nanalyses, risk assessment, judicial review, a petition process and many \nother provisions originally a part of S. 343 as it was first \nintroduced. But a host of new provisions, many of which have little or \nnothing to do with reforming the regulatory process, have been thrown \ninto this pot luck legislation that has tripled in length since \noriginally introduced.\n  One example is the effective repeal of the Delaney clause in this \nlegislation. The Delaney clause, as many observers agree, is no longer \nconsistent with modern scientific methods of detecting residues of \npesticides, fungicides and insecticides on processed foods.\n  The zero-risk standard prevents use of chemicals that have been used \nfor many years simply because new technology allows us to more easily \ndetect minute levels of residues.\n  It provides for an inconsistent standard for EPA to set tolerances \nfor pesticide residues in processed foods versus raw foods.\n  The current law does not provide for consideration of actual \nconsumption patterns of various foods nor does it take into account the \ndietary intakes of different segments of our population.\n  And it only addresses cancer risk, rather than other potential health \neffects of food additives. These are problems that should be addressed.\n  However, despite these problems with the Delaney clause, a stand \nalone repeal of the provision--as included in the Dole-Johnston \nlegislation--will do nothing to improve the safety of our food supply \nand simply does not belong in legislation intended to address the \ninadequacies of the existing regulatory process.\n  The fact is that there are incredibly complex and important issues \nthat should be considered as a package of pesticide reform legislation \nin the appropriate committees.\n  When I served on the Agriculture Committee, I had a change to hear \nvery compelling testimony on the types of ranges of issues that should \nbe included.\n  For example, farmers fear that more and more of their crop protection \nchemicals will be taken without adequate alternatives. This issue needs \nto be addressed. But repealing Delaney only allows some chemicals to \nremain on the market--it does nothing to address the environmental side \nof the \n\n[[Page S 9759]]\nequation that farmers are faced with on a regular basis.\n  Farmers also want to know that so-called minor use pesticides will \ncontinue to be available--they want reregistration to be made less \nburdensome and yet consumers want to be assured that those chemicals \nare safe despite potentially expedited registration processes. \nRepealing Delaney does not address this so-called ``minor use'' issue.\n  Consumers also want to know that the way in which we set tolerances \nfor chemicals used in food production takes into account the needs of \nour most vulnerable populations infants and children.\n  This is what we heard so much about in the Agriculture Committee. A \nlot of studies and flies are based on adult males, not necessarily on \nthe tolerances that children can absorb of certain pesticides and \nsubstances. Again, repealing Delaney does not address that issue.\n  Consumers want to know that all health risks have been addressed in \nthe process of setting tolerances for chemicals, reproductive and \ndevelopmental impacts as well as carcinogenic risks. Repealing Delaney \ndoes not solve that problem.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that there is a lot of work that \nneeds to be done with respect to the regulation of chemicals used in \nfood production and processing by the EPA and the FDA. But that sort of \nreform needs to be done as part of a comprehensive package that \naddresses the issues of importance to manufacturers, food processors, \nfarmers and consumers.\n  It should not be inserted as a phantom paragraph in a hundred-page \nbill that seeks to reform the process by which regulations are issued.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate my sincere and spirited support for \nreforming the regulatory process that is currently in place. I do not \nbelieve that the current system is acceptable--the need for reform is \nclear and imperative.\n  I think what we need is to rededicate ourselves to finding that \nproper balance between needed health, safety and environmental \nsafeguards, and granting greater relief to those who are being \nregulated by rules that have little or no rational basis.\n  I hope that as this bill is considered now and in the coming days, \nthat Members from both sides of the aisle can get together, roll up our \nsleeves and find an alternative\n that really does achieve the balance that I think we can support.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I wish to specifically address the Johnston \nsubstitute for the Daschle amendment that was proposed earlier today.\n  Let me say in starting out that I agree with Senator Johnston's \nintent. I wish there was some other way to do this. I wish that what he \nis proposing was a freestanding amendment; I could probably vote for \nit. I do not want to commit to that at this point, but it would make it \nmuch more palatable if it was put in in the form of a freestanding \namendment instead of trying to replace Senator Daschle's amendment.\n  I agree with Senator Johnston completely that we want to cut down on \na repeat of expensive procedures, and that is what he attempts to do \nwith this amendment.\n  I also understand his concern that he put this in to replace the \nDaschle proposal because he is afraid that, if the Daschle proposal \npasses with specific reference to food pathogens such as E. coli, \nsalmonella, and so on, and this passes, it opens the door to a lot of \nother rules--cryptosporidium and a lot of other proposals. There is \nalmost no end to the number of things that could be brought up as \nexceptions to S. 343, so I appreciate that.\n  At the same time, having said that, I disagree with replacing the \nDaschle amendment and disagree specifically with the proposal by my \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, for the following reasons.\n  The first involves risk. The Department of Agriculture informs us \nthat whether or not they have to do a second risk assessment at the \nfinal rule stage, they will not in any event be able to say that the \nrisk assessment that they have already done, which the Senator from \nLouisiana refers to, complies with the requirements of S. 343 as it \nwould be amended by the Dole-Johnston substitute. They would have to go \nback and comply with S. 343, such things as least-cost analysis, new \nprocedures for cost-benefit analysis, and every one of these steps is \nsubject to judicial challenge along the way. So it changes things \ndramatically.\n  The Department of Agriculture says they could not just use the old \ninformation that they already have developed because there are now new \nrequirements in S. 343, so it just would not work. This part of Senator \nJohnston's second-degree amendment does nothing to protect the issuance \nof USDA's meat inspection rule. It just would not do it. So that is the \nfirst point.\n  The second point. Moving the effective date to April 1 for new \nproposed rules is certainly an improvement from an across-the-board, \nimmediate effective date. I agree with that. Unfortunately, I do not \nbelieve it is enough. The requirements of this bill cannot be met \nwithin a few weeks or even a few months because the new rulemaking \nprocedures, new least-cost rule criteria, preparing for a new level of \njudicial review, these all require months and months and months of new \nextra work.\n  So this new proposed effective date will let already-issued proposed \nrules through the process without delay. It will, however, effectively \nstop all other new rules that are in the pipeline. Agencies will have \nto go back and start over with their proposals.\n  Now, this is not right. And it will delay a large number of health \nand safety rules and just waste agency resources.\n  Now, lest we think this is just my opinion and I am making this up, \nlet me give a few examples that have come to us so far. This is not a \ncomplete listing by any means, but by setting April 1, which the \nJohnston proposal does now, we then cut out such things as some of the \nmammography regulations; we cut out some with regard to flammability \nstandards for upholstered furniture; we cut out some regulations with \nregard to cables and lead wires that particularly protect children. \nThese are just three examples here of rules that would not go into \neffect, would not be exempted by the April 1 deadline.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator requesting that I withdraw the second-\ndegree amendment and vote up or down on the Daschle amendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. No. I said that I was sorry that the Senator's amendment \nwas not proposed as a completely separate amendment, that we should let \nthe Daschle amendment go and have a vote of its own, and that I might \neven be able to support the Senator's proposal. I favor the general \nproposal of trying to cut out unnecessary paperwork, unnecessary risk \nanalysis, unnecessary cost-benefit analysis, to cut those out and to \nprevent duplicate paperwork. Now, I would have to go through and read \nyour amendment to be specific.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would the Senator rather go ahead and vote on Daschle \nright now and propose it as a separate amendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would have preferred that. I said that earlier this \nmorning in our private conversation. What I objected to specifically \nwas cutting Daschle out for what he proposed. This substitute for \nDaschle is not a second-degree amendment. It substitutes for Daschle.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, I am \ninclined at this point to pull down the amendment. Frankly, it is \nlikely that there will be another second-degree amendment which will \nnot include the April 1 cutoff date. I am now advised that the April 1 \ncutoff date, even though agreed to by some on the other side of the \naisle, has not been cleared, so in any event it would not pass. I think \nthat is very unfortunate because I think it was a complete fix for this \nrule as well as other rules.\n  But if my colleague from Ohio wants it withdrawn and my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle want it withdrawn, it is not going to pass \nanyway, \n\n[[Page S 9760]]\nso if that is what I am being asked to do--I want to be sure that if I \ndo this now, that is what everybody wants to do.\n  The Senator from Ohio would like that done?\n  Mr. GLENN. I have made my comments about it earlier. I am not \nadvising the Senator what to do. I had my objections this morning that \nyour amendment did away with Daschle. That has been my concern all the \nway through this, because I think his amendment is good. I think it \ncorrects the inadequacy of the amendment that we passed yesterday.\n  I support the Daschle amendment for all the reasons I stated earlier \nin the Chamber today. If the Senator wants a vote on his amendment, we \ncan have a vote on his amendment. I think there are some problems with \nit that I was about to go into in more detail. If he wishes to withdraw \nhis amendment, then we could proceed with Daschle.\n  Mr. President, while the other conversations are going on, I will \nproceed with some of these examples of what would happen if we set the \n1 April date that is proposed in the Johnston amendment.\n  Here is one on mammography that would not fit under the exemption; it \nwould be held up; it would be delayed. Let me read this.\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act--MQSA, as it is called--of 1992 \nrequires the establishment of quality standards for mammography \nclinics, covering quality of films produced, training for clinic \npersonnel, recordkeeping, and equipment. MQSA resulted from concerns \nabout the quality of mammography services that women rely upon for \nearly detection of breast cancer. FDA is planning to publish proposed \nregulations to implement the MQSA. The potential magnitude of these \nregulations is substantial. Improving the quality of mammography \ntranslates directly into early detection of breast cancer, and earlier \ndetection of breast cancer increases the likelihood of successful \ntreatment and survival.\n  An interim rule in this regard was published December 21, 1993, and \npublication of the proposed regulations is planned for October 1995. \nUnder the Johnston amendment, the Johnston replacement for the Daschle \namendment, this is well after the 1 April deadline so this would not be \nexempted. They would have to go back then and redo all of their \nprevious analyses under the new guidelines, the new directions given in \nS. 343--unnecessary delays, and all the work that has been done \nalready, unnecessarily so.\n  Let me bring up another one that is different: Flammability standard \nfor upholstered furniture. The Commission is in the process of \ndeveloping a proposed flammability standard for upholstered furniture. \nThe purpose of the standard is to reduce the deaths and injuries that \nresult from fire incidents involving upholstered furniture started by \nsmall open flames--matches, candles, lighters, so on.\n  The beneficiary of the rule: The potential victims of house fires \nwould benefit from this rule. In 1992, there were an estimated 80 \ndeaths, 490 injuries, $48.3 million worth of property damage associated \nwith open-flame ignition of upholstered furniture. A substantial \nportion of these are believed to be related to small flame sources.\n  The impact of S. 343 would keep the Commission from doing the work \nnecessary to develop this standard until after the moratorium period. \nThe delay could result in additional fire-related injuries and deaths \nthat could have been avoided.\n  Now the date: The Commission issued an advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking on June 15, 1994, and is working toward a proposed rule. \nWhen that would be put out would obviously be after the April 1 \ndeadline.\n  Let me give another example: cables and lead wires. The Food and Drug \nAdministration has proposed a regulation to require that cables which \nconnect patients to a variety of monitoring and diagnostic devices be \ndesigned so that the cables cannot be plugged directly into a power \nsource or electrical outlet.\n  The agency has received several reports of death and injury resulting \nfrom misuse of these devices, including one death and two cases of \nserious electrical burns when unsupervised children plugged cables from \na home apnea monitor into outlets; one death in a hospital when \nelectrocardiogram cables were plugged into an infusion pump power cord; \nand a death when a neonatal monitor's lead wires were plugged into a \npower cord for another device.\n  Advance notice of proposed rulemaking was issued on May 19, 1994. The \nproposed rule was published June 21, 1995, comments to be received by \nSeptember 8, 1995. Obviously, that would not go into effect. It would \nnot be permitted to go into effect without all the additional analyses \nprovided in S. 343.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to have a reasonable effective date, I \nthink we should do what we have in the Glenn-Chafee bill. We should put \nthe effective date out 6 months beyond passage of the legislation to \nallow agencies some reasonable time to put into place the new \nrequirements to administer the legislation.\n  The amendment proposed may let the meat inspection rule through; too \nmany others will still be stopped, including these I just mentioned.\n  Another example. There are also some other problems with S. 343. \nThere is a general problem illustrated by the debate today and \nyesterday. The amendments offered yesterday, and Senator Johnston's \nsecond-degree amendment this morning, show without a doubt that the \nproponents of S. 343--and I think they know it--have a less than \nsatisfactory bill. They know it is a bad bill. I think it goes too far, \nand I think they also know it goes too far, because each time we get \nclose to raising issues or offering amendments, as happened yesterday, \nthey leap up to modify their own bill to avoid the inevitable \nconclusion on the floor that their bill is flawed.\n  I think the bill they brought to the floor would harm public health \nand safety. They may not be willing to admit that, but I think they \nknow it is true nevertheless, and the examples I gave this morning of \nwhat would happen to the change to it that is proposed by the Johnston \namendment, which replaces the proposal made by Senator Daschle earlier \ntoday, would go further in that direction, as I see it.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out one other thing. We talk about \nthese amendments and rules and regulations and what would be required \nof the agencies to comply with the requirements of this bill.\n  Let me start off by saying that in committee, we had testimony that \nthe estimate is that for each major rule and regulation that is put out \nunder the version of regulatory reform that passed the House, it would \ncost somewhere around $700,000 to put the rule out. That was questioned \nby some people when I brought that out on the floor yesterday, and we \ndiscussed it in private back here. But let me give an example.\n  The Clean Water Act was passed back in 1972. There was an amendment \nto it later in 1972. There was another amendment to the Clean Water Act \nin 1977, and another one in 1987. It has been 8 years from 1987 to the \npresent time. Just one regulation put out pursuant to that Clean Water \nAct, and I do not have a listing of how many regs were put out overall. \nBut one regulation, that pertaining to effluent limitation guidelines \nand standards for metal products and machinery put out under that act, \nhas taken 8 years to do.\n  This thick document that I hold before you is just the index for it. \nIt just went into effect April 1995. That is just the index. I wish we \nhad time to go through all these pages. These are single-spaced pages, \none after the other, all the requirements.\n  This is just the development document for how they were going to go \nabout it. This is pursuant to laws that we passed. If we want to see \nwho is at fault for a lot of this, look in the mirror.\n  This is just a development document for the proposed effluent \nguidelines and standards for the metal products and machinery phase I \npoint source category. That is just one regulation.\n  Do you know how much shelf space is taken up with that one \nregulation, that one single regulation put out pursuant to what we \npassed here in the Clean Water Act? I stepped off the width of this \nChamber a while ago, and it comes out to somewhere around 112 to 115 \nfeet of pacing here. That one regulation has shelf space of 123 feet \njust for the documents involved with one regulation. \n\n[[Page S 9761]]\nYet, we passed yesterday afternoon a new requirement in this bill that \nwould open it up for hundreds and hundreds of new regulations that \nwould have to meet the requirements of S. 343.\n  Now, sometimes I do not think we know what we are doing around here. \nIn other words, just the shelf space for this regulation would be about \n10 feet longer than from that wall to this wall in the Senate Chamber. \nI know anybody that happens to be watching this discussion on TV does \nnot have an idea of what this dimension is here. But it is about 45 \npaces across here to get that kind of distance, taking about a yard per \npace. That is one regulation we are talking about, under the Clean \nWater Act.\n  I do not know how many regulations are required. I think there are \nprobably several hundred. I do not know the exact number, but I am sure \nthere are at least several hundred under the Clean Water Act that we \npassed right here. Can they cut back on that and can they get by with \n60 feet of shelf space? I do not know. I know that what we are going to \nrequire with this legislation whole new requirements, a whole new cost-\nbenefit analysis, whole new risk assessment, least cost analysis--that \nmeans agencies have to develop a number of additional options to see \nwhich one is least costly. You cannot make more judgment and say we go \nwith the one we think is most likely to be successful and exercise some \ncommonsense judgment. Now we are going to have to develop several \noptions under each one of these things, and we will probably double \nthat space across the Chamber that would be needed to hold all these \nanalyses.\n  That is just an example of what we are requiring here with some of \nthis legislation. At the same time, we are talking about cutting down \nthe agencies, cutting back on their budget, cutting people, getting \npeople out of Government. Through our actions here, we are loading on \nadditional requirements that are almost unbelievable. Can you imagine \none regulation that requires 123 feet of shelf space and requires \ndocuments like I held up here just for the index?\n  That is just one under the Clean Water Act of 1972. And the \nsubsequent amendments, and the final amendment that requires this was \nput out 8 years ago, and the final rule is coming out in 1995.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very concerned about where we go with this. I \nthink we take a much more logical approach with S. 1001, the Glenn-\nChafee bill. We would not leave out certain things, such as I mentioned \nhere on mammography; flammability regulations, which protect families \nin homes; on the cables and lead wires; medical machinery, and so on. \nThose would all be left out in S. 1001. They would have to go back and \ngo through this whole process over again if we passed the amendment \nsubmitted by the Senator from Louisiana to S. 343.\n  So, for all these reasons I have just given, I oppose this. I hope we \ncan have, but I do not know whether the Senator from Louisiana still \nwants, a vote on his amendment. He talked about possibly withdrawing it \nso we can get on with a vote on the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the July \n17, 1995 Business Week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Are Regs Bleeding the Economy?\n\n       To the Republican Congress, regulations are like a red cape \n     waved in front of a raging bull. ``Our regulatory process is \n     out of control,'' says House Science Committee Chairman \n     Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.). He and other GOP leaders charge \n     that nonsensical federal rules cripple the economy, kill \n     jobs, and sap innovation. That's often true: Companies must \n     spend enormous sums making toxic-waste sites' soil clean \n     enough to eat or extracting tiny pockets of asbestos from \n     behind thick walls.\n       That's why GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill want to impose a \n     seemingly simple test. In a House bill passed earlier this \n     year and a Senate measure scheduled for a floor vote in July, \n     legislators demand that no major regulation be issued unless \n     bureaucrats can show that the benefits justify the costs. \n     ``The regulatory state imposes $500 billion of burdensome \n     costs on the economy each year, and it is simply common sense \n     to call for some consideration of costs when regulations are \n     issued,'' says Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.).\n       That sounds eminently reasonable. But there's a serious \n     flaw, according to most experts in cost-benefit calculations. \n     ``The lesson from doing this kind of analysis is that it's \n     hard to get it right,'' explains economist Dale Hattis of \n     Clark University. It's so hard, in fact, that estimates of \n     costs and benefits may vary by factors of a hundred or even a \n     thousand. That's enough to make the same regulation appear to \n     be a tremendous bargain in one study and a grievous burden in \n     the next. ``If lawmakers think cost-benefit analysis will \n     give the right answers, they are deluding themselves,'' says \n     Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, chairman of the community medicine \n     department at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.\n       There's a greater problem: The results from these analyses \n     typically make regulations look far more menacing than they \n     are in practice. Costs figured when a regulation is issued \n     ``almost without exception are a profound overestimate of the \n     final costs,'' says Nicholas A. Ashford, a technology policy \n     expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For one \n     thing, there's a tendency by the affected industry to \n     exaggerate the regulatory hardship, thereby overstating the \n     costs.\n       More important, Ashford and others say, flexibly written \n     regulations can stimulate companies to find efficient \n     solutions. Even critics of federal regulation, such as Murray \n     L. Weidenbaum of Washington University, point to this effect. \n     ``If it really comes out of your profits, you will rack your \n     brains to reduce the cost,'' he explains. That's why many \n     experts say the $500 billion cost of regulation, bandied \n     about by Dole and others, is way too high.\n       Take foundries that use resins as binders in mold-making. \n     When the Occupational Safety & Health Administration issued a \n     new standard for worker exposure to the toxic chemical \n     formaldehyde in 1987, costs to the industry were pegged at \n     $10 million per year. The assumption was that factories would \n     have to install ventilation systems to waft away the \n     offending fumes, says MIT economist Robert Stone, who studied \n     the regulation's impact for a forthcoming report of the \n     congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).\n\n\n                              bottom lines\n\n       Instead, foundry suppliers modified the resins, slashing \n     the amount of formaldehyde. In the end, ``the costs were \n     negligible for most firms,'' says Stone. What's more, the \n     changes boosted the global competitiveness of the U.S. \n     foundry supply and equipment industry, making the regulation \n     a large net plus, he argues.\n       While federal rules that improve bottom lines are rare, \n     regulatory costs turn out to be far lower than estimated in \n     case after case (table). In 1990, the price tag for reducing \n     emissions of sulfur dioxide--the cause of acid rain--was \n     pegged at $1,000 per ton by utilities, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and Congress. Yet today the cost is $140 \n     per ton, judging from the open-market, price for the \n     alternative, the right to emit a ton of the gas. Robert J. \n     McWhorter, senior vice-president for generation and \n     transmission at Ohio Edison Co., says the expense could rise \n     to $250 when the next round of controls kicks in, ``but no \n     one expects to get to $1,000.'' The reason: Low-sulfur coal \n     got cheaper, enabling utilities to avoid costly scrubbers for \n     dirty coal.\n       Likewise, meeting 1975 worker-exposure standards for vinyl \n     chloride, a major ingredient of plastics, ``was nothing like \n     the catastrophe the industry predicted,'' says Clark \n     University's Hattis. He found in a study he did while at MIT \n     that companies developed technology that boosted productivity \n     while lowering worker exposure.\n       Of course, it's possible to find examples of underestimated \n     regulatory costs. And even critics of the GOP regulatory \n     reform bills aren't suggesting that cost-benefit analysis is \n     worthless. ``We should use it as a tool'' to get a general \n     sense of a rule's range of possible effects, says Joan \n     Claybrook, president of the Ralph Nader-founded group Public \n     Citizen. But she and other critics strongly oppose the \n     Republican scheme to kill all regs that can't be justified by \n     a cost-benefit exercise. As a litmus test for regulation, \n     ``the uncertainties are too broad to make it terribly \n     useful,'' says Harvard University environmental-health \n     professor Joel Schwartz.\n       What is useful is moving away from a command-and-control \n     approach to regulation. There's widespread agreement among \n     companies and academic experts that bureaucrats should not \n     specify what technology companies must install. It's far \n     better simply to set a goal, then give industry enough time \n     to come up with clever solutions. ``We need the freedom to \n     choose the most economical way to meet the standard,'' \n     explains Alex Knauer, chairman of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. Krauer, for \n     example, points to new, cleaner, processes for producing \n     chemicals that end up being far cheaper than installing \n     expensive control technology at the end of the effluent pipe.\n\n\n                              dumb things\n\n       But when goals are being set for industry, the proposed \n     cost benefit analysis approach could have a perverse effect. \n     That's because agencies are rarely able to foresee the low-\n     pollution processes industries may concoct. Smoke-stack \n     scrubbers are a good example. The bean-counters will use the \n     known price of expensive scrubbers in their analyses. Their \n     cost-benefit calculations will then argue for less stringent \n     standards. And those won't help spark cheaper technology. The \n     result can be the worst of both worlds: costlier \n\n[[Page S 9762]]\n     regulation without significant pollution reductions. ``It's a vicious \n     circle,'' explains Stone, ``If you predict that the costs are \n     high, then you stimulate less of the innovation that can \n     bring costs down.''\n       There's no doubt reform is needed. ``Frankly, we have a lot \n     of dumb environmental regulations,'' says Harvard's Schwartz. \n     But he puts much of the blame on Congress for ordering \n     agencies to do dumb things. Now, Congress is tackling an \n     enormously complex issue without fully understanding the \n     ramifications, Schwartz and other critics worry. Overreliance \n     on cost-benefit analysis could make things worse for \n     business, workers and the environment.\n\n                Regulation Isn't Always a Costly Burden\n\n       Many regulations cost much less than expected because \n     industry finds cheap ways to comply with them.\n\n\n                              cotton dust\n\n       1978 regulations aimed at reducing brown lung disease \n     helped speed up modernization and automation and boost \n     productivity in the textile industry, making the cost of \n     meeting the standard far less than predicted.\n\n\n                             vinyl chloride\n\n       Reducing worker exposure to this carcinogen was predicted \n     to put a big chunk of the U.S. plastics industry out of \n     business. But automated technology cut exposures and boosted \n     productivity at a much lower cost.\n\n\n                               acid rain\n\n       Efficiencies in coal mining and shipping cut prices of low-\n     sulfer coal, reducing the need to clean up dirty coal with \n     costly scrubbers. So utilities spend just $140 per ton to \n     remove sulfur dioxide, vs,. the predicted $1,000.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Washington \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will speak on the floor later on the \nentire regulatory reform bill and its affect on the American public.\n  I rise today to speak specifically to the Daschle amendment because \nit affects me personally and I feel very strongly about it. The \nunderlying Daschle amendment on the floor for debate right now takes us \na step closer to protecting a particularly vulnerable segment of our \npopulation--our children--from the most American of foods, the \nhamburger.\n  The Center for Disease Control estimates that thousands of people \nbecome ill each year due to E. coli-contaminated meat. In fact, one of \nthe first tough issues I had to deal with upon my election to the U.S. \nSenate was visiting young children in hospitals in my hometown of \nSeattle and in Tacoma who had innocently eaten Jack in the Box \nhamburgers and then found themselves in critical condition after being \ninfected by E. coli. Three of those children died in that outbreak. All \nI could do was stand there and assure those families that I would try \nto do all I could to make sure that this would not happen to any other \nchild in our State or in this country.\n  Since that outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, this country has \nsuffered 50 outbreaks of E. coli in 23 other States. E. coli repeatedly \nappears in ground beef that has been inspected under current meat \ninspection methods.\n  But help is finally on the way. This past January, USDA proposed a \nnew meat inspection system that requires modern food handling \ntechniques, safe storage, and scientific testing at slaughter houses \nand meatpacking plants. I think we all know that such a revised \nregulatory system is long overdue. But I am afraid that even with the \namendment adopted yesterday by this body, this meat inspection \nregulation will be delayed because its opponents may--and very likely \nwill--petition and subject this rule to the cumbersome review required \nby this bill. And any delay in this vital regulation's implementation \nwill allow more children to become ill. Consequently, this Congress \ncould become responsible for the illness and perhaps the death of \nthousands of children in this country.\n  I do not pretend to be an expert on the intricacies of this \nregulatory reform bill. I do know, however, that I have given my word \nto families who have lost children due to our current regulatory \nsystem's failure. I promised them I would work to protect children from \nlethal food products. So I strongly support the Daschle amendment \nensuring the most expeditious implementation possible of E. coli \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, I intend to keep my word to the families who lost \nchildren in my State, who ate hamburgers that were tainted by E. coli. \nI intend to do it by voting for other amendments to S. 343 that will \nensure that the Government works efficiently and cost effectively and \nthat it will encourage general protection of human health and our \nenvironment.\n  We have to remember that it is our responsibility as the Nation's \nleaders to have commonsense protections in place and to ensure that \nthose are there for all of our constituents. So I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote for the Daschle amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have listened with some interest, as I am sure other \npeople have, while the distinguished Senator from Utah has come to the \nfloor with a list of egregious regulatory excesses, which I think he \nhas called his top 10 list of silly regulations. And as one listens to \nthose silly regulations, it is pretty easy to sit back and say, hey, \nthat is pretty silly. Why is my Government doing silly things like \nthat? It builds up resentment to regulations, and people say, wow, that \nis what this bill is all about. This bill will get rid of those silly \nregulations.\n  Now, the Senator from North Dakota is going to be here at some point \nin time, and he is going to discuss a few of the silly designations \nfrom the Senator from Utah. I would like to take on a couple, if I can, \nand I would like to try to substitute reality for the quick hit, easy \nperception. I begin that, Mr. President, by saying, as a number of us \nhave said on this side of the aisle for a number of days, there are \nexcesses in our regulatory process. And nobody in this Chamber denies \nthat, and nobody in this Chamber is going to deny the need to have \nregulatory reform. There are stupid things that happen, and when we \nfind them, we ought to get rid of them.\n  But what disturbs me, Mr. President, is to see an opportunity taken \nto label as sort of the top 10 silly items, items which when you look \nat them are not actually so silly after all or do not even fit or \nbelong in that kind of category.\n  Now, I would like to go through a couple of those and set the record \nstraight and factually look at some of the supposedly silly \nregulations, and perhaps my colleague from Utah would be willing to \nlook at the real language and acknowledge that there may be a rationale \nthere that has not been properly characterized in his top 10 silly \nlist.\n  I am reading from the Congressional Record of June 28 when the \nSenator from Utah talked about the Head Start Program. He pointed to a \nchurch in Harlem, the Abyssinian Baptist Church, that struggled ``for 4 \nyears to get approval for a Head Start program in a newly renovated \nbuilding. Most of those 4 long years was spent arguing with Federal \nbureaucrats concerning the dimensions of the rooms.''\n  Mr. President, that is the Senator's rhetoric. Here is the reality: \nAccording to the New York City Agency for Child Development, there are \nnot any Federal ordinances or regulations that apply to that building \nor to the rooms. None. Zero. In fact, it was local regulations--not \nFederal regulations--with which they were dealing and which were \nresponsible for the delays.\n  According to Richard Gonzalez, the Assistant Deputy Commissioner \nresponsible for running Head Start, ``The Federal Government did \nnothing to hold up this project.'' Yes, it took 4 years for the program \nto become operational, but the 4 years were not spent arguing about the \ndimensions of the rooms, they were spent finding sponsorship for the \nprogram; obtaining a lease agreement between the church, the owner of \nthe property, and the city of New York; and completing the license \nprocess with the various city agencies.\n  So we have rhetoric and we have reality. This is the reality, Mr. \nPresident. I submit that that greatly changes the perspective of the \nway in which we ought to approach this debate.\n  On the same day, June 28, the Senator from Utah cited the use of \nBraille on drive-through cash machines. Now, that is pretty silly on \nits face, is it not? It is nice to come to the floor of the Senate and \nmake fun of the notion that Braille is required on anything to \n\n[[Page S 9763]]\ndo with a drive-through machine because, obviously, blind people are \nnot driving.\n  That is basically the thrust of the comments that were made on the \nfloor. It sounds absurd and the rhetoric can make it pretty laughable, \nand people can get angry at regulations.\n  But what is the reality, Mr. President? The reality is that the \nbanking industry itself recognized the need for these machines for \npassengers and for walk-up users. There are plenty of places in America \nwhere you have just one machine at a facility and you have a walk-up/\ndrive-in teller, and people walk to the teller machine, just as they \ndrive up to it.\n  In point of fact, because many blind people or visually impaired \npeople do not want to be required to give up their privacy, they may be \nriding in a car and the car drives them to the automatic teller machine \n[ATM]. But they do not want to give their personal identification \nnumber to a stranger, so they get out of the car and they walk up and \nthey use the ATM machine.\n  What happened here on the floor is almost insulting to those who are \nvisually impaired, who have won the right which the banking industry \nhas suggested is necessary.\n  In discussing the regulation, this is what the American Banking \nAssociation said:\n\n       It is entirely conceivable and not unexpected that a \n     passenger may exit the automobile to use the drive-up ATM, \n     and this passenger may be an individual who is visually \n     impaired.\n\n  The American Foundation for the Blind brought to my attention that \ndespite what appears to be an obvious conclusion, blind or visually \nimpaired people do use drive-up ATM machines. They may take a cab to \nthe bank. They may ask a friend or a relative to drive them. But bank \ntransactions are very personal and they clearly want to contain their \npin number to themselves, so they say many times drive-up ATM machines \nare the only ones available after regular banking hours.\n  Now, the regulation that applies to this, Mr. President, only \nrequires one machine of several available to have the Braille. If that \nmachine is indoors, that satisfies the requirement. So there is no \nrequirement that a machine that is drive-up must have the Braille. The \nonly requirement is that one machine be available to the visually \nimpaired. Is that a silly requirement? Not quite as silly as the \nSenator seemed to want to make it out to be.\n  Another example of rhetoric versus reality: The Senator from Utah \nsaid that Government regulations on the sale of cabbage total almost \n30,000 words.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Government \nregulations on cabbage be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA\n\n\n                                general\n\n     Sec. 51.4120. General.\n\n       (a) The accompanying grades for cabbage are intended to \n     facilitate transactions between growers and processors who \n     may wish to use a purchasing system based upon the quality of \n     cabbage delivered. These grades are an out-growth of the \n     widely accepted principle that price should be directly \n     proportional to quality. The grower who delivers high quality \n     cabbage deserves a premium price because such cabbage enables \n     the processor to pack a better quality proudct.\n       (b) In the application of these standards it is assumed \n     that in most instances sellers will not sort their cabbage \n     into separate lots of U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 grades before \n     delivery to the buyer, and that the buyer will pay a certain \n     price for the percentage of each in the lot as determined by \n     inspection. Upon delivery, the inspector will simply sort \n     representative samples taken from each lot, and determine the \n     percentage of each grade. Final settlement would then be made \n     by applying the percentage of each grade to the total weight \n     of the lot, and then applying the contract prices established \n     for each grade. Under such a procedure, there is no need for \n     tolerances.\n       (c) It will be noted, however, that the standards provide \n     tolerances but these apply only when a grower or shipper has \n     actually sorted his cabbage into separate lots of U.S. No. 1 \n     and U.S. No. 2 grades before delivery to the buyer.\n\n\n                                 grades\n\n     Sec. 51.4121. U.S. No. 1.\n\n       ``U.S. No. 1'' consists of heads of cabbage which are firm, \n     and well trimmed; which are free from soft rot, seedstems, \n     and from damage caused by bursting, discoloration, freezing, \n     disease, birds, insects, mechanical or other means. Unless \n     otherwise specified, the weight of each head of cabbage shall \n     be not less than 3 pounds. (See Sec. 51.4124.)\n\n     Sec. 51.4122. U.S. No. 2.\n\n       ``U.S. No. 2'' consists of heads of cabbage which are not \n     soft; which are fairly well trimmed, free from soft rot, \n     seedstems, and from serious damage\n      caused by bursting, discoloration, freezing, disease, birds, \n     insects, mechanical or other means. Unless otherwise \n     specified, the weight of each head shall be not less than \n     2 pounds. (See Sec. 51.4124.)\n\n\n                                 culls\n\n     Sec. 51.4123  Culls.\n\n       ``Culls'' are heads of cabbage which do not meet the \n     requirements of either of the foregoing grades.\n\n\n                               tolerances\n\n     Sec. 51.424  Tolerances.\n\n       (a) For the purpose of determining compliance with one of \n     the foregoing grades the following tolerances, by weight, are \n     provided in order to allow for variations incident to proper \n     grading and handling:\n       (1) For defects. Ten percent for cabbage in any lot which \n     fails to meet the requirements of the grade, including \n     therein not more than 3 percent for cabbage which is affected \n     by soft rot and including in this latter amount not more than \n     1 percent for cabbage which is seriously damaged by soft rot.\n       (2) For size. Ten percent for cabbage in any lot which \n     fails to meet the specified minimum size.\n       (b) In the application of these standards to determine the \n     percentages of cabbage in any lot which meet the requirements \n     of the respective grades no tolerances apply.\n\n\n                              definitions\n\n     Sec. 51.4125  Well trimmed.\n\n       Well trimmed means that the head shall be free from loose \n     leaves and the stems shall be not longer than one-half inch. \n     Loose leaves shall be considered those leaves which do not \n     closely enfold the head. Heads of cabbage which show evidence \n     of having been well trimmed in the field shall be considered \n     as meeting the trimming requirements although they may have \n     some leaves which have become loose in the process of \n     ordinary handling.\n\n     Sec. 51.4126  Seedstems.\n\n       Seedstems means those heads which have seed stalks showing \n     or in which the formation of seed stalks has plainly begun.\n\n     Sec. 51.4127  Damage.\n\n       Damage means any defect, or any combination of defects, \n     which materially detracts from the processing quality of the \n     cabbage, or which cannot be removed in the ordinary process \n     of trimming without a loss of more than 5 percent, by weight, \n     in excess of that which would occur if the head of cabbage \n     were perfect.\n\n     Sec. 51.4128  Soft.\n\n       Soft means loosely formed or lacking compactness.\n\n     Sec. 51.4129  Serious damage.\n\n       Serious damage means any defect, or any combination of \n     defects, which seriously detracts from the processing quality \n     of the cabbage, or which cannot be removed in the ordinary \n     process of trimming without a loss of more than 15 percent, \n     by weight, in excess of that which would occur if the head of \n     cabbage were perfect.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. The Government regulations on cabbage, Mr. President, are \n1,808 words--only 208 words more than it took the Senator from Utah on \nJune 28 to describe the problems with the 30,000 words and other silly \nregulations that do not exist.\n  The truth is, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune:\n\n       That cabbage quote has been kicking around for years. . . \n     It cropped up as a Reader's Digest filler years ago. That is \n     where Ronald Reagan admitted finding it . . . and the thing \n     has obtained a life of its own.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Utah if he has actually read the regulations, \nthe 30,000 words, because here are 1,800 words, and what these 1,800 \nwords do, Mr. President, is establish a capacity for the Federal \nGovernment to guarantee that those who grow cabbage get the highest \nprice possible for the best cabbage by defining what will be the Grade \nNo. 1 of cabbage and defining subsequently what is Grade No. 2 of \ncabbage.\n  Farmers all across this country have appreciated and applauded the \nfact that a very precise definition of that standard exists, so that \nhigh-quality cabbage can command an appropriate price.\n  I would suggest, Mr. President, that this really frames the debate \nhere, in a sense. There is a rush to try to characterize very \nlegitimate regulations as somehow excessive or unwanted when, in fact, \nif we stop and take a look at them, there are a number of examples of \nhow these regulations assist people and make a difference to the lives \nof Americans.\n  I repeat, there are some silly regulations. Every Member knows that. \nWe ought to be engaged in a process here that allows Members to \nlegislate in a \n\n[[Page S 9764]]\nway that tries to get rid of those that are legitimately silly but also \nallows us to improve this bill and to eliminate provisions which seeks \nto do things that I do not think any American wants to do.\n  Let me give an example, Mr. President. There is a provision in this \nbill that weakens the toxics release inventory [TRI]. The TRI program \noriginated in 1986. This important sunshine law is the most successful \nvoluntary environmental program Congress has ever enacted. Yet all that \nthe toxics release inventory requires is a right-to-know. Because of \nTRI, emissions from facilities have decreased 42 percent nationwide \nsince 1988; a reduction of 2 billion pounds.\n  If you are a citizen living in your community, and you have a large \nchemical plant or a small chemical plant or some business entity, and \nit is discharging toxins into the environment, the current law does not \nrequire them to stop discharging; the current law does not require them \nto stop using chemicals. It does not require them to stop producing \nchemicals. It does not require them to stop selling chemicals. This \nsunshine law does not require anyone to reduce their use of chemicals \nin any way; TRI only requires that companies that use over 10,000 \npounds or produce over 25,000 pounds--a significant amount--of \nchemicals report the discharges from that usage on the TRI for everyone \nto see. It just requires them to tell the people in the community what \nthey are emitting.\n  I just came from a press conference where the head of the \nFirefighters Union, representing 200,000 firefighters in America, said \nif you get rid of this, you will cost firefighters lives and the lives \nof the citizens who they are trying to save. Fire departments need to \nbe able to plan, to know what kind of fire they are fighting in a \nparticular community. Under today's law, if you have a fire in a \ncommunity, because of the toxics release inventory, they just punch up \nthe information on the computer, and they can look at the business \nwhere they are going to fight the fire. They see precisely the kind of \nchemicals that are contained at that facility, and they know whether \nthey need gas masks, whether they need full chemical enclosures, \nwhether to expect an explosion, whether to evacuate. They know a whole \nseries of things in the public interest, Mr. President.\n  Since 1988, when the first reporting information was available, we \nhave reduced the chemical emissions in this country by 42 percent \nvoluntarily.\n  Some 2 billion pounds of chemicals have been taken out of the \nexposure stream to American citizens. We did not require it. There is \nno law that made it happen. But, because these companies were required \nto tell people what they were emitting, they began to better understand \nthemselves what the consequences were and they began to make some \ndifferent judgments; judgments about how best to prevent pollution, how \nto better use and conserve their raw materials in order to waste less; \nhow to make their processes more efficient and by so doing save money.\n  There is no rationale, there is no scientific argument, there is no \nacceptable health standard argument, there is no environmental argument \nfor coming in here in the Dole-Johnston bill and just throwing this out \nand creating a new risk-based standard that will require the 280 \nchemicals that were put on the list in November 1994 to suddenly be \navailable for review again, and for many of them to jump over a whole \nseries of tougher hurdles as to whether or not they will ever get back \non the list.\n  So I hope my colleagues will take a hard, hard look at the reality of \nsome of the provisions in this bill. I repeat, I would like to vote for \na regulatory reform bill. I know the Senator from Ohio would. We \nappreciate the opportunity to be able to legislate and make changes \nthat could improve this bill so we can do so. I am prepared to accept a \ncost-benefit evaluation and risk assessment standard in the analysis. I \nthink that is fair. I think it is important.\n  But we should not make it a standard which somehow precludes the \ncapacity of the rulemakers to make some rules, and of people to \ncontinue programs of good common sense.\n  Another example of what this bill is, it essentially eliminates the \nDelaney clause. The Delaney clause protects our citizens from being \nexposed to carcinogens in their food. The Dole-Johnston bill does not \ncome in and suggest a responsible fix. It does not come in and suggest \nwe can improve this in a thoughtful way that protects the health of \nchildren while reforming the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This bill \nlegislates changes preferred by one set of special interests and I hope \nthe U.S. Senate does not embrace this provision.\n  So, my hope is that we are going to keep our eye on the ball here, as \nwe listen to people denigrate--easily denigrate--regulations. I hope \nthat our approach to reform will be done with accuracy and reflect the \nreality of the benefits that accrue to Americans because many of these \nefforts will be used to guarantee standards by which products will be \nsold and Americans will live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we had hoped to set aside the underlying \nDaschle amendment, which would set aside with it the Johnston \nsubstitute amendment. But I understand the minority leader wishes to go \nahead with his amendment, so I regret to say the state of play is this.\n  I proposed a second-degree amendment which I believe totally and \ncompletely solves the problem and I have said to my colleagues, Why do \nyou not take ``yes'' for an answer? My colleagues on this side of the \naisle do not seem to want that ``yes'' for an answer. In the meantime, \nthe proposal that I had, which I thought was suitable on the Republican \nside of the aisle, apparently has some major problems there. And we \ncannot bring the bill down at this point.\n  So I suggest we go ahead and vote on the Johnston amendment, which I \nguess will be voted down by Republicans because it goes too far. It \nwill be voted down by Democrats because it does not go far enough. But \nI will vote for it because it solves the problem and I think that is \nwhat we want here.\n  In any event, I think we ought to go ahead and vote and get on with \nthe business so we can deal with some other amendments. Apparently the \nsuccessful ability to deal with this amendment is eluding us as we \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think the decision expressed by Senator \nJohnston to go ahead is one I concur with. I think we have had enough \ndebate on this, all parts of this--the Daschle proposal and the \nsubstitute Johnston amendment. We have gone through all of these issues \nthis morning. There have been a number of people who have come to the \nfloor and debated this.\n  I think we are ready for a vote. And I checked with Senator Daschle \nand he does prefer to have a vote on his. So we will just go ahead and \nvote through on both of them and see where we go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have had a good debate now over the \nlast several hours on this issue. I think there are probably four \npoints that need to be made.\n  First of all, we all recognize that the legislation we passed \nyesterday--the Dole amendment--really does not go far enough in \naddressing the concern that many of us have raised, that simply \ndelaying the implementation of the language for 180 days does not cut \nit. The Secretary has stated that. I think by and large most of our \ncolleagues now have come to that conclusion.\n  Point No. 2: The passive process is one that has moved to a point \nwhere implementation is necessary. We do not want to encumber the \nSecretary of Agriculture in attempting to address a very serious \nconcern having to do with meat inspection. We want the freest hand to \nenable him to do all that he \n\n[[Page S 9765]]\nought to be able to do, given all of the time that has already been \ninvested in this issue, to do so in a way that is meaningful, in a way \nthat ought to be accomplished as a result of the tremendous work done \nby the Department of Agriculture now in two administrations to reach \nthe point that we are today.\n  Point No. 3: There is a realization that the current language will \nencumber the Secretary's effort unless something happens, unless we \naddress through an amendment his ability to deal with all of the \ncomplexities of the passive system and to recognize that progress has \nbeen made, and that, indeed, we ought to give him the opportunity to do \nso regardless of what happens on this bill.\n  No. 4: In my view, the only way to do it, the only way to do it \ncleanly and without any equivocation, the only way to ensure that we \ncan do it without legal misinterpretation, without the regulation being \nsubjected to a good deal of litigation at some point in the future, is \nto pass the Daschle amendment, simply to exempt passive completely from \nthe bill.\n  Were we to do that, the Secretary would have the ability to move \nahead to do all that he needs to do to ensure that this rule can be \npromulgated now in a reasonable period of time. We can do so without \nany fear of litigation or bureaucratic complexity. We can do so with \nthe knowledge that the work that they have invested, all of the effort \nput forth now over at least the last 24 months, will not be for naught, \nthat we will actually accomplish what we all know we must do--protect \nfood safety, give the Department of Agriculture the tools that they \nneed to get the job done, ensure that this particular rule which has \ncome as far as it has can be promulgated without the fear at some point \nin the future of a new challenge, a new complexity that would encumber \nthe Secretary's opportunity to ensure that this rule is promulgated at \nsome point in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, for all of those reasons, it just seems to me that \nas well intended as the effort of the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana is, I am very concerned that at some point in the future the \nDepartment of Agriculture could be intimidated once again, could be \nencumbered in a number of different ways that were certainly not \nintended by the Senator from Louisiana or anybody else who indeed wants \nto resolve this problem. The best way to do it is to defeat the \nJohnston amendment, pass the Daschle amendment, and then move on to a \nnumber of other amendments that have been pending. There are a number \nof other Senators that have expressed to the Senator from Ohio an \ninterest in coming to the floor and offering their amendments.\n  We want to expedite consideration of this legislation. I think the \nbest way to ensure that we get on to some of these other amendments is \nto finally dispose of the Johnston amendment, pass the Daschle \namendment, and move on to these other proposals.\n  We are ready to go. We do not want to prolong this debate any longer \nthan it has to be, and certainly the best way to ensure that we do not \nprolong it is to dispose of it and to move on.\n  There has been some talk I know of yet another second-degree on the \nDaschle amendment. I hope that we can avoid that. I think after the \ngood debate that we have had we deserve an up-or-down vote. We have \nacted in good faith. We have not in any way attempted to obfuscate the \nissue or prolong the debate any longer than necessary. I think it has \nbeen an enlightened and educational effort.\n  So I think now having done all that we have in the last 5 hours, it \nis imperative that we simply finish this and move on to other issues. \nLet us do that. Let us have a vote on Johnston. Let us have a vote on \nDaschle. Let us get on with the other amendments that are ready to go. \nThat is the way I think we can ultimately finish this bill. The sooner \nwe get on with it, the better.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, let me be clear. The Johnston amendment \nfixes the problem of passive. It simply fixes it. Reasonable minds can \ndisagree about many things about this bill. There is no problem with \npassive going forward.\n  What the Johnston amendment says is that if you have already done a \ncost-benefit analysis and the rule has not changed, you do not have to \nredo it. And if you have promulgated your notice of proposed rulemaking \nprior to April 1 of this year, then you are exempted from cost-benefit \nor from risk assessment--very simple, very clear, very clear-cut. It \nfixes this problem.\n  We have had a lot of debate here about whether some woman who went to \nthe Jack-in-the-Box and ate some hamburgers and died, and all of this \nis going to kill her.\n  Mr. President, it fixes the problem. Now, unfortunately, the \namendment which was put forth on my behalf and with Senators Hatch and \nRoth and had a majority of support for a while, now, after having hung \nout there for a few hours, my friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave changed their minds, apparently some of them at least, with \nrespect to the April 1 date. They are concerned that now there will be \nthis flood of regulations which will be exempt from cost-benefit and \nrisk assessment.\n  It is very unfortunate, Mr. President, that both sides could not \nstick together; that on our side of the aisle we could not recognize \nthe fix which this is, and that the other side could not stick with \nwhat we thought was a deal. I fear what happens now is this whole \nbipartisan effort begins to come apart piece by piece--Democrats put \nforth a substitute and get 30-something votes, and the Republicans put \nforth their bill and it gets filibustered, and there we go.\n  We have to be able to come together, Mr. President, if we are going \nto pass this difficult legislation. We have to be able to come together \nin some sort of reasonable middle ground that solves the problem and \nstick to a deal. This is complicated enough. I found myself accepting \namendments from our side of the aisle, and then come back and be met \nfrom our side of the aisle with that amendment which we accepted on \ntheir behalf as being a fault of the legislation. That has happened not \nonce but several times.\n  We had a fix proposed from the other side of the aisle, and now they \nthought about it and that is not good enough.\n  That is not going to pass this bill. This is a very important bill. \nWe have people strung out all over the philosophical spectrum on this \nbill, and when we start putting forth amendments and then withdrawing \nthem, I fear the whole thing is going to come apart.\n  Mr. President, as I speak, there is still hope, and so I will yield \nthe floor at this point and hope we can pull this amendment back \ntogether and the coalition for reasonable regulatory reform will \nreform.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see both the distinguished leaders in the \nChamber.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask if I might be able to yield without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think both leaders are trying to determine how we can get \nto a vote. The Senator from South Dakota had an agreement where we \nwould by consent vote on the Johnston amendment, followed by a vote on \nthe Daschle amendment if Johnston was defeated; otherwise, it would be \nas amended, I assume.\n  I am not able to get that agreement, but I would be prepared to vote \non the Johnston amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont still retains the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield further, if I could do so without \nlosing my right to the floor. I do not intend to hold the floor very \nlong.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for me to \nrespond, I have no objection to having a vote on the Johnston \namendment, but at some point I think it would be fair to say that we \nwould like to have an up-or-down vote on the Daschle amendment. I do \nnot know if others may have second-degree or substitute amendments that \nthey wish to offer to this one. Obviously, that is anyone's right. But \nI think at some point it would be helpful if we could get a time \ncertain for an up-or-down vote so we could move on to other amendments. \n\n\n[[Page S 9766]]\n\n  I know the distinguished majority leader has urged us to try to move \nthis process along. In that interest, I think we have a few other \namendments that could be offered maybe even with some time limits. So \nto accommodate everyone it would be helpful if we could get a time \ncertain for a final vote on this one and move on to other amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator from Vermont will yield to me to respond to \nthe Democratic leader, I understand the suggestion. I think the Senator \nfrom South Dakota probably knows that if the Johnston amendment is \naccepted--I guess I could say first, would there be any objection to \njust accepting the Johnston amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Accepting the Johnston amendment? We would be opposed to \naccepting the Johnston amendment. We want a rollcall on that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. So if it were adopted, then we could vote \nimmediately then on the Daschle amendment, as modified. But if it were \ndefeated, there would be probably another second-degree amendment. I \nthink that is the only protection we would like to keep. There would be \nanother second-degree amendment to the Daschle amendment which might be \nsomething that the Senator from South Dakota could agree with, maybe \nnot. I am not certain.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator from Vermont will yield again, let me \njust say we have been working in good faith on both sides to try to \nresolve this issue, and I especially commend the two managers for their \nefforts in trying to accommodate everyone. I do not understand, \nfrankly, why it would not be in everyone's best interests just to have, \neven accept a tabling motion if that were the only option. But this \nprocess of second-degreeing all the amendments being offered precludes \nreally an opportunity to have a vote on an issue that is quite simple.\n  So I understand and again accept the right of any Senator to offer \nsecond-degrees, but we would hope on this one, given the debate we have \nhad, given the fact that we have had a good debate yesterday on the \nDole amendment--the Senator was protected with second-degrees on that \none--we could simply resolve this matter and go on to other amendments. \nI hope we would not have to have a second-degree on this one, too.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just want to be certain the Senator understands there \ncould be a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand that.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would not want to mislead the Senator. But could we then \nproceed, after the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from new \nVermont finish their statements, to vote on the Johnston amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. My point is that we could agree to that if we could also \nagree at some point to have an up-or-down vote on the Daschle \namendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Johnston amendment is accepted, then the question is \nmoot, of course,\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. So it would be hard to make an agreement until after we \ndispose of the Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Johnston amendment were not to pass, it would \nseem to me then the pending issue would be the Daschle amendment. And \nif that circumstance were to present itself, it would be helpful I \nthink if we could then have an agreement that that would be the next \nvote followed without any intervening debate, we would go right to that \nvote and resolve this issue. If we could do that, I think we would be \nprepared to go to the vote on the Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would have to check with other Members on this side \nbefore I could make that agreement. So maybe while they are debating, \nwe can make some determination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont still retains the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do. And I will speak only briefly, as I \nknow the leaders of this legislation want to go forward.\n  Mr. President, we have many, many issues on this bill, as we know, \nmany issues now and many to come. But we have one issue that we ought \nto understand, and that is, will our food here in the United States \ncontinue to be the safest in the world, which I believe it now is. I \nbelieve it now is the safest in the world and it should continue that \nway. I believe this is important to every American. It is not an issue \nof whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. You want to have safe \nfood. It is important certainly to every parent as it is to me as a \nparent because we know that children are uniquely vulnerable to \ncontaminated food. Many times the things that might just cause an adult \nto get sick can cause a child to die.\n  Safe food is important to our farmers and ranchers. It is how they \nmake their livelihood. They have to assume the consumers have \nconfidence that the food they raise will be the safest in the world. \nOur consumers need to have confidence in the safety of the meat they \nbuy or we can all understand how quickly they will stop buying that \nmeat.\n  In Vermont, meat is the real food that real people eat. It is not \njust some abstract question. In the United States, half of all farm \nrevenues come from livestock production. Ranchers and farmers cannot \nafford to have their incomes hit by another food scare. Beef prices, \nbelieve me, are low enough already. They will sink through the floor if \nwe have another scare, and that is why I am here.\n  In the last 10 years, we have been pushing the Agriculture Act to \nprotect the safety of our food supplies. As the past chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee I tried to pass legislation to reform our \nfood safety laws. Indeed, the legislation I proposed are very similar \nto the Department's proposed food safety rules.\n  If you look at the meat inspection laws we have now, they were put in \nplace after the Upton Sinclair book ``The Jungle'' that warned the \npublic of a threat to their food supply. That was decades and decades \nago.\n  Again, American people assume they walk into the grocery stores and \nbuy meat that is safe. We have built a whole industry. Our ranchers, \nour livestock, people, farmers, all assume this is in there, this sense \nof safety. Those who own the stores and distribute them, our \nrestaurants, fast food outlets, have to go on the assumption they are \npassing out safe food, and the American people assume that. And now we \nknow that we can do much better and that we should allow the American \npeople to have what is much better.\n  It is not an academic issue because, in spite of the best efforts of \nthousands of meat inspectors, there have been serious outbreaks of \nfoodborne disease. In 1986, an outbreak caused by the E. coli pathogen \nkilled two elderly women, sickened 37 persons in Washington State. \nTwenty-seven of them had eaten at the Taco Time restaurant in Walla \nWalla, WA. Two years ago another outbreak occurred in a Jack in the Box \nRestaurant. This foodborne illness outbreak, which began January 17, \n1993, made over 300 persons ill, resulting in the death of three \nchildren. At least one child, a 4-year-old girl, had a stroke caused by \nhemolytic uremic syndrome caused by the outbreak.\n  Now, these are serious matters. My full statement will put out a \nnumber of things on it. But it is why I support the underlying \namendment. I want to make sure that people have safe food, that our \nfarmers and ranchers, producers, and distributors are protected. That \nis why I support the Daschle amendment. I think the second-degree \namendment, with all due respect to my friend from Louisiana, I believe \nthat this really creates only a figleaf. It just says that any risk \nassessment previously done will continue to be valid.\n  That does not solve our problem. It does not solve the problem of the \npeople who have suffered from E. coli. It completely eliminates the \nDaschle amendment. The Daschle amendment, instead, says let us get rid \nof the roadblocks and protect the American people. We ought, as \nSenators, to be prepared to support the Daschle amendment. That is not \nRepublican and Democrat. That is saying we want safe food that we buy \nand safe food our children eat and we want safe food sold. And we want \nto be able to tell ranchers and livestock owners and farmers that if \nyou put your food in the chain, it is going to be protected and safe.\n  Now, I think that otherwise you are going to be voting on an effort \nto stop the real protection of the American people. I believe that the \namendment we are soon to vote on means more delay and more sickness. We \nstill have to have another cost-benefit analysis. There still will have \nto be a new peer \n\n[[Page S 9767]]\nreview panel and a number of new issues litigated. It becomes a \nlawyer's dream. I think we ought to stand up for safety and approve the \namendment from the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I would like to share with the Senate the \nstory of a young woman named Katie O'Connell. She was 2 years old and \nshe died from eating hamburger at a fast food restaurant. Unknown to \nanyone, her meal was contaminated with E. coli, the deadly pathogen \nthat really is the subject of this amendment. Sadly, the meat that \nKatie ate had been declared safe by inspectors from the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture. Katie died from a disease that should have been \ndetected through our Federal meat inspection system. Katie is no longer \nalive because that system failed her and her family and has failed \nthousands of others across this country.\n  Diseases caused by foodborne illnesses often strike those who are \nmost vulnerable in our society, our children. Last summer health \nofficials in my home State of New Jersey, where Katie lived, found \nanother outbreak of the disease that killed Katie just a short time \nbefore. One family, the McCormicks in Newton, NJ, had two of their \nchildren, ages 2 and 3, hospitalized. Their lives were endangered \nbecause they, too, ate meat that was declared safe by Federal \ninspectors at the Department of Agriculture.\n  These cases are far from isolated, unfortunately. The Centers for \nDisease Control estimates that there are over 9,000 people who die and \nanother 6.5 million people who get sick every year from foodborne \nillnesses.\n  The USDA regulations proposed last February as an effort to meet this \ncrisis would require daily testing for salmonella at meat and poultry \nprocessing plants across America. Additionally, each of the Nation's \n6,000 slaughterhouses and processing plants would have to develop \noperating plans designed to minimize possible sources of contamination; \nin other words, to design systems to avoid contamination in advance \ninstead of fighting it after it breaks out.\n  Mr. President, I think this proposal offered by the Department of \nAgriculture represents a significant improvement over the current \nsystem, which has remained in place remarkably unchanged for over 90 \nyears, since reforms were put in place in the wake of, as the Senator \nfrom Vermont says, Upton Sinclair's great book, ``The Jungle.''\n  Ironically, a cost-benefit analysis was done of these proposed rules. \nAnd what did the cost-benefit analysis show? Well, the costs would be \n$250 million per year, lowering to $200 million after the first 3 \nyears. And the benefits from these regulations would be at least $1 \nbillion per year. In other words, almost a 5-to-1 ratio in terms of \nbenefit over cost. That does not even really count the other fact here, \nMr. President, that the Department of Agriculture used a relatively low \nnumber of $1 million, for the value of each human life. Contrast these \ncost with the savings to consumers of $1 to $3.7 billion per year \nattributable to lost wages and medical costs for sickness caused by \nfoodborne disease that would be paid out without this rule.\n  Mr. President, what would be the cost to consumers if every penny of \nthis system's cost were passed along? If every penny of the cost of \nthese proposed regulations were passed along to consumers, the cost \nwould be two-tenths of 1 cent per pound. That is right, two-tenths of 1 \ncent per pound. So a consumer would have to buy 5 pounds of hamburger \nbefore incurring any cost at all. Surely, the typical American family \nwould be more than willing to pay this modest price to make sure that \nwhen they buy meat or go down to the fast food franchise and buy a \ncheeseburger for their child, that it will be safe meat.\n  Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues will say, ``Why eliminate \nthese regulations? Why exempt these regulations from the coverage of \nthis regulatory reform bill?''\n  Why single out this particular issue? Well, I think there is an \nanswer to that. It is pretty simple. I do not want any more children to \ndie. According to the USDA, the summer months are the prime time for \nfoodborne diseases. In fact, last month alone, there were at least four \nmore disease outbreaks. How many more will have to die before we take \naction, before we allow the regulations that have been proposed to go \ninto effect and to assure families across this country that their \nchildren are not going to eat contaminated meat at a fast food \nfranchise?\n  Mr. President, the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the \nUSDA use this new kind of system that was proposed last February. They \nrecommended it first 10 years ago. Yet, these proposed regulations have \nbeen the subject of countless hearings, roundtable meetings with \nindustry and consumers, and on and on.\n  At one point, the industry even claimed that the E. coli organism was \nnot technically an adulterant under the food safety law, clearly an \nattempt to deny the agency the ability to regulate E. coli. Mr. \nPresident, do we really need to waste years, lives and money redoing \nall the old analyses and creating new ones in an effort to stall or \neven defeat these regulations?\n  Senator Dole's amendment that he offered yesterday modified the bill \nslightly regarding the effects of S. 343 on E. coli regulations. \nSenator Johnston's second-degree amendment to the Daschle amendment \nwould modify it further, but unfortunately not enough to ensure that \nthe regulations would not be caught up in a revolving door of petitions \nand sunset provisions which could plunge the regulations into a swamp \nof uncertainty and litigation. The resulting delay would cause even \nmore cases of sickness and death, and the delay is unnecessary.\n  I am very concerned that these regulations are already a target of \nMembers in the other body who would try to delay them further through \nappropriations riders and other techniques. Instead of delay, I urge my \ncolleagues to stop interfering with these regulations. They are exactly \nthe kinds of regulations that we claim to want. We have them. They are \nhere. They are cost-effective. They deal with a serious problem, and \nthey have been subjected to close scrutiny by a wide variety of \ninterests.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge that we reject the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and adopt the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota and take a giant step toward protecting our \nfamilies from outbreaks of E. coli on our next visit to a fast food \nfranchise to buy a cheeseburger for our son or daughter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I might ask in the next few moments if the \nSenator from New Jersey will remain and we can visit about this issue \nonly briefly because I express the same kind of urgency and the concern \nthat the Senator has just expressed as it relates to a new inspection \nfood safety process that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has begun \nto put in place, known as HACCP.\n  Let me also suggest that it was the meat industry of this country \nthat brought this process and concept to USDA and suggest that this be \nthe process that come forward. Why has it not come since 1906 until \ntoday? Why have we not been able to change the process? Everybody \nskirts the issue, but nobody talks about it. Has the industry wanted to \nchange? Not always. The Senator is right. Guess who else has not wanted \nto change? The thousands of unionized meat inspectors who did not want \nto lose their jobs, even though--it is very important this be said in \nthe totality of the discussion--even though it might have meant a safer \nproduct coming to the market.\n  In my State of Idaho and in the President's State of Idaho where the \nbeef industry is critically important, 2 years ago something else \nhappened. A child, not unlike the child that the Senator from New \nJersey spoke of, went to a fast food restaurant to buy a hamburger and \nbecame critically ill. She did not die, but she was near death. It was \nthe result of having ingested an E. coli bacterial-contaminated meat \npatty. We are all concerned about that.\n  But the fundamental question is simply: Does what we are doing here \ntoday or what we did yesterday stop the process that is currently under \nway in the \n\n[[Page S 9768]]\nU.S. Department of Agriculture? The answer is no.\n  But there is another side to this story that is very important to \ndiscuss, beyond the politics and the rhetoric and the headlines that we \nhave seen over the last 2 weeks that even the Senator from New Jersey \nwould probably argue are not all fact.\n  When they argue that S. 343 will poison the food chain of America, \nthat is not only not fact--and that is what they argued--that is a \nfabrication. Here is the reason it is, here is why the Senate ought to \nknow this before they vote on the Daschle amendment.\n  Is it possible in the producing and the processing of food through to \nthe consumer, be it the restaurant or the home dinner table, to produce \na zero-risk food? The answer is, absolutely it is not possible to do. \nEven though America has the safest food in the world, and even though \nin the last couple of months in consumer reports from Europe, American \nmeat products are preferred 5 to 1 over any other meat product of the \nworld, and the answer is, because it is the safest in the world; the \nanswer is, it is not zero-proof safe. Why? Because it is not possible \nto create a zero-safe environment.\n  Why? Because the Centers for Disease Control in a survey started in \n1973 and concluded in 1989, in analyzing the pathogenic-borne food \nillnesses and deaths, answered the question this way: 97 percent of all \ndeaths occur because of the way the food was prepared for the table, \nnot the way it was processed in the plant.\n  It is fundamentally important for this Senate to know and for us to \nunderstand that the Daschle amendment changes not one iota of that \nequation. It is false rhetoric on the floor of the Senate to argue that \nsomehow this will make meat safer. It is already 99.9 percent safe, and \nthat is as safe as we can get it, and the institution of HACCP by USDA \nis an effort to make it 100 percent.\n  But we must face reality, and there are two very prevalent realities \nout there: One, we have to expect the preparer of the food to have a \nresponsibility, and we cannot exempt them from that.\n  Second, something else is happening in America today. As we all \nbecome busier people--and we have--the bottom line is we cannot \nregulate a perfect world. We have to expect the consumer to have a \nresponsibility in the preparation. So does S. 343 change the \ntemperature of the grill in the fast food restaurant? It does not. It \nhas absolutely nothing to do with it.\n  Here is the problem, though, with what we want to do to create the \nflexibility. Does the Daschle amendment create lookback so that if \nHACCP is not working well, we can adjust it? It does not. Do we want to \nlock in a process that is already one put upon the other, the other one \nbeing the old one that is not working anymore, because this \nadministration has tried to bind all two together and you cannot do \nthat and get a product that creates an efficiency in the market. No, it \ndoes not. In fact, it may lock us into an imperfect process that we are \ntrying to institute to be a better one.\n  I hope, as someone from a State that is a major producer of meat \nproducts and from a State that is a major consumer of meat products and \nsomeone who worked with Mike Espy from day one to create a better \nprocess,\n that we deny the Daschle amendment because we do not want to lock in \nthe forming of a process that may, to date, be imperfect. And staff \ntells me--and I believe they are accurate--that this may do just that. \nIt may deny us the opportunity to adjust and change in our pursuit of \nthe perfect, because the Senator from New Jersey knows, as I have seen \nhim nod his head, we cannot get to the perfect because perfect is \nimpossible; we can only create the best. Then we must say to the \nconsumer of America that you, too, have a responsibility, whether it is \nthe chef of a local fast food restaurant, or whoever, to make sure that \nthe center of that hamburger patty has reached the temperature that \nmight kill bacteria if it is present, and to say to the preparer in the \nfamily home that you, too, have a responsibility because 97 percent of \nthe E. coli deaths in America occur because of the latter and not the \nformer.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Well, I think he wanted to engage me in a colloquy for a \nquestion, the answer to which is yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I would like to respond briefly, if I could. I think the \nSenator makes a number of very good points. There is no question that \nmany of the illnesses with regard to meat come about because the meat \nis not cooked properly, not cooked well done. Many of us like our meat \nraw, red. If you do, you increase your chances of E. coli pathogens.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Only reconstituted meat. Not the steak, but the hamburger.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. My point is that, after Katie died, I remember giving \nall kinds of speeches, urging that people insist that all hamburgers be \nwell done, be cooked fully, urging owners of fast food franchises to \ntake that as a responsibility. Some responded, some did not. So let me \nagree with the Senator on that point.\n  As to the real reason that has prevented the new regulations from \ngoing into effect over many years, well if it was the union, in that \ncase I am against the union. I don't know the reason. I am for the \nconsumer. Let us get the thing done.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me regain my time to say this. From the day that this \nadministration began to work on this process of food inspection, there \nis no reason to accuse anybody. Everybody worked as quickly as they \ncould to bring the new process on line. My only argument there is, why \ndid it take us from the year 1906 to today to improve a process that we \nknew 30 years ago ought to be improved?\n  My point is simply this, relating to the Daschle amendment: The \nprocess we are putting in place is not yet complete. The administration \nknows that. So let us not lock ourselves once again in time and place. \nLet us be able to look back and make sure that it works, that it is an \nintegrated, evolving process to make a safer meat product than, in my \nopinion, what the Daschle amendment does free standing, because it \nhappens to fit the political debate of the day. That is not right.\n  Mr. GLENN. If the Senator will yield for 1 minute, the Daschle \namendment----\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. When did it get off the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I regained my time. But I will yield to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  Mr. GLENN. The Daschle amendment permits USDA to go ahead, without \ngoing back and going through the hoops and the new things that would \ndelay the regulations being put out that would be required under S. \n343. That is what he does.\n  Recent surveys have shown that about 4 percent of the ground beef in \nsupermarkets is tainted with E. coli. I do not know what else. That is \n1 out of 25 hamburgers, if you want to put it on a percentage basis.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is why they should be cooked thoroughly.\n  Mr. GLENN. Contamination of meat and poultry products sickens 5 \nmillion Americans a year and kills 3,500 to 4,000 people every year.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But 97 percent is as a result of preparation at the home, \nnot at the factory.\n  Mr. GLENN. Maybe some are. If we prevent deaths with this \nlegislation, what is wrong with going ahead where we know there is a \nclear and present danger?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is not the issue.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is what Daschle does, whether you think so or not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is what Dole did yesterday.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, that is not what Dole did yesterday. You have not been \nlistening to the debate on the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I was here for 3 hours yesterday.\n  Mr. GLENN. And we went through some of that this morning.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me at this point yield the floor. My \nconcern is, of course, is the Daschle amendment creating the \nflexibility to allow the HACCP process for food inspection to go \nforward and to be changed and adjusted, as we do for the sake of a \nbetter product and program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S 9769]]\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I will not be long, but I would like to \ncontinue what I was saying before in response to the statements made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  I am all for cooking the meat. Let us cook the meat. But before the \nmeat is cooked, 1 out of 25 hamburgers has E. coli bacteria in it. That \nis not produced by the person who is preparing it. That exists because \nit has not been caught earlier; 1 out of 25. So if the distinguished \nSenator is so concerned about the health of our children--and I believe \nhe is, and I believe the industry is, if for no other reason than self-\ninterest--then we need a new system of inspection, a system that will \nincrease our chances of detecting E. coli before it reaches the \nunsuccessful preparation process.\n  So all the Daschle amendment says is, exempt E. coli from the \npotential of further delays, further petitions, further litigation, and \na much longer time before it will ever be in place to capture and \nprevent the E. coli from being passed on to consumers.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. No, I will not yield. And so all the Daschle amendment \nsays is exempt E. coli regulations from this bill. If the distinguished \nSenator does not want E. coli to be in the meat of children in this \ncountry, in 1 in 25 hamburgers before preparation, then he should \nexempt it. Now, I believe that he does not, and I know that he has \nworked faithfully and diligently with the Department of Agriculture in \nan attempt to get an agreement among all parties. He is, in a very real \nsense, somebody who likes to build consensus. And I believe that what \nwe have in the new amendments, as he said, is a much better job--a much \nbetter job--than current law. The Senator would admit that.\n  Is the regulation regime projected to be perfect? No. Is it much \nbetter than the current situation? Yes. All we are saying is, allow it \nto be put in place and do not make the very, very best the enemy of the \nvery, very good, with the hope that at some distant moment, we will \nhave the perfect set of regulations. Or 15 years from now, when we get \nto that point, there will have been 9,000 more people every year dying \nand more kids like Katie O'Connell dying.\n  Put it in place now, and revisit it later. That is what the Daschle \namendment says by exempting E. coli from this regulatory reform bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator now yield?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am disappointed that my colleague would not yield for \na question, because I wanted to ask him, did he not admit that the \nJohnston amendment allows this E. coli regulation to go forward? It \ndoes, and he has left the incorrect impression that the Johnston \namendment somehow stops this regulation, and it does not.\n  Let us be candid, Mr. President, about our representations out here. \nLet us not give the impression that the Johnston amendment somehow is \ngoing to allow this hamburger to be tainted and go forward because it \nstops the E. coli regulation.\n  It does not. It solves the problem. It is clear that it does. There \nis no argument that it solves the problem.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues understand that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think we have debated this long enough. I \nthink we have gone on and on here. Frankly, these are important \nconsiderations. We need to move on, on this bill.\n  I think Senator Daschle's amendment goes way too far. Exempting the \nDepartment of Agriculture's HACCP rule in its entirety is unnecessary.\n  The distinguished Senator from Louisiana is absolutely correct in the \nway he has characterized his amendment. Frankly, there is no reason to \ngo to that extent.\n  There would be arguments--do we not exempt everything else, too, \nwhich is, of course, one of the ploys of those who want to defeat this \nbill. Sooner or later if we want to do something about overregulatory \nconduct in this society, we will have to pass this bill.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for his ingenuity \nin coming up with this amendment. I support Senator Johnston's \napproach. It leaves it to the agency head's discretion to determine \nwhether a new risk assessment is necessary for final rules, where one \nhas already been conducted for proposed rules.\n  This solves the problems for all rules. When an agency has done a \nrisk assessment for a proposed rule before the effective day of this \nact, if the risk assessment has been properly done, why would we want \nto force them to do it over again? It just makes sense--again, \ncommonsense approach to commonsense problems.\n  The Johnston amendment solves the problem, and it does it in a \nreasonable way without sharing any preference to industry, any group of \npeople, any particular agency. It allows this bill to work to try and \nresolve the overregulatory aspects of our society.\n  As for the effective date provision, I think the April date is fair \nand will significantly prevent extra costs to the agencies which have \nalready performed good cost-benefit analysis--and risk assessments, I \nshould add--for proposed rules. Not to have them redo them, over again, \njust to comply with certain procedural requirements. It makes sense. It \njust makes sense.\n  The Daschle amendment is totally unnecessary. Any emergency situation \nis already exempted under S. 343. We take care of it. The language is \nclear. If a rule needs to be promulgated quickly to protect health, \nsafety, and the environment, S. 343 allows prompt promulgation of those \nrules.\n  Concern that S. 343 will not allow rules to protect against E. coli \nbacteria to go forward is nothing but sheer hype.\n  The Johnston amendment allows for the proposed rules in the \nguidelines, in the pipeline, where money has been spent on studies, \nrisk assessment, or cost-benefit analysis, not to have to go through \nthese analyses again. It just makes sense.\n  Thus, the E. coli and food safety regulations will go forward under \nthe Johnston amendment.\n  I hope our colleagues will support the Johnston amendment, because I \nbelieve that it is a reasonable approach to try and resolve these \nproblems.\n  It is no secret that there are some who do not like the Johnston \namendment, also. For some reason, there are some people who want to go \nback 50 years, if they could, and revoke everything.\n  Well, I want to go forward and start doing what we have to do to get \nthis overregulatory burden off our backs in this country so this \ncountry can compete and be more competitive with the rest of the world, \nso that we can have our citizens treated more decently, so that the \ncosts are not eating Americans alive, so that people do not die because \nof the overregulatory aspects of our society, which is happening today, \nand so that we have some reasonable, decent, honorable way of trying to \nget regulation and overregulation under control.\n  I think we need to go to a vote on this. I am prepared to go to a \nvote on the Johnston amendment, and we will see where we go from there.\n  If the Johnston amendment passes, it ends this issue as far as I am \nconcerned. If it does not pass, we will have to look at it at that \npoint.\n  I have to say that I do not think the Johnston amendment solves every \nproblem. There are some legitimate concerns on our side that people \nhave. Legislation cannot always be perfect--just like food safety \ncannot be zero risk. We have to do the best we can under the \ncircumstances. This is the best we can do under the circumstances.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for being willing \nto try and resolve this issue. I think his amendment does resolve it, \nat least on the issue of E. coli and other meat and poultry matters.\n  Frankly, if all agencies, in the sense of the agency head's \ndiscretion, so they did not have to do unnecessary, duplicative efforts \non risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis--it makes sense. I think \nanybody with brains has to consider it makes sense, and I hope we vote \nthis amendment up and get on with the rest of the amendments on this \nbill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I would like to make sure that the record \nis absolutely clear in this debate.\n  I heard my distinguished colleague from Louisiana take umbrage at my \n\n[[Page S 9770]]\n  characterization of his amendment. I would like the Record to state \nthat, yes, indeed, he allows the E. coli regulation to be placed into \neffect. He exempts any regulation promulgated before April 1, and the \nRecord should show that; that it is the other amendment, the underlying \namendment, that has the biggest problem.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Louisiana offers an amendment \nthat is a vast improvement over the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas--a vast improvement. I salute him for \noffering this amendment and moving the Senate forward.\n  However, unfortunately, it is not enough. It is not as much as I \nthink we need. It allows endless petitions. It allows sunsets to be \nplaced on the regulation.\n  I believe we should simply exempt E. coli and let the Department of \nAgriculture do what they are going to do, without any kind of back-door \nor unforeseen event, and strengthen this regulation, to protect the \nfood and meat for people in this country. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I, too, want to get on with the vote on \nthis. I will be very brief and take just a couple of minutes.\n  In summary and in response to the Senator from Utah, the manager on \nthe other side, I, too, wish that we had a separate vote on this \nJohnston amendment. We might be able to vote for it, but not if it \nreplaces Senator Daschle's amendment.\n  The Department of Agriculture informed us whether they have to do a \nsecond risk assessment in the final rule stage, they are not going to \nbe able to say that they are already doing risk assessment, complies \nwith the requirements of S. 343, as it would be amended by the Dole-\nJohnston substitute. In other words, they would have to go back to \nleast-cost, new procedures--all subject to judicial challenge and so \non.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator recognizes that since the notice of \nproposed regulation was put out prior to April 1, 1995, that it would \nbe exempt totally from risk assessment and cost-benefit, under that \npart of the amendment as well as the other part, am I correct?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. President, this brings up the second point. That is, moving the \neffective date to April 1 for new proposed rules. While it may be an \nimprovement from an across-the-board immediate effective date, \nunfortunately I do not think that goes far enough.\n  This bill cannot be met within a few weeks or even a few months.\n  The new rulemaking procedures, the new least-cost, all the rest of \nthese things that go into this thing are something that is going to \ntake some time to do.\n  April 1, as an example, setting that as the cutoff time, means that \nregulations on mammography would be cut off. Regulations on the \neducational title I, help for the disadvantaged, where they are \nplanning to implement those regulations this fall, in school this \nfall--those would be cut out.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under the Johnston amendment, each one of those rules, \nhaving had a notice of proposed rulemaking prior to April 1, is exempt \nfrom this bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. I believe on all these the notice of proposed rulemaking \nwas April 1.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. On mammography? If the notice of proposed rulemaking \nwas after April 1, how is it scheduled to go into operation right away? \nMost of these rulemakings, the Senator told me, take a long time.\n  Mr. GLENN. An interim rule was published on mammography on December \n21, 1993, and publication of proposed regulations is planned for \nOctober 1995.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The April 1 date, under the Johnston amendment, is a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking. So this notice has been out for years.\n  Mr. GLENN. Publication of proposed regulations is planned for \nOctober, 1995.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I know, but when was the notice of proposed rulemaking? \nThat has been in operation--that has been out there for years.\n  Mr. GLENN. I do not have a particular date on that. It was my \nunderstanding, and the people that administer this have interpreted the \nSenator's proposal, his amendment, as cutting them off.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, did the Senator not just tell me the \nnotice of proposed rulemaking was 1993 or something?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, I said publication of the proposed regulations was \nplanned for 1995.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You gave me a date in 1993 there?\n  Mr. GLENN. That was an interim rule published in 1993.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There had to be a notice of proposed rulemaking prior \nto the interim rule.\n  Mr. GLENN. I am told these are covered at different dates. I would \nhave to go back and correct this. But the people administering this \nhave looked at what the Senator is proposing and they say it would cut \nthem off.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I tell my dear friend, that cannot be. \nIt just cannot be.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will go on with this and then I propose \nwe get on with the vote on this as soon as we can.\n  I was talking about the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That \nwould be held up because the dates on that--the final rule is coming \nout by July 1, 1995. That would be knocked out. The flammability \nstandards for upholstered furniture would be knocked out. Cable lead \nwires used on medical equipment--that has caused considerable problems. \nThere is a new rule coming out that would be held up.\n  This April 1 deadline, whether we argue about proposed rulemaking or \nspecific dates, a couple of things that came to our attention this \nmorning would be held up.\n  Mr. President, with that I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business for no longer than 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Likewise, the CDA would clearly cover all \n     distributions of hard-core obscenity over the computer \n     networks, whereas existing law has been applied only to \n     commercial sales of obscenity by computer bulletin board use \n     of phone facilities, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1465.\\2\\\n       ``This much has been categorically settled by the Court, \n     that obscene material is unprotected by the First \n     Amendment.''--Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, at 23 (1973)\n       ``A requirement that indecent language be avoided will have \n     its primary effect on the form, rather than the content, of \n     serious communication. There are few, if any, thoughts that \n     cannot be expressed by the use of less offensive \n     language.''--F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, at \n     743 n.18 (1978)\n       In Miller v. California, 413 U.S. at 24-25, the Court \n     announced it's ``Miller Test'' and held, at 29, that its \n     three part test constituted ``concrete guidelines to isolate \n     `hard core' pornography from expression protected by the \n     First Amendment''. The Court has consistently upheld federal \n     and state obscenity laws which prohibit the public and \n     commercial dissemination of such unprotected hard-core \n     obscenity. The United States Government and the States have \n     long banned the use of the mails for transporting obscenity. \n     See: Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S. 29, 41-42 (1896); Roth \n     v. United States, Alberts v. California, 354 U.S. 476, 493-94 \n     (1957). The use of common carriers has also been banned for \n     the transportation of obscenity, even for private use. See: \n     United States v. Orito, 413 U.S. 139, 141-44 (1973). The \n     Court has held that telephone companies are ``communication \n     common carriers'' subject to federal jurisdiction. See: \n     United States v. RCA, 358 U.S. 334, 348-49 (1959); F.C.C. v. \n     Sanders Bros. Radio Station, 309 U.S. 470, 474 (1940). In \n     1988, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1465 to include new \n     technologies, such as computer-phone modem systems, by adding \n     the words ``uses a facility or means of interstate commerce'' \n     to the prohibitions on commercial shipments of obscenity \n     across state lines. (See: H.R. 3889, The Child Protection and \n     Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988, 100th Cong., 2nd Sess.) \n     \\3\\ By that 1988 Act, Congress also criminalized the use of \n     cable, subscription, and satellite TV to distribute \n     obscenity, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1468.\n       Congress also spent several years developing a valid dial-\n     porn statute, resulting in the present, constitutionally \n     valid, version of 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223 (b) and (c), as amended \n     in 1988-89. The Supreme Court upheld the power to completely \n     ban obscenity from the phone systems. Sable Communications of \n     Calif., Inc. v. F.C.C., 492 U.S. 115, 124-26 (1989). In the \n     Sable case, the Court struck down a total ban on indecent \n     dial-porn to adults, but discussed with approval the \n     reasonableness of the F.C.C.'s ``least restrictive'' \n     practical methods to screen out minors, such as credit cards, \n     access code-pin numbers, and scrambling. Id. at 121-22, 128-\n     31. This blueprint for a valid statutory-F.C.C. scheme was \n     adopted by Congress and upheld by the courts as a valid means \n     to prohibit the distribution of indecency to minors by these \n     ``least restrictive means'' that allow adult access while \n     providing adequate safeguards to protect all but ``the most \n     enterprising and\n      disobedient young people''. Information Providers' Coalition \n     v. F.C.C., 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991); Dial Information \n     Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2nd Cir. 1991), \n     cert. denied, 112 S.Ct. 966 (1992).\n       The Senate version of the Communications Decency \n     Amendments, as sponsored by Senators Exon and Coats, amends \n     47 U.S.C. Sec. 223 in a way that is consistent with and \n     follows the Court's pronouncements on First Amendment \n     requirements discussed in the cases cited above. Such an \n     extension of the valid dial-porn law to computer porn would \n     prohibit only illegal obscenity and restrict indecency only \n     to minors, while allowing adults access to non-obscene \n     indecent communications when the F.C.C.'s technical screening \n     devices are used, or when similarly effective practical means \n     are developed by the users or service or access providers \n     themselves, even if beyond those of the present F.C.C. \n     regulations. The ``Exon-Coats'' amendment is, thus, more \n     protective of legitimate rights than the existing dial-porn \n     scheme.\n       It is not a valid argument that ``consenting adults'' \n     should be allowed to use the computer BBS and ``Internet'' \n     systems to receive whatever they want. If the materials are \n     obscene, the law can forbid the use of means and facilities \n     of interstate commerce and common carriers to ship or \n     disseminate the obscenity. See: Paris Adult Theatre I v. \n     Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 57 (1973). The Supreme Court has \n     forbidden the criminalization of the mere possession of \n     obscenity in the privacy of one's own home, Stanley v. \n     Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 568 (1969), but has rejected any \n     ``correlative right to receive it, transport it, or \n     distribute it'' since there is no ``zone of constitutionally \n     protected privacy [that] follows such material when it is \n     moved outside the home area protected by Stanley''. Orito, \n     supra, 413 U.S. at 141-42. To the contrary, the Court has \n     held that there is ``a long-recognized legitimate interest in \n     regulating the use of obscene material in local commerce and \n     in all places of public accommodation''. Paris Adult Theatre, \n     supra, 413 U.S. at 58. The Court also held that Stanley \n     ``does not extend to one who is seeking . . . to distribute \n     obscene material to the public, nor does it extend to one \n     seeking to import obscene materials from abroad, whether for \n     private use or public distribution''. United States v. \n     Thirty-Seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363 376-77 (1971) (adding \n     that ``Congress may declare it contraband''). Perhaps the \n     best defense for the CDA was summarized by the Court in \n     Orito, supra at 143-44, where it held that Section 1462 could \n     not be used to ship obscenity from San Francisco to Milwaukee \n     by a common carrier, the airlines, stating:\n       ``Given (a) that obscene material is not protected under \n     the First Amendment . . . (b) that the Government has a \n     legitimate interest in protecting the public commercial \n     environment by preventing such material from entering the \n     stream of commerce . . . and (c) that no constitutionally \n     protected privacy is involved . . . we cannot say that the \n     Constitution forbids comprehensive federal regulation of \n     interstate transportation of obscene material merely because \n     such transport may be by private carriage, or because the \n     material is intended for the private use of the transporter. \n     . . . Congress may regulate on the basis of the natural \n     tendency of the material in the home being kept private and \n     the contrary tendency once material leaves that area, \n     regardless of a transporter's professed intent. Congress \n     could reasonably determine such regulation to be necessary to \n     effect permissible federal control of interstate commerce in \n     obscene material, based as that regulation is on a \n     legislatively determined risk of ultimate exposure to \n     juveniles or to the public and the harm that exposure could \n     cause.'' [Citations omitted.]\n       As the late Chief Justice Burger stated in Paris Adult \n     Theatre, supra at 69: ``The States have the power to make a \n     morally neutral judgment that public exhibition of obscene \n     material, or commerce in such material, has a tendency to \n     injure the community as a whole, to endanger the\n      public safety, or to jeopardize, in Mr. Chief Justice \n     Warren's words, the states' [and the Nation's] `right . . \n     . to maintain a decent society.'' The Court has also \n     recognized that legislatures ``must be allowed a \n     reasonable opportunity to experiment with solutions to \n     admittedly serious problems'', Young v. American Mini \n     Theatres, 427 U.S. 50, 71 (1976), and Congress has taken \n     up such challenges by updating the various federal \n     obscenity, child pornography and exploitation, and \n     telephone and broadcasting statutes to cover new ways that \n     people invent from time to time to traffic in unprotected \n     obscenity and the provision of indecency to minors. The \n     overlap of some criminal acts by inclusion in two or more \n     federal statutes, like the corresponding prohibitions of \n     the various state laws, is a testament to the need to keep \n     all federal statutes comprehensive and paying their \n     individual roles in deterring harmful, unprotected conduct \n     and allowing prosecution under various circumstances. \n     Shortly after World War II, the Court upheld application \n     of the common carrier laws to cover the new technology of \n     phonograph records, recognizing the power and intent of \n     Congress to legislate comprehensively to prohibit traffic \n     in obscenity. United States v. Alpers, 338 U.S. 680682-83 \n     (1950). Congress later amended Section 1462 to \n     specifically include phonographs, so as to clarify and \n     give undeniable notice to all what the law prohibits. Such \n     a task is now before the Congress and the Communications \n     Decency Amendment serves this dual and noble purpose. \n     (Congress should likewise consider updating and clarifying \n     Section 1462 to plainly prohibit commercial and non-\n     commercial use of any and all common carriers, including \n     telephone, wire, cable, microwave, satellite, computers, \n     etc., for carriage of obscenity for private and public use \n     in interstate, intrastate, and foreign commerce and \n     travel. Times are changing, technology is advancing, but \n     obscenity is till obscene, unprotected, and harmful.)\n       Much of the hard-core obscenity on the BBS and ``Internet-\n     World Wide Web'' networks is placed there for sale or \n     advertisement by members of the pornography syndicates and by \n     fledgling pornographers. However, the vast amount of hard-\n     core pornography on today's computer bulletin boards and \n     interactive nets is placed there indiscriminately by \n     individual ``porn pirates'' who post freely available \n     pictures of violence, rape, bestiality, torture, excretory \n     functions, group sex, and other forms of hard and soft core \n     pornography which are as available to teenage computer users \n     as to men who are addicted to pornography. A tough federal \n     law is needed to deter such unprotected and viciously harmful \n     activity and the CDA does just that, making such activity a \n     felony in order to deter those who would violate such \n     federally protected interests and public decency and safety \n     concerns. This proposed law would remove hard-core obscenity \n     from most of the generally available computer boards and \n     sites and isolate those who continue so that the remaining \n     obscenity distributors may be identified and prosecuted or \n     deterred by their own lack of anonymity. Present law is not \n     successfully serving its intended deterrence and apprehension \n     roles, obviously.\n       The CDA would also channel indecent speech and pictures \n     that are not obscene away from the general access public \n     boards and sites where minors and non-consenting adults could \n     take advantage of the serious \n\n[[Page S 9772]]\n     uses and benefits of this new computer technology. The service and \n     access providers could and would set up consensual access \n     ``adult'' boards and sites where adults could subscribe or \n     provide credit cards and/or access-pin codes and engage in \n     all the ``adult'' (pornographic) speech they wish to consent \n     to. This is no more burdensome than obtaining dial-porn, or \n     cable television's pay-per-view or premium channels, or \n     asking for ``men's sophisticate magazines'' at the \n     convenience stores, or going to hard-core ``adult'' \n     bookstores or into the ``adult'' porn section of video \n     stores, etc., etc., etc. The hysterical arguments about \n     indecency laws banning serious works of literature or library \n     art, so cleverly but hypocritically pandered by the porn \n     user's advocates, are no more real than they would have been \n     under existing laws or in past enforcement actions by the \n     F.C.C. The generations of law enforcement and judicial \n     supervision have narrowly tailored the application of \n     obscenity laws to ``hard-core pornography'' and indecency \n     laws to intentional patterns of patently offensive sex, \n     graphic sexual nudity, and four-letter ``Seven Dirty Words''. \n     As the Court said in Pacifica, sura, 438 U.S. at 743, ``the \n     Commission's definition of\n      indecency will deter only the broadcasting of patently \n     offensive references to excretory and sexual organs and \n     activities''. The Court in Pacifica, at 742, also stressed \n     that ``indecency is largely a function of context'' and \n     that speech is not indecent unless it is so patently \n     offensive for the time, place, and manner of its utterance \n     that the community would universally disapprove of its \n     open availability in those circumstances.\n       A review of the decisions of the Supreme Court and other \n     federal and state courts shows that a slip of a four letter \n     word of showing nudity for legitimate reasons has never been, \n     nor would it be, found indecent under the F.C.C.'s, the \n     Court's, or the Justice Department's interpretation of the \n     term ``indecent''. Those in the ACLU and EFF who sound the \n     screeching alarm are merely trying to deafen the gullible to \n     drown out the screams of the children and parents who are \n     being screamed off the modern age's most promising tool for \n     education and global communications. They don't seek in \n     earnest to ``empower'' parents to protect children, they want \n     to force parents by the power of their arrogance to kick the \n     kids off the system so they can trade dirty words and \n     pictures. The Internet does not belong to the most obscene \n     and indecent characters of this world, it was created and \n     should be available to everyone, like radio, television, and \n     telephone services, like the mails, common carriers, and \n     other public interstate facilities. To these concerns should \n     Congress turn in this critical time. The recent study of \n     computer porn by the prestigious Carnegie Mellon University, \n     as reported in the venerable Georgetown University law review \n     provides ample reality to the real alarm being heard by the \n     public and responsible public officials. The obscenity and \n     indecency is totally out of control and the law is behind the \n     times. The CDA merely modernizes existing federal law so that \n     the old maxim that ``the law is presumed to know what \n     everyone knows'' can be fulfilled.\n       The CDA as adopted by the Senate is both fair and \n     reasonable. It intentionally safeguarded legitimate corporate \n     and private rights. Some provisions of the CDA have even been \n     criticized by pro-family groups as too lenient and providing \n     too many defenses for pornographers, as well as too much \n     exemption and good-faith defense for the on-line computer \n     service access providers, such as Prodigy, CompuServe, \n     NETCOM, and America On Line. The present version of the \n     Amendment would, indeed, exempt the phone company carriers \n     and computer access providers only to the extent that they \n     provide mere access for users to connect to the services and \n     boards of other companies and individuals beyond their \n     control. This would not make the law ineffectual, however, it \n     would simply channel the blame to those who deserve it and \n     enlist the responsible corporations into taking good-faith \n     efforts to avoid and block hard-core pornography and channel \n     indecent speech to adults. To the extent any phone or \n     computer access company would offer obscenity in their own \n     boards, they would be as liable as anyone else. Likewise for \n     making indecent material available to minors under age 18, if \n     they do it-they are liable, but if they don't do it-they \n     aren't liable if someone else does it. This puts the primary \n     criminal liability on those who distribute obscenity to \n     anyone and on those who make indecency available to minors \n     without taking reasonable steps to limit it to adults. \n     Although some people and groups may feel that the phone and \n     computer access providers should bear responsibility for the \n     traffic in obscenity and indecency that is available to \n     minors, but the law need not extend the strictness of its \n     liability to those who act in good faith or merely provide \n     carriage to the illegal materials of others. Existing Section \n     1462 does not criminalize the act of the common carrier in \n     merely carrying illegal materials. It prohibits the user from \n     using the carrier to transport the obscenity. The carrier \n     would be liable only if it acted beyond its role as a carrier \n     and conspired with, or intentionally aided and abetted, the \n     misuse of company facilities for illegal purposes. The same \n     type of knowledge and\n      criminal involvement would be required under the CDA and \n     could be applied to such conduct.\\4\\ The CDA's \n     restrictions to protect minors from indecent speech are \n     the ``least restrictive means'' to protect minors while \n     allowing adults access to non-obscene speech. This is all \n     the public can demand of its laws. The law cannot impose \n     strict liability, but the CDA is designed to provide a \n     serious criminal deterrent to those who would put \n     obscenity onto the computer nets or who would publicly \n     post indecent materials within easy reach of children.\n       Consistent with this aim, the Amendment contains ``good \n     faith'' defenses that would allow any company, carrier, \n     Internet connector, or private individual to create \n     reasonable and effective ways to screen children out of adult \n     conversations and allow adults to use indecent, non-obscene, \n     speech among adults. This would encourage, and enable (or \n     ``empower''), the access providers to take steps to enforce \n     corporate responsibility and family friendly policies and \n     monitor their systems against abuse. When they do take such \n     steps, the good faith defense would protect them from \n     becoming liable for unfound or unknown abuses by others, and \n     that is all we think the law can ask of them at this point. \n     There is only so much that can be done in a way that is \n     ``technically feasible'' at any point in time (as the Court \n     reminded us in Sable), and the CDA would not require anyone \n     to take steps that are not technically feasible and does not, \n     and should not, expect anyone to take all steps that may be \n     technically possible.\n       This bill would also allow the States to enforce their own \n     obscenity and ``harmful to minors'' laws against the \n     pornographers and porn pirates. If they chose to regulate the \n     carriers and connectors, they would be bound by the Supremacy \n     Clause of the Constitution and the First Amendment to using \n     consistent measures. This ``pre-emption clause'', subsection \n     (g), is not intended to be inconsistent with existing \n     requirements for the States to meet under any criminal law. \n     The joint role of federal and state prosecution of those who \n     distribute the obscenity, and indecency to minors, is \n     intended to be a specifically preserved.\\5\\\n       The good faith defense also allows responsible users and \n     providers to utilize the existing regulations from the F.C.C. \n     for dial-porn systems, until such time as the F.C.C. makes \n     new regulations specifically for the computer networks. This \n     means that a company or individual who takes a credit card, \n     pin number, or access code would be protected under present \n     F.C.C. rules if a minor stole his parent's Visa card or dad's \n     porn pin number. In other words, some responsibility still \n     resides with parents to watch what their kids are watching on \n     the computer. This is serious business and there is a lot of \n     very harmful pornography on the ``Internet'', so parents \n     better take an interest in what their children have access \n     to, and cannot rely on the law or the businesses to solve the \n     entire problem for them. Federal law can make it a crime to \n     post hard-core obscenity on the computer boards, but many \n     people are willing to break the law. The porn pirates are \n     posting the kind of porn that hasn't been sold by the \n     pornography syndicates in their ``adult'' bookstores in \n     nearly 20 years. This law should deter them for doing that \n     any longer and it would allow federal prosecutors to charge \n     them for it now.\n       The defenses to indecency are available to every one, so \n     that every one has a chance to act responsibly as adults in \n     protecting children from indecency. This is what the Supreme \n     Court will require for the indecency provisions to be upheld \n     as ``least restrictive'' under the First Amendment. \n     Conversely, no one has a defense to obscenity when they \n     distribute or make obscenity available. The only exception to \n     this is for the carriers and connectors in their role as mere \n     access connectors, only then would they be exempt from the \n     obscenity traffic of others. However, if the on-line service \n     providers go beyond solely providing access, and attempt to \n     pander or conspire with pornographers, for instance, then \n     they would lose their obscenity exemption and be liable along \n     with every one else. This is a limited remedy to prevent the \n     bill from causing a ``prior restraint'' on First Amendment \n     rights. This bill would be nothing at all if it were struck \n     down or enjoined before it could be used against those who \n     are posting, selling, and disseminating all the pornography \n     on the computer networks.\n       There has been some criticism that this bill in adopting \n     good faith defenses would make it ineffectual and that this \n     would weaken the bill in the same way that the existing dial-\n     porn law is not completely effective. We disagree. The \n     defenses in the dial-porn law were necessary to having that \n     law upheld by the courts. Without them, it was struck down by \n     the Supreme Court. Only after the F.C.C. provided its \n     technical screening defenses was the law upheld by the \n     federal appeals courts. This law adopts those \n     constitutionally required measures for indecency and for \n     obscenity only for the mere access providers. The dial-porn \n     law has removed the pre-recorded message services from the \n     phone lines. The pornographers have gone to live credit card \n     calls. To the extent they are still obscene, they can and \n     should be prosecuted by the Department of Justice, with the \n     help of the F.B.I. That is what it will take to remove the \n     rest of the illegal dial-porn services. The most ineffective \n     part of the dial-porn law is not the F.C.C. defenses, they \n     are fine. What is broken is the phone company defense in the \n     statute, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(c)(2)(B), that allows the bell \n     companies to rely on ``the lack of any representation by a \n     provider'' of dial-porn that the provider is offering illegal \n     messages. This means that if the dial-porn company does \n\n[[Page S 9773]]\n     not tell the phone company that the messages are obscene or going to \n     children as indecency, then the phone company doesn't have to \n     block all the dial-porn lines until an adult subscribes in \n     writing. This is not workable and should be fixed by \n     Congress. The dial-porn law should also be amended to give \n     good faith reliance only of a false representation by a dial-\n     porn provider. If the phone company doesn't know about a \n     dial-porn service, then they should not be responsible. \n     However, the phone company should block all the dial-porn \n     lines and only unblock them on adult request. This is the \n     provision that is causing the phone companies not to act, not \n     the F.C.C. defenses. There is no such provision in the CDA \n     that would allow the carriers or connectors to wait for the \n     pornographers to confess guilt before they must act. If they \n     know, they must act in good faith. No more, no less. This \n     computer porn law is, therefore, better than the existing \n     dial-porn law in that respect.\n       This amendment would allow federal prosecutions against the \n     pornographers and porn pirates immediately, thus removing \n     much of the hard-core material from the networks that the \n     carriers would be providing access to. A more perfect \n     solution, if any there could be, cannot wait several months \n     or years. If Congress has to exempt the connectors as long as \n     they merely carry the signal and otherwise act in good faith, \n     then so be it. If they abuse it, then Congress can take that \n     break away when it is shown that they don't deserve it. In \n     the meantime, the CDA will give federal law enforcement \n     agencies a tool to get at those who are responsible for \n     distributing the obscenity that is at the heart of the \n     complaints at present. It is a good and constitutional law \n     and arguments that it is too much Government involvement, or \n     not enough, are not true, not realistic, and should not lead \n     Congress to bypass this opportunity to enact an effective \n     remedy to protect the public and our children from this \n     insidious problem.\n       Bruce A. Taylor, June 29, 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The National Law Center for Children and Families \n     (``NLC'') is a non-profit legal advice organization which \n     supports law enforcement and governmental agencies in the \n     prosecution and improvement of federal and state laws dealing \n     with obscenity and the protection of children.\n     The author of this Memorandum, NLC's Chief Counsel, Bruce \n     Taylor, has been prosecuting obscenity and child pornography \n     cases since 1973, presenting over 85 cases to juries and \n     numerous oral arguments on appeal, as: Senior Trial Attorney, \n     Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Criminal Division, \n     U.S. Department of Justice (1989-94); Assistant Attorney \n     General of Arizona (1989); General Counsel, Citizens for \n     Decency through Law, Inc.

Taylor).\n     \\2\\ The CDA and existing Section 223 are attached hereto.\n     \\3\\ It was under Section 1465 that the Government convicted \n     the operators of Amateur Action BBS in the Western District \n     of Tennessee for shipping hard-core obscenity, depicting \n     rape, incest, torture, children, excretory functions, etc, \n     etc., from Milpitas, Cal., to Memphis by computer-phone \n     modern facilities. The case is U.S. v. Thomas and is \n     presently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \n     Circuit. Interestingly, the A.C.L.U. and the Electronic \n     Frontier Foundation, and some interactive computer service \n     and access providers argued, as amici curiae in support of \n     the Defendants, that present law did not apply to the \n     computer systems, BBS and Internet networks, and that the \n     material should be judged according to the ``cyberspace'' \n     community standards of the customers of such pornographic \n     distributors. This alone should illustrate the need to \n     clarify and update all federal laws on this subject.\n     \\4\\ In this regard, the Senate version of the CDA would be \n     more clear if it were amended to add the words: ``or who \n     aids, abets, or advertises for,'' after the phrase ``or a \n     conspirator with'' in subsection (f)(1).\n     \\5\\ In this regard, the CDA would be more clear by replacing \n     the words ``this section'' at the end of the pre-emption \n     clause, subsection (g); with: ``subsections (a)(2), (d)(2), \n     or (e)(2)''. As we pointed out in Senate colloquies, this is \n     intended to preserve the right and ability of the states to \n     enforce this obscenity and harmful to minors statutes, \n     consistent with the decision of the Court in Roth-Alberts, \n     supra, 354 U.S. at 493-94.\n                      Lies That Pornographers Tell\n\n                                               National Law Center\n\n\n                                    for Children and Families,\n\n                                                    July 10, 1995.\n     Re Cox-Wyden bill on the Internet connectors as consistent \n         with Exon-Coats Senate CDA.\n     Hon. Christopher Cox,\n     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     House of Representatives, Longworth House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representatives Cox and Wyden: Please excuse the \n     length of this letter, but much misinformation needs to be \n     corrected and this is an issue of utmost importance to \n     America's children and families. You have been lied to. I'd \n     like to give you my views on the pornographer's propaganda \n     and offer an explanation of the true meaning of the Exon-\n     Coats amendment dealing with computer assisted obscenity and \n     the problem of indecency being made available to minors.\n       A review of your proposed legislation to protect the \n     computer information service providers shows that you are \n     trying to accomplish the same objectives as the Senate \n     version of the Communications Decency Amendment (``CDA''). \n     Whatever you may have been led to believe about the ``Exon-\n     Coats Amendment'' is obviously incorrect. The Senate bill \n     accomplishes the same benefits and protections your proposed \n     bill seeks to provide. However, I feel your bill, in giving \n     immunity and a defense without a corresponding offense, will \n     have the opposite effect to that which you seek.\n       Your bill imposes no obligations or prohibitions on either \n     the computer or phone companies, nor on the pornographers. No \n     one would be required to remove or restrict obscenity from \n     the Internet or any BBS bulletin board systems, or to \n     restrict indecency from minors. If any company wishes to take \n     responsible corporate policy measures, your bill would only \n     seek to protect them from civil liability. Under the Senate \n     CDA, every company must clean up its own facilities, could \n     not assist other persons to violate the law, and would be \n     protected from both civil and criminal liability for good \n     faith steps to enforce a responsible policy and restrict \n     obscenity from everyone and indecency from minors.\n       Your explanatory statement for the Cox-Wyden Bill to \n     protect the access provider Internet connectors (Prodigy, \n     AOL, etc.) expressed a genuine concern for the unfairness of \n     holding these connectors liable civilly for acts they may \n     take in good faith to restrict or prevent the transmission of \n     offensive materials over their facilities and services.\n       I think that your proposed measure is consistent with and \n     intends a like result as the Communications Decency Amendment \n     (CDA) of Senators Coats and Exon. The defense-immunity in \n     your proposal, and the exemption and defenses in the CDA, as \n     passed by the Senate, are co-extensive, not different. It is \n     apparent to me that your purpose would be furthered by \n     supporting the Senate's CDA (and even adding some additional \n     provisions to the House version of the CDA, as discussed \n     below and in my attached Memorandum of Opinion in Support of \n     the CDA).\n       The New York decision against Prodigy, to which you \n     referred, is a lawsuit result to which we also disagree. In \n     fact, the Exon-Coats amendment recognized the same concern by \n     granting those access providers and phone carriers an \n     exemption from criminal liability for crimes committed by \n     others over the facilities of others beyond their control, in \n     (f)(1). The CDA also provides a good faith defense to \n     offenses committed over one of their own facilities, if they \n     take steps to restrict or prevent such offensive or unlawful \n     communications, in (f)(3). Then, the CDA provided a civil \n     hold-harmless provision to protect users and providers from \n     liability for lawful acts taken in good faith to avoid \n     liability for the offenses specified in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223, \n     as amended, in (f)(4).\n       The Senate CDA does not exempt access providers ``if they \n     exercise `no control' over the information their customers \n     get'', as your release states. Just the opposite is true. A \n     phone carrier or access connector is only exempt, under \n     (f)(1), from crimes committed over facilities over which that \n     company ``has no\n      control''. If they have control, they must act (such as over \n     their own boards and chat lines and over services with \n     which they enter contracts or carriage agreements). If \n     they truly have no control, they are not strictly liable \n     for another's offenses (such as over a university or \n     pornographer's board existing independently on the \n     Internet or Use Net or World Wide Web to which they \n     ``solely'' provide unassisted access.\n       To the extent the phone and access companies learn of other \n     people abusing their systems with unlawful activities, they \n     can and must act in good faith to prevent or restrict access \n     to the offensive and unlawful materials, under (f)(3). The \n     phone carriers and access providers are liable for all \n     unlawful activity they know of on their own facilities, under \n     (d)(1) and (e)(1). They are also liable for knowingly \n     allowing others to use their facilities for unlawful acts, \n     under (d)(2) and (e)(2).\n       The key to responsible action, to taking ``good samaritan'' \n     policy measures, therefore, is in the operation of the good \n     faith defenses. If a bill provided strict liability on a \n     carrier or connector for all unlawful acts they know of on \n     their systems, then their only avoidance of liability would \n     be to pull the plug or to maintain complete ignorance (not to \n     know is not to act ``knowingly'', so they won't look for what \n     would give them guilty knowledge). A strict liability law, \n     without good faith defenses, would have the effect of making \n     the phone and computer companies turn a blind eye. The Senate \n     version requires responsible action and empowers them to use \n     technically feasible soft-ware and hard-ware measures and \n     protects them from liability in doing so. Your bill seeks the \n     effect of the Senate version, and the opposite effect of a \n     ``no defense'' bill.\n       Your bill provides a similar exemption from liability for \n     good faith acts to restrict access to objectionable material, \n     in (c) of IFFEA. Without the exemption in (f)(1) and the \n     defenses in (f)(3) of the CDA, the telephone-computer porn \n     statute would provide near strict liability for the carriers \n     and connectors without any incentive to protect themselves \n     except to avoid all knowledge of the offensive materials.\n       Ignorance would be their best defense if the good faith \n     defenses are removed from the Senate version and they would \n     be criminally, as well as civilly, liable if they knew there \n     were unlawful materials on other facilities over which they \n     had no control but to which they knew one could gain access \n     by using their facilities to reach the Internet and get \n\n[[Page S 9774]]\n     to those other boards and web sites. The unfairness of this result is \n     the reason the Exon-Coats amendment was structured the way it \n     is and your bill shows a like interest in having a fair \n     application of the law without extending undue liability to \n     those who take responsible action.\n       Here's how the Senate's CDA really works:\n       No substantive changes are made to existing ``dial-a-porn'' \n     provisions in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223 (b) and (c). Subsection \n     223(a) is clarified only to codify that subsection's historic \n     interpretation as applying to unconsented harassing and \n     obscene calls for annoyance or threat. This merely codifies \n     present law and prevents subsection (a) from any argument \n     that it would ban all ``indecent'' or ``obscene'' phone or \n     computer conversations.\n       The CDA adds four new offenses, two in each of the new \n     subsections (d) and (e), which are subdivisions (d)(1) and \n     (d)(2) and then (e)(1) and (e)(2):\n       (d)(1) knowingly make or make available obscenity;\n       (d)(2) knowingly allow one's own facility to be used by \n     others to make or make obscenity available;\n       (e)(1) knowingly make or make available indecency to \n     minors;\n       (e)(2) knowingly allow one's own facility to be used by \n     others to make or make indecency available to minors.\n       The (d)(1) and (e)(1) offenses apply to everyone, the \n     pornographers, and the persons who post or sell it on a \n     bulletin board or chat line or web site, and any board or \n     site owner-operator who knowingly conspires with them or aids \n     & abets them. They also apply to phone carriers and computer \n     connectors who would provide such unlawful materials as one \n     of their own services.\n       The (d)(2) and (e)(2) offenses are ``carriers'' crimes and \n     apply only to phone carriers and access connectors who own-\n     operate telecom. facilities used by others to make computer-\n     modem connections to the Internet, Use Net, World Wide Web, \n     or private BBS boards. To the extent a computer connector \n     acts as a mere conduit, they act like carriers when they \n     connect someone to the facilities of others on the nets or \n     boards. To that extent, only, they are and should be treated \n     as carriers are treated for the same activity.\n       Legally, the access provider-connectors (Prodigy, America \n     On Line, CompuServe, NETCOM, etc.) are not ``common \n     carriers''\n      like the telephone companies (ATT, MCI, Sprint, and the Bell \n     companies). The Senate CDA specifically recognizes this in \n     the last sentence of (f)(3), thus precluding FCC \n     jurisdiction over the operation of those ``enhanced \n     information services''. (Your bill, conversely, merely \n     states, in (d), that nothing in your bill gives FCC \n     jurisdiction. Nothing prevents FCC jurisdiction from \n     another source or act, just that your bill doesn't confer \n     it.) The Senate's CDA allow the FCC only to develop \n     defenses and technical methods to screen out children from \n     indecency and allow adults to have reasonable access to \n     indecent material among themselves, like it did for dial-\n     a-porn. The FCC's technical screening devices (credit \n     cards, access-pin codes, and blocking) were cited by the \n     Supreme Court as effective ``least restrictive means'' to \n     screen out minors without affecting adult's rights to non-\n     obscene but indecent communications among adults. Allowing \n     these FCC regulations, along with any present or future \n     soft or hard-ware solutions to restrict indecency to \n     adults, makes the indecency provisions of subsection (e) \n     of the CDA constitutional and effective.\n       Since existing federal law (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1462 and 47 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 223) treats common carriers differently, because \n     of their role as public access carriers, the CDA treated the \n     access connectors in like fashion when they act as common \n     carriers by merely providing access to the facilities of \n     others beyond their control. To the extent a connector gives \n     one access to its own facilities or services, like its own \n     boards and chat sites that are within its control, it is \n     liable like anyone else and must police its own operations. \n     This is like dial-a-porn, where Mountain Bell (which does not \n     provide lines to dial-porn providers) would not be liable for \n     a call from a customer in Arizona who calls through Mountain \n     Bell, then is carried from Mountain Bell by ATT to NYNEX, and \n     reaches a dial-porn company in New York with which NYNEX has \n     a contract. NYNEX can and should be liable if it is culpable, \n     but Mountain Bell should not. The CDA apportions the same \n     criminal liability on those who share the same criminal \n     blame.\n       The CDA's (f)(1) only exempts the phone carriers and access \n     connectors when they ``solely'' give one mere access to \n     others' facilities over which they have ``no control''. As to \n     their own boards and sites, they are liable for the offenses \n     when they knowingly and intentionally allow users to transmit \n     obscenity, or indecency to minors, through their systems. In \n     that regard, however, they have the good faith defense in \n     (f)(3) if they monitor, block, screen, etc., all the \n     offensive material they know about and someone still gets \n     unlawful material through. If they've done all they could to \n     police their own boards, they would be protected. If they do \n     nothing and they know their facilities are being so used for \n     unlawful purposes, they would be liable under (d)(2) and \n     (e)(2).\n       The incentive is therefore mandated (f)(3) that they do \n     their own corporate responsible actions to restrict or \n     prevent such transmissions or access. It is obvious, however, \n     that Prodigy cannot police what is posted on a CompuServe \n     board or on an independently operated board on the Internet \n     (such as a university, pornographer, or private company \n     board). They can, and would, delete such boards from their \n     index and directory listings, and they could block the drive \n     paths to known offending sites and porn pictures (known as \n     ``GIF'' files-Graphic Interchange Format), to the extent \n     technically feasible. If they advertised for such sites or \n     GIF files of others, then they would not be ``solely'' \n     providing access as exempted under (f)(1).\n       There is one change to the Senate CDA that could be made to \n     specify some things that an access provider could not do to \n     assist a pornographer on another's service, like listings and \n     advertising porn sites and GIF files. To accomplish this \n     result more clearly, I suggest that the House CDA add the \n     words: ``or who aids, abets, or advertises for,'' after the \n     phrase ``or a conspirator with'' in (f)(1). This would mean \n     that the access connectors would be responsible for policing \n     their own boards and services and could not assist or aid the \n     unlawful activities of others that they cannot otherwise \n     control.\n       Another change I would like to see in the CDA is to correct \n     the last clause of the pre-emption clause, subsection (g), to \n     make it clear and consistent with the first sentence. I \n     suggest the words ``this section'' be replaced with: \n     ``subsections (a)(2), (d)(2), or (e)(2)''.\n       Finally, I believe Congress has been betrayed by some \n     telephone companies by not blocking all their dial-a-porn \n     numbers unless they receive a written request from the \n     customer for access to those numbers, as intended and \n     provided in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(c)(1). The problem lies with \n     the immunity granted by subsection 223(c)(2)(B)(i), which \n     allows the phone carriers to avoid their blocking duties by \n     relying ``upon the lack of any representation'' from a dial-\n     porn provider that the provider is selling illegal messages. \n     In other words, if the phone-sex company does not confess \n     guilt to the phone company, the phone company need do \n     nothing. Since the dial-pornographers don't admit anything, \n     some phone companies don't block anything. This loophole has \n     become a sink hole that Congress should plug. This can be \n     remedied to its original intent by removing the immunity from \n     reliance on silence and giving them immunity only if they\n      were lied to or unknowingly misled. Two changes to that \n     clause, Sec. 223(c)(2)(B)(i), would remedy this unjust \n     result, as follows: (i) in good faith reliance upon the \n     representation by a provider of communications that \n     communications provided by that provider are not \n     communications specified in subsection (b) of this \n     section, or\n       Other than the two suggested clarifications to the CDA, and \n     the one suggested correction to the dial-a-porn law, the \n     Senate version of the CDA is eminently fair and as \n     constitutional and effective as the law will allow.\n       I hope that, when you consider the Senate version in its \n     entirety and as it would be applied and followed in reality, \n     you will agree that the CDA provides the same protections you \n     seek for the legitimate interests of the computer and phone \n     companies, while outlawing illegal obscenity from the \n     computer networks and allowing minor children to take \n     advantage of the educational and growing benefits of the \n     computer without being bombarded with so-called ``adult'' \n     materials. The Internet need not be the ``adult bookstore'' \n     of cyberspace. The Senate bill would put the ``adult'' books \n     in the back room and have adults show ID to get in. Just like \n     in every day life in the rest of the country. This is the \n     least restrictive means to protect children, and they are \n     entitled to at least ``the least'' the law will allow them \n     under the First Amendment.\n       As for obscenity, the Senate version only prohibits that \n     which is already illegal to distribute by any other federal \n     means. Existing laws in Title 18 of the U.S. Code prohibit: \n     the sale of obscenity on federal property or in Indian \n     Country (Sec. 1460); all mailings of any obscenity \n     (Sec. 1461); use of a common carrier to ship any obscenity in \n     interstate or foreign commerce or smuggle it into the U.S.A. \n     (Sec. 1462); broadcasting obscenity or indecency by radio or \n     TV (Sec. 1464); transporting it across state lines by any \n     method, or using an interstate commerce facility such as \n     computer phone-modems, to ship or transit it for sale or \n     distribution (Sec. 1465); selling obscenity at retail that \n     was shipped through interstate commerce (Sec. 1466); and \n     using cable, subscription, or satellite TV systems to \n     distribute obscenity (Sec. 1468).\n       The Communications Decency Amendment is a good, fair, and \n     constitutional proposal. You and your colleagues have been \n     lied to about what it would do and what it provides. I trust \n     that you seek a proper blend of law and private action and I \n     trust in your instincts to see through the smoke. Without a \n     law, the computer nets will continue to be abused by the \n     purveyors of hard-core obscenity and it will continue to be a \n     place in which responsible adults should fear to let their \n     children play. A law that does not prohibit unlawful \n     materials is no law at all to the pornography syndicates, \n     their associates, and the addicted customers. An overly \n     strict law would not be tolerated by the courts, for fear of \n     an unconstitutional prior restraint.\n       There is no reasonable doubt that only a carefully worded \n     and First Amendment sensitive statute will survive the legal \n     challenges that the ACLU, Center for Democracy and \n     Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and some \n     commercial pornography companies will mount. The CDA can \n     withstand the tests to be applied, no other proposal can make \n     that claim. This is a serious \n\n[[Page S 9775]]\n     problem and needs a serious and lawful solution. The CDA would be a \n     valid extension of federal obscenity law to the computer \n     networks and a valid extension of dial-a-porn protections for \n     children from indecent adult material.\n       Our hope is that you sponsor and support the CDA as passed \n     by the Senate. Your leadership would probably insure its \n     passage. The country, all us parents and grandparents, all of \n     our children, our neighbors, even the addicted customers need \n     your help and that of your fellow Members of the House of \n     Representatives. Please reconsider and look at the \n     Communications Decency Amendment in a new light. It is a good \n     bill. Look for yourself. It won't lie to you like porn \n     advocates have.\n       Please let us know if we can help you in this regard.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Bruce A. Taylor,\n                                        President & Chief Counsel.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, this letter is by a distinguished lawyer, \nwho has, I guess, as much experience with the prosecution of \npornographers as most lawyers in the United States would recognize as a \nreal authority on the subject.\n  The letter of July 10 is addressed to the Honorable Christopher Cox \nof the House of Representatives and the Honorable Ron Wyden of the \nHouse of Representatives. The subject is the Cox-Wyden bill on Internet \nconnectors as consistent with the Exon-Coats Senate decency amendment. \nAnd I quote:\n\n       Dear Representatives Cox and Wyden: Please excuse the \n     length of this letter, but much misinformation needs to be \n     corrected and this is an issue of utmost importance to \n     America's children and families. You have been lied to. I'd \n     like to give you my views on the pornographer's propaganda \n     and offer an explanation of the true meaning of the Exon-\n     Coats amendment dealing with computer assisted obscenity and \n     the problem of indecency being made available to minors.\n       A review of your proposed legislation to protect the \n     computer information service providers shows that you are \n     trying to accomplish the same objectives as the Senate \n     version of the communications decency amendment (``CDA'').\n      Whatever you may have been led to believe about the ``Exon-\n     Coats amendment'' is obviously incorrect. The Senate bill \n     accomplishes the same benefits and protections your \n     proposed bill seeks to provide. However, I feel your bill, \n     in giving immunity and a defense without a corresponding \n     offense, will have the opposite effect to that which you \n     seek.\n\n  Mr. President, although the letter has been printed in the Record, I \nwould like at this time to quote from the last two or three paragraphs:\n\n       The communications decency amendment is a good, fair, and \n     constitutional proposal. You and your colleagues have been \n     lied to about what it would do and what it provides. I trust \n     that you seek a proper blend of law and private action and I \n     trust in your instincts to see through the smoke. Without a \n     law, the computer nets will continue to be abused by the \n     purveyors of hard-core obscenity and it will continue to be a \n     place in which responsible adults should fear to let their \n     children play. A law that does not prohibit unlawful \n     materials is no law at all to the pornography syndicates, \n     their associates, and the addicted customers. An overly \n     strict law would not be tolerated by the courts, for fear of \n     an unconstitutional prior restraint.\n       There is no reasonable doubt that only a carefully worded \n     and first amendment sensitive statute will survive the legal \n     challenges of the ACLU, Center for Democracy and Technology, \n     Electronic Frontier Foundation, and some commercial \n     pornographic companies will mount. The CDA can withstand the \n     tests to be applied, no other proposal can make that claim. \n     This is a serious problem and needs a serious and lawful \n     solution. The CDA would be a valid extension of Federal \n     obscenity law to the computer networks and a valid extension \n     of dial-a-porn protections for children from indecent adult \n     material.\n       Our hope is that you sponsor and support the CDA as passed \n     by the Senate. Your leadership would probably insure its \n     passage. The country, all us parents and grandparents, all of \n     our children, our neighbors, even the addicted customers need \n     your help and that of your fellow Members of the House of \n     Representatives. Please reconsider and look at the \n     communications decency amendment in a new light. It is a good \n     bill. Look for yourself. It won't lie to you like porn \n     advocates have.\n       Please let me know if we can be of help in this regard.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Bruce A. Taylor,\n         President and Chief Counsel for the National Law Center \n           for Children and Families\n\n  Mr. President, since the Exon-Coats measure passed with a 84 to 16 \nmajority, the Senate of the United States sent a very loud and clear \nsignal that something has to be done about obscenity. Something has to \nbe done with regard to material that is being used promiscuously on the \nInternet today. This is a wonderful new system for the distribution of \ninformation. But if we are to sit idly by and listen to some of the \nopponents, who do not want to do anything about this problem, the \nAmerican people are being convinced and are now being told by national \npublications, including Time magazine, who last week had an indepth \nstory with a front-page cover showing a child.\n  This is a carefully crafted piece of legislation. It is obviously \nnecessary, as has become evident to most people who have taken the time \nto either see this smut--and I use that word very advisedly because it \ndoes not begin to describe the bestiality and the sexual perverts that \nhave invaded this system, primarily to make money.\n  The courts have continually held that we have the right to do \nsomething in the courts when we have this kind of material in full \nswing. We had a hearing in the Commerce Committee today, primarily on \nviolence on television. The people are justifiably upset about that. We \nalso talked today about the large amount of sex and suggested sex that \nis being thrown at our children today. The Exon-Coats proposal with \nregard to our Internet system is an important step in the right \ndirection. And as more and more people look at it, and as more and more \npeople recognize all of the lies that are being told about this piece \nof legislation--simply untruths designed and planted in many \npublications by those who want the pornographers to run at will and be \navailable at will to our children on the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a step in the right direction. I have \npersonally hand delivered a copy of this letter that I had printed in \nthe Record to the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno. I \nhave had a personal conversation with the Vice President of the United \nStates about this today. He was very much interested in this letter. I \nfaxed the letter to him. In addition thereto, I have had delivered \ntoday to the White House itself, to the attention of the President, \nthis well-thought-out letter that adequately and honestly describes the \nwell-thought-out Exon-Coats amendment. I only hope that the Members of \nthe House of Representatives will awaken. I think too many of them have \nbeen misled and lied to about the communications decency amendment. I \nhope it becomes law.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9770-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9775-S9777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to offer a few comments this \nafternoon about the need for regulatory reform and then more \nspecifically about a substitute amendment that I anticipate will be \noffered, if not today then sometime during the course of the debate on \nthis bill.\n  At the outset, I would like to make clear that I believe that we need \nto have regulatory reform in this country. We now have what is fairly \ndescribed as a cumbersome regulatory morass. I think it is the result \nof over 40 years of having a very activist Government. The number of \nexecutive branch and independent regulatory agencies has been steadily \nincreasing since the New Deal. This increase in the size of Government \nhas been compounded by the fact that Congress passes hundreds of new \nlaws every year, while statutes are rarely taken off the books. With \neach new law comes an ever-expanding set of detailed rules and \nregulations. So, while we cannot deny the fact that those faceless \nFederal bureaucrats do compound the problem, we also ought to look \nright here at home in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, \nbecause we, too, have responsibility for this trend of more and more \nlaws which require more and more regulations.\n  This regulatory burden that Congress has created, I think everyone \nrecognizes, is daunting even for the largest \n\n[[Page S 9776]]\nof corporations that can hire a whole spate of attorneys to advise them \nin complying with the regulations that are imposed. But I think the \nburden is clearly overwhelming for most of the small businesses in this \ncountry that are bombarded with reams of technical legalese and ordered \nto comply with regulations they do not understand. These are the very \nsmall businesses which happen to be the backbone of this country's \neconomy. I think the overwhelming burden they are required to measure \nup to, and many cannot do so, has contributed in large part to the \ndisenchantment with Government we are seeing in recent years.\n  We have heard a lot about bringing common sense into the regulatory \nprocess. My colleague from Utah has spoken about this. But I would like \nto point out the fact it was Senator Glenn, of Ohio, whom I recall \nfirst holding up the book, ``The Death of Common Sense,'' in one of our \nhearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee. We can all quote from \nthis book and others, giving anecdotes which lay a foundation for the \nneed for change in this country.\n  One anecdote from that book discusses an OSHA regulation that \nrequires manufacturers to describe the possible harmful effects of a \nhazardous substance on every package or container of the product. In \n1991, OSHA decided that packages of everyday bricks must contain a \nhazardous substance notice because a small amount of silica is released \nwhen the bricks are sawed in half. But OSHA did not consider the fact \nthat bricks are rarely sawed in half, and that when they are only trace \namounts of silica would be released. Nonetheless, the agency imposed \nthis useless paperwork requirement on the Nation's brick manufacturers. \nClearly, in that case, common sense did not prevail.\n  I recently held a field hearing in Maine on Government regulations. I \nheard of another case where Federal regulators appeared to lose their \ncommon sense. A number of years ago, the Food and Drug Administration, \nthe FDA, demanded that McCurdy Fish Co., of Lubec, ME, change its \nproduction method to protect the public from the threat of botulism. \nThe FDA's extensive testing, however, never found any contamination in \nMcCurdy's product. In addition, the FDA was applying a safety standard \nfor freshwater fish even though McCurdy sold small ocean herring, a \ntotally different type of fish. Nonetheless, FDA insisted that this \nsmall company purchase $75,000 worth of equipment to eliminate a hazard \nthat had never arisen in the past and that was unlikely to ever arise \nin the future. Yet, with only $250,000 of annual revenue, McCurdy \nsimply could not comply. As a result, it was forced to close its doors \nback in 1991, eliminating 22 jobs in an industry that had been part of \nthat small community since the early 1800's.\n  Twenty-two jobs may not sound like a lot to many of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate, but 22 jobs in a small town like Lubec, on the \ncoast of Maine, has a major impact upon the local economy. That is \nanother case where common sense did not prevail. It is another case \nwhere we saw regulations proposed and imposed by the so-called faceless \nbureaucrats which really produced an inequitable result.\n  Even though all of us can point to these types of horror stories and \nwe can all agree that we need to reform our regulatory system, I think \nthere is substantial difference of opinion about what is the correct \nsolution.\n  First of all, I do not think we can accomplish reform in a one-shot \nproposition. It cannot be accomplished on one piece of legislation; it \ncannot be accomplished overnight. As impatient as we might be to remove \nthese excessive layers of regulation that have been accumulating over \nthe past 40 years, we cannot succumb to the temptation to look for a \nquick fix that is going to cause many more problems than it hopes to \nresolve. Real regulatory reform requires Congress to review each and \nevery piece of Federal legislation, to repeal the laws that are no \nlonger working or serving a useful purpose, and fix those that are \nunnecessarily causing an undue burden on our economy.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to do that. That is what needs to be \ndone. We should not try to pass some sort of regulatory reformation \nhere that is going to deal on a procedural level with what needs to be \nfocused on in terms of substantive issues.\n  The bill before the Senate seeks regulatory reform through procedural \nreform rather than substantive changes in the law, and it focuses on \nreforming the process for implementing and reviewing these Federal \nregulations. The Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I sit, has \nbeen struggling with this issue for decades. Some 20 years ago the \ncommittee first issued a comprehensive report, concluding that the \nregulatory system was too costly and the process for developing the \nregulations too often ignored the costs that those regulations imposed \non the economy. And the problems have only worsened since that time. \nThe annual cost of Federal regulation was recently estimated to be \napproximately $560 billion for 1992 and projected to reach the \nstaggering level of $660 billion by the year 2000.\n  The remedy for this ill is twofold. First, Congress has to stop \npassing laws without considering the huge costs we are imposing on the \neconomy in comparison to the benefits that are going to be derived.\n Second, after Congress does pass a law, the executive branch agencies \nneed to make every effort to interpret and enforce the laws in the \nleast costly manner possible.\n\n  I believe that S. 291, which is the bill that was unanimously \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee this past March, \nrepresented a balanced approach toward reforming the regulatory \nprocess. A version of that bill is going to be introduced as a \nsubstitute by Senator Glenn and Senator Chafee later on during the \ncourse of the debate on this measure. It requires the agencies to \nperform cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for major rules. It \nauthorizes sufficiently rigorous judicial review to ensure that the \nagencies take this responsibility very seriously. And it mandates that \nagencies review their existing regulations of cost effectiveness.\n  I believe this approach is clearly superior to the one that we are \ncurrently considering.\n  These provisions, combined with the congressional review process \nalready passed by the Senate, would represent a marked improvement in \nour current regulatory system. I am a cosponsor of the Glenn-Chafee \nsubstitute and hope it gains the support of my colleagues.\n  The Glenn-Chafee substitute is also commendable because it does not \nalter substantive statutes that are currently in effect and does not \ndelegated to unelected Federal judges the authority to second-guess \nCongress' judgments about the costs and benefits of public policies.\n  I frankly do not believe it is appropriate to attempt to alter \ncarefully crafted legislation, some of which has enjoyed the support of \nCongresses over the years, through a statute which is designed to \nimprove Federal rulemaking. If we do not like the Clean Water Act, if \nwe do not like the Clean Air Act, if we do not like the Superfund Act, \nwe ought to change them. But what we are doing is calling upon the \nregulators to change the substantive law that we have the \nresponsibility to modify and to change if we are dissatisfied with it.\n  I also believe it is inappropriate for a Congress which is concerned \nabout litigation, about lawyers, about judges, about judicial activism, \nto suddenly hand them our laws and say, ``Here, you take care of this. \nYou decide whether the agencies have exceeded their mandate. You decide \nwhether or not their cost-benefit analysis was correct or inaccurate. \nYou decide whether or not the least possible cost is involved here, as \nopposed to another regulatory alternative.''\n  I do not believe that judges are well-equipped to evaluate whether \nthe social and economic benefits of a policy justify its costs. The \nbalancing of costs and benefits is essentially a political judgment, \nnot a legal one. If a law passed by Congress requires agencies to \nimplement inefficient regulations, then the responsibility for \nreversing those regulations rests with Congress. The Glenn-Chafee \nalternative accomplishes this by requiring the agencies to notify \nCongress when a regulation fails a cost-benefit test and by giving \nCongress the power to void any such regulation through expedited \nprocedures. \n\n[[Page S 9777]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think, for a Congress which is concerned about too \nmuch litigation taking place in this country, this bill is really \ninviting more litigation, and more lawyers and judges to now start \ninterpreting what is taking place in the agencies, rather than the \nCongress measuring up to its own responsibility.\n  So I think that the pending bill before us certainly can be improved \nupon. If the goal of regulatory reform is to make Government work \nbetter, we should not be overloading the Government with so many \nanalytical requirements that it does not work at all. We cannot on the \none hand bog agencies down with analytical requirements and expose them \nto additional litigation, and at the same time demand that they be able \nto meet the public's demand for prompt action.\n  One thing is for sure. We know this. If another bacteria infects the \ncity water system, the public is going to want to know, ``Where is the \nEPA?'' If workers are trapped in a factory fire, the public is going to \nwant to know, ``Where was OSHA at the time to prevent this incident \nfrom taking place?'' If there is an outbreak of contaminated meat, \npeople will look to the Department of Agriculture for answers. The \npublic wants smaller and less intrusive Government. It also expects the \nGovernment to perform a core set of functions promptly and effectively.\n  So these are the issues that are of concern to me: The effect of the \nbill on existing law, the role of the courts, and the cumulative burden \non the agencies.\n  I believe the Glenn-Chafee substitute is superior to the bill we are \nconsidering. I do not know if it will gain a majority. But I hope it \nreceives sufficient support to force some needed changes to S. 343.\n  Over the past week of debate, progress has been made on a number of \nfronts and some improvements have been made to the bill. The Johnston \namendment raising the threshold for major rules from $50 to $100 \nmillion was a step in the right direction.\n  I would like to see the process of negotiation and compromise \ncontinue so a regulatory reform bill passes the Senate by a substantial \nmargin and a bill emerges from conference that will be signed into law \nby the President. A truly bipartisan regulatory reform bill that could \nbe enthusiastically supported by both parties would go a long way to \nrestoring some of the confidence in our government that unfortunately \nhas eroded over the past years.\n  I see both of the authors of the bill on the floor. I want to commend \nthem for being open to making changes. I think some real progress has \nbeen made during the last several days to improve the legislation now \npending.\n  I am hopeful that we will see even more changes to make sure that a \nstrong bipartisan group of Senators supports the legislation.\n  For that reason, I would like to urge very strong consideration of \nthe Glenn-Chafee substitute when it is proposed.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to the remarks by \nthe senior Senator from Maine because on our committee, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, he has been one of the stalwarts on the \nRepublican side in working on these matters of regulatory reform, and \nhe deserves a lot of credit for that.\n  I particularly appreciate his remarks. He is a cosponsor of the \nGlenn-Chafee approach to this whole matter of regulatory reform. We \nworked with him through the years. And I know how devoted he is to \nbringing some reform in this particular area.\n  So I appreciate his remarks very, very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendments \nnumbered 1502 and 1503 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 1502 and 1503) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJohnston be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment, the text of \nwhich is the pending Johnston amendment, and that a vote occur on the \nfirst-degree amendment with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold that? It is a \nsimilar text but since it strikes in a different part of the bill, it \nwill not be an identical text to that now pending.\n  Mr. HATCH. With that understanding.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it was our \nopinion that we knew exactly what we were going to vote on at 5 \no'clock. Now I do understand that is liable to be changed?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under the rules, in order to accomplish what we wanted \nto accomplish, we had to amend a different page and section of the \nbill. The guts of this would be identical with a couple of really \nstylistic changes. The way it would read is: Any rulemaking pending on \nJuly 12, 1995, for which a notice of proposed rulemaking or a proposed \nrulemaking has been published in the Federal Register before April 1, \n1995--et cetera.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to see it first so we can \nconsider it with staff and look at it. We will put in a quorum call. I \ndo not know what this does to our 5 o'clock time that was planned. I \nthink we can probably resolve it between now and 5 o'clock. If we do, I \nwill have no objection.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9775-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9777-S9792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RESCISSIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I was on the floor earlier today trying to just \npresent some clarity about the rescissions bill. I will not go over my \nremarks I made earlier, but, Mr. President, the simple point I made was \nthat Senator Moseley-Braun and I, Friday and today, always made it \nclear that we had several amendments, altogether four amendments, and \nwe agreed to 50 minutes on each amendment, to be in the evening and the \nstacked votes the next day, and equally divided for summary, 50 minutes \nequally divided. That seemed an eminently reasonable proposal, \nespecially for a bill where there were changes from what we had done in \nthe Senate and wanted a chance to make some changes in this piece of \nlegislation.\n  That was rejected by the majority leader, Mr. President, which amazed \nme. I mean, to argue that Senators cannot come out and have some \namendments and some discussion about a peace of legislation so people \nknow what is in there, it seems to me to go against the grain of what \nwe are about and what representative democracy is about.\n  Now I see something put out by the Republican Policy Committee, ``The \nCost of Delay: The Filibuster * * *.'' So, Mr. President, could I just \nread from the dictionary about what a filibuster is? ``The Cost of \nDelay: The Filibuster * * *.'' Here is the definition of ``filibuster'' \nright out of the dictionary. ``The use of obstructionist tactics such \nas the making of prolonged speeches or the introduction of irrelevant \nmaterial for the purpose of delaying legislative action.''\n  Our amendments are hardly irrelevant. They deal exactly with these \ncuts. We wanted to have some offsets. We agreed to a time limit on the \namendments; less than an hour for each one. And now I see this \naccusation of the filibuster.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to, if I could read one more time \nthe definition of ``filibuster.'' Maybe my colleague could further \nexplain what the filibuster is, although I----\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I cannot think of a better colleague to do that for \nme. One more time before we get into these kinds of accusations and \nthis kind of attack politics, ``The Cost of Delay: \n\n[[Page S 9778]]\nThe Filibuster * * *.'' ``Filibuster. The use of obstructionist tactics \nsuch as the making of prolonged speeches or the introduction of \nirrelevant material for the purpose of delaying legislative action; an \ninstance of the use of such tactics, especially in the United States \nSenate.''\n  Again, when Senators have amendments to a piece of legislation, very \nrelevant, and agree to a time limit, and make it very clear that all we \nwant is an opportunity to have a debate and discussion so people know \nwhat the priorities are of this rescission bill and some opportunities \nto improve it as we see it and better represent our constituents, that \nis hardly a filibuster.\n  My second point, by the way, Mr. President, is there is no delay on \nour part. The delay is on the part of the majority leader who will not \naccept an eminently reasonable proposal. There is probably not a \nSenator in the U.S. Senate, Democrat or Republican, I say to my \ncolleague from Utah, who does not believe that it is important for us, \nespecially if we do not block a motion to proceed and especially if we \nhave a time agreement, to have an opportunity to improve a piece of \nlegislation.\n  I would be pleased to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would yield, I just enjoyed the Senator's \nremarks. And as someone who has seen filibusters on both sides, it is a \nlittle more than long, interminable speeches and irrelevant materials \nbeing brought up. The fact of the matter is that we have now been on \nthis E. coli matter for 2 solid days when the original bill took care \nof that problem. Then to resolve it even further, to make it more \nexplicit, Senator Dole brought his amendment forth yesterday, and it \npassed and solved it again.\n  Now we are talking about exempting all of the HACCP rules, basically \neverything that the Department of Agriculture wants to do. To be honest \nwith you, we know that this amendment is an amendment just plain geared \nto try to stop this bill, because if you exempt one agency, then we \nwill see 50 people in here arguing to exempt other agencies or other \nagency particulars or other special interests. And we would like to \njust see them all covered.\n  Now, the E. coli is taken care of. The meat problems are taken care \nof in this bill. They were taken care of before we got into this \namendment process. We have been tied in knots for 2 days over this E. \ncoli problem that was taken care of in the original bill. We have tried \nto solve the problem for the other side by restating it. We have put \nnew language in this bill. And, frankly, there is a belief on the part \nof many--I think some on both sides of the aisle, many--that there is \ndelay for delay's sake here.\n  Now, whether that is true or not, I am not going to say this early in \nthis stage of the bill. But it looks to me like it is starting to smell \nlike it is true. And it is no secret that this is a bill that many on \nthe other side and some on our side do not want to pass. But the vast \nmajority here in the Senate do. And I think it is time to go ahead.\n  Now, we do not have a time agreement. I have tried to get a time \nagreement. It has been objected to or at least they have asked me to \nwithhold until the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana can be thoroughly examined by the other side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I might also add that the Senator from Louisiana could \nhave modified his amendment at a whim, as it sat on the desk up here \nbefore we talked about a unanimous consent agreement. And he modified \nit. And in a very innocuous--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thought he yielded the floor. I apologize. I thought he \nyielded the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just so the Senator would--I will let \nthe Senator from Ohio respond, but just for a moment, I want the \nSenator from Utah to know, I was actually not referring to this piece \nof legislation at all.\n  Mr. HATCH. You were referring to something else?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct. I just want to make it clear that \nwhen I see a piece of literature coming out on a rescissions bill \ntitled ``The Cost of Delay: The Filibuster * * *,'' I just wanted to \nread for some of my colleagues who make these accusations the \ndefinition of ``filibuster.'' It seems to me when Senators are going to \nbe engaged in these kinds of attacks, we ought to be clear what a \nfilibuster is. So, I read the definition of ``filibuster.'' And I will \ndo it one more time. Dictionary definition: ``The use of obstructionist \ntactics such as the making of prolonged speeches or the introduction of \nirrelevant material for the purpose of delaying legislative action.''\n  Our proposed amendments are not irrelevant. They are directly \nrelevant to this bill. We have offsets. We have agreed to amendments. \nWe have agreed to time limits on those amendments. That is in no way, \nshape or form a filibuster.\n  I do not want to interrupt the flow of discussion about this bill, \nbut I must say that if this goes on, I am going to have to come out \nhere and start reading definitions of democracy and other such terms \nthat are important to the way we conduct our business.\n  But, Mr. President, before I yield the floor, let me just make it \nclear one more time. I did this morning, and I want to say it one more \ntime. Senator Moseley-Braun and I have been very clear. We were clear \nFriday; we are clear now. The bill comes over, changes are made, \nchanges are made late Thursday night, changes that are made that we \nthink make this rescissions bill not the bill that was passed out of \nthe Senate.\n  We think it could use improvement. We think the people in the country \ndo not know about some of these changes. We are not at all sure that \nsome people's priorities are to cut low-income home energy assistance, \nsummer jobs training, job training for dislocated workers, or \ncounseling programs for seniors when it comes to consumer protection on \nhealth policies that they purchase. Therefore, we wanted the \nopportunity and desired the opportunity and made it clear to have some \ndiscussion. I do not know why my colleagues are afraid of some limited \ndiscussion about this so people in the country know what is in it. But \nit certainly is not a filibuster. We are ready to proceed as soon as \nthere is no longer any delay, and I certainly hope the majority leader \nwill be willing to let us go forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, let me clarify this. There was an agreement \nworked out between the leaders. Senator Hatch was in the process of \nreading that. There was disagreement with it from Senator Johnston, who \nis a coauthor of S. 343, the Dole-Johnston bill. He wanted to change \nhis amendment in some respects in the middle of the unanimous-consent \nrequest. I wanted to see what the changes were, which I do not think is \nat all unreasonable. If they were innocuous, fine, we would go ahead \nwith it. It turned out they are a bit more substantive than I \nanticipated--dates changed, wording changed. So we have had staff \nworking on it as fast as we can, checking with people who are more \nfamiliar with this than some of us.\n  So that is what is going on right now. There was no intention to \ndelay on our part whatsoever. It is just that in the middle of a \nunanimous-consent which we thought we had agreement on, changes were \nmade in what we were about to vote on supposedly at 5 o'clock. I do not \nthink it is unreasonable at all to know what it is we are voting on \nwhen something is being changed. That is the problem.\n  They are in the cloakroom right now. I think we are going to have \nagreement on this shortly, but I am not willing to agree to a \nunanimous-consent request until we know what the vote is going to be \non. We thought it was going to be on the amendment that we debated all \nday. The amendment has changed somewhat. As soon as this is worked out, \nwe can set the vote.\n  There is no attempt to delay. The change is made not in favor of the \nGlenn-Chafee bill, but one of the coauthors of the Dole-Johnston bill. \nThat is the reason we are where we are with this delay.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair. \n\n[[Page S 9779]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have been following the debate in an effort to \nunderstand exactly what the ramifications are of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] and the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston].\n  The manager of the bill, the Senator from Utah, has discussed the \nmatter with me, and in order to try to obtain some clarification, I \ncalled the Secretary of Agriculture to try to understand the specifics \nas to what is involved here on the inspection of meat and poultry.\n  I favor regulatory reform and, in the course of the debate and \namendments for consideration, I have supported amendments which will \nreform the regulatory process to try to eliminate some of the red tape \nwhich is now present. But I do believe that when it comes to matters of \nhealth and safety, we have to be very, very careful about how the \nreform measures impact the regulatory process. Furthermore, the \nregulatory process has to be reasonable so business can proceed without \nundue regulations.\n  There is general agreement today that there is excessive governmental \nregulation, and it is not easy to find the appropriate balance. In my \njudgment, it depends upon the specifics.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture pointed out to me the problems which \nhave been discussed at some length regarding E. coli bacteria and \nsalmonella. He said that for some 10 years, there has been an interest \nin the scientific community in moving beyond the traditional touching \nand smelling; that from the E. coli and salmonella, some 4,000 people \ndie each year and several hundred thousand are made ill; that the \nproposed rulemaking, which was submitted in January, has brought \ncomments from many, many people, thousands of comments, and they are in \nthe process of considering those comments.\n  The Secretary says there will be appropriate consideration so that \nthere will not be an undue regulatory burden. He has received many \ncomplaints from the small packers who complained, understandably, about \nthe cost in the testing, and there have been some complaints that they \nhave not had enough of an input in the process. Secretary Glickman says \nthat there will not be a final rule until there has been very \nsubstantial input from small business.\n  The second-degree amendment which has been offered by Senator \nJohnston would exempt, as I understand it, the rulemaking process which \nSecretary Glickman is concerned about here but would not stop at a \nlater time somebody going back and insisting on the kind of cost \nanalysis which might invalidate the rule which the Department of \nAgriculture is considering at the present time.\n  A question which is on my mind is whether there should not be some \ninput from the Secretary of Agriculture who could make recommendations \nso that we could have legislative language which would protect the \nsmall packers, the small business people and have some guarantees \nagainst excessive regulations, but which would not tie the Secretary's \nhands on taking the steps which are necessary to guarantee the safety \nof meat and poultry.\n  On this date of the record, it is my view at the moment, and I am \nprepared to listen to further argument, while the amendment by Senator \nJohnston is a significant step forward in exempting the current \nregulatory process at least for the time being, that it is not a \nguarantee that there will not be some revision at a later time which \nwould jeopardize the sanitary condition of meat and poultry.\n  My colleague from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, asked me to review it to try to give him my thinking, \nbecause there is a vote count going on now. As I see it at the moment, \nI would support the Johnston amendment, but similarly I would support \nthe Daschle amendment. I told my colleague from Utah it might be useful \nto have a discussion on the record.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my colleague's candor. Actually, the Dole \namendment yesterday solved the problem. Johnston solves it even \nfurther. What apparently the Secretary of Agriculture does not like is \nthe petition process provided in this bill.\n I just suggest that if, 5 years from now, science dictates there is a \nneed for a change, what is wrong with having the petition process to \nhelp to effectuate that change? That is what is provided for here.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that the Daschle amendment exempts the \nDepartment of Agriculture rules asserting hazard analysis and critical \ncontrol point systems from S. 343. Those are the systems that deal with \nE. coli in meat and poultry. Now, it is not necessary because yesterday \nthe Senate, by a large margin, accepted Senator Dole's amendment that \nmakes it absolutely clear what was already present in S. 343, that the \nbill contains emergency exemptions from cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment requirements of the bill. Consequently, where an emergency \nexists, where food safety from E. coli bacteria exists, S. 343 would \npermit and allow for a prompt promulgation of the HACCP rules.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. First, I will add one other thing. The Johnston amendment \ntakes care of the problem without exempting a rule from the bill, which \nis a very bad precedent. If we exempt one rule, everybody will be in \nhere with their own special rules. We think all of the agencies should \nhave the obligation under this bill to pass reasonable regulations.\n  The Johnston amendment makes clear that the proposed rules in the \npipeline as of April 1, 1995, will not have to redo cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment. This applies to the E. coli and food \nsafety USDA-proposed rules, as well.\n  Now, as I understand it--and I think it is a silly argument--those \narguments for the Daschle amendment want a complete exemption for the \nDepartment of Agriculture rules because that would mean there would be \nno costly petition pursuant to section 633 of S. 343, and the petition \nneed not be done. I call that silly because the petition process should \nlie for proposed rules prior to April 1, 1995. If it turns out that \nscientific assumptions underlying the bill are erroneous, or the rule \nturns out to be burdensome, why not allow for the petition and the \nagency rule? The rule would still be in effect if the petition is \nfiled, so one can argue that safety will not be harmed.\n  So we do not think that is essential. We think Johnston covers the \nproblem and Dole does. We do not think there should be an exception for \none aspect of regulation that would open the bill for all kinds of \narguments that other aspects should be accepted at all. The petition \nprocess guarantees that we have the best science, and that petition \nprocess goes on for years.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If my colleague will yield for a question, there are a \nnumber of questions I would like to discuss with the Senator from Utah, \nbut I will start with the core question. When you talk about not \nwanting to have an exception because then you would have other \nexceptions, is not the issue of safety and health as it relates to meat \nand poultry a very, very unique circumstance which justifies an \nexception for that very important category? What other categories would \nthe Senator from Utah anticipate seeking exemptions? Because if there \nare other categories where an exemption is accorded on a case-by-case \nbasis, I think that is something the Senate ought to consider.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator would allow me, Mr. President, I will \nanswer. The unique circumstance of meat and poultry inspection is not \nunique, but it is an unusual circumstance, in that you have a \nrulemaking that is already mature, that has been out there for a couple \nof years, and they have already done a cost-benefit analysis and it is \nready to go into operation, I think, later this year or early next \nyear. In other words, it is ready to go, and the unusual circumstance \nis that you do not want to have to go back and redo that. And under the \nJohnston amendment, that would be exempted from the provisions of this \nbill, so that the rule can go into effect.\n  Now, with respect to future rulemakings, 2 years from now or 5 years \nfrom now, we are saying this activity, even though it deals with public \nhealth, ought to have to go through the same scientific evaluation as \nany rules, \n\n[[Page S 9780]]\nbecause almost all of this bill is concerned either with safety, with \nhealth, or with the environment. If we are going to exempt this, then \nwhy not product safety? You know, automobiles kill a lot of people. Why \nnot the Clean Air Act? The Clean Air Act kills more people than E. coli \nby factors of hundreds. Hundreds of people die because of asthma, or \nwhatever, because of unclean air. There is no problem with emergency \nrules. We have that taken care of, and we have a further amendment, \neven better, to take care of that.\n  But the point is, you do not want to exempt future rules from \nscientific evaluation, from risk assessment, and from cost-benefit just \nbecause they deal with health, because almost everything deals with \neither health, safety, or the environment. We do want to exempt this \nrulemaking, which is ready to go forward and which will protect the \npublic. We do not want to delay that.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture has a very legitimate concern there. But \nwe do not want to come along on a case-by-case basis and exempt \nanything that relates to health or safety or the environment, which is \nimportant, too, because then you have no bill left.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Has there been an effort made to seek any exemption \nbeyond this one on the Department of Agriculture?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. As part of the unanimous consent, we had requested that \nthere be an agreement that there be no other amendments once we vote on \nthe Daschle amendment with respect to health or safety. That was not \nagreed to on this side.\n  Frankly, I have been asking around about what is next on that, and I \nhave heard, well, there might be one on mammography, there might be one \non cryptosporidium. Who knows? It is health and it is important, sure; \neverything is important. But under the Johnston amendment, any ongoing \nrulemaking is not going to be stopped. That is going to be allowed to \ngo into operation. And if any emergency situation beyond that comes up, \nthe bill will allow you to take care of the emergency situation. But if \nyou have a new rulemaking, even though it relates to health, or safety, \nor the environment, that ought to pass scientific muster just like \neverything else because, look, great wrongs are committed in the name \nof health. In fact, most of the problems have been committed in the \nname of health.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Both ways.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Both ways. But we are correcting that with the Johnston \namendment. And then, other than that, we subject all rules to good \nscience. That is what this bill is basically about.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may reply for a moment to what the Senator from \nLouisiana has commented about. I would be interested to see in the \nunanimous consent request if the issue is just limited to the \nDepartment of Agriculture. That would be very weighing on my mind on \nhow I vote on the Daschle amendment.\n  I support the Johnston amendment. I think it is a decisive step \nforward. I discussed this earlier today off the floor with the Senator \nfrom Louisiana. I think it is a step forward. But I want to know what \nother specific situations might rise to the level of the problem of the \nE. coli and the salmonella.\n  Is it not true, if I may ask, whether there is not a lookback \nprocedure, as the expression is used, even with passage of the Johnston \namendment, that would open the door to reevaluation of this regulatory \nprocess that the Secretary of Agriculture is now engaged in?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What it provides is that a year after the effective \ndate, the Secretary or the agency shall list all rules which he or she \nthinks should be reviewed and that he or she thinks cannot pass muster \nunder the bill; that is, where the benefits do not justify the costs.\n  So that the Secretary himself or herself, if they want to review one \nof these rules, they can. They can do that anyway, today.\n  In addition to that, if someone out there feels aggrieved, they can \nfile a petition for a review. That is the lookback the Senator is \ntalking about. But it is a high threshold.\n  They have to show a substantial likelihood that they could not meet \nthe test. The basic test is that the benefits justify the cost.\n  Mr. SPECTER. To what extent does the Daschle amendment change that?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It would exempt it from any scientific evaluation as \nprovided for in this bill whatever.\n  For the future, or lookback or anything else, this would be it. No \nquestions asked. It would be business as usual with respect to this \nactivity.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just add to my colleague from Pennsylvania, we \ndo not believe anything should be exempt from S. 343, because what S. \n343 requires is that we consistently push for the best science \navailable.\n  Frankly, the problem the Johnston amendment does deal with is what \nyou do with proposed rules before the effective date. The amendment \nwould set the date of April 1, 1995, as the cutoff date. Anything \nbefore that date, including E. coli rules, will not have to redo \nalready done risk assessments and cost-benefit analysis--if, in the \ndiscretion of the head of that agency, they have already done that.\n  We do not want to have to do unnecessary, duplicative risk \nassessments and cost-benefit analysis. That is what his amendment does.\n  Frankly, safety is not the issue in this matter. Safety is taken care \nof through the Johnston amendment. Money is really the issue. Frankly, \nthere is little or no reason for the Daschle amendment, once we have \nthe Johnston amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues. I will confer further with the \nSecretary and further study the matter.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I was going to suggest as a way to \nhandle this unanimous consent that I send an amendment to the desk at \nthis time, and that the unanimous consent refer to the amendment at the \ndesk. I will not do so until Senator Glenn or the representative of the \nminority leader comes out.\n  I suggest if we do that, we send a Johnston amendment to the desk, \nhave the unanimous consent refer to the Johnston amendment and to the \nDaschle amendment in the way that it is now stated.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Glenn. I was going to suggest I send an \namendment to the desk, and that the unanimous consent refer, then, to \nthe amendment at the desk.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, and I do object right now, \nwe are spelling out what the changes are that have been made so we can \ncomment on them briefly before we go to the unanimous consent request. \nThat is being prepared. It should be ready within 4 or 5 minutes. I \nwould rather do that and then send it to the desk.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator could refer to it in the unanimous-consent.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not see a problem of sending it to the desk.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I still object until we have a chance to \nlook at this.\n  Mr. President, I object, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has the floor.\n  The Chair, in his capacity as a Senator from the State of Wyoming, \nsuggests the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJohnston be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment, the text of \nwhich both sides are acquainted with, and a vote occur on the first-\ndegree amendment with no second-degree amendments in order after 5 \nminutes of debate, divided equally between Senators Johnston and Glenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I further ask that following the vote on the Johnston \namendment, Senator Daschle be recognized to offer a first-degree \namendment, the text of which is the pending Daschle amendment, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order, and a vote occur immediately on the \namendment without any intervening debate or action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S 9781]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the Daschle amendment, no other amendments regarding the \nUSDA HACCP rules proposed on February 3, 1995, be in order during the \npendency of S. 343.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1504 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that risk assessments conducted to support \n    proposed rules may be used to support final rules that are not \n   substantially different with respect to the risk being addressed)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, and Mr. Roth, proposes an amendment numbered 1504 to \n     amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 50, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4) If the agency head determines that--\n       (A) a final major rule subject to this subchapter is \n     substantially similar to the proposed major rule with respect \n     to the risk being addressed;\n       (B) a risk assessment for the proposed major rule has been \n     carried out in substantial accordance with section 633; and\n       (C) a new risk assessment for the final rule is not \n     required in order to respond to comments received during the \n     period for comment on the proposed rule; the head of the \n     agency may publish such determination along with the final \n     rule in lieu of preparing a new risk assessment for the final \n     rule.''\n       1. On page 19 strike out lines 11 through 13 and the words \n     ``than 30 days after such date of enactment),''.\n       2. On page 20, line 9 strike out the words ``(or, in the \n     case of a notice of proposed rulemaking'' and strike out \n     lines 10 through 12.\n       3. On page 43, amend line 11 to read ``agency after the \n     effective date of this subchapter''; strike out lines 12 and \n     13; and strike out ``section 623'' on line 14.\n       4. On page 48 amend lines 4 and 5 to read ``effective date \n     of this subchapter, the head of each''.\n       5. On page 97 relable subsection (b) as subsection (c) and \n     insert a new subsection (b) as follows:\n       ``(b) Any rulemaking pending on July 12, 1995 for which a \n     notice of proposed rulemaking or a proposed rulemake has been \n     published in the Federal register before April 1, 1995 shall \n     not be subject to the provisions of subchapter II or \n     subchapter III of chapter 6 of title 5 U.S. Code except for \n     section 623 (relating to review of rules).''\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I think it is fair to say that the \nJohnston amendment will not be opposed because the Johnston amendment \nis not now a substitute to the Daschle amendment; the Johnston \namendment is a freestanding amendment which exempts the inspection of \nmeat provisions from this subchapter. In other words, it allows that \nrule to go forward without any delay at all. I believe everyone is for \nthat.\n  The controversial amendment will be the Daschle amendment which will \nfollow this because, if and when we adopt the Johnston amendment, it \nwill solve the problem of the rulemaking. But what it will do is exempt \ntotally the whole area from future rulemaking. If we do that with \nrespect to inspection of meat and poultry, then what is next? \nCryptosporidium, clean water, the Clean Air Act, car seats for kids, \nradioactivity? It sets a precedent to exempt everything from this bill \nand, if health is the standard by which you exempt matters from \nscientific determination, then why do a risk assessment at all because \nalmost everything in this bill--almost everything--has to do with \nhealth, safety, or the environment.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote for the Johnston \namendment. I expect that almost everyone will. I urge that they vote \nagainst the Daschle amendment, as that undermines this whole bill \nbecause it sets a precedent for taking everything out of risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis and scientific determination.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the Johnston amendment, as revised, will \nexempt from the cost-benefit and risk assessment provisions of this \nbill any pending rules proposed before April 1 of this year. However, \nSenator Johnston's amendment does not solve the E. coli problem, since \nit would continue to subject the HHCCP rule to a petition and look-back \nprocess, as well as judicial review. That is of considerable concern. \nThese procedures could expose this important public health rule to \nunnecessary and potentially life-threatening delay.\n  In addition, Senator Johnston's amendment would continue to apply the \nrequirements of this bill to many rules now in the pipeline which were \nproposed after April 1. Those rules would be subject to all of the \nrequirements of the bill--cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment \npetitions, and look-back.\n  This amendment would continue to allow the bill to delay rules that \nare currently in the pipeline, such as protections against \ncryptosporidium, unsafe mammography standards, and other important \nrules.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Johnston \namendment and yes on the Daschle amendment, which would clearly permit \nthe HHCCP rule, a rule that would protect the public from tainted meat, \nto go forward without change.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am surprised that Senator Glenn is now \nopposing the Johnston amendment because earlier today he said if the \nJohnston amendment were freestanding, he would support it. It is still \na good amendment. It takes care of the problem. It prevents any delay \nin any pending rule now, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 6 seconds.\n  Mr. GLENN. Earlier today, I said I might. I wanted to see the \nlanguage. I think it was good that I said that earlier. We have had a \ncouple of changes here in the middle of the unanimous-consent request \nthat changed the nature of this.\n  So I did not make a commitment to vote for this in whatever form it \nmight come up. I am for the general principle being proposed, but not \nthe way this was developed today.\n  So I yield the remainder of my time, and I am ready to go to a vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe).

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senate majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Madam President, I understand--if I could have the \nattention of my colleagues--I understand the Senator from Wisconsin has \nan amendment on which he is willing to accept a time agreement of 30 \nminutes. We were going to propose 30 minutes and any second-degree \namendment be limited to 20 minutes equally divided and must be relevant \nto the first-degree amendment.\n  I do not have a copy of the second-degree amendment. There may be one \nor more second-degree amendments. But if we could start off on the \npremise that the Senator from Wisconsin had 30 minutes, maybe by the \ntime he finishes, we will have a copy of the second-degree amendment. \nWill that be OK?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we would certainly want to accommodate \nsome time agreement, but I think in order to accommodate any specific \ntime agreement, we would want to see the second-degree amendment. If we \ncould do that, just as soon as we see it and have a chance to look at \nit, I think we could lock into a time certain. But I would be reluctant \nto lock into any time until we had a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. DOLE. In the meantime, the Senator from Wisconsin will proceed on \nthe basis we hope to have a time agreement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That will be all right.\n  Mr. DOLE. So any of my colleagues who would like to eat, I think it \nis safe to say there will be no votes until 8 p.m.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, how long did the majority leader wish \nto proceed?\n  Mr. DOLE. Hopefully for a while. I understand the Senator from \nDelaware will have an amendment following disposition of the amendment \nof the Senator from Wisconsin. We are not moving too quickly. There are \nstill, as I understand it, numerous amendments. We have not had the \nmajor amendment from the other side, the Glenn amendment.\n  So, we will be here for a while yet this evening.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We have had some delays on both sides.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We have a number of amendments we are sort of waiting \nto get cleared on the other side having to do with the problem Senator \nGlenn pointed out on 180 days within which to perform a risk \nassessment. We want to extend that to a year. That is something on \nwhich we are just waiting for an answer. It is a very simple, \nstraightforward amendment.\n  There is another one having to do with Superfund. Those are really \nbig amendments. If we got those adopted, I think it might change the \nsort of mood, our procedure.\n  They are not, apparently, ready, so I do not insist on it. But I hope \nwe could get a procedure for clearing these amendments on the other \nside as well as on our side.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right. I do not know if we have had any cleared on either \nside, but I think we should try to cooperate where we can. As far as I \nknow, nothing has been cleared.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the majority leader yield for a moment? Madam \nPresident, I ask the majority leader. We have a list, a series of sort \nof major items, and then some less major, that have been presented some \ntime ago. We did, in the day before we departed for the recess, have a \nnegotiating process that at least had just begun. That broke up with \nthe notion that at some point we might hear from people whether we \ncould get back and see if we could make more progress.\n  It is my sense the Senator from Utah has, in good faith, offered to \nsit down. The Senator from Louisiana has. The difficulty is both of \nthem have also had a requirement to be on the floor for a significant \nperiod of time, so it is very hard to try to accomplish what I think \nmight be possible, which is to have progress in the negotiating effort.\n  I do not know if that means, therefore, it might make sense to have a \nprolonged quorum call in the morning, or maybe come in a little later \nand give us time to get together and see if we could find some \ncommonality. But we are still waiting for a response with \n\n[[Page S 9783]]\nsome specificity to those things that have been submitted.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could answer the distinguished Senator?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Utah for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could answer the distinguished Senator, it is my \nunderstanding that both sides are pretty well aware of what we can \nagree to and what we cannot agree to. But I would be happy to sit down \nin the morning and go over every detail and see what we can do.\n  But we have given responses to that. It is my understanding staff has \nbeen informed of what our positions are.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, Senator----\n  Mr. HATCH. If that is not so, I will be happy--I would be happy to \nsit down anyway, because there may be things we can work out.\n  Mr. KERRY. It was my understanding, in conversations a few moments \nago with the Senator from Louisiana, that he thought we had the \ncapacity to accommodate a particular concern on the decisional criteria \nwhich we had some colloquy on yesterday on the floor and some further \nconversation on today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us sit down and see if we can.\n  Mr. KERRY. But we still do not actually have language or an agreement \nto do so, so we are in this sort of nebulous area. I think it would be \nhelpful if we could find the time to work through those critical areas. \nAt that point, a lot of our people who would like to vote for this bill \nif we can fix these things will have the ability to decide whether we \nare close to that, whether that is a reality or not. I think it would \nhelp determine what the course will be on this legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. We had a brief discussion last night, I guess before we \nadjourned, with the Senator from Louisiana because the Senator from \nOhio raised a question last evening about 9 major areas of difference \nand 23 minor areas of difference which consumed--I do not know--25 or \n30 pages of suggestions, or a number of pages.\n  I think we are in the process--at least I understand Senator Hatch \nand Senator Johnston may be in the process--of going through those one \nby one trying to get some response to the Senator from Ohio. But that \ndoes not mean we should not meet and see if we cannot make further \nprogress.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the leader will yield, I have \ncompleted that process and given answers for those. But we will be \nhappy to meet as well and talk about what the answers are.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the leader will also yield for that, I understand from \nthe Senator from Utah that the responses that we now have that we can \ntake a look at overnight are also reflecting his own views and the \nviews of others on that side of the aisle.\n  Is that fair?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is fair. I think it is correct. Of course, we \nare going to continue this dialog throughout this process. There will \nbe an attempt to accommodate folks on both sides of the aisle. We are \ngetting down to where we are going to have to battle out some of these \nissues.\n  Mr. DOLE. We have, I might add, requests for morning business for \nabout an hour and a half in the morning. That might accommodate \nconcerns, and give Senators time to sit down and at least go over each \nof the items.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is my understanding that the Senator from Wisconsin \nwill be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1506 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n(Purpose: To protect the public from the dangers of Cryptosporidium and \n     other drinking water hazards by ensuring timely completion of \n rulemaking to protect the safety of drinking water from microbial and \n                              other risks)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. \n     Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 1506 to amendment \n     numbered 1487.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 19, line 5, strike out ``or''.\n       On page 19, line 7, strike out the period and insert in \n     lieu thereof a semicolon and ``or''.\n       On page 19, add after line 7 the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(xiii) any rule proposed or promulgated by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency that relates to the control \n     of microbial and disinfection byproduct risks to human health \n     in drinking water supplies.''\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, we have heard the arguments made by \nproponents of S. 343 stating that the emergency exemption section of \nthis bill will protect urgent health and safety regulations in the \npipeline. However, a careful reading of the legislation reveals that \nmany essential regulations would not be protected under this section or \nthe bill as a whole. My amendment will address a particularly serious \nomission: namely regulations to protect the public from the dangers of \ncryptosporidium and other drinking water hazards.\n  Simply, what my amendment does is exempt pending EPA regulations \nregarding cryptosporidium and related waterborne parasites from the \nstrictures of this bill.\n  Unfortunately, I am all too familiar with the cryptosporidium \nparasite because of the recent outbreak of this waterborne disease in \nmy State of Wisconsin. As many may recall, the water supply in \nMilwaukee was contaminated with this parasite in 1993, and 104 people \ndied. Let me repeat, 104 people died. And more than 400,000 became \nseverely ill as a result of drinking ordinary tap water.\n  As we continue this debate, I urge my colleagues to keep in mind, \nthis bill is not just about how many forms businesses should be \nrequired to fill out, this bill is about peoples' lives.\n  Over the years, we have come to take for granted the safety of our \ndrinking water. We have done much to protect American water consumers \nfrom devastating waterborne disease and death that plagues so many \nother countries in the world. But we have become complacent about the \nsafety of our drinking water--perhaps too complacent.\n  In the aftermath of the Milwaukee cryptosporidium outbreak, EPA, \nwater utility organizations, local government officials, and public \ninterest groups have worked together to agree upon a plan of action. \nAll parties agree that the cryptosporidium problem must be addressed. \nAnd now all parties have agreed on the way to fix this problem. EPA is \nin the process of issuing three regulations to implement this \nagreement, in order to prevent the devastation that crippled Milwaukee \nfrom occurring again. But S. 343 threatens to stop the process dead in \nits tracks. While that may not be the intention, I believe that that \nwill be the outcome.\n  In cooperation with the regulated industry and public interest \ngroups, EPA is moving forward on three regulations:\n  First, the information collection rule, which requires water \nutilities to collect data about the contaminants, like cryptosporidium, \nin their water. Based on the information collected, the next two \nregulations will be finalized.\n  Second, the enhanced surface water treatment rule, which, based on \nthe information collected, will require new treatment and filtration \nmethods to protect against cryptosporidium and related parasites, and\n  Third, the disinfectants/disinfection byproducts rule, which will \npropose standards on certain harmful byproducts that\n are created as a result of using chemical disinfectants to treat \ndrinking water.\n\n  This is not an example of a Federal agency issuing ridiculous \nregulations in a vacuum. Instead, this is an example of the Federal \nGovernment finally addressing a problem that should have been addressed \nlong ago. And it is an example of a cooperative effort with all \ninvolved parties.\n  Given the overwhelming need and support for these regulations, we \nshould not be subjecting these regulations to the time consuming and \nextremely complicated labyrinth of S. 343.\n  I would like to briefly mention just a few of the problems that S. \n343 poses for the pending cryptosporidium protection regulations. \n\n[[Page S 9784]]\n\n  First, S. 343 would stop EPA from gathering information on \ncryptosporidium. One of the first things EPA is doing, even before \nsetting drinking water standards, is to gather information from water \nutilities to gain a better understanding of the problem. This is a \ncommon sense approach. The information gathered will help the agency \nand the water utilities gain a better understanding of the nature of \nthe cryptosporidium problem and other less-known waterborne parasites. \nThe rules cost would make this information collection rule subject to \nthe strictures of the bill. But this creates a catch-22: The whole \npurpose of this rule is to gather information to be able to judge the \ncosts and benefits of creating new standards to protect against \nwaterborne diseases. So it would be impossible to do a cost benefit \nanalysis on the effort to gather data. This makes no sense.\n  A second problem with S. 343 is that it could stop EPA from issuing \nstronger drinking water rules altogether. Without the information \ncollection EPA has proposed, it will be impossible for EPA to conduct a \nfull risk assessment as required under S. 343. Further, S. 343 makes it \nnearly impossible for EPA to specify the technology needed to \nadequately treat water to address cryptosporidium. Instead, the bill \nrequires use of least cost alternatives, and establishment of vague \nperformance goals that make it difficult to protect consumers.\n  It is highly unlikely that these regulations would be covered by the \nemergency exemption in the bill. How could the EPA possibly win a court \nchallenge--and I am certain there would be a court challenge--on \nwhether this rule is responding to an emergency? The information \ncollection rule, which starts the whole process, is to determine the \nextent to which there is an emergency. Certainly for those of us who \nhave watched the human devastation in Milwaukee, there is no question \nthat an emergency exists. And I know that my colleagues from Texas, \nGeorgia, Oregon, Nevada, and other States that have had recent \noutbreaks view this as an emergency, as well. But we still must \ndetermine the extent of the problem nationwide. And that's a time \nconsuming process. Can you imagine the opponents saying, ``Well, if \nyou're planning to spend 18 months collecting information it can't \nreally be an `emergency.' ''\n  One final note on the emergency exemption we have been hearing so \nmuch about. The emergency exemption just delays the cost benefit \nanalysis requirement by 180 days. It does not waive the cost benefit \nanalysis. Having to do a risk benefit analysis mid stream would disrupt \nthe data collection process.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to \nprotect the drinking water rules which are in the works. More than 45 \nmillion Americans use tap water from systems that have been found to \nhave cryptosporidium. Everyone agrees that we have a problem here. And, \neveryone agrees on the solution. My reading of the Dole-Johnston bill \nis that it would certainly delay and even stop this solution. My \namendment would ensure that does not happen.\n  Madam President, S. 343 is intended to streamline the regulatory \nprocess and bring common sense to government. However, there are times \nwhen lack of action on the part of the Federal Government does not make \nsense. If we had stricter water treatment standards in place, maybe the \ntragedy in Milwaukee would not have happened.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of the \namendment proposed by my colleague from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl]. I cannot \nexpress to my colleagues in the Senate the significant urgency with \nwhich regulations on cryptosporidium, other waterborne parasites, and \ndisinfection byproducts, need to move forward. EPA has negotiated a \nseries of regulations with the cooperation of water utilities and \npublic interest groups to require public water systems to test for \ncryptosporidium and other parasites and issued them as a proposed rule \npackage. Using information from these negotiations, the EPA has also \nindicated its intent to prescribe particular treatment and filtration \ntechniques to prevent waterborne disease outbreaks. Mr. President, this \nregulatory reform bill should support, not hinder, the results of \nnegotiated rulemaking. Bringing the potentially regulated community \ntogether with the regulatory agency to discuss in a constructive way \nthe content and scope of governmental requirements in negotiated \nrulemaking is the type of process that helps to ensure our objectives \nin regulatory reform.\n  Lest anyone in this body think that cryptosporidium is either just \nMilwaukee's problem, or an unfortunately vogue parasite brought into \nthe limelight 2 years ago, cryptosporidium has been widely detected in \npublic water systems, including here in Washington, DC, in 1994. In a \nSeptember 30, 1994, Congressional Record statement, I described the \ncontents of a three-part NBC news ``Dateline'' series that ran on \ncryptosporidium. Though the news show time limits prohibited a listing \nof all the cases of concern, the program reported that between 1986 and \n1992, the Centers for Disease Control reported a total of 102 drinking \nwater disease outbreaks linked directly or indirectly to microscopic \nparasites, viruses, and bacterium striking 34,155 people in 35 States.\n  Concerns with cryptosporidium outbreaks continue. On June 15, 1995, \nthe CDC and EPA issued additional guidance for people with weakened \nimmune systems, such as people with HIV and AIDS, cancer and transplant \npatients taking immunosuppressive drugs, and people with genetically \nweakened immune systems, to take extra precautions in consuming \nmunicipal water such as boiling their water or using a cyst-certified \nwater filter to protect against cryptosporidium.\n  Some 400,000 people, of all States of health, became ill in Milwaukee \nand my colleague from Wisconsin and I have seen firsthand the ongoing \nhealth problems and the significant institutional response and \ncoordination challenges that Milwaukee citizens continue to face, in \nthe absence of regulation.\n  I also remain concerned about the health risks posed by disinfection \nbyproducts, rules that were proposed to control the\n amount of disinfectant byproducts allowed in drinking water at the \nsame time that safeguards would be strengthened against disease-causing \nmicroorganisms such as cryptosporidium. According to the fall 1994 EPA \nJournal, chemicals used to disinfect drinking water, such as chlorine, \nform byproducts that can harm human health. For example, chronic \nexposure to excessive amounts of trihalomethanes, a class of \nbyproducts, can cause cancer, liver and kidney damage, heart and \nneurological effects, and effects on fetuses. The proposed rule would \nlower the maximum contaminant level for total trihalomethanes from 100 \nmicrograms per liter to 80 and address 6 other by-products.\n\n  In conclusion, our efforts to reform the regulatory process should \nnot thwart rules that are needed and consensus-based, such as the rules \non cryptosporidium. The citizens of Milwaukee, and indeed the citizens \nof many other major cities, are asking for the Government to respond to \nthis public health concern. I believe exempting these rules from this \nbill is both the responsible public policy course, and the right thing \nto do.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to insert in the Record \nsupporters of the Kohl amendment to exempt microbial and disinfection \nbyproduct rules from S. 343. Those organizations are: American Oceans \nCampaign, Clean Water Action, Environmental Working Group, Friends of \nthe Earth, National Association of People with AIDS, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Sierra Club, and \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. \n\n[[Page S 9785]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, let me congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] for taking the initiative on this \nmatter. His constituents were hard hit in Milwaukee not long ago when \nthey had some of these problems with cryptosporidium. It resulted in \naround 100 deaths and some 400,000 people ill. So he brings this to our \nattention. He certainly has the personal experience of knowing what \nhappened back right where he lives with people he knows.\n  For that reason, I fully support the Senator from Wisconsin on this \namendment to ensure the health and safety of our people. As I stated \nearlier when talking about the E. coli bacteria, this bill, S. 343, \ndoes not, in my opinion, provide that essential balance of regulatory \nrelief and protection of the American people, and there does have to be \nthat kind of a balance.\n  That is why I supported the minority leader's amendment on the USDA \nE. coli meat and poultry inspection rule. And that is why I support \nthis amendment on rules addressing cryptosporidium. The current dangers \nto public health from contaminated drinking water were made clear by \nthe outbreak of cryptosporidium in the water supply of Milwaukee, WI. \nAs I said a moment ago, it resulted in an estimated 100 deaths and over \n400,000 illnesses. I do not know the population of Milwaukee, but that \nmeans just about everybody around that area was sick for a while--\n400,000 people ill, and some ill enough that around 100 died from \nthis--died.\n  So the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin would exempt this \ncritically important rule from the burdensome requirements of this \nbill. I support this amendment in order to show how important rules \nthat are already underway will be delayed and can be stopped by the \nregulatory reform bill before us.\n  I stated earlier the situation with this rule reminds me of the \nregulatory moratorium we had before us not long ago except now we are \ncalling it regulatory reform. Rules that are in the pipeline and will \nbe final soon must still go back to square one all over again. Even \nwith the emergency exemption that the proponents of S. 343 keep \npointing to, this rule would still be subject to all the petition \nprovisions, be subject to all the judicial review opportunities, the \nagency review of rules, and et cetera, all the things that are \nprovided.\n  Also, the emergency exemption in S. 343 does not really exempt \nanything from the bill. It would be only temporary at best. It only \nprovides for a 180-day grace period after issuance of the rule. That \nis, it gives an agency an additional 180 days to comply with the \nrequirements of the bill and that is it.\n  Now, at the end of the 180 days, all of the onerous requirements of \nS. 343 kick in again. No exemption then. Just new opportunities for \nchallenges, uncertainty, and delay.\n  Now, I guess the people who wrote this assume that 180 days was \nenough to do all the investigating that would have to be done. But some \nof these rules and regulations take years and years to finalize. Yet, \nwe are saying, Do this within 180 days or you have to go back and start \nall this all over again. It is just a new opportunity for challenges, \nuncertainty and delay.\n  What will happen to the implementation of the rule when it faces \nthose prospects? Well, regardless of the Senator from Wisconsin's \namendment, the cryptosporidium rule will be caught in the vise of S. \n343 and public health will suffer. The potential delays for this rule \nare very real. So there will be the additional deaths and sicknesses. \nThey will be very real, too. Those sicknesses and deaths will be to \nthose Americans who possibly assume wrongly that their water is safe to \ndrink.\n  This amendment is certainly a step in the right direction to protect \nthe health of the American people. But it certainly is not enough. S. \n343 will catch other important rules, and overall it will make the jobs \nof the agencies to protect health, safety, and the environment much \nmore difficult.\n  S. 343 simply does not fulfill my two principles for regulatory \nreform: regulatory relief and protection for the American people. And I \nrepeat for the umpteenth time on the floor, there has to be a balance \nbetween those two. That is why I, along with Senator Chafee and many \nothers, have introduced S. 1001, which we believe is a balanced \nregulatory reform proposal. It is a tough bill. It is not an easy bill. \nBut our bill would not shut down these important rules that are already \nin the pipeline.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I strongly \nencourage them to take a hard look at our alternative proposal for \nregulatory reform, S. 1001. It makes amendments like this unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I would like to also talk for a moment about problems \nfor control of cryptosporidium with the amendment to exempt prior \nproposed rules, the Johnston amendment, so-called, that we just passed.\n  Now, the amendment we passed, which I voted against, would raise \nseveral problems for control of cryptosporidium, even apart from the \nlikelihood that the continued application of the section 623 petition \nprocess would have the effect of nullifying the exemption.\n  First, the interim enhanced surface water treatment rule [IESWTR] to \naddress waterborne microbial contamination, was proposed on July 29, \n1994. This proposal did not actually contain a specific approach to \ncontrol such contamination, but as an integral part of the negotiated \nagreement with stakeholders, including the drinking water industry, it \nset forth general control options that might be part of a final rule \nand request for other options. This was done because, per the \nagreement, the final rule was to be developed after and based on a \nlarge effort by the industry to gather scientific information on \nmicrobial and related drinking water contaminants. By being made very \ngeneral as controls, as agreed, the proposal would expedite the \nregulatory process after the data collection.\n  Second, given how little of necessity that the proposed IESWTR told \nabout the controls to be required in a final IESWTR, judges may \nconclude it would be irrational to apply the exemption to a proposed \nrule which arguably does not fulfill the normal function of a \nproposal--to describe the initially intended direction of the \nregulatory agency's approach to controls on the particular issue.\n  Now, given the general rule of legal interpretation that the \nlegislative body not be presumed to have intended an irrational result \nand the concern elsewhere in the bill, and in this amendment, that \nnotice in the Johnston amendment--that notice suggests final rules \nshould be substantially similar--substantially similar to proposed \nrules, some judges might find this a basis for deciding that Congress \ncould not have intended any proposal made before April 1, 1995, to \ninclude this proposal.\n  Further, as the word interim suggests, the regulatory negotiation \nleft open the potential that further controls might be needed for \ncryptosporidium, and the IESWTR did not necessarily represent the full \nregulatory response appropriate for cryptosporidium. The concept for \nthe interim rule to be promulgated as quickly as reasonably possible \nafter the information collection was completed shows the intent of the \nreg neg to put in place--regulatory negotiation--to put in place \nwhatever controls were quickly attainable but still solidly science \nbased.\n  Thereafter, if implementation of the interim-enhanced surface water \ntreatment rule left a substantial remaining risk to health from \ncryptosporidium, that risk could be addressed in an enhanced surface \nwater treatment rule. Therefore, even if the proposed IESWTR did prove \nto be exempted under this amendment, any later enhanced surface water \ntreatment rule clearly would not be exempted. I bring that up because \nit does apply to cryptosporidium and specifically with regard to the \nJohnston amendment that we passed just a short time ago.\n  So once again I urge my colleagues to support the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin. He points out the dangers because \nthere were dangers in his State that resulted in around 100 people \ndying and some \n\n[[Page S 9786]]\n400,000 ill. I think knowing that the danger, knowing that that is what \nhas already occurred, to say that we should take any chance at all or \nmake any requirement for going back and doing new analysis, new risk \nassessment, we know the risk is there. Doing new cost-benefit ratios, \ndoing new everything when we know what the danger is, I think would be \na mistake.\n  So I fully support the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, and I \nwould urge my colleagues to support this amendment when we have a vote \nhere in a half hour or so. And I hope that it will pass because it is \nsomething that is needed to protect the health and safety of this \ncountry so we do not have more outbreaks such as the disastrous one \nthat happened in Milwaukee.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to thank very much my colleague from Ohio for \nthe kind words he said about this amendment and, of course, for the \narguments most importantly that he has presented in support of this \namendment.\n  In the aftermath of the Milwaukee incident, Mr. President, EPA \nnegotiated a package of regulations to protect citizens against future \noutbreaks. All interested parties participated in this regulatory \nnegotiation, people like water utilities, local officials, public \ninterest groups, and others. And now all parties have agreed to these \nregulations. They feel strongly about moving ahead as quickly as \npossible.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the very broad \nlist of groups that have participated in the very cooperative, \ncommonsense regulatory process.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   Regulatory Negotiation Committee, Disinfectants and Disinfection \n                    byproducts rule, membership list\n\n       Scott Bernstein, Center for Neighborhood Technology, \n     Chicago, IL; David Bailey, Environmental Defense Fund, \n     Washington, DC; James R.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, here we go again. This is a very similar \namendment my dear colleague from Wisconsin has brought up. It is quite \nsimilar to what we have been debating for the last 2 days.\n  Yesterday the adoption of Senator Dole's amendment makes crystal \nclear that S. 343 contains several provisions that deal with health and \nsafety emergencies.\n  Any rule, including any proposed EPA rule dealing with \ncryptosporidium, is not delayed by the Dole-Johnston bill. The bill \nwaives the requirement for notice and comment procedures when \nemergencies occur. I do not know how much more clear we can make it \nthan we have made it in this bill.\n  The bill waives the cost-benefit requirements when emergencies occur. \nThe bill waives the risk assessment requirements when emergencies \noccur. Simply put, S. 343 will not--let me just emphasize that, will \nnot--in any way delay the promulgation of a rule when health and safety \nemergencies require quick public action.\n  I understand my colleague from Wisconsin--and I know he is very \nsincere and he is literally trying to solve a problem that he thinks \ndoes exist, but we have solved that problem in the prior language that \nhas been put in this bill.\n  In any event, rules to protect against cryptosporidium microbes are \nalready in place. The public safety is protected today. As we stand on \nthe Senate floor, the public safety is protected.\n  When EPA enforces a rule, it does so through an adjudicatory order, \nnot a rule. This is important. When an inspector or EPA official shuts \ndown a water processing plant or water reservoir by an order, they do \nso by an order, not a rule. Such orders, which are not rulemakings, are \nexplicitly exempt from S. 343--explicitly exempt from S. 343.\n  So nothing will stop the EPA from issuing an order, not a rule, but \nan order shutting down a water plant or a water processing plant if \nthey find that plant and that water not to be safe.\n  As to the petition process, it is true that a proposed rule, such as \nthe cryptosporidium proposed rule, may be subject to S. 343's petition \nprocess. But this is a good thing.\n  Why is it a good thing? Years from now when perhaps new science \nrequires a new standard, why should we not put into this bill--which we \nhave--a provision that a petition should be granted to require an \nagency to look at the latest scientific data? That is what is involved \nhere. We just want all decisions in the future to be made on the best \navailable science so that the decisions will be right.\n  More important, we put protections in this bill to make sure that the \nrulemaking by the regulatory agencies is done in the highest form and \nin the best sense. If a rule becomes burdensome, why should not the \nrule be reviewed? If we find that there is a scientific change that \nmerits reviewing the rule, why should we not use the best science to do \nso? That is what this bill does. It is a commonsense bill. It is pure \nand simple common sense.\n  The Dole-Johnston bill protects health and safety. The Dole-Johnston \nbill does not delay the promulgation of emergency rules or even apply \nat all to orders that enforce agency health and safety rules. And that \nis something that has not been brought out in our debates up to now, \nthat orders are not covered. Orders can be issued by these agencies \nand, frankly, emergency rules can be obtained where an emergency \nexists. The bill is explicit on it. The bill makes it clear. The bill \nprotects the American public, and the bill requires that the best \nscience be used through the years in these areas.\n  So there is no need for this amendment and, frankly, it is the same \nissue as we had with regard to the E. coli issue. We have solved that \nproblem. We have an emergency provision in this bill that will allow \ntrue emergencies to be taken care of without worrying about risk \nassessment or cost-benefit analysis until afterwards. And in this \nparticular case, the EPA can issue an order to correct it, if there was \na cryptosporidium problem, without any consideration at all and would \naccomplish exactly what the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin would \nlike to accomplish.\n  So I hope my colleagues will recognize this and realize that we have \nto get serious about passing a bill that \n\n[[Page S 9787]]\nliterally makes a lot of sense, makes common sense, invokes the best \nscience available, not only today but as science develops into the \nfuture and, basically, does everything that we really need to have done \nto force the bureaucracy to be more responsible with regard to the \nissuance of rules.\n  That is why this bill is so important, because we can get rid of a \nlot of the irresponsibility of the bureaucracies in this society, \nbureaucracies that are eating us all alive and many times without \njustification, while at the same time upholding rules that are truly \ndrafted, that work, that make sense, that are in the best interest of \nhealth and safety and meet the highest scientific standards necessary \nto protect the American public.\n  So I hope, as much as I respect my colleague from Wisconsin--and I \ndo, and we work together on the Judiciary Committee--I believe that \nthis amendment is not needed. I know it is not needed. The bill covers \nthese problems, and I hope our colleagues will be willing to vote it \ndown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to make it clear that I believe \nthis is an emergency, and I would like to think my colleague from Utah \nagrees we have an emergency situation here. But we also have to \nunderstand this is not a situation where there can, under any \ncircumstances, be quick action. This is not a situation where there can \nbe an immediate order. We understand in order to gather the information \nnecessary to promulgate the rules and regulations some amount of time \nnecessarily, if unhappily, but necessarily will take place, and that is \nwhy, first, we have to understand we have to gather information.\n  So I say to my colleague from Utah that if he believes that this \nsituation is covered in the bill, then let us just make it clear. There \nis no sense getting involved in belaboring the point. Again, if, as my \ncolleague from Utah says, this matter is already addressed in the \nbill--I do not believe it is--but if he believes that it is addressed \nin the bill, then there should be no harm in reiterating this point. \nWhat I am saying is, let us not leave it later on to lawyers to dispute \nand to decide, to argue whether or not the bill covers this particular \ncryptosporidium problem.\n  Let us simply make it clear with this amendment that it does insert \nit into the bill in any way in which my colleague from Utah wishes to \ndo that, because I think I hear him saying that there is a problem with \ncryptosporidium that needs to be addressed. I think he has said that \nvery clearly. He is saying that the bill addresses it.\n  What we are saying--and what many people would say--is that the bill \ndoes not address it. So I do not think it is too much to ask of my \ncolleague from Utah to understand that people are terribly concerned \nthat S. 343 will not derail the cryptosporidium problem and that we are \nasking for his assurance in the bill that the cryptosporidium problem \nwill not be put off the tracks because of the way in which the bill is \nwritten and because of the way in which lawyers then will be able to \nbring all kinds of arguments against taking action on cryptosporidium.\n  So I think that is a reasonable request insofar as our colleague \nagrees that the cryptosporidium problem needs to be addressed and \nshould not be set aside by S. 343.\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe the cryptosporidium problem is being addressed \nhere and under current law. We even make it stronger under this bill. \nBut the important thing is that we do not think anything should be \nexempted from this bill, because this bill, by not exempting these \nmatters, requires that the best available science, as it evolves into \nthe future, be applied to these types of issues.\n  If we exempt cryptosporidium, make an exception for it--as the \nminority leader wanted to do with the last amendment on the E. coli and \nmeat and poultry inspection problems--then we are not guaranteeing that \nwe will apply the best and finest science into the future. We provide \nfor emergency relief here. We do provide that orders are not to be \ninterfered with. So there is plenty of power in the law right now to \nresolve this problem. This bill will help to do it anyway. The \nemergency provisions, I think, are more than adequate and, I think, \ncrystal clear.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will ask a question of my friend from \nUtah, or a generic question. It seems to me that what is happening here \non the last amendment and this amendment is that we are allowing \nourselves to be captives of a rule that we are setting out that makes \nno sense. This generalized notion, when one states it, that there \nshould be no exemption sounds like a rule of equity. There should be no \nexemption. But when cryptosporidium--not a thing you take home in your \nlunch pail to feed to your children, not a thing that anyone can find \nany rational basis for thinking it could be beneficial in the food or \nwater chain anywhere along the line. To suggest that you cannot take \nsomething that is of nothing but destructive capacity when ingested by \nhuman beings and explicitly exempt it from this process that is being \nput in place, seems to me to make one a victim of your own rule--a rule \nthat is of no value in and of itself.\n  This generalized notion that everything is on the table, everything \nhas to be considered, is a little bit like saying that when we do the \nFederal budget, everything is on the table, including whether or not we \nhave an army, or everything is on the table, including whether or not \nwe continue to have a Constitution. There are certain things that are \nnot on the table, and there is no value in anything other than keeping \nthem off the table. Other things that are of such clear, damaging \nconsequences to the public at large should be taken out of the general \nrule we have here, and we should say flatout, no, flatout cannot--\ncannot. There is no tolerance level for certain things.\n  I think we are getting caught up, and we are acting like lawyers. I \nam a lawyer, and I do not accuse my friend from Wisconsin of being a \nlawyer. I know he is not. Everybody always says, ``Do not call me a \nlawyer.'' Many of us here are lawyers, and we are sounding like \nlawyers. We are setting up rules. It is almost a tautology that we are \nconstructing here. We are penalizing ourselves by making ourselves \nsubscribe to a generalized proposition that makes no sense.\n  And so I compliment my friend from Wisconsin in insisting that this \nchange take place. And I think, to put it on the other side of the \ncoin, what the Senator from Utah is saying--what damage is done to this \nlegislation by doing what the Senator from Wisconsin wants? If we are \ngoing to err, does it not make sense to err on the side of seeing to it \nthat there is not a repeat of the situation that occurred in the \nSenator's State? Does it not make sense to err on that side? What \ndamage are we doing to a specific industry, a specific economic \ninterest, a specific company by doing what the Senator wants? And even \nif we were, so what?\n  I find this to be getting to be a very tortured discussion. So I hope \nour colleagues--and I know the last thing in the world my colleague \nfrom Utah would want to happen would be to change the law in such a way \nthat we increase the possibility of what the Senator from Wisconsin is \ntrying to prevent from happening again. This bill requires the agency \nto conduct all of the analysis required by this bill within 180 days, \neven if there is an emergency.\n  I thought an emergency meant an emergency. I do not think the \nAmerican people think that when they talk about emergency, they are \ntalking about 180 days. Is that an emergency? How many people could we \nlose in 180 days? How much damage can be done? That is 6 months. We are \nnot talking about an emergency where somebody says, I found this out \ntoday and tomorrow it stops. That is, I think, an unrealistic timeframe \nfor conducting risk assessment and peer review and cost-benefit \nanalysis, all of which is required.\n  Assuming those requirements can be met, the bill then allows \nregulated parties to come in and challenge whether the benefits justify \nthe cause, or that the agency adopt the cheapest regulatory \nalternative, or whether any analysis that is conducted has been done \nproperly, or any number of other \n\n[[Page S 9788]]\nissues that can be litigated under this bill. The rule could be tied up \nin litigation. The parties could seek injunctions to prevent it from \ngoing into effect, based on the cumbersome requirements of the bill. \nAnd once the rule went into effect, industry could also petition to \nseek a repeal of the rule, or seek interpretation of the rule, or seek \na waiver or an alternative method of compliance. If denied, they could \nthen litigate these issues again in court.\n  This bill already recognizes that some types of rules should be \nexempted from the requirements. For example, the bill already exempts \nrules affecting the banking industry--deposit insurance funds, the farm \ncredit insurance fund. It exempts rules relating to financial \nresponsibility of brokers, dealers of futures, commission merchants, \nand safeguarding investor security. It exempts anything relating to the \nintroduction of a product into the market. Some of these exemptions \ncould well be sensible on precautions, given the complex, cumbersome, \nexpensive process required by this legislation. But certainly a rule \naffecting, in this case, cryptosporidium, or in the case of the last \namendment, meat inspection and safety, is at least as important as to \nwhether or not those exemptions which I just mentioned, including the \nbanking industry and financial transactions, should be exempt.\n  So we do have in this legislation, in essence, what the Senator from \nWisconsin is seeking.\n  But guess what it is for? It is not for public health and safety. It \nis for what my Republican friends seem most concerned about, and they \nshould be concerned, I agree with their concern. But it seems they are \nconcerned about property. Property. Not people--property.\n  Banking industry, deposit insurance, farm credit insurance. We exempt \nthat, why not exempt things that kill people? I am not arguing we \nshould not exempt what they exempted.\n  What I do not understand is the generalized statement made that \neverything is on the table. It is not all on the table. The rules \naffecting banking are not on the table the same way as the rest. \nDeposit insurance funds are not on the table the same as everything \nelse.\n  It is kind of funny. It reminds me--I have been here a long time. I \nremember when there was a move for the neutron bomb back in the 1970's \nwhen Carter was President. The virtue of the neutron bomb was that it \nkilled only people and does not destroy property. That was a really \ngreat benefit of the neutron bomb.\n  We are going to make it very, very difficult under the version my \nRepublican friends are offering, to be able to protect the public on \nmatters relating to things like cryptosporidium or E. coli and many \nother things, but not difficult to protect the public interest when it \ncomes to Federal deposit insurance.\n  Now, I think we should do what we have done as it relates to these \neconomic interests, but what I do not understand is why is the thing \nthe Senator is talking about, which literally, if not handled well, \ncauses death, human life is lost, why is it not treated the same way?\n  I suggest to my friend from Wisconsin, keep at it. Do not buy on--\nwhich I know he does not--to the argument that everything is on the \ntable. Everything is not on the table. Everything is not being treated \nthe same way. Things affecting public health and safety are put in one \ncategory because business has interest in those things. Things that \naffect business in terms of potentially being exposed financially are \nexempted from this cumbersome process.\n  Do not let them kid you, Senator. These folks understand what they \nare doing. They understand what they are doing. They are making it \neasier to make a mistake when it comes to public health and safety and \nmaking it, as they should, difficult to make a regulatory mistake when \nit comes to financial transactions.\n  I do not think that is what the American people want. I think if you \ngave them a choice, would they take a risk on a Federal bureaucrat \noverstepping his or her bounds when it came to clean water, or take a \nrisk at overstepping their bounds when it came to financial \ninstitutions, what do you think they would pick? I think they would \nsay, ``I would run the risk of having an overzealous person take care \nof my water, an overzealous person taking care of my meat, an \noverzealous person taking care of the air I breathe.''\n  I know the Senator from Wisconsin. We have worked together too long. \nIf anybody abhors bureaucracy, it is the man from Wisconsin. The \nSenator is the most no-nonsense businessman I have ever come across.\n  That is why the Senator has been such a successful businessman as \nwell as such as successful Senator. The Senator is one of the few \npeople on the floor of this Senate who knows how cumbersome bureaucracy \ncan be, who is frustrated by it as a businessman, and worked his way \nthrough it to become an incredibly successful businessman, is on the \nfloor here saying, hey, wait a minute, we are going too far here.\n  I hope the public understands what this is about because it is so \ncomplicated. We can get so caught up in this. What does peer review \nmean? What does it mean when we are talking about all of these various \naspects of the bill?\n  It comes down to simple things. From my standpoint, when it comes to \ncryptosporidium, which I can hardly pronounce but I know full well what \nthe consequences of its ingestion, I am not as worried about some \nfeckless bureaucrat out there exercising unreasonable power. I do not \nlike bureaucrats exercising unreasonable power. But I want to say this \nis the place I least worry about it, least worry about it.\n  Let me say, I would rather have some obnoxious bureaucrat making sure \nthere is no E. coli in the hamburger my kid eats at McDonald's than I \nwould worry about a bureaucrat overstepping their bounds in terms of \ntelling banks what they can and cannot do.\n  Is it not funny how this debate goes when it comes to money, when it \ncomes to dollars? We do not want to fool around too much. When it comes \nto human life, when it comes to public health and public safety, well, \nthen, we know how the bureaucrats are.\n  This is not a defense of bureaucrats. I am a cosponsor of the Glenn \nbill. I want to remind everyone when the Glenn bill came out in another \nform--same substance but under another title several months ago--the \nenvironmentalists were against it.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Delaware are not up \nhere being purists. We realize that bureaucracy gets in the way of \nbusiness. We realize bureaucracy increases costs unnecessarily for \nconsumers. We realize that Washington does not know all the answers, \nhave all the answers.\n  That is what the Glenn bill does. But this goes too far. It goes too \nfar. As I said, I think I will go back to my home State, I will not \nspeak for the Senator's State or any other State in the Nation, even \npresumptuous for me to speak of my own State, although I think I \nunderstand it as well as anyone.\n  I have listened as hard as anyone over the last 25 years I have been \nin office. I make a bet. Ask them whether or not they are worried about \nwhether or not someone is being overzealous and protecting their water, \nsomeone is being overzealous and protecting contaminants in the meat, \nor feces in the meat that they ingest, and whether that is something \nthey really think the Senate should be worried about right now, and my \nguess is they are going to say ``You know, Senator, I don't think you \nare doing enough to make sure my water is clean. I don't think you are \ndoing enough to make sure that the meat, the fish and the poultry I \ningest lacks contaminants. I don't think you are doing enough to make \nsure that the environment and the air I breathe and the water I swim in \nand the beaches I bathe on are clean.''\n  ``I do think you are right, Senator, that worrying about pink \nflamingos and spotted owls and endangered species can be taken to a \nridiculous extreme. Senator, when it comes to the water my kid drinks, \nwhen it comes to the hamburger my kid eats, when it comes to the beach \nmy kid swims on, I do not think you are doing enough.''\n  Is that not the essence of what this debate is about? Which side can \nwe err on? I think the Senator from Wisconsin is erring on the right \nside. I would suggest that this notion that everything is on the table, \ntreated the same way, is not accurate. \n\n[[Page S 9789]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Delaware. I could not agree more \nwith his comments. He is talking very clearly about the things that \naffect human health and safety, the things that the American people \nhave repeatedly insisted that they care about, are concerned about, and \ndo not want to see any mistakes made concerning their human health and \nsafety.\n  What happened in Milwaukee, which has happened to a lesser extent in \nother communities, but what happened in Milwaukee, we lost 104 people \nbecause the water developed a parasite that was not protected.\n  What the EPA now is doing, I want to say again, the EPA is now in the \nprocess, along with water utilities and other concerned interest \ngroups, without anybody disputing the process that is unfolding, the \nEPA is in the process of collecting information which will result, \nfinally, in setting up rules and regulations regarding the treatment of \ndrinking water.\n  Now, I would challenge any Senator, the Senator from Utah or any \nother Senator, to come to Milwaukee and tell the people that in this \nregulatory reform bill the Milwaukee situation and the EPA process \nwhich is now unfolding is or is not absolutely protected.\n  I think if we would have to tell them that we think it is protected \nbut we cannot absolutely guarantee that the process that is unfolding \nis protective, I do not think that any public official could stand up \nin Milwaukee and make the case and satisfy people in Milwaukee that he \nor she was doing his job.\n  We had the outbreak. We lost 104 people. And 400,000 people got sick. \nThere is a process of unfolding to see it does not happen again,\n not only in Milwaukee but all across the country. What we are simply \nasking is that this process be guaranteed to unfold, and that there not \nbe any chance that S. 343 could impede that happening. It seems to me, \nI suggest to my colleague from Utah, that is a reasonable request to \nmake, and a reasonable assurance to ask for, as we move ahead with S. \n343.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have reached a point where I really \nappreciate my colleague. I know they have had a particular problem. I \nknow he is trying to solve it, as he always does. He is a sincere, \ndedicated Senator, and I appreciate it personally. And he is a friend.\n  But the point that I am making is that in this bill it is crystal \nclear that the regulators have every right to treat any cryptosporidium \nsituation as an emergency and to pass the necessary rule or obtain the \nnecessary orders to stop it. There is no reason to add anything else to \nthis bill with regard to cryptosporidium.\n  The real point here is that there is nothing in the Dole-Johnston \nbill that delays, harms, impedes or hinders the promulgation of rules \nthat protect health and safety of the American people--nothing. In \nfact, there is everything in this bill that would lead one to--and the \nbureaucracy--to meet the highest scientific standards of the time, not \njust of today, but as we go into the future.\n  These are some of the real reasons why this bill is so important and \nwhy we cannot exempt anything from the coverage of this bill that might \nbe subject to regulation. The reason is because the bill's main \nemphasis is on using the highest form of science in order to resolve \nthis. When you exempt something, you do not have to do that.\n  We have been putting up with really almost 40 years, now, since 1958, \nwith the Delaney clause. The Delaney clause was enacted at a time when \nwe only could determine scientifically parts per thousand--parts per \nmillion at the very most--in 1958. Today, because of the scientific \nadvancements that we have had, and because of the scientific \nattainments that we have attained over these last 40 years, we can now \nascertain through science parts per quintillion.\n  What that means is, parts per quintillion is like having a \nteaspoonful of water as part of all of the Great Lakes system. Yet we \nhave this stupid, idiotic Delaney clause that requires zero risk with \nregards to anything that might be carcinogenic. And we have \ngrandfathered foods that are carcinogenic because they have long been \nused, and we have barred foods that are not, where there is just a \nnegligible risk, or no risk, really, of getting cancer from eating \nthese foods. The fact of the matter is, that is what is wrong when you \ntry to exempt something from what really are good, scientifically based \nlegislative bits of language.\n  This bill will take care of cryptosporidium. The current law will, \nbut this bill even does more. Because nobody is going to have any delay \nin any emergency where the bureaucracy would act anyway. Because they \nwould not have to go through a risk assessment or a cost-benefit \nanalysis in an emergency, pre-issuing the rule or order or whatever it \nmay be. They would have to do the cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment afterwards. But they could act immediately on any emergency \nsituation. Any cryptosporidium problem would be resolved.\n  But more important, because we will not exempt cryptosporidium, the \nbest possible science will be applied through the upcoming years; \nunlike the Delaney clause, where the worst possible science generally \nis applied, and where we, like I say, we do not know where we are. And \nwhere the rule is used to keep out substances and foods that really \nhave no carcinogenic effect, where there is very negligible or very \nminimal--de minimis risk of harm to any human being--where we keep \nthose off the marketplace. We have seen that time after time.\n  What we want to do, and what we are trying to do in this bill, is \nhave the very best science we possibly can. We like the rule of common \nsense. We have no doubt that, if there is a threat to health and safety \nof the American population, and it becomes an emergency, that our \nregulators will immediately attack those problems. But they will attack \nthem by having thought through this bill, and it is requisite that they \ndo it in the right way and that they do it in a non-onerous way. They \nwill not have to go through a risk assessment or a cost-benefit \nanalysis before they act, in the case of true emergencies. Anybody who \ndoes not understand that does not understand the bill. There is \nabsolutely no reason, absolutely no reason for us to make exemptions \nfor, really, anything of this nature in the bill.\n  By the way, Senator Kohl has mentioned that EPA has negotiated an \ninformation-gathering rule dealing with cryptosporidium data, scheduled \nto be released next December. The argument just made that S. 343 will \ndelay or impede the information-gathering rule is simply not true. The \ninformation-gathering rule is not covered by the cost-benefit and risk \nrequirement provisions of the bill, of this bill. Research is not \ncovered by the bill's requirements. So that needs to be made clear.\n  Just to make the point one more time, we do not want to exempt \nanything from this bill because we have confidence that our regulators \nare going to go after anything that threatens the health or safety of \nAmerican citizens. I have no doubt about that. I do not think anybody \nelse does either. We have provided specific language in this bill that, \nif there is a true emergency, they do not have to go through any delay \nat all. They can handle that emergency immediately. And we also provide \nin this bill, once the emergency is handled, that well into the future \nthe very finest science is going to have to be applied in these \ninstances.\n  Frankly, to go beyond that and to exempt something where we might \nwind up with another Delaney clause--I admit, people could say that is \na stretch, but it is not. We do that all the time in this country. I \nthink it is a real mistake. If you really want to solve the problem of \ncryptosporidium, then do it with the bill's language, where we provide \nfor emergency relief by those who are concerned about these type of \nproblems as they arise. And since cryptosporidium is something that \neverybody is concerned about, I cannot imagine any bureaucrat not being \nwilling to solve the health and safety aspects of that particular \nproblem.\n  We are prepared to go to a vote. I am prepared to move to table.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold the tabling \nmotion, I would like to make several brief comments.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to withhold. I would like to move on. \n\n[[Page S 9790]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will try to decode this in what I \nunderstand to be, to use the phrase we all use here, basic old common \nsense.\n  What the Senator from Wisconsin is saying is: Hey, look, if a \nbureaucrat oversteps his bounds and comes up with some preposterous \nruling relating to pesticides or parasites in the water, and says that \none--I did not even know the figure the Senator used, but one \nteaspoon--whatever the measurement was that would equal one teaspoon \nrelative to the entire Great Lakes--and says you cannot put that in the \nwater, that amount,\n if this is that ridiculous, there is emergency relief for the company \nwhich is doing that. It is called the Congress. That is the emergency \nrelief. Come to Congress and say, ``That stupid bureaucrat just passed \nthis rule saying you cannot have more than 1 part per hundred trillion \nof such and such in the water. We can pass a law. We can say no. It can \nbe 5 million parts per trillion.'' That is the emergency relief I think \nwe should have. But what is the emergency relief that he is suggesting \nfor us, if in fact what is being done to the water system is damaging? \nIt is this cumbersome procedure even under an emergency which is \ndeclared that takes months to occur.\n\n  So I think common sense dictates to me if a manufacturer--that is \nwhat we are talking about, a business, an economic interest--is in fact \ndamaged because some silly bureaucrat comes up with a rule that makes \nit impossible for them to conduct business and does no harm to the \nwater system, there is recourse, emergency recourse--the U.S. Congress.\n  What is the emergency recourse for the constituent in Wisconsin if in \nfact a pesticide is being put in the water that is causing serious \ndamage? It takes time under this rule. The Senator says nothing is \nexempt. First of all, anything, any rule that does not affect $100 \nmillion worth of something is exempt from this process, this cost-\nbenefit analysis, this risk assessment laid out in this thick piece of \nlegislation in both the Glenn bill and the Hatch bill we are talking \nabout. So that is one exemption.\n  There is a second exemption, a series of exemptions. If you turn to \npage 16 of the text of the bill, it says it does ``not include''--\nmeaning that the cost-benefit analysis is not required for the \nfollowing things: A rule that involves the internal revenue laws of the \nUnited States.\n  So what it says here is even if the IRS comes up with a stupid rule \nwhere a cost far outweighs the benefits, it is not reviewable under \nthis law. Even if the rule of an agency that impedes an international \ntrade agreement, and if in the implementation of it the cost far \noutweighs the benefit, it is not subject to this legislation. The list \ngoes on. Just pick another one.\n  A rule or agency action that authorizes the introduction into \ncommerce or recognizes a marketable status of a product. You would have \nthe most damaging darned product in the world where the cost would far \noutweigh the benefit, and it is not reviewable.\n  So this idea that there is something sacrosanct here about not \nexempting anything, what the Senator is asking for is this incredible \nexception where his amendment would be the only thing out there. There \nare a raft of actions that mindless bureaucrats can take that are not \nsubject to the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment required in \nthis bill.\n  Why? Why? Why should we somehow now impose a rule of legerdemain here \nin the Senate saying, ``Senator, what you are asking for is an \nexemption. You are asking for something to be treated differently than \nthe rest of the bill. And we just cannot do that. It will open up the \nfloodgates here.'' No one said that. But that is implicit.\n  I would say to the Senator there are lot of things that are not \nsubject to a cost-benefit analysis that mindless bureaucrats can \nundertake. I might add I do not think most bureaucrats are mindless. \nBut let us pick that mindless bureaucrat.\n  In law school we always talked about a ``reasonable man.'' No one \ncould always find a reasonable man. But we always talked about the \nreasonable man. We have the mindless bureaucrat wandering the halls of \nCongress and the floor of this body. He or she is the person we are all \nafter. Well, if we find that mindless bureaucrat and he or she is \nmindlessly engaged in regulations relating to the Internal Revenue \nCode, we say, ``You may continue to be mindless. This does not apply to \nyou.'' If they are talking mindlessly interfering with a rule, \ninterfering with the introduction of a product into commerce, you say, \n``You can continue to be mindless.''\n  The list goes on for two pages:\n       ``(iv) a rule exempt from notice and public procedure under \n     section 553(a);\n       ``(v) a rule or agency action relating to the public debt;\n       ``(vi) a rule required to be promulgated at least annually \n     pursuant to statute, or that provides relief, in whole or in \n     part, from a statutory prohibition, other than a rule \n     promulgated pursuant to subtitle C of title II of the Solid \n     Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.);\n       ``(vii) a rule of particular applicability that approves or \n     prescribes the future rates, wages, prices, services, \n     corporate or financial structures, reorganizations, mergers, \n     acquisitions, accounting practices, or disclosures bearing on \n     any of the foregoing;\n       ``(viii) a rule relating to monetary policy or to the \n     safety or soundness of federally insured depository \n     institutions or any affiliate of such an institution. . . .''\n\n  It goes on and on:\n\n       ``(xi) a rule or order relating to the financial \n     responsibility of brokers and dealers or futures commission \n     merchants, the safeguarding of investor securities and funds \n     or commodity future or options customer securities and funds, \n     the clearance and settlement of securities, futures, or \n     options transactions, or the suspension of trading under the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n       ``(xii) a rule that involves the international trade laws \n     of the United States.''\n\n  They are all exceptions. There is not a cost-benefit analysis \nrequired for those; no requirement to do anything like any of this \nlegislation we are about to pass. We can do that. Why cannot we do it \nfor cryptosporidium or E. coli? What is the problem? Because there is \nemergency relief for an aggrieved party, if a mindless bureaucrat sets \nout a rule that has no relationship to science, and it is called the \nCongress. It can change the law. The bureaucrats can only make laws we \nauthorize them to make.\n  Why provide this kind of hurdle for an agency attempting to protect \nthe water supply of the Nation? Why provide this hurdle to catch the \noccasional overzealous bureaucrat overreaching and damaging the \nproperty owner, or damaging a business interest? Why not provide it \nwith the 535 Members of the Congress?\n  If there is one side I would err on, I would err on the side of the \nCongress. But there are already significant portions of our commerce in \nthis Nation that are legitimately and reasonably exempted from any \ncost-benefit analysis including any rule that does not have the impact \nof $100 million.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will take a minute to summarize again what \nmy amendment is all about.\n  We have a problem of cryptosporidium in this country. We had an \noutbreak in Milwaukee, and we lost 104 people, leaving 400,000 people \nseriously ill. We had outbreaks in a dozen other communities in the \ncountry. I will not enumerate all of those communities. But San \nAntonio, Jackson County, OR, Las Vegas, and we had something here in \nWashington, DC, recently. There is no question about the need to \npromulgate rules and regulations.\n  As I said, the involved water utilities--and other interest groups--\nall of them have agreed that we must set in motion the process we have \nto collect information and then promulgate rules to protect our water \nsupply in this country from another outbreak of cryptosporidium.\n No disagreement. And that process is now under way.\n\n  Now, people who have looked at S. 343, lawyers and other people--I am \nnot a lawyer--have assured me that there is a real danger that under S. \n343 as it is written the EPA process that is underway will be \nsidetracked, may very well be sidetracked. Some believe that it will. \nSome believe that it may be.\n  What we are asking for in S. 343 is assurance that the process now \nunderway and agreed to by EPA and water utilities and other interest \ngroups will not be sidetracked. That is all this amendment says. Let us \nsee to it that the process is not sidetracked.\n  So I ask my colleagues to consider that simple consideration when \nthey \n\n[[Page S 9791]]\ndecide how to vote on whether or not to table this amendment which, as \nI understand, is going to be asked for by the opposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there other debate on the Kohl amendment? \nIf not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  All those in favor of the amendment--the Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 303 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n       \n  So the motion to table the amendment (No. 1506) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I am going to ask consent that the Senator from Delaware be \nrecognized next to offer an amendment concerning risk-based priorities; \nthat there be 30 minutes for debate to be equally divided in the usual \nform; that any second-degree amendment be limited to 15 minutes to be \nequally divided and must be relevant to the first-degree. I do not know \nif any second-degree amendments are going to come from that side or \nnot. Since it will not come from this side, maybe it will not be \nnecessary that they be seen ahead of time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I know the \nmajority leader wants to speed this along, and I agree with that. We \nhave been moving along pretty well. But I think without knowing what \namendments might even be put forward and how serious they might be, I \nwould not want to agree on time limits unless we had the amendments in \nadvance and could look at them and decide how important they are. I \nwill have to object.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, the amendment of the Senator from Delaware \nis available.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask the distinguished Senator from Ohio whether it might \nnot be possible on my amendment, which has been cosponsored by Senator \nBiden, that we might not reach a time agreement on that.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thought the unanimous consent request was on all the--\n  Mr. DOLE. Thirty minutes on the Roth amendment equally divided and \nthen any second-degree amendment 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Can we agree there will be no second-degree amendments on \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. GLENN. On this particular amendment, I probably would accept the \namendment. I think there would be objection on our side to accepting \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, we want to accommodate the Senator from \nDelaware. The problem is it takes the National Academy of Sciences out \nof the picture at least in part, and it is highly controversial, as I \nunderstand it, with the National Academy of Sciences. I confess, I have \nbeen working on these other amendments and have not had the time. It is \nnot one of the most important issues, and we do want to try to work \nwith the Senator from Delaware. I wish we had a little time to try to \nfocus on it, because we want to try to find a way to accommodate.\n  Mr. ROTH. We will just lay it down tonight.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That would be good.\n  Mr. GLENN. We can lay it down tonight and discuss the time limit \ntomorrow. I would not want to agree to a time limit tonight.\n  Mr. DOLE. I understand. The Senator from Ohio is not prepared to \nconsent to any agreement. I do not quarrel with that. The amendment \nwill be laid down tonight, and then maybe tomorrow we can work out a \ntime agreement.\n  There will be no more votes this evening, unless someone wants to \nhave another vote; no more votes.\n  Tomorrow morning, there will be, as I understand it, a meeting with \nSenator Kerry, Senator Levin, Senator Johnston, Senator Glenn, Senator \nHatch, Senator Roth and others.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1507 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n(Purpose: To strengthen the agency prioritization and comparative risk \n                      analysis section of S. 343)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself and Mr. \n     Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 1507 to Amendment No. \n     1487.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Delete all of section 635 (page 61, line 1 through page 64, \n     line 14 and add in its place the following new section 635:\n\n     SEC. 635. RISK-BASED PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (1) encourage Federal agencies engaged in regulating risks \n     to human health, safety, and the environment to achieve the \n     greatest risk reduction at the least cost practical;\n       (2) promote the coordination of policies and programs to \n     reduce risks to human health, safety, and the environment; \n     and\n       (3) promote open communication among Federal agencies, the \n     public, the President, and Congress regarding environmental, \n     health, and safety risks, and the prevention and management \n     of those risks.\n       (b) Definitions.--For the purpose of this section:\n       (1) Comparative risk analysis.--The term ``comparative risk \n     analysis'' means a process to systematically estimate, \n     compare, and rank the size and severity of risks to provide a \n     common basis for evaluating strategies for reducing or \n     preventing those risks.\n       (2) Covered agency.--The term ``covered agency'' means each \n     of the following:\n       (A) The Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (B) The Department of Labor.\n       (C) The Department of Transportation.\n       (D) The Food and Drug Administration.\n       (E) The Department of Energy.\n       (F) The Department of the Interior.\n       (G) The Department of Agriculture.\n       (H) The Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n       (I) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n       (J) The United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n[[Page S 9792]]\n\n       (K) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n       (3) Effect.--The term ``effect'' means a deleterious change \n     in the condition of--\n       (A) a human or other living thing (including death, cancer, \n     or other chronic illness, decreased reproductive capacity, or \n     disfigurement); or\n       (B) an inanimate thing important to human welfare \n     (including destruction, degeneration, the loss of intended \n     function, and increased costs for maintenance).\n       (4) Irreversibility.--The term ``irreversi- \n     bility'' means the extent to which a return to conditions \n     before the occurrence of an effect are either very slow or \n     will never occur.\n       (5) Likelihood.--The term ``likelihood'' means the \n     estimated probability that an effect will occur.\n       (6) Magnitude.--The term ``magnitude'' means the number of \n     individuals or the quantity of ecological resources or other \n     resources that contribute to human welfare that are affected \n     by exposure to a stressor.\n       (7) Seriousness.--The term ``seriousness'' means the \n     intensity of effect, the likelihood, the irreversibility, and \n     the magnitude.\n       (c) Department and Agency Program Goals.--\n       (1) Setting priorities.--In exercising authority under \n     applicable laws protecting human health, safety, or the \n     environment, the head of each covered agency should set \n     priorities and use the resources available under those laws \n     to address those risks to human health, safety, and the \n     environment that--\n       (A) the covered agency determines to be the most serious; \n     and\n       (B) can be addressed in a cost-effective manner, with the \n     goal of achieving the greatest overall net reduction in risks \n     with the public and private sector resources expended.\n       (2) Determining the most serious risks.--In identifying the \n     greatest risks under paragraph (1) of this subsection, each \n     covered agency shall consider, at a minimum--\n       (A) the likelihood, irreversibility, and severity of the \n     effect; and\n       (B) the number and classes of individuals potentially \n     affected, and shall explicitly take into account the results \n     of the comparative risk analysis conducted under subsection \n     (d) of this section.\n       (3) OMB review.--The covered agency's determinations of the \n     most serious risks for purposes of setting priorities shall \n     be reviewed and approved by the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget before submission of the covered \n     agency's annual budget requests to Congress.\n       (4) Incorporating risk-based priorities into budget and \n     planning.--The head of each covered agency shall incorporate \n     the priorities identified under paragraph (1) into the agency \n     budget, strategic, planning, regulatory agenda, enforcement, \n     and research activities.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Institute of Medicine will \nrelease the findings of a major investigation into how America's \nhemophilia community came to be decimated by the HIV virus.\n  Even before this report is released, some of the tragic facts are \nvery well \n\n[[Page S 9793]]\nknown. In the early 1980's, America's blood supply was contaminated by \nHIV-infected donors. Many Americans have become HIV positive by \ntransfusions of the HIV-tainted blood.\n  Mr. President, Americans who contract HIV through a single blood \ntransfusion know they can point to the specific blood supplier and \ntherefore seek redress. But this is not the case with people who suffer \nfrom hemophilia. Those individuals have to undergo blood treatment too \noften and receive blood products from too many sources for this \nrecourse to be open to them. They simply cannot identify the blood \nsupplier that is culpable.\n  Mr. President, this community has been extremely hard hit by the \nspread of HIV. Mr. President, this story is one of the great tragedies \nof the last decade. It is a sad, tragic, and shocking story.\n  Mr. President, today there are approximately 20,000 Americans who \nrequire lifelong treatment for hemophilia, a genetic condition that \nimpairs the ability of blood to clot effectively. In the early 1980's, \nmore than 90 percent of the Americans suffering from severe hemophilia \nwere infected by the HIV virus.\n  Think of it--more than 90 percent. I think everyone knows someone who \nsuffers from hemophilia. Mr. President, 90 percent of those individuals \nin this entire country have been affected by HIV.\n  Mr. President, people with hemophilia have to receive treatment on a \nregular basis, treatment that requires the use of blood products from \nmany sources.\n  The danger to this population is and was immense. Their ability to \nget health insurance and life insurance has been severely limited. They \nalso have very little chance of legal redress for the tainted blood \nthey have received.\n  Mr. President, in America's past, a challenge of some public health \ndisasters, disasters in which the Federal Government has played a \ncontributing role, has, in fact, been met with a Federal response. I \nbelieve, Mr. President, that the U.S. Senate needs to tackle the \nquestion of whether the Federal Government should play a similar role \nin the crisis now taking place in America's hemophilia communities.\n  The report scheduled to be released tomorrow will be very helpful, as \nwe discuss this problem. It is my hope, it is my expectation, that the \nreport will address three very important questions: First, did the \nFederal agencies responsible for blood safety show the appropriate \nlevel of diligence in screening the blood supply? Second, did the \nFederal agencies move as quickly as they should have to approve blood \nproducts that were potentially safer? Third, did the Federal Government \nfail to warn the hemophilia community when the government knew or \nshould have known that there were legitimate concerns that the blood \nsupply might not be safe?\n  Said in another way, what did the government know? When did it know \nit? What did it do about it? Whom did it inform? Mr. President, if the \nanswer to any of these three questions is no, it is clear to me, and I \nwould hope to other Americans, that the Federal Government has not met \nits responsibility--has simply not met its responsibility in this area.\n  As a result, the Federal Government would have a clear duty to \nprovide some measure of relief to the people with hemophilia who have \nbeen infected with the HIV virus.\n  Mr. President, there is reason to suspect that the answer to all \nthree of these questions is, tragically, ``No.'' No to each of the \nquestions.\n  Beginning in 1982, an investigation by the Centers for Disease \nControl suggested that aids was being transferred by blood-borne \nagents, but the public health service of this country did not call for \nprecautionary measures to protect the blood supply until March 1983.\n  Mr. President, on January 4, 1983, the Centers for Disease Control \nrecommended the testing of new viral inactivation methodologies--\nessentially, new strategies to stop the spread of HIV virus in the \nblood supply.\n  The public health service did not--I repeat, did not--act on this \nrecommendation. Neither, Mr. President, did the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Furthermore, we know that Federal agencies assured the American \npeople that it was safe to go ahead and use these blood products. Now \nwe know the products were, in fact, not safe.\n  Mr. President, I will be examining this report that will be issued \ntomorrow with great care, as I think all Americans should.\n  I believe the story this report is going to tell will not be a \nreassuring story, that the picture that this story will paint will not \nbe a pretty one.\n  Therefore, I expect to come back to this floor before this Senate to \ndiscuss appropriate steps for the Congress to take in response to this \nvery great human tragedy.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9792-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RABBI JUDEA MILLER\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nman, Rabbi Judea Miller. He passed away July 9, 1995, and the loss of \nhis presence is already felt by all those who knew him.\n  A much respected fixture in the city of Rochester, NY, Rabbi Miller \nled an exciting life in which he continually challenged the status quo \nand injustice in society. Born in New York City in the early 1930's, \nRabbi Miller first served as a rabbi in the U.S. Army at Fort Riley, \nKS. After completion of his service, he moved to Temple Emanu-El in \nWitchita, KS and then to a temple in Malden, MA before settling at \nTemple B'rith Kodesh in 1973. Yet throughout his geographic moves, the \nrabbi held dear the notions of equality and acceptance. In 1962, he \ntraveled south to Mississippi to assist in the voter registration \ndrives. There, he and a local minister dined at a Woolworth's lunch \ncounter, marking that restaurant's first integrated meal.\n  He continued this fight for justice taking stands against slumlords \nand poor education and capital punishment. He was a defender of faith \nin the largest sense and he reached out to other religions. Said the \nReverend Dwight Cook of Mt. Olivet Baptist Church, ``Rabbi Miller was \nabout bringing people of different races and different religions \ntogether.''\n  He will be remembered dearly by his friends, his congregation, and \nthe city of Rochester. He will be remembered, the Rochester Chronicle \nand Democrat said, as, ``a voice of dignity, reason and compassion, \nspeaking always on behalf of justice and peace.'' Those who knew him \nalready miss him dearly.\n  Rabbi Miller is survived by his wife, Anita; his son, Rabbi Jonathan \nMiller; his daughter, Rebecca Gottesman; his mother, Yetta Waxman; and \nfive grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following article \nfrom the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, July 11, 1995]\n\n                           A Voice For Peace\n\n       Regular readers of the Democrat and Chronicle editorial \n     pages knew Rabbi Judea Miller well. He was a frequent \n     contributor, a voice of dignity, reason and compassion, \n     speaking always on behalf of justice and peace. His writings \n     consistently revealed his sense of scholarship and history; \n     and his empathy for peoples of every race and religion.\n       His death Sunday is a loss to us all.\n       He wrote often of his wish for security for the Jewish \n     state of Israel, but he often ran into criticism from those \n     who saw him too ready to make peace with the Palestinians. In \n     1989, for example, he wrote of his visit to the Palestinian \n     refugees at Ramallah, and described in moving terms the \n     conditions he found there. In 1992, he compared Serbian \n     attacks on the Bosnian Muslims to the Nazi attacks on Jews.\n       Miller was full of intellectual curiosity, and he went \n     where his restless mind took him. In 1987 he journeyed to \n     visit the Russian dissident, Andrei Sakharov, who had only \n     recently been released from his exile. In 1990 he defended \n     the writer Issac Bashevis Singer against Yiddish critics who, \n     Miller said, were so wounded by the pain of the Holocaust \n     that they could not see the uncomfortable truths that Singer \n     was writing.\n       Hundreds of Rochesterians knew Miller personally, through \n     his unceasing efforts to bridge the racial and religious gaps \n     that divide blacks, whites, Protestants, Catholics and Jews \n     in our community.\n       In April, when he announced his retirement from Temple \n     B'rith Kodesh, he assured a reporter: ``I will still be \n     around to make trouble.'' The only trouble he ever made was \n     for those whose prejudice or ignorance stood in the way of \n     the world of peace and justice that he envisioned.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9793-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 9794]]\n\n\nTHE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL FOR FY \n                                  1996\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

If good progress is \nbeing made, then it would not be necessary, or if some agreements could \nbe reached, it would not be necessary to have this cloture vote.

Mr. President, I rise now with a sense of real \ndisappointment because I thought we were moving along very well. We \nwere doing this in good faith, moving as fast as we can. There has not \nbeen delay on our side. We have not submitted a lot of amendments. The \namendments have taken some time to discuss, but that discussion has \nbeen as much on the Republican side as it has on the Democratic side. I \nthink any fair analysis of the record over the last 2 days would show \nthat. In fact, on the bill we are considering, S. 343, it is the Dole-\nJohnston bill, and I think one of the coauthors of that bill has been \nresponsible for as much time on the floor--more time on the floor being \nspent than have those of us who have opposed some of that.\n  I do not know why it is necessary to try to make this point with \ncloture, which means there seems to be a feeling that we have been \ndelaying things on our side so we have to be cut off with cloture. I do \nnot think that is fair. I really do not.\n  I think anybody who has watched these proceedings or been involved on \nthe floor here knows we have been going ahead in good faith. We have \nbeen trying to move things. We have not delayed things. The only delay \nI can think of, out of the last 2 days, where any time was taken on our \nside that might be looked at as unnecessary on the other side, was the \ntime this afternoon when we were trying to work out this agreement for \nwhether the Johnson amendment and the Daschle amendment were going to \nbe taken up in what order. There was a period of maybe an hour this \nafternoon where we wasted time on that, that is true. But that is the \nonly time.\n  Outside of that, we have been operating in good faith that we were \nmoving ahead on these things. I think this puts a whole different cast \non this thing.\n  I do not know whether this fits the same pattern as some of the \npatterns a little earlier a month or so ago when we were laying down a \nbill and putting down the cloture the same day before we even got \nstarted. But this is just an unfair castigation, as I see it, of the \nway we have proceeded on this bill.\n  So I must say I am disappointed. Obviously, I cannot do anything \nabout it. But I am disappointed that the other side views this with \nsuch lack of faith in our good efforts to move forward on this that \nthey think it is necessary to file cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator, first of all, there has been no castigation in \nthe way this legislation has been handled. As far as laying down \ncloture the same time bills are offered, I recall that was done an \nawful lot in the previous 2 years. This cloture was not laid down the \nsame time the bill was brought up for consideration. We have been on \nthis bill now for parts of 4 or 5 days.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Ohio did not hear my comments when I sent \nthis cloture motion to the desk. If I could have the Senator's \nattention, I direct his attention to the fact that I said when I sent \nit to the desk that it was hoped that it will not be necessary to have \na vote on the cloture motion. But we did not make a whole lot of \nprogress today in terms of numbers of amendments considered. It may not \nbe necessary to go through with the vote \n\n[[Page S 9795]]\non the cloture motion. But if one is not filed tonight, there would be \nno way for one to be brought to fruition before next Monday.\n  It is the clear hope of the leader, and I think the leaders, that \nthis legislation be completed early next week because we do have a long \nlist of very important legislation pending which we hope to be able to \nconsider in a timely fashion and with fair and full debate before we go \nout for the August recess. I know the Members are looking forward to \nthat opportunity to be with their families, their children, their new \nbrides. And in order to be able to achieve that, we are going to have \nto make some progress on a long list of legislation that is necessary \nbefore we go out. We need to start taking up appropriations bills. We \nneed to get two or three appropriations bills done next week. We need \nto get several--seven or eight--of the appropriations bills completed \nbefore we go out for the August work period.\n  So all I am saying to the distinguished Senator from Ohio is that I \nknow he is working hard. I know he is working in good faith. We hope \nthat will continue to be the case. We hope tomorrow that we will be \nable to take up and dispose of a lot of serious, relevant amendments. \nThen I think the leader would have the option of talking with the \ndistinguished floor managers of the bill, Senator Hatch and Senator \nGlenn, and see where we are, make a decision as to how much progress is \nbeing made, seeing if there is any possibility at that point to get \nsome finite list of amendments and get some idea of when we might be \nable to bring this legislation to a conclusion.\n  So I just want to respond, first of all, that there has been no \ncastigation of his efforts or intentions. I think there has been good \nfaith on both sides of the aisle. There has been a bipartisan effort \nunderway. It is not intended to cut off debate, but it is intended by \nthe leader as a signal to let us keep working, let us keep moving, and \nlet us not let it get bogged down between now and Friday afternoon.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, talking about castigation, I think the very \nfact of filing cloture indicates a castigation of how we have been \noperating on this side. It indicates that something has to be cut off \nto move us forward and that we have not been doing an adequate job \nhere. I do not think that is the case at all. That is what I referred \nto by castigation.\n  As far as the schedule, I do not believe there will be a more \nimportant piece of business before this Senate this year than this \nlegislation. It may be dry, it may be arcane, it may be hard to \nunderstand, and it may be complicated. But this stuff affects every \nperson here in this room. It affects every person in this city, and \nacross this land, and in major, major ways.\n  I just do not see that we are going to be able to rush through \nsomething like this and do the job that should be done for the people \nof this country.\n  Since Monday, I am told by staff there have been 16 amendments; 11 of \nthose were put in by Republicans; 6 of those were withdrawn; there were \n5 of the Democratic proposals, I believe, that have been voted on. So \nthat is an indication of what we have done since Monday. This is \nWednesday evening. I do not think that is taking too long on what is \none of the most important pieces of business that this body will take \nup this year.\n  The appropriations bills may be more important. But I do not think \nany other legislation is going to affect as many people directly in \nthis whole Nation as what we do on this. To now have to go under a 30-\nhour time limit and say, ``If cloture is invoked, that is it. No matter \nhow important it is for the people of the country, no matter how \ncomplex, how complicated, yes, we are going to rush through because we \nhave some other stuff we have to get on to.''\n  We all have to get out for that August break, for sure. I agree. I \nwant to go out on the August break. But to rush through this thing and \nindicate that we have to meet some schedule, I think, is unwarranted \nbecause this is a very important piece of legislation.\n  I say once again that since Monday, 16 amendments, 11 of them \nRepublicans, 6 of those withdrawn, 5 Democrats, and we have had votes.\n I think we have moved along pretty well since Monday, and so I must \nsay it disappoints me greatly, obviously, when we felt we had to file \ncloture, or the leader felt he had to file cloture on us when we have \nbeen operating in good faith, moving along, spending long hours on \nthis. So I am disappointed, that is all.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me just associate myself with the remarks of the \ndistinguished manager of the bill on our side, Senator Glenn. I was \nhoping we could avoid this. I had the opportunity throughout the last \ncouple of days to talk to the distinguished majority leader about our \ndesire to continue to work in good faith. I think we have done that.\n  Obviously, today was a good example of what has happened. I laid down \nan amendment this morning, and by far the bulk of the debate has been \non an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, \nSenator Johnston, and modified on several occasions throughout the day \nby Senator Johnston.\n  It was only at the end of the day, after a great deal of prodding and \npleading on our part, that we could finally agree to a time limit and \nan up-or-down vote on his amendment and then on mine.\n  So I think the distinguished Senator from Ohio said it very well--16 \namendments, 11 Republican, 5 Democrat. We are here tonight. I would \nnote that in the Chamber there is one Republican and four or five \nDemocrats ready to continue to work. So I am disappointed that the \ncloture motion was filed. I think it is fair to say that we will not be \nprecluded from offering amendments, from ensuring that this debate \nreceives the full airing it deserves. This is one of the most important \npieces of legislation to come before the Senate in this session of \nCongress, regardless of what else may be brought up before the end of \nthe year.\n  So we will not be precluded from that. We will offer amendments. I \nthink we will anticipate the unity that we have experienced on several \noccasions already this year when it has come to cloture in protecting \nMembers' rights to offer amendments and have the full debate.\n  So while we may have a cloture vote, I have the feeling that we will \nbe on this bill for a little while yet because we need to raise a \nnumber of issues that have yet to be addressed. We will have the \nalternative perhaps as early as tomorrow. Subject to however that may \nturn out, we may or may not want to protect our rights to deal with \nother issues. So it is unfortunate, and we will continue to work in \ngood faith. Hopefully we can resolve these outstanding issues in \nwhatever time it may take.\n  It is not our desire, as the Senator from Ohio has indicated, to \nprolong debate unnecessarily, to do anything other than work in good \nfaith to resolve the outstanding differences and get on with final \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond briefly to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader's comments, first of all, just 20 \nminutes ago I am sure we probably had 90 or 100 Senators in the Chamber \nprepared to work. If there had not been agreement that we end the work \nfor today, on both sides of the aisle, we would still all be here, and \nso I do not believe the Record reflecting there are only one or two \nRepublicans here willing to work and four or five Democrats--it was \nalready announced that business was over for the day, and basically we \nwere in the process of shutting down.\n  I do want to say, secondly, to my distinguished friend from South \nDakota that I think there has been a good-faith effort. I think he does \nwant to try to bring this to a reasonable conclusion as far as time and \nthe results, and we continue to hope that will be the case. Maybe we \nwill make good progress tomorrow. Maybe we will make good progress \nFriday.\n  Maybe, with him working with the distinguished majority leader, we \nwill find it is not necessary to have a cloture vote, or it may be \nnecessary. I do not think that it is not allowing enough time when you \nspend 5, 6, 7, 8 days on one piece of legislation. It is very \nimportant, I agree on that, and we ought to have it fully discussed, \nwhich \n\n[[Page S 9796]]\nI think it certainly is being and has been for quite some time.\n  I note also, though, that we have just had a meeting, bipartisan \nleadership meeting with the President, in which the President was \nsaying please get together, move forward expeditiously. He was \nwondering about the rescissions bill. No conclusion has been reached on \nthe rescissions bill. The President was saying he was in hopes that we \ncould move through a long list of important items to him and the \ncountry--welfare reform. We would like to work on that. Appropriations \nbills and reconciliation. So the President is also asking that we move \nthings right along, and I think that we have an obligation to try to do \nthat.\n  For instance, I was under the impression that there was going to be \nan alternative maybe available earlier--I thought Monday. We have not \nseen it. But maybe, as it was just indicated, there will be an \nalternative, or substitute that will be offered tomorrow and we can \nhave full debate on that, and that will kind of settle the dust. And \nthen we will be able to move on to an expeditious conclusion.\n  That is all that is done here, for the leader to preserve his options \nand to, quite frankly, keep pressure on all of us, both sides of the \naisle, without being critical of the leaders because they are doing a \nvery difficult and very important job, but to keep pressures on us, to \nserve notice that we need to keep moving forward, making progress. And \nif we are not, then he has this option. If we did not file it tonight, \nwe would not have the option until next Monday or Tuesday, depending on \nwhen it was filed, for it to ripen for a cloture vote, if necessary. We \nhope it will not be necessary, but we are going to keep that option \navailable.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I respect the ability of the Senator from \nMississippi to be able to put a shiny note on almost anything. But I \nmust say that the question still remains whether or not it is \nappropriate to file it today, Wednesday, or whether or not you could \nnot preserve the option to file it on Friday, and it would ripen by \nMonday, or file it Monday and ripen by next Wednesday.\n  The question is, what signal is being sent. If you look back at the \nRecord, this bill was laid down in the Chamber--excuse me, it was \nprinted in the Record on a Wednesday night. Thursday it appeared prior \nto our departure for the July 4 recess.\n  It was then agreed upon that there would only be debate and no \namendments offered. That was a suggestion, I might add, of the majority \nleader. So we departed on a Friday with everybody agreeing there was \nonly debate.\n  We came back only this Monday, the mid part of the day. We had an \nagreement to have some votes in the afternoon. We then went into a \nrecess the next morning for conferences. We recessed in the evening \nwithout any additional votes. Now we are back here on Wednesday.\n  So here we have one of the single most important pieces of \nlegislation that will come before us--I think everybody agrees with \nthat--and here we are with a cloture motion at the desk on Wednesday \nevening with only five Democratic amendments voted on.\n  Now, the Senator from Mississippi has suggested, well, this happened \na great deal previously. I would say to the Senator, respectfully, that \nby June of the first session in the prior terms this never happened.\n  This happened in the second session. And it did begin to happen with \nsome frequency because certain people here adopted a conscious policy \nof filibustering everything. And everybody knows that our efforts in \nthe final months of the last session of the last term were literally \ngoverned by the policy of gridlock that was a calculated strategy to \nlet nothing pass. Thereupon, Senator Mitchell, who was truly the \nmonument to patience and goodwill, came to the floor again and again \nand again without pressing the notion of late nights and cloture and \norder in our lives. So I think that really it does not send a good \nsignal in the context of where we traveled in last few days.\n  Second, we entered into some negotiations in those days when the \nfloor was open for debate. I thought we were making some progress. At \nthe last meeting Senator Nickles, who headed up the task force on the \nother side of the aisle, stood up and said, ``Well, we have gone just \nabout as far as we can go today. I'll let you know when we can have the \nnext meeting.'' Well, it is now Wednesday, 9:30 at night. We still have \nnot been notified about another meeting. There has been no serious \neffort to reengage in negotiations. So this filing has to be placed \nalso in the context of that fact, that if this was serious, we might \nindeed have met.\n  Now, I want to have what I call a press alert here tonight because \nthe reason this cloture motion has been filed is basically to empower a \ncertain political strategy to take place, which is to try to put those \nwho want to legislate a good piece of legislation on the defensive with \nthe notion that they are somehow delaying the Holy Grail of regulatory \nreform. And so we now have hanging over our heads the specter of \ndisappearing for a weekend with a cloture vote where we have to assert \nour right to legislate under the cloud of being accused of standing in \nthe way of regulatory reform. That is the game here. And my hope is \nthat as more and more of these amendments come to the floor and \nAmericans are given a chance to measure what is happening here with an \nattempt to take away the right to know and supplant it with the right \nto hide and the right to pollute, or to take away the ability of \nregulators to issue reasonable rules, or even to approach a standard of \nreasonableness here, I think people are going to understand.\n  Now, I would say for myself, I am running this year. It does not \nmatter to me if we have to vote cloture five, six, seven, eight times \nto preserve the right to protect those things that 25 years have made a \ndifference in people's lives. And you know, I think that we ought to \nget about the business of trying to figure out how we are going to lift \nstupid rules and legitimately irrelevant, excessive agency regulations, \nbut at the same time not take something like the Delaney clause that \nkeeps carcinogens out of the food that our kids eat and our fellow \ncitizens eat, and somehow just throw it out, which is what this bill \ndoes.\n  So I do not think most Americans have yet come to realize the full \nmeasure of what is at stake in this legislation. But this Senator \ncertainly is happy to debate it for some period of time to help them do \nso.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, if the Senator would yield, I \nwould like to respond to that. First of all, there is some degree of \ntrepidation, I would say. Maybe there is going to be another meeting in \nthe morning at 9:30. Maybe he had not--the Senator from Massachusetts \nand others--had not received that information. But I understand there \nis an attempt to meet and to discuss and negotiate further. And I say \nwith some degree of trepidation because, you know, this is regulatory \nreform. I do think that the American people want that. I do think that \nthe American people and the economy and the people that have lost their \njobs because of the overbearing burden of the bureaucrats and the \nmandates and the regulations spewing out of this city, hundreds of \nthousands of pages annually going out and being dumped on the private \ncitizens and small businesses and people who are trying to make a \nliving in this country, want regulatory reform. They want regulatory \nrelief.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator like me to----\n  Mr. LOTT. I have to say, I frankly have been shocked at all of the \ndiscussion and the concerns and ``we must get rid of this, and we must \nget rid of this portion of the bill.'' What are we going to wind up \ndoing here, striking out all after the enacting clause and sending it \nto conference? We did a lot of work that has been done on this, a lot \nof negotiations.\n  A lot of compromises, but at some point we have to make up our minds \nif we want real regulatory reform or not. And I am not questioning \nthere are probably other amendments that are deserving to be considered \nand we can take up and vote on. We have got time to do that, and we \nwill be doing that tomorrow. But, you know, a lot of negotiations have \nalready gone on. A lot of good portions of the original bill have \nalready been jettisoned, in my opinion. A lot of critical portions \nhave \n\n[[Page S 9797]]\n\nalready been weakened that I think are--we are going to regret later \non, without getting into specifics at this late hour.\n  But, you know, I really am concerned that the appearance is beginning \nto go out that we are going to nitpick a very important piece of \nlegislation. I agree with that, to the degree we will not wind up with \nvery much. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, you see, it seems to me that the \nSenator from Mississippi is now doing exactly the kind of \ncharacterization that I just issued a press alert on, suggesting that \nwe are tearing apart a bill that is, in fact, the nirvana of regulatory \nreform. But what the Senator neglects to tell the American people is \nthat by a vote of 15-0, the committee that has spent years working on \nthis issue sent a bill to the floor. It is the Roth-Glenn bill. It is \nthe heart of what we will vote on as an alternative. And I say again to \nmy friend, 15-0. If that bill were on the floor today, without the \nDole-Johnston substitute in the mix, as the only ingredient of \nlegislation, I submit to my friend we would pass it 100-0. Maybe 98-2. \nBut now that we have got the new mix, a contentiousness has entered the \nentire equation.\n  I might add, there are two other committees that have jurisdiction \nhere. The Environment Committee, of which the Senator from Rhode Island \nis the chairman, was bypassed altogether. Now, that may be because he \nis noted for his reasonableness on these issues. And then the Judiciary \nCommittee, which also has jurisdiction, was not allowed to legislate \none amendment. Not one amendment. So what happened is that the three \ncommittees with jurisdiction were taken completely out, and this bill \nwas essentially written by the majority leader, by a cabal of people \ninvolving a lot of interests that have been specially served here. Take \nout the Delaney clause. Take out the toxic release. Have a special fix \nhere and a special fix there.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could ask the Senator to allow me to reclaim my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is your right.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think there are 4 committees that have jurisdiction in \nthis area. They had some jurisdiction. Judiciary has jurisdiction. I \nbelieve Energy and Natural Resources had a bill that Senator Murkowski \nand Senator Johnston and others had worked on for a long time, as well \nas the bill out of the committee chaired by Senator Roth. Senator Roth, \nas a matter of fact, the chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, \nsent out a letter today saying this is in his opinion a better bill \nthan what was reported out of his committee.\n  As a matter of fact, what happened with this bill is exactly what I \nthink the Senator from Massachusetts is calling for. This is an \namalgamation that has some of the better parts of the Judiciary \nCommittee bill in it, some of the better parts of Government Affairs. \nIt is not some mongrel hybrid; it is an amalgamation of good bills.\n  So that was point No. 1, that everybody had a jurisdiction here. And \nto say, Oh, well, only Government Affairs can have the lead call, I do \nnot think that is very fair. Other very important committees had a very \nimportant part. But beyond that there were a lot of discussions and \nnegotiations that went on between the distinguished majority leader and \nMembers on your side of the aisle--a lot of discussions, a lot of give \nand take, a lot of changes, a lot of compromises, many of which this \nSenator did not agree with. But in an effort to try to come up with a \nbipartisan bill, those changes were made.\n  We are going to have to do more of that around here.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I simply, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, want to \ncomment on the point raised by the Senator from Massachusetts. The bill \nwas considered over a period of months in the Judiciary Committee. I \nmust say, in the 5 years I have been in the Senate and the 10 years I \nspent in the House of Representatives, and the 4 years I spent in the \nColorado State Senate, it is the first and the only bill I have seen \nfilibustered in committee, and that is exactly what happened.\n  The reason amendments were not offered by committee Democrats is \nthat, when the floor was open to them to offer amendments, members \nchoose instead to filibuster. I offered an amendment, which was added \nto the bill, so, clearly amendments were added in our process in the \nJudiciary Committee. My amendment was not included in the Roth bill \nthat came out of that committee. My amendment simply points out there \nare times when Federal Government agencies will develop conflicting \nregulations. My amendment provides a safe harbor for working people who \nfind themselves subjected to conflicting regulations and are put at \nrisk by when Government agencies' regulations require opposite actions.\n  So the statement that no amendments were considered in the Judiciary \nCommittee is not accurate. Amendments were considered and amendments \nwere added. The fact that Democratic amendments were not acted on in \nthe last few days came from the fact that members choose to filibuster \nthe bill rather than respond to it.\n  Finally, I do not want to delay your deliberations in winding up the \nsession, but let me simply add, one of the problems with this bill and \none of the problems with this area is that so few Members of the House \nand the Senate have had a chance to work with their hands and work in \nbusiness and be subjected to regulation. We passed last year and this \nGovernment sent out over 60,000 pages of new regulations.\n  Let me repeat that, because I do not think Members focused on it. \nOver 60,000 pages of new regulations, not counting the hundreds of \nthousands of regulations that exist already. The Federal Government \npromulgated so many regulations that people who work in this country do \nnot even have time to read the regulations that affect their lives. I \nsuggest to any Senator who is concerned, work in an industry that is \nsubjected to Federal regulations. You cannot even read what you are \nsubjected to. You cannot even get people who work for a living to even \nread what they are liable for, what they are at risk for that this \nGovernment pumps out.\n  Before we pursue this effort, you ought to place yourself in the \nposition of the people who have to work for a living, who have to live \nwith these regulations and find themselves subjected to fines and \npenalties for insane regulations they do not have a chance to read.\n  If you sat down today and read solidly for a year, 8 hours a day, no \ncoffee breaks, no time off, no holidays, read 52 weeks a year without \nany vacations and you read at 300 words per minute, you would still not \nread the regulations, the new ones that came out this year. You would \nprobably read a little over half of the pages of the new regulations \nthat came out.\n  Now we have a problem. We are strangling this economy with redtape \nand regulations, and I just would say to my good friends that have \nraised objection about this, honestly talk to some of the people who \nhave to live under these regulations. See what they are subjected to.\n  This is a burden that is crushing. It is crushing to our \ncompetitiveness and the people who operate under this burden. I have \ntalked to contractors who make their living trying to build houses. \nThey find themselves in the position of having somebody who has never \nbuilt a house in their life come out and tell them how to build a \nhouse. They never built a house in their life, do not know anything \nabout it, but if you do not do it the way they tell you, you can be \nfined and lose your entire business.\n  What we have done is set up a system to micromanage this economy. The \nbill that is before us is a joke. Some improvement it is, but to say \nthe only regulations you are going to subject this test to are ones \nthat have the threshold that is included in this bill is absurd. That \nis the problem.\n  I do not think what has been voiced on this floor has reflected the \nimpact these regulations have on the working people in this country. We \nare strangling this economy and working people of this country with \nneedless regulations. What we need is a lick of common sense. So we can \nfight over this bill, but the fact is the threshold is already so high \nthat you have denied relief to most of the American people that \ndesperately need it.\n  If we are going to be competitive in the world economy, if we intend \nto give \n\n[[Page S 9798]]\npeople good livelihoods, if we are concerned about the wage of working \nmen and women, we better figure out a way to have more of the people \npull the wagon and less regulating where it goes. If you are talking \nabout a business, you have to get more people out of the office and \nonto the assembly line where they do the work.\n  That is what this bill is all about, to find a way we can make \nAmerica more competitive and more productive and more creative and \nspend less time on regulations. We need to do a lot more in this bill. \nI hope Members will take some time to look at what we have done to this \neconomy, because it is devastating.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could continue----\n  Mr. KERRY. I will not take long.\n  Mr. LOTT. I still want to respond a little more to your earlier \nquestion.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Colorado that when he got \ninto that recitation about the coffee breaks and the amount of time and \npages, I all of a sudden feared he might have been one of those people \nwho had written some of these regulations. But knowing that he did not \nand would not, I just want to say, we agree with everything he just \nsaid, and the bill that Senator Glenn and Senator Roth brought out of \ncommittee 15-0 would have, indeed, addressed almost everything that the \nSenator just said.\n  The problem is, if you take, for instance, the threshold argument the \nSenator just made, the threshold was set in 1975 by President Ford. One \nhundred million dollars is worth $35 million today, and if you lowered \nit to $50 million, you are talking about reality of a $17 million \nthreshold.\n  As my friend knows, there is not a lawyer in America who cannot \nconjure up a threshold impact of $17 million in real value, $50 \nmillion, or otherwise. We lifted that to $100 million for a major rule, \nbut we still have a $10 million threshold in here for Superfund. And \nunder the Nunn amendment that was adopted, we brought in this \nextraordinary panoply of small business at a whole new threshold. So \nyou have literally a 100- to 400-percent increase in EPA and other \nagency requirements here just to review the new rules you brought under \nit. I know the Senator is not going to add to the budget to provide \npersonnel to do that. So you have an enormous gridlock problem.\n  I will just say to my friend from Mississippi, by having filed this \ncloture motion, I believe, if I am correct in the parliamentary \nprocedure, amendments now have to be filed by 1 p.m. tomorrow; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. So if amendments have to be filed by 1 p.m. tomorrow, \nthose of us who have to work tonight in preparation for a meeting have \nto disperse our staff in order to ensure all Democratic amendments can \nbe brought together by 1 p.m. tomorrow. That is an example, I say \nrespectfully, of how this breaches the process. There is, in effect, a \nchilling effect on our capacity to pull ourselves together for a \nmeeting and negotiate. And second, there is a terribly unfair burden \nput on all of our colleagues who will arrive tomorrow morning to learn \nthat they have about 2 or 3 hours to put in an amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I realize this is the Senate, \nunlike most legislative bodies, but I would be somewhat shocked if most \nSenators do not already know what amendments they want to offer and \nhave already gotten them drafted.\n  This is not something that just drifted onto the floor of the Senate. \nThis has been coming for weeks and months. Surely, most Senators have \ntheir amendments ready to go. Now, I realize maybe some of them would \nbe affected by other amendments that may be offered during the next \ncouple of days. I do not view it as a real burden. We are on this bill, \nand everybody knows what is in it supposedly and should have their \namendments ready to go.\n  I want to go back to a point made earlier about how one committee \nreported out a bill unanimously. That committee was the only committee \nthat considered the so-called original Roth bill. The Dole bill went to \nfour committees--not only Judiciary, Energy, and Governmental Affairs, \nbut Small Business.\n  Then there were negotiations to try to make it a genuinely bipartisan \nbill that went on between Senator Dole and Senator Johnston of \nLouisiana, who has worked so diligently in trying to find a compromise \nthat could go through in a bipartisan way.\n  Then I remember there were subsequent negotiations. I went into a \nmeeting in the distinguished Democratic leader's office one day, and \nthere must have been 15 Senators in there. I was floored. I left pretty \nquickly because I said nothing good will come out of this because there \nwere too many people involved.\n  There were more changes made. I know changes were made because there \nwere changes made on sections I worked on, some that I certainly did \nnot agree with. There has been a long, protracted effort to develop a \ncompromise bill. There comes a point when you have to stop changing it \nand vote. We are hoping that point will come early next week.\n  One final point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. LOTT. One final point, and then I will be glad to yield to you.\n  There is something that the Senator from Colorado in his fine remarks \njust reminded me to comment on. We were all home during the Fourth of \nJuly recess. I was in my State. I met with some small business \nrepresentatives, among other things. I remember a small businessman \nfrom Fulton, Mississippi. I met with the group and they told me that \nunder a new rule promulgated, that they, for small technical violations \nin their company, could be fined up to $10,000 per day until the \nbureaucrat concluded that they had complied with this violation they \nhad. I think probably this bill will help address that kind of problem. \nAnd they gave me the new regulations. This is one small business group \nin my State, although it is a nationwide group. The new regulation that \ncould lead to a $10,000 fine per day, which would put most of them out \nof business in about 2 days, was that thick. We need to deal with that.\n  I know we are trying to do that. I hope we will, but I am beginning \nto really have my doubts about whether or not we can continue to water \nthis bill down and have one that is worth going forward with.\n  With that, I will yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for yielding. I will \nbe very brief. I just want to add one chapter to the historical record \nhere. Immediately prior to the recess, there was a suggestion that \nthose of us that favored the so-called Glenn bill, or the Glenn-Chafee \nbill, that we put suggested changes----\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will withhold, I was going to say something \nto the Senator from Massachusetts, but he may be gone. I will say it \nnow if the Senators from Ohio and Michigan are concerned about the \nfiling deadline of 1 o'clock. I am sure the leader--in fact, I \nunderstand he will be willing to get a unanimous-consent to delay that \nuntil 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. In furtherance of that, would that \nbe helpful?\n  We will do that in the morning, then, after we have checked with \nothers. I wanted to make that offer so they know we are perfectly \nwilling to be helpful and cooperative if there is a time problem in \ngetting those amendments drafted.\n  I yield once again.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As I was saying, there is one element which has not been \nspoken to, which is the fact that immediately prior to the recess, it \nwas suggested to those of us that support the Glenn-Chafee bill that we \nput into specific language form suggested changes in the Dole-Johnston \nbill. And we did that. The staff, I think, probably stayed up all night \nto do that. Three pages of very specific proposed changes were \ndelivered prior to the recess about two weeks ago. Nothing happened. \nThere was no response to the suggested changes until today. And it is \nstill a bit fragmentary, but at least now we think we understand what \nthe response is on the part of the supporters of the pending Dole-\nJohnston legislation.\n  If we are talking about expediting the process here, it seems to me \nthat those of us who support the Glenn-Chafee proposal have, for almost \nnow two weeks, been waiting for a response to some very specific \nlanguage suggestions. Instead, we raised this issue on \n\n[[Page S 9799]]\nMonday, and then I think yesterday the Senator from Utah suggested, \nwell, let us just go at it amendment by amendment. The tree was filled \nup a couple times, by the way, so that it was all controlled. \nAmendments could not frequently be offered without a gatekeeper okaying \nit. And then they were second-degreed. That is all part of the rules. \nThere is nothing new about that.\n  But to suggest that there has been an effort on the part of the \nsupporters of the Glenn proposal to, in any way, delay instead of to \ndebate and hopefully approve the pending amendment, I think, is a \nmisplaced suggestion. And that suggestion is implied when a cloture \nmotion is filed. That is the implication of the filing of a cloture \nmotion.\n  Somehow or other, people who are the supporters of the Glenn approach \nare in some way delaying the legislation that is pending before us, and \nthere is not only no evidence of that, it is quite the contrary. There \nwas an effort made in the last two weeks to get some very specific \nresponses to some very specific proposals. Again, the first glimpse we \nhad of a response was just today.\n  So I suggest to my good friend from Mississippi that the filing of \ncloture tonight is inappropriate. It is also, I believe, \ncounterproductive because, just tonight, without any knowledge that a \ncloture motion might be filed, there was an understanding reached that \nthere would be a meeting tomorrow morning, and I believe the time was \nset at 9:30. And then, having agreed to do that, suddenly there is a \ncloture motion filed. That is not the kind of signal which I think is a \nproductive signal in terms of moving legislation.\n  As far as the legislation is concerned, I have to tell you that I \nthink all of us in this body, hopefully, have seen a great deal of \nevidence of excessive regulation, of abuse, and of waste in this \nprocess.\n  I came to this town determined to get some kind of accountability in \nthis process. I have been a strong supporter of legislative veto and \nexecutive oversight. I believe we ought to have cost-benefit analysis \nrequired by law. I believe in the various parts of both proposals.\n  So the speeches about regulatory overkill, I think, are very \nappropriate. There has been some. There has also been some very \nessential regulation that has made it possible for us to breathe \ncleaner air and to have cleaner water and to have safer vehicles, and \nother things. The question is the balance. We want both, a cleaner \nenvironment, a safer workplace, but not overkill in the regulatory \nprocess. We can have both. But the signal that was sent here tonight, \nwhen after there was an understanding about meeting tomorrow morning to \ntry to make some more progress, and then to file a cloture motion, it \nseems to me, is a counterproductive act, and it tends to undermine the \npossibility of progress here rather than to promote it.\n  So that is why I think it was a mistake for that cloture motion to be \nfiled. It prevents relevant amendments from being considered if cloture \nis invoked because they have to be technically germane, but they can be \nrelevant and be prevented from being debated. I do not think it is in \nanybody's interest, as long as good progress is being made. And surely \nthere has been some progress, and there is no effort to delay the \nconsideration of this bill by anybody I know. I think cloture is not \nthe appropriate signal which should have been sent tonight. I regret \nthat it was.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the only thing we have pending would be to \nclose. Does Senator Glenn wish to make a comment?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes, I do. Mr. President, I will not go on long because we \nhave been on the floor a long time today.\n  I do not want to let the wrong impression go out to those who may be \nwatching. The impression was left perhaps by the distinguished chair in \nhis remarks a moment ago here, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, \nas though we were delaying and we are not interested--it could give \nthat impression; it could be interpreted that way, at least--and that \nsomehow those for the Dole bill are in favor of regulatory reform, and \nthose of us who have some other views about how that can be \naccomplished are somehow not as much in favor of regulatory reform. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  We have worked hard in committee, and the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, is maybe too modest. I have heard him say in committee \nthat one of the major things he wanted to get into when he came here--\nhaving been president of the city council in Detroit, he knew the \nimpact of regulations and what they did to the business people and the \ncommunity and the city government of Detroit, and what they did to the \nsurrounding communities of Detroit, and he was determined to do \nsomething about it.\n  I have heard on a number of occasions, both in committee and in \nprivate conversation with him, about his dedication to this, which is \nto his everlasting credit. I think we have worked on this specific \nlegislation in committee for close to 3 years now.\n  So this is not something that we come at lightly. We are as dedicated \non the Democratic side to regulatory reform as anybody on the \nRepublican side. We have some different views about how to get to it, \nthat is all, and what is workable and what is not. That is our \ndifference on this. It is not any difference in dedication. When I \nspoke on the floor and we opened up on this bill, my earlier remarks \nwere exactly along that line. We are a united Senate on one thing, and \nthat is the need for regulatory reform.\n But we also, at the same time, know that we must hit a balance. We \ncannot just do away with all regulations.\n\n  I agree with the examples, and I can give a dozen more from Ohio that \nmatch those of the distinguished Senator from Colorado, on \noverregulation. That is what we have to correct.\n  However, at the time we are doing this, do not throw out the good \nthat the regulations have done in the country along with throwing out \nthe excesses.\n  We do have better health in this country because of regulations. Some \nhave gone too far--yes. Do we have a better business climate in this \ncountry because of regulations? Yes, but there have been excesses in \nthat area, too.\n  So we certainly do have to correct these things. We agree with that. \nWe are as united with the Republicans as anybody can be in our \ndedication to seeing that regulatory reform is carried out. We get the \nsame comments from our business people and our organization people, our \nschool people, our local government people, that the Republicans get \nwhen we get back home. We are as dedicated to this as anybody can be.\n  Now I might say in committee, as was already referred to, we voted \nthat out of our committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, under \nChairman Roth, 15-0. Unanimous.\n  Now, there is a different approach that Senator Dole has taken. I \nthink our approach hits a better balance. That is all we are trying to \ndo here, is make sure that balance is hit.\n  What we are trying to do now in filing cloture is force a restricted \ntime on this legislation--one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we will have before the Senate--we are trying to take a \ncomplicated bill, and instead of saying how good we will make it, we \nare saying we will spend minimum time on it, force your hand. We will \nspend minimum time off the floor, will not give time for amendments, \nfor balance, for fairness, for consideration of those things. We will \nhave minimum time on it.\n  This will be a big concession on the Republican side apparently--big \ndeal, we will have an extension from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock to get \neverything that we want in this.\n  Everything has not been considered in this bill. All amendments have \nnot been considered. These are very complicated pieces of legislation--\nboth of the proposals.\n  I just want to address one other thing. I just cannot agree with my \ndistinguished colleague from Mississippi when he says we have gotten \ndown to nit-picking on this. That is the phrase that he used. Some 500 \npeople a year die from E. coli. Cryptosporidium killed 104 people, and \nmade 400,000 seriously ill in Milwaukee a couple years ago.\n  Senator Abraham and Senator Nunn addressed small business interests, \nSenator Dole addressed E. coli with his amendment, Senators Johnston \nand \n\n[[Page S 9800]]\nLevin put in the super mandates, so existing laws could not be \nsuperseded by something an agency does over here.\n  Now, I do not think of those as nit-picking. I think these are health \nand safety matters for the people of this country. Anybody that was \nfair in looking at what has happened on this floor can certainly not \ncome to the conclusion that these things have been nit-picking concerns \non the Democratic side.\n  Quite the opposite. These are life and death concerns, and it is the \nreason they were brought up, the reason we wanted to amend this. It is \nthe reason I supported some of the amendments on this.\n  Now, there have been negotiations that have gone on on this \nlegislation in the past, as Senator Levin says. We cannot help but \nwonder whether this was good faith negotiation when we now have cloture \nfiled against Members at this hour of the evening, after we thought we \nwere closing down the Senate, and all at once, staff came running out \nand said, ``Did you know they filed cloture?'' They filed cloture. I \nthought that could not be. I thought there was a mistake. It happens \nthat it is true.\n  We want to work through this. Obviously we want to have a chance to \ndo as good as we might otherwise have done. I want to disabuse anybody \nof the idea that we are not concerned about regulatory reform on this \nside of the aisle. We are as concerned and as dedicated to it as \nanybody, regardless of whatever political labels each may take. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I repeat, as the distinguished Senator from \nOhio pointed out, this is not a new issue. It has been pending for \nyears. It has been considered for the last 3 or 4 years and in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. It has been considered for at least a \ncouple years that I know of, Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nThere have been hours, days, spent bringing Members to this point.\n  This is a good bill. This is a bipartisan bill. The Dole-Johnston \nbill has been laboriously crafted and developed and changed--in some \nways people would think improved. In my opinion it has been weakened.\n  I repeat, I believe we have an especially good bill now, one that is \na balance, that is bipartisan. I just have to say, at some point, we \nhave to just agree to disagree. How long can you negotiate? Forever?\n  This is the most, I think, probably the most negotiated bill that we \nhave had this year. How many changes are we going to make? It reaches a \npoint, I think, that we weaken it so much that then there will be some \nthat have to start asking ourselves, is this still a strong regulatory \nreform bill.\n  There is still talk about taking major portions out of it. Talking \nabout taking the Superfund part out of it. Boy, if that has not been a \nregulatory nightmare, a lawyer's dream. But there are those that say we \nshould not have Superfund as part of regulatory reform. My goodness, I \ndo not know any area where we probably need regulatory reform more than \nin Superfund.\n  We could go back and forth, on and on. This is a good bill. We need \nstrong regulatory reform. We are talking about not only 60,000 pages of \nregulations just last year being promulgated, we are talking about \nestimates from as much as $300 to $600 billion a year cost to the \neconomy for many regulations that are necessary.\n  I know many of the Senators here tonight, Senator Levin would like to \nhave regulatory reform, but at some point, we just have to stop \nchanging it and vote. Let the votes fall where they do and bring it to \na conclusion.\n  I think we probably talked enough about this tonight. We will see \nwhat kind of progress we make tomorrow and the next day, and maybe we \ncan reach agreement and conclude this legislation and go on to other \nvery important pieces of legislation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9794-6", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9800-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9800-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9800-S9801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO LIBYA--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 64\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I hereby report to the Congress on the developments since my last \nreport of January 30, 1995, concerning the national emergency with \nrespect to Libya that was declared in Executive Order No. 12543 of \nJanuary 7, 1986. This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of \nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c); section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c); \nand section 505(c) of the International Security and Development \nCooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).\n  1. On December 22, 1994, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Libya pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal \nextended the current comprehensive financial and trade embargo against \nLibya in effect since 1986. Under these sanctions, all trade with Libya \nis prohibited, and all assets owned or controlled by the Libyan \ngovernment in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. \npersons are blocked.\n  2. There has been one amendment to the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, \n31 C.F.R. Part 550 (the ``Regulations''), administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control (FAC) of the Department of the Treasury, since \nmy last report on January 30, 1995. The amendment (60 Fed. Reg. 8300, \nFebruary 14, 1995) added 144 entities to appendix A, Organizations \nDetermined to Be Within the Term ``Government of Libya'' (Specially \nDesignated Nationals (``SDNs'') of Libya). The amendment also added 19 \nindividuals to appendix B, Individuals Determined to Be Specially \nDesignated Nationals of the Government of Libya. A copy of the \namendment is attached to this report.\n  Pursuant to section 550.304(a) of the Regulations, FAC has determined \nthat these entities and individuals designated as SDNs are owned or \ncontrolled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on \nbehalf of, the Government of Libya, or are agencies, instrumentalities \nor entities or that government. By virtue of this determination, all \nproperty and interests in property of these entities or persons that \nare in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. \npersons are blocked. Further, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging \nin transactions with these individuals or entities unless the \ntransactions are licensed by FAC. The designations were made in \nconsultation with the Department of State and announced by FAC in \nnotices issued on January 10 and January 24, 1995.\n  3. During the current 6-month period, FAC made numerous decisions \nwith respect to applications for licenses to engage in transactions \nunder the Regulations, issuing 119 licensing determinations--both \napprovals and denials. Consistent with FAC's ongoing scrutiny of \nbanking transactions, the largest category of license approvals (83) \nconcerned requests by Libyan and non-Libyan persons or entities to \nunblock bank accounts initially blocked because of an apparent \nGovernment of Libya interest. The largest category of denials (14) was \nfor banking transactions in which FAC found a Government of Libya \ninterest. One license was issued authorizing intellectual property \nprotection in Libya and another for travel to Libya to visit close \nfamily members.\n  In addition, FAC issued one determination with respect to \napplications from attorneys to receive fees and reimbursement of \nexpenses for provision of legal services to the Government of Libya in \nconnection with wrongful death civil actions arising from the Pan Am \n103 bombing. Civil suits have \n\n[[Page S 9801]]\nbeen filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and \nin the Southern District of New York. Representation of the Government \nof Libya when named as a defendant in or otherwise made a party to \ndomestic U.S. legal proceedings is authorized by section 550.517(b)(2) \nof the Regulations under certain conditions.\n  4. During the current 6-month period, FAC continued to emphasize to \nthe international banking community in the United States the importance \nof identifying and blocking payments made by or on behalf of Libya. The \nFAC worked closely with the banks to implement new interdiction \nsoftware systems to identify such payments. As a result, during the \nreporting period, more than 171 transactions involving Libya, totaling \nmore than $6.5 million, were blocked. As of May 25, 27 of these \ntransactions had been licensed to be released, leaving a net amount of \nmore than $5.2 million blocked.\n  Since my last report, FAC collected 37 civil monetary penalties \ntotaling more than $354,700 for violations of the U.S. sanctions \nagainst Libya. Eleven of the violations involved the failure of banks \nto block funds transfers to Libyan-owned or -controlled banks. Two \nother penalties were received from companies for originating funds \ntransfers to Libyan-owned or -controlled banks. Two corporations paid \npenalties for export violations. Twenty-two additional penalties were \npaid by U.S. citizens engaging in Libyan oilfield-related transactions \nwhile another 54 cases of similar violations are in active penalty \nprocessing.\n  Various enforcement actions carried over from previous reporting \nperiods have continued to be aggressively pursued. The FAC has \ncontinued its efforts under the ``Operation Roadblock'' initiative. \nThis ongoing program seeks to identify U.S. persons who travel to and/\nor work in Libya in violation of U.S. law.\n  Several new investigations of potentially significant violations of \nthe Libyan sanctions have been initiated by FAC and cooperating U.S. \nlaw enforcement agencies, primarily the U.S. Customs Service. Many of \nthese cases are believed to involve complex conspiracies to circumvent \nthe various prohibitions of the Libyan sanctions, as well as the \nutilization of international diversionary shipping routes to and from \nLibya. The FAC has continued to work closely with the Departments of \nState and Justice to identify U.S. persons who enter into contracts or \nagreements with the Government of Libya, or other third-country \nparties, to lobby United States Government officials or to engage in \npublic relations work on behalf of the Government of Libya without FAC \nauthorization. In addition, during the period FAC attended several \nbilateral and multilateral meetings with foreign sanctions authorities, \nas well as with private foreign institutions, to consult on issues of \nmutual interest and to encourage strict adherence to the U.N.-mandated \nsanctions.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from January 7 through July 6, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the Libyan national emergency are estimated at \napproximately $830,000.00.

The policies and actions of the Government of Libya continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States. In adopting UNSCR 883 in November \n1993, the Security Council determined that the continued failure of the \nGovernment of Libya to demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation \nof terrorism, and in particular its continued failure to respond fully \nand effectively to the requests and decisions of the Security Council \nin UNSCRs 731 and 748, concerning the bombing of the Pan Am 103 and UTA \n772 flights, constituted a threat to international peace and security. \nThe United States continues to believe that still stronger \ninternational measures than those mandated by UNSCR 883, possibly \nincluding a worldwide oil embargo, should be imposed if Libya continues \nto defy the will of the international community as expressed in UNSCR \n731. We remain determined to ensure that the perpetrators of the \nterrorist acts against Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 are brought to justice. \nThe families of the victims in the murderous Lockerbie bombing and \nother acts of Libyan terrorism deserve nothing less. I shall continue \nto exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions \nagainst Libya fully and effectively, so long as those measures are \nappropriate, and will continue to report periodically to the Congress \non significant developments as required by law.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nassure fairness and choice to patients under the Medicare Program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the medicare health care quality act of 1995\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nMedicare Health Care Quality Act of 1995 today to make certain that \nMedicare beneficiaries are protected and receive access to high-quality \ncare when they enroll in health plans offered through the Medicare \nProgram.\n  I am deeply concerned about the extreme cuts in the Medicare Program \nthat would be necessitated by the recently adopted budget resolution. A \ncareful examination of the program clearly shows that the increasing \nnumbers of elderly, disabled, and end-stage-renal disease patients--\nchanging demographics--and overall health care inflation account for \nmost of the increased growth in spending. According to projections \nbased on CBO numbers, the cuts contained in the Republican budget \nresolution will not allow the Medicare Program to even keep pace with \nthe private sector on a per person basis. And the Medicare Program \ntakes care of many of our society's sickest and frailest members.\n  We have heard a lot recently about Republican proposals to \nrestructure Medicare by giving seniors a voucher and allowing them to \npurchase health coverage in the private market. This legislation would \nensure that plans participating in such a program would be required to \nmeet minimum standards of performance, and that access to needed care, \nand quality of that care are assured. Many health plans already meet \nthe standards I have included in this legislation, but for those that \ndo not, this legislation will provide a critical safety net for \npatients.\n  If a voucher system is created, it is likely that constraints on the \namount of the voucher will force many seniors to choose managed care \nplans, as their most affordable alternative. Currently abut 3 million \nMedicare beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans through the \nMedicare Program. Most of these patients are satisfied with the care \nthey receive. A significant fraction, however, primarily the frailest, \nthe sick and disabled, are not satisfied, according to a recent report \nby the office of the inspector general of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Serious problems identified with the program identified \nin this report included:\n\n       Compliance with Federal enrollment standards for health \n     screening and informing beneficiaries of their appeal rights \n     appeared to be problematic.\n       Perceived unmet service needs . . . led 22% of disenrollees \n     and\n      7% of enrollees to seek out-of-plan care''\n       Some beneficiaries reported having difficulty making \n     appointment for services in terms of the days waited for \n     scheduled appointments. . .\n       Some beneficiaries reported they were refused referrals to \n     specialists. . .\n\n  It is clear to me, however, when I look at the managed care plans in \nMinnesota, that managed care plans can provide access and quality in \nhealth care, while holding down the growth of costs. In a recent \neditorial on July 6, 1995, in the New England Journal of Medicine, the \neditor-in-chief, Dr. Jerome Kassirer stated:\n\n       Managed care itself is not the enemy. On the contrary, many \n     of its effects are salutary. Patients stay in the hospital \n     far fewer days, many surgical procedures that previously \n     required hospitalization are now safely performed in day \n     surgery, there is far more attention to preventive care, many \n     medical practices have been standardized to produce better \n     outcomes, and satisfying patients has become an explicit \n     goal. There is, however, remarkable diversity among managed-\n     care plans. Some, mostly older plans that were created when \n     cost containment was an unexpected benefit rather than their \n     central purpose, deliver high-quality care economically. \n     Unfortunately, others cut costs by recruiting the healthiest \n     patients, excluding the sickest, rationing care by making it \n     inconvenient to obtain, and denying care by a variety of \n     mechanisms.\n\n  The Medicare Health Care Quality Act of 1995 defines the standards \nthat must be met by any health plan, including managed care plans, if \nthey are to participate as a plan for Medicare patients. The major \nstandards would include those for:\n  Information to be provided to enrollees on plan coverage, benefits, \npatient satisfaction, and quality indicators to assist consumers in \nmaking informed purchasing decisions.\n  Utilization review activities, credentialing of health professionals, \nand handling of grievances by consumers and providers to assure that \nall are treated fairly by the health plan.\n  Provision of adequate access to care, including specialty and \nemergency care without penalizing consumers.\n  Fair marketing of health plans to Medicare beneficiaries to be \ncertain plans cannot selectively market, and enroll only the healthiest \npatients.\n  Mr. President, I have repeatedly stated that trying to restructure \nthe Medicare Program without addressing the bigger question of overall \nhealth system reform is foolish, and likely to worsen the situation in \nthe private sector. As Medicare cuts are put in place, providers will \nbe forced to shift charges to private sector payers, insurance rates \nwill rise, more people will be unable to afford coverage, and we will \nall end up paying more for our health care in the end. I believe that \nwe must tackle health care reform in this Congress. Until that happens, \nhowever, and as Medicare beneficiaries continue to join private sector \nhealth plans, including managed care plans, in increasing numbers, it \nis critical to be certain that adequate patient protections are in \nplace. The Medicare Health Care Quality Act of 1995 will go a long way \ntoward doing that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1024\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the exchange of certain federally \nowned lands and mineral interests therein, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n[[Page S 9806]]\n\n\n\n            the arkansas-oklahoma land exchange act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a piece \nof legislation that will begin a public process for a project of great \nimportance. This legislation would allow for the exchange of lands \nbetween the Weyerhaeuser Co., the Forest Service, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service. This land exchange could, in my view, achieve a \nnumber of worthy goals for the environment in my home State of Arkansas \nand for the State of Oklahoma. It is a bill that I have been working \non, and will continue to work on, with the advice and assistance of \nSenators Pryor, Nickles, and Inhofe, as well as Congressman Brewster of \nOklahoma and the entire Arkansas House delegation.\n  First, let me provide a bit of background on this exchange proposal. \nIn 1985, I learned that the Weyerhaeuser Co. had informed the Forest \nService that it had thousands of acres of land for sale in Arkansas. \nThese lands included undeveloped timberland adjacent to Lake Ouachita. \nAfter a meeting that I had with representatives of the Weyerhaeuser \nCo., they agreed to withhold the sale to allow me time to work through \nthe appropriations process and acquire environmentally significant \nlands through the land and water conservation fund for the Ouachita \nNational Forest.\n  The acquisition of lands inside the Lake Ouachita Management Area \npresents opportunities for more dispersed recreation, wildlife \nenhancement work, and protection of visual and water quality of the \nlake. These acquisitions began in 1989 and have continued up through \nthis year. As a result of these acquisitions, the Government has been \nable to acquire almost 40,000 acres of some of the best forest lands I \nhave seen. Since the acquisition program started, the bald eagle has \nbecome established on Lake Ouachita. In addition, habitat is provided \nfor the red-cockaded woodpecker, Southern lady slipper, and Arkansas \nfat mucket mussel. The area is popular for deer, turkey, and small game \nhunting.\n  While it would be nice to continue acquiring lands through the land \nand water conservation fund, that is just not a practical strategy. I \nknow that some of my constituents do not like the concept of a land \nexchange because it means some lands leave Federal ownership and, under \nthis proposal, would go to the Weyerhaeuser Co. However, reality is \nthat this Government has a budget deficit, and funds for land \nacquisition have been decreasing for several years. In fact, the money \nthat has been dedicated to land acquisition of the Weyerhaeuser \nproperty has fallen steadily since 1991. The decrease of funds has not \nresulted from my lack of interest in this area. It is due to the fact \nthat Federal dollars are scarce for the kind of environmental \nenhancement I would like to see. Therefore, I believe it is incumbent \nupon Congress, the Federal Government, land owners and interest groups \nto be creative about how we can reach mutual goals for conservation. I \nchallenged the Weyerhaeuser Co. to work with me in finding such an \nopportunity, and I believe they have taken a good step toward such an \neffort. I know Senator Nickles offered the same challenge. As a result, \nfor the past year, the Weyerhaeuser Co., the Forest Service and the \nFish and Wildlife Service have been working to determine if a mutually \nagreed upon land exchange proposal could be achieved. The bill today \nrepresents the result of that preliminary effort.\n  Pursuant to this legislation, the State of Arkansas would gain \napproximately 25,000 acres for a national wildlife refuge. This unique \nbottomland forest called Pond Creek is located in the floodplain \nbetween the Cossatot River and the Little River. It is extremely rich \nand diverse in wetland habitat for wading birds, resident and migratory \nwaterfowl, small mammals, deer, fish, alligators, and other wildlife. I \nunderstand that there are four bird rookeries there, used by herons, \negrets, and other birds. This land would become part of the Cossatot \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Arkansas would also benefit by acquiring lands that would complement \nLake Ouachita; the Little Missouri Wild and Scenic River; Flatside \nWilderness, and parts of the Ouachita National Forest. These \nacquisitions would enhance recreational opportunities for hiking, rock \nclimbing and mountain bicycling. It would protect watersheds, and help \nblock up ownership that is currently intermingled between the \nWeyerhaeuser Co. and the Forest Service. In the State of Arkansas, \napproximately 30,000 acres would be added to the Ouachita National \nForest.\n  In Oklahoma, the exchange would add more than 100,000 acres to the \nOuachita National Forest through the addition of lands around Lake \nBroken Bow. This lake is similar to Lake Ouachita--very beautiful, and \nworthy of protection. I will work closely with my colleagues in the \nSenate and House from Oklahoma to ensure that this legislation fits \nwith their goals for the area.\n  To summarize, through this exchange the Federal Government stands to \nreceive almost 160,000 acres of land that is currently owned by the \nWeyerhaeuser Co. I want to emphasize that I have personally viewed this \nproperty and believe it is worthy for consideration in this land \nexchange bill.\n  Of course, Weyerhaeuser will also receive something in this exchange \nthrough the acquisition of approximately 28,000 acres of the Tiak \ndistrict of the Ouachita National Forest in Oklahoma and approximately \n20,000 acres in Arkansas. This is land currently under timber \nmanagement, and would continue under timber management by the \nWeyerhaeuser Co. I have inquired into the company's forest practices \nand understand that these lands would be managed in conjunction with \nits recently adopted Forestry Resource Goals. These goals strengthen \nand reinforce the company's commitment to continue protecting water \nquality and fish habitat in carrying out forest management, providing \nhabitat for wildlife associated with managed forests, using \nscientifically based practices to protect soil stability and ensuring \nlong term soil productivity; and considering aesthetics in forest \npractices as they manage forestlands for sustainable production of wood \nand other forest products. I understand that the Weyerhaeuser practices \ngo beyond the guidelines of State Best Management Practices [BMP's], \nand that it has a good neighbor policy that calls for carefully \nconsidering the concerns of adjacent landowners and host communities.\n  There are several issues I would like to address. First, is the \nconcern that Weyerhaeuser is merely trading away cutover lands. I have \ntoured the exchange area and seen first hand the quality of lands that \nthe Forest Service has been receiving through the land and water \nconservation fund, as well as the lands that Weyerhaeuser would \ntransfer to the\n Government. These are some of the best forests I have seen, and they \ndeserve to be in Federal ownership.\n\n  Currently, the Arkansas Nature Conservancy has scientists conducting \nan ecological assessment of all of the Weyerhaeuser lands that would \ncome into Federal ownership. I am anxious to see the result of this \nwork, and it will be important for Congress to review this proposal as \nthe bill moves ahead. I plan to hold hearings on this very topic so \nthat we can all understand the environmental impact of the land \nexchange. While we know a great deal about the lands currently in \nFederal ownership that would go to Weyerhaeuser, this assessment will \nhelp us learn more information about the quality of lands owned by \nWeyerhaeuser that would go to the Ouachita National Forest for \nmanagement. I understand that preliminary data show that this land \nprovides habitat for a number of sensitive species and serves important \nwatersheds.\n  A question has arisen about whether this exchange would be a value-\nfor-value exchange. I can assure my colleagues that this exchange would \nbe a value-for-value exchange. I understand that the Forest Service, \nFish and Wildlife Service, and Weyerhaeuser Co., have contracted with \nan independent land appraiser to determine the values of the land and \nensure that land is traded on a value-for-value basis. That is, the \ntotal value of the land, timber and other economic resources that the \nFederal Government would give up will equal the total value that it \nreceives from Weyerhaeuser. Determining resource values will involve \nsurveys, land appraisals, timber cruises, mineral and \n\n[[Page S 9807]]\ngeologic assessments. As with any other business transaction, \nevaluations would be based on such items as recent comparable sales and \ncurrent market values. These will provide an economically sound basis \nfor discussion and negotiation--even for areas where the highest and \nbest land uses may be environmental, recreational, or aesthetic rather \nthan economic. I plan to be sure that the land values will be \nestablished precisely before this legislation is enacted.\n  Concerns have also been raised about whether or not hunting and \nfishing will be allowed in the Cossatot National Wildlife Refuge. I \nbelieve that as long as hunting and fishing can be conducted in a \nmanner that is compatible with sound wildlife management, then it makes \nsense to allow this and other forms of recreation.\n  One issue that I am committed to working on with my colleagues from \nOklahoma is an issue regarding the school districts in McCurtain \nCounty. I understand that under the current land exchange proposal, two \nschool districts--Haworth and Tom--would lose money they presently \nreceive under current allocations from the timber receipt payments. I \nknow these timber receipt payments are important to the operation of \nthese school districts and look forward to finding an equitable \nsolution to this situation.\n  Then there is the issue of minerals. Because of the acreage \nimbalance, the exchange would result in approximately 100,000 acres of \nWeyerhaeuser minerals being located under the lands to be conveyed to \nthe Federal Government. At my request, Weyerhaeuser Co. has met with \nthe Forest Service to come up with a recommendation that could be \nagreed to by all parties. The result of these discussions includes a \nproposal whereby Weyerhaeuser would trade all Forest Service mineral \nrights--approximately 50,000 acres--for an equivalent amount of acreage \nof Weyerhaeuser mineral rights when the surface is exchanged. The \nWeyerhaeuser hardrock minerals, which means all minerals except oil and \ngas, on all of the property Weyerhaeuser conveys to the Government, \nwould be conveyed at the time of the surface exchange. However, \nWeyerhaeuser will reserve oil and gas rights on the acres for 45 years. \nOwnership by Weyerhaeuser of all oil and gas rights within any section \ncontaining a producing oil or gas well would extend beyond 45 years for \nas long as production continued. Weyerhaeuser would also reserve a \nproportionally reduced 6.25 percent of 8/8's overriding royalty \ninterest in all oil and/or gas produced from any well located within \nthe eight governmental sections immediately surrounding any section in \nwhich well is producing as of December 31, 2041.\n  Finally, let me say Mr. President that this proposal has a great deal \nof support. It is supported in concept by the Forest Service and the \nFish and Wildlife Service. It has the support of the Arkansas Nature \nConservancy and the Oklahoma Wildlife Federation to name but a few. I \nwas particularly encouraged recently by the statement of the Department \nof Agriculture's Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, \nJames Lyons. When I asked him about the exchange in an Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee hearing, he said ``I think it is a good \nexchange for the taxpayers and for Weyerhaeuser, and certainly for the \nState of Arkansas''. I would encourage anyone who has concerns about \nthis proposal to contact Weyerhaeuser and the Forest Service and take \nthe time to tour the proposed lands for exchange. It was time well \nspend for me, and I would highly recommend it.\n  I would emphasize that I want to hear from my constituents about this \nproposal. I want to hear about what they like and what they don't like \nso that I can be sure that the public process we are beginning today \nwill benefit from their views.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nArkansas-Oklahoma Land Exchange Act of 1995. This \n\n[[Page S 9809]]\nlegislation represents several years of work on the part of the U.S. \nForest Service, the Weyerhaeuser Co., the Oklahoma and Arkansas \ncongressional delegations, State officials, and local communities. I \nfirmly believe that this land exchange will benefit not only timber \nresource management, but also wildlife habitat, tourism, recreation, \nand the economic vitality of the region.\n  During the course of negotiations, I strongly held that any exchange \nof lands would have to serve the best interests of Oklahoma citizens \nand the taxpayer. With this in mind, we crafted a proposal that would \nrepresent no cost to the Federal Government and that would allow for an \nequitable exchange of land and resources between the U.S. Forest \nService and the Weyerhaeuser Co.\n  Specifically, the public, through the U.S. Forest Service, will \nreceive 105,000 acres in southeast Oklahoma adjacent to Broken Bow Lake \nand near the McCurtain County Wilderness Area, the lower Mountain Fork \nRiver, and the Glover River. These acres will become part of the \nOuachita National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service will also receive \napproximately 28,000 acres located near Lake Ouachita in Arkansas and \nan additional 25,000 acres in Sevier County, AR, to become part of the \nCossatot National Wildlife Refuge.\n  In exchange, the Weyerhaeuser Co. will receive 28,000 acres of land \nlocated in the Tiak District of the Ouachita National Forest in \nMcCurtain County, OK. The Tiak District was hand planted in pine timber \nand has been managed commercially in large blocks by the U.S. Forest \nService for many years. In Arkansas, Weyerhaeuser will receive \napproximately 20,000 acres of scattered tracts located in Garland, \nYell, and Perry Counties.\n  I am committed to ensuring this proposal will not have an adverse \nimpact on school district funding in southeastern Oklahoma. I am \npresently working with State and local officials, as well as the U.S. \nForest Service and Weyerhaeuser, to guarantee an equitable and fair \ndistribution of Forest Service timber receipt payments to local school \ndistricts. We are progressing positively and will attempt to reach an \nagreement before the exchange of lands is authorized to proceed.\n  I have confidence in Weyerhaeuser's sound forest management practices \nand its commitment to replanting trees and protecting wildlife. I also \nhave confidence in the U.S. Forest Service's ability to manage the land \nsurrounding Broken Bow Lake as it\n becomes part of the Ouachita National Forest. I appreciate their \ncommitment to managing our natural resources for the benefit of all \ncitizens, including the development of tourism and recreation in the \narea.\n\n  The Arkansas-Oklahoma Land Exchange Act of 1995 has the support of \nthe Oklahoma Wildlife Federation, the Broken Bow Lake and Mountain Fork \nRiver Association, the Idabel Chamber of Commerce, the Broken Bow \nChamber of Commerce, and the McCurtain County Chapter of Wild Turkey \nFederation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Chafee, \n        and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1027. A bill to eliminate the quota and price support programs for \npeanuts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                          peanuts legislation\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, later this year Congress will be \nconsidering a new farm bill. This bill will guide our farm program into \nthe next century. As we look to the future, we must clean up outdated \nprograms of the past. Senator Bradley and I are introducing a bill to \neliminate the Federal peanut program.\n  The peanut program was established as part of the Agricultural \nAdjustment Act in 1938 when America was emerging from the Great \nDepression. Insuring a stable supply and price for agricultural \ncommodities, including peanuts, was of great importance during the \nunstable economic times that followed the Great Depression. Today, \nhowever, the peanut program drives up the price for consumers and \nrestricts the number of farmers that can take part in the program.\n  The peanut program was originally intended to stabilize prices for \nfarmers. Now, it has become a cartel. A small number of farmers own \nlicenses, issued by the USDA, that allow them to participate in the \nprogram. These licensed farmers are restricted by a set production \nquotas reminiscent of communist-era central planning. How does someone \nobtain an allotment under the quota to grow peanuts? The right to \nparticipate in the program can be inherited, purchased, or rented. In \nfact in 1991, 68 percent of the peanuts produced under the peanut \nprogram were produced by farmers\n who rented the right to grow peanuts under the Federal program from \nlicensed quota-owners. Those who rented collectively paid $208 million \nfor the privilege of using someone else's quota.\n\n  Farmers who do not own and are not able to rent a quota allotment are \nshut out of the peanut cartel. They cannot sell their peanuts on the \nU.S. free market. Unlicensed peanut farmers have only two options. They \ncan sell their peanuts on the international markets where they receive \nonly about half what quota-owners are assured through the Federal \nprogram. They also could sell their peanuts to the Federal Government \nfor one-fifth the price the quota-owners receive, which is below the \ncost to produce the peanuts.\n  While the peanut cartel benefits a small number of quota-owners, it \ngouges the American consumer. This program makes peanuts and peanut \nbutter more expensive to Americans. In a 1993 report, the General \nAccounting Office estimated that the current program cost the U.S. \npeanut consumer between $314-$513 million per year in higher prices.\n  The peanut program differs significantly from other commodity \nprograms. Commodity programs should provide a measure of stability to \nthe agriculture industry and insure an abundant supply of food at a \nreasonable price. The peanut program does not accomplish this goal. The \ncurrent peanut program prevents farmers who do not own or cannot rent a \nquota from selling on the U.S. market. The current program artificially \nraises the price of peanuts and peanut products to U.S. consumers.\n  Consumers do not benefit from the program. Most of the peanut growers \ndo not benefit from the program. The peanut program only benefits a \nsmall number of people who own a quota license.\n  This program is simply a bad program that needs to be eliminated. The \nagriculture industry has under gone a significant change since its \ninception. America and the American farmer have outgrown the peanut \nprogram.\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today, Senator Brown and I are \nintroducing legislation to end the Federal peanut program, a system of \nproduction quotas, price support loans and import restrictions which \nbenefit a privileged few at great cost to American taxpayers and \nconsumers.\n  You do not have to be a peanut farmer to take advantage of the peanut \nprogram. In fact, you do not have to be farmer at all. You just have to \nbe lucky enough to inherit--or rich enough to buy--a quota. Quota \nholders live all over the United States and in foreign countries as far \naway as Hong Kong and Great Britain.\n  The Federal peanut program has been in place since the 1930's. It \nplaces strict quotas on peanut production, which drive up the cost to \nconsumers by as much as $500 million a year, according to the American \nPeanut Product Manufacturers.\n  Farmers who wish to grow peanuts for human consumption in the United \nStates must own or lease a quota. And while quotas are assigned to \nparticular farms, they can be rented or sold to someone else within the \nsame county. \n\n[[Page S 9810]]\n\nThe GAO reports that 68 percent of all quota owners merely rent out \ntheir quotas to others. Even worse, fewer than 22 percent of all quota \nholders control 80 percent of the total U.S. peanut quota.\n  This program does nothing to help American farmers. It simply lines \nthe pockets of what amounts to a Park Avenue peanut cartel.\n  Additionally, the Government provides Federal price support loans of \n$678 per ton for peanuts grown within the quota limits, despite the \nfact that the world price for peanuts is only $350 per ton. If a farmer \ncannot sell his crop, he can forfeit it to the Government in return for \nthe Federal price support. These price supports will cost American \ntaxpayers $119 million in 1995.\n  This program turns market capitalism on its head. It forces consumers \nto pay twice as much for peanuts than they otherwise would pay. \nIronically, high peanut prices are shrinking the market for peanut \nproducts. At this rate, we're going to make peanut butter and jelly a \ndelicacy.\n  For the dynasty of peanut quota holders, this program is the greatest \nthing since sliced bread. But for everyone else, it is a shell game you \ncannot win. The peanut program does not need overhauling, it needs to \nend now.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR TEST \n                               EXPLOSIONS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 149\n\n       Whereas the President of France stated on June 13, 1995, \n     that the Republic of France plans to conduct 8 nuclear test \n     explosions over the next several months;\n       Whereas the United States, France, Russia, and Great \n     Britain have observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since \n     1992;\n       Whereas a resumption of testing by the Republic of France \n     could result in the disintegration of the current testing \n     moratorium and a renewal of underground testing by other \n     nuclear weapon states;\n       Whereas a resumption of nuclear testing raises serious \n     environmental and health concerns;\n       Whereas the United Nations Conference on Disarmament \n     presently is meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, for the purpose \n     of negotiating a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \n     (CTBT), which would halt permanently the practice of \n     conducting nuclear test explosions; and\n       Whereas the announcement by the President of France \n     severely undermines the efforts of the international \n     community to conclude a CTBT by 1996, a goal endorsed by 175 \n     nations, including France and the United States, at the \n     recently completed NPT Extension and Review Conference (the \n     conference for the extension and review of the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Republic of France should abide by the current international \n     moratorium on nuclear test explosions, refrain from \n     proceeding with its announced intention of conducting a \n     series of nuclear tests in advance of a Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty, and initiate preparations to close its \n     underground test sites at the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls.\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate regarding the Republic of France's \nintention to conduct a series of underground nuclear test explosions \ndespite the current international moratorium on nuclear testing.\n  On June 13, 1995, French President Jacques Chirac announced that the \nRepublic of France planned to resume nuclear testing in the South \nPacific. A series of eight underground tests are planned beginning \nSeptember, 1995 and ending in May, 1996 at the Mururoa and Fangataufa \natolls located in French Polynesia.\n  Following the French announcement, I contacted the White House to \nurge \n\n[[Page S 9811]]\n\nPresident Clinton to convey the concerns of the United States and the \nPacific island nations to France over its resumption of nuclear \ntesting. We in the Pacific, more than any other region in the world, \nknow the ramifications of nuclear testing. We only have to look at what \nhappened to Bikini, Enewetak, or Rongelap Atolls in the Marshall \nIslands to understand the long-term damage to human lives and the \nenvironment that can occur as a result of nuclear testing. I have \nvisited these atolls and I can attest to the plight of the native \npeoples in these areas. The U.S. nuclear testing between 1950 and 1960 \nresulted in epidemic-like outbreaks in these communities, including \ndamage to the nervous system, paralysis, impaired vision, and increased \nrates of cancer. Even a half century later, the effects are still being \nfelt. To this date, clean up efforts have been difficult and slow, and \nsome residents have not been able to return to their homelands.\n  In May, the world's five nuclear powers--the United States, France, \nRussia, China, and Britain--persuaded the rest of the world to \nindefinitely extend the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. To win that \nconsensus, the five countries promised to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty by the end of next year. The resumption of French nuclear \ntesting seriously undermines these international efforts to curb the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  We cannot ignore the resumption of nuclear testing by France. By \nadopting this resolution, the Senate will strongly encourage France to \nabide by the current international moratorium on nuclear testing and \nrefrain from proceeding with its announced intention of conducting a \nseries of nuclear tests in advance of a Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9810-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9811-S9817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n            THE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 1498\n\n  Mr. HATCH proposed an amendment to amendment No. 1487 proposed by Mr. \nDole to the bill (S. 343) to reform the regulatory process, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       Delete all of section 635 (page 61, line 1 through page 64, \n     line 14 and insert the following new section 635:\n\n     SECTION 635.

Mr. President, I do not ordinarily enter into the \nRecord speeches that are 6 years old, but I came across a speech given \nby James Perkins, the distinguished former president of Cornell, to the \nNassau Club in Princeton, NJ, on November 1, 1989.\n  It was titled ``Europe Views the Ivy League: With Astonishment and \nJealousy.''\n  Because it contains so many insights into where we are and how we got \nwhere we are, I think it is worth reprinting in the Congressional \nRecord, and I urge my colleague and their staffs to take the time to \nread it.\n  For example, he says: ``It is not uncommon for an Ivy League \nuniversity to have a public relations office of a dozen or more people \nand a development office of 50 and sometime as many as 70 full-time \npersons at work on maintaining accurate and up-to-date files on the \nfinancial prospects of its important alumni. These files would be the \nenvy of the CIA and the KGB.''\n  As a former Ivy League college president himself, he notes: ``that \nthe presidents of Ivy League institutions spent at least 25 percent of \ntheir professional time on the financial needs of their universities \nand personal attention to both individuals and institutions which can \nprovide financial resources to meet its needs.'' He finds a German \nobserver, ``reminded his audience that in Japan, it was the public \nuniversities that restricted their enrollment and so expansion was \ntaken care of by the proliferation of private institutions which had, \nof necessity, to live off their tuitions. \n\n[[Page S 9818]]\nThe result was the Ivy League experience in reverse. It is the \nuniversities of Tokyo and Kyoto that are the Harvards, Yales, and \nPrincetons of Japan. The best students apply to the prestigious public \ninstitutions while the privates have to fight to maintain anything like \nthe same quality of instruction. While in the United States 80 percent \nof undergraduates are in the public sector, in Japan almost 80 percent \nof students are in private institutions.''\n  Many of my colleagues will remember James Perkins as the person who \nheaded the Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies \nappointed by President Carter.\n  It was one of the finest commissions ever to serve this Nation, and \nno small part of the reason was the leadership of Jim Perkins.\n  I ask that the text of his 1989 speech be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n       Europe Views the Ivy League With Astonishment and Jealousy\n\n                         (By James A. Perkins)\n\n       European higher education is suffering from three \n     pressures. The first is new limits on public funds after \n     three or four decades of increasing financial support. \n     Consequently, there is a serious effort to secure funds from \n     private sources. In educational systems that have almost been \n     free of student charges, there has been the need to establish \n     tuitions or, in those cases where they exist in small \n     amounts, to increase them. These efforts have not been \n     successful and have often led students to take to the \n     streets. Support from wealthy individuals or corporations is \n     practically non-existent because most European societies see \n     business support as damaging to the intellectual integrity of \n     the university.\n       A second pressure comes from the increasing demand to \n     decentralize authority from the central government to regions \n     on the one hand and to the universities on the other. The \n     recognized need for flexibility and the capacity to innovate \n     requires plural rather than uniform arrangements. But the \n     legacy of Napoleon, who viewed higher education as a \n     centralized public function, required equal treatment through \n     a uniform curriculum which could only be installed and \n     managed by a central authority. Efforts to decentralize have \n     had extreme difficulties because local authorities have had \n     little experience in managing educational institutions and \n     the universities themselves do not have a system of \n     governance that assures effective autonomy.\n       The two exceptions to this general rule are Western \n     Germany, where the states preceded the establishment of the \n     central government (although they did not create it), and \n     Spain, where Catalonia and the Basque country have had a long \n     history of considerable independence from the central \n     government in Madrid. It is worthy of some note that the \n     education reform law of 1984 in Spain does, in fact, provide \n     for increased educational responsibility for the provinces, \n     which only a half dozen of them have been able to accept.\n       A third pressure for change involves the educational \n     consequences of the provision for a strong European community \n     to be established in 1992. There is the possibility of a \n     growing move towards something like the federal system in the \n     United States where the individual countries of Europe are \n     prepared to surrender some of their independence to community \n     authorities.\n       On all three counts, the search for private funds, the \n     decentralization of control from central governments and the \n     prospects for a European community with federal overtones--\n     all three of these pressures and prospects have led to \n     serious soul-searching on the part of European public \n     officials and educators. It is not surprising that their \n     attention would turn to the experience of the United States \n     which, in one way or another, has had to deal with \n     maintaining a decentralized system, a successful effort to \n     secure private funds for higher\n      education, and a federal system that has acquired a \n     reasonable balance between federal and local authorities, \n     along with a substantial private sector.\n       It could be that four distinguished European educators \n     decided to study one of the most successful examples of \n     private institutions in the context of a decentralized system \n     on the one hand and a network of connection between \n     universities (both public and private) on the other. The four \n     of them could have decided to make a special study of what we \n     know as the Ivy League. Here are eight private institutions \n     with the highest academic standards, with steady and high \n     demand for admission (in spite of high tuition rates), and \n     having secured what, to European eyes, seems like phenomenal \n     amounts of money, both as endowments under their own control \n     and annual gifts from all sources running into tens of \n     millions of dollars. The question these four educators might \n     have asked themselves was, ``how do they do it and what \n     lessons can we draw from their obvious success?'' They \n     visited the Ivy League universities, studied their governance \n     and academic programs and their financial arrangements in \n     considerable depth and reported on their findings to a large \n     gathering of their colleagues.\n       The first critique was by a Swedish social psychologist \n     from the University of Stockholm who reported somewhat as \n     follows. The current success of these 8 institutions finds \n     its roots in the origins of the country where 13 independent \n     colonies became the original states which, on their own \n     initiative, formed a federal government. The United States, \n     he reported, did not have to face the extreme difficulties of \n     decentralizing political power because political power \n     started out decentralized. And each colony was determined to \n     create institutions of higher education long before the \n     successful revolutionary war, the only exception being \n     Cornell which became a land grant university in the 1860s but \n     inherited the academic traditions of its colonial \n     predecessors.\n       A second historical fact of importance is, so he reported, \n     that early higher education had powerful religious sponsors \n     which, in turn, reflected the many sects of Protestantism as \n     well as the presence of a Catholic interest in higher \n     education. This diffuse religious background assured the \n     plurality of university design and purpose on the one hand \n     and gave the universities strong support in securing their \n     independence from governments, both federal and state. There \n     was, and is, no Church of England or Lutheran predominance as \n     in Scandinavia, nor Catholic monopoly as in the southern half \n     of Europe. Thus independence and differentiation soon led to \n     competition and provided some of the historical basis for the \n     flourishing of these private institutions.\n       Finally, because of their private initiation, they were \n     almost completely dependent upon the tuitions they charged \n     their students which was possible because only a very small \n     fraction of an age group had any interest in higher \n     education. The dependence on tuition meant that from the very \n     earliest days these institutions were sensitive to student \n     and family demand on the one hand and society's needs on the \n     other for a diversity\n      of trained citizenry with widely held democratic values. \n     This market orientation helped assure that individual \n     needs could have a priority over government prescription.\n       The Swedish educator ended his report by emphasizing that \n     in the United States the states came first and they, in turn, \n     supported the independence of the private college. Thus they \n     never experienced the agony faced by European universities \n     urging their government bureaucracies to let go some of their \n     power and to build up their regions and universities and the \n     capacity to exercise the responsibility that goes with \n     decentralized power.\n       His summary point was that not only did the states come \n     first but so did private universities supported almost \n     entirely with private funds. With this background the \n     development of the Ivy League institutions was almost a \n     natural consequence of the early political and social \n     arrangements of the United States.\n       The next reporter was a French professor from the \n     University of Paris. He said he accepted the report of his \n     Swedish friend and fully agreed that the processes by which \n     the United States developed from states to a federal system \n     and the fact that the private universities came first as a \n     natural consequences surely described the favorable soil \n     which nourished private institutions like the Ivy League. But \n     he went on to report that this independence is, in modern \n     times, secured by multiple sources of funds to carry on the \n     work of these institutions. The early dependence on tuitions \n     has already been noted, but today, they represent only a part \n     of the needed income. Having carefully excluded government in \n     early days, government has not been welcomed back as an \n     important and, indeed, a decisive source of funds for the \n     research enterprise that has given the university its \n     substantial position in society. Tuitions continue to rise, \n     but, in a concern for equal treatment and social justice, \n     they are offset by the availability of scholarships, loans, \n     and campus jobs that have kept these institutions from \n     becoming intolerably elite. They are elite, but only in a \n     meritocratic sense, and not in a social or economic sense.\n       A second source of funds has been gifts from various \n     sources such as corporations, individuals, and particularly \n     alumni of the various institutions involved. Private \n     universities have relied on gifts for many years but now, it \n     is astonishing to report, public universities are beginning \n     to receive large sums of private money also. He said that it \n     seemed to be deep in the American culture that people of \n     wealth should give to charities, their churches, and their \n     educational institutions. Some of the wealthiest donors to \n     higher education, like Andrew Carnegie and John Rockefeller, \n     really believed that a wealthy man had almost a religious \n     duty to use his wealth for the good of society. It was as if \n     they wished to atone for any sins that might have been \n     committed in the acquisition of their wealth.\n       As has been mentioned, the third source of funds from \n     government falls into two categories. State governments have \n     been an almost negligible factor in the financing of Ivy \n     League\n      institutions. Once again, he mentioned that Cornell \n     University is something of an exception because the State \n     of New York finances four of its colleges by contracts \n     that provide both its capital and its ongoing expenses. He \n     also found it interesting that many States had now adopted \n     a plan to provide public funds to its private institutions \n     on a formula basis. This means they provide a specified \n     amount of funds based upon the number of recent bachelor's \n     and doctor's degrees granted by the institution in the \n     previous year. This process effectively neutralizes the \n     prospect of undue interference coming along with state \n     money.\n\n[[Page S 9819]]\n\n       With respect to the federal government, the Ivy League \n     institutions receive funds based on the programs they pursue \n     that are of interest to the federal government. Thus, \n     scientific research, undergraduate scholarships, and \n     occasional fellowship programs come to these universities not \n     based upon a judgment of the university as such but rather \n     the value of the programs they pursue as part of the federal \n     interest. It was not many years ago, he reported, that there \n     was a large debate in the United States as to whether federal \n     money should go directly to the institutions. However, this \n     view did not prevail because it was felt that it would \n     interfere with state responsibility on the one hand and the \n     independence of the universities, both public and private, on \n     the other.\n       Finally, he reported, that in the last 40 years there had \n     been an astonishing increase in support of private \n     universities in general and the Ivy League in particular from \n     business corporations. In 1988 higher education had received \n     over $2 billion of funds with a substantial fraction of this \n     money paid to private universities in general and to the Ivy \n     League in particular. He reported that universities had been \n     able to receive this money, just as they had from government, \n     through a process that effectively protected their \n     independence from having the business interests exercise \n     undue influence over its teaching programs. He stated, \n     however, that in the area of research there was large debate \n     in process in the United States as to whether the desire to \n     acquire business corporations as partners in various research \n     enterprises was not raising danger flags on the integrity of \n     the research enterprise, compromising the primary university \n     preoccupation with basic research, and forcing an imbalance \n     in curricular interests in favor of the more short-run \n     interests of profit-oriented commercial enterprises. He \n     thought that this debate should be followed with interest by \n     the European countries that were looking to business as a \n     source of replacement funds for reduced government \n     expenditures.\n       His main point was that these four sources of financial \n     support--tuitions, gifts, government, and business--not only \n     were important in themselves but, together, they helped \n     assure the independence of the university by balancing both \n     the funds and their interests in a way that would insure both \n     the development and the independence of their institutions.\n       The next critique was presented by a Professor of the \n     School of Architecture at the University of Rome. She said \n     that she\n      fully supported the presentations of her two colleagues that \n     the educational quality and institutional success of the \n     Ivy League schools had to be traced to their colonial \n     origins and the current success in arranging for financial \n     support from multiple sources. However, she said that to \n     these two primary factors must be added the skillful \n     development of institutional loyalty on the part of alumni \n     and friends--especially alumni. Looking at the U.S. scene \n     from Europe, the strong, emotional attachment and loyalty \n     to their universities on the part of their graduates is a \n     distinctive feature of the higher educational scene. Among \n     all the institutions, it is the private ones which have \n     been, of necessity, most successful since private \n     contributions are a decisive part of their total income. \n     And of private institutions, perhaps the Ivy League has \n     developed the process of securing alumni support to the \n     highest level of both art and governance.\n       She pointed out that this highly developed institutional \n     loyalty has produced a continuing influx of funds for \n     operating expenses, for capital buildings, and endowments. \n     But this financial support has not come by chance. She was \n     astonished to find that the development of institutional \n     loyalty started soon after a student's original entry. Even \n     the student newspapers carry reports of the latest \n     benefactions. They also were likely to headline the \n     achievements of its more distinguished, or at least more \n     visible, alumni. Their football teams, whether they won or \n     lost, receive continuous and vocal support from the \n     university's alumni. And all of this adds to the central \n     notions of pride in the university and encourages their \n     interest to assure their university's financial health.\n       But all this requires hard and careful work by \n     professionals to make sure that the university's activities \n     continually appear in the press and on television. At the \n     same time, every effort is made to encourage alumni to return \n     to the campus, not only for athletic events, but also for \n     lectures and public events of interest to alumni.\n       To assure the success of this activity, the university has \n     a very substantial office concerned with constructive public \n     relations on the one hand and having an up-to-date knowledge \n     about the potential of key individuals for making financial \n     contributions to the university. It is not uncommon for an \n     Ivy League university to have a public relations office of a \n     dozen or more people and a development office of 50 and \n     sometimes as many as 70 full-time persons at work on \n     maintaining accurate and up-to-date files on the financial \n     prospects of its important alumni. These files would be the \n     envy of the CIA and the KGB. Furthermore, these development \n     offices work closely with university management and faculty \n     leadership to see that these key individuals become members \n     of important departmental advisory committees, leading \n     members of the alumni council, and are promoted to membership \n     on boards of trustees. She found that the presidents of Ivy \n     League institutions spent at least 25% of their professional \n     time on the financial needs of their universities and \n     personal attention to both individuals and institutions which \n     can provide financial resources to meet its needs.\n       In summary, she said, the business of raising money for \n     private institutions, like the members of the Ivy League, is \n     a big business, requiring many professionals, very hard work, \n     and careful attention to matching needs and sources of funds \n     over a long period of time. She could not fail to mention to \n     her European colleagues, who may believe that securing \n     private support was merely a matter of just asking for it, \n     that it required considerable attention and substantial \n     offices over a long period of time.\n       The fourth and final rapporteur was the German Director for \n     Higher Education in the Ministry of Education and Science. \n     He, also, reported on the importance of early history, \n     multiple financial sources, and the sophisticated fundraising \n     efforts of the Ivy League universities as decisive factors in \n     their current success.\n       But he was astonished to discover how little the Ivy League \n     institutions themselves recognized the role of public bodies \n     in assuring this success. He reminded his audience that it \n     was the privilege of the Ivy League schools to remain both \n     selective and relatively small in their admissions which made \n     it possible for them to concentrate on the quality of their \n     education and research. He pointed out that in the great \n     expansion of higher education in recent decades it was public \n     institutions which took in almost 80% of this explosive \n     demand for higher education. Without this expansion of pubic \n     universities, the pressure on the Ivy League schools to \n     double or even quadruple their numbers would have been \n     irresistible. They would either have to have become much \n     larger or there would have to have been 3 or 4 times as many, \n     which could not possibly be of the same quality.\n       Diverting from the European scene for a moment, he reminded \n     his audience that in Japan, it was the public universities \n     that restricted their enrollment and so expansion was taken \n     care of by the proliferation of private institutions which \n     had, of necessity, to live off their tuitions. The result was \n     the Ivy League experience in reverse. It is the universities \n     of Tokyo and Kyoto that are the Harvards, Yales, and \n     Princetons of Japan. The best students apply to the \n     prestigious public institutions while the privates have to \n     fight to maintain anything like the same quality of \n     institution. While in the United States 80% of undergraduates \n     are in the pubic sector, in Japan almost 80% of students are \n     in private institutions\n       The German rapporteur ended by repeating that, in his \n     judgment, the administrations and faculties of the Ivy League \n     should recognize that Harvard must be grateful to the \n     University of Massachusetts, Yale to the University of \n     Connecticut, and Princeton to the public universities of \n     Rutgers, Trenton State, and Mercer County Community College. \n     They should view these institutions as their unsung friends, \n     making it possible for them to be universities with world \n     reputations for high quality and institutional success.\n       The final European report was by the former Vice Chancellor \n     of Sussex University in England. He said it was his \n     assignment\n      to bring the discussion out of the euphoric clouds of \n     astonishment and jealousy. In other words, he, speaking \n     for the group, felt they should record some concerns they \n     had about the future of the Ivy League universities.\n       They had been very successful in being able to continuously \n     raise tuitions to meet their rising costs. But now these \n     increases were going up faster than inflation and faster than \n     the increase in personal incomes. They had already heard \n     rumblings of discontent on the part of many who felt they \n     could not afford these higher costs which available \n     scholarship funds, particularly for middle income groups, \n     could not fully compensate. They believed the time is not far \n     off when there would be a strong reaction to these increases \n     which would certainly come with any serious recession. In \n     short, the golden age of the Ivy League may be here and now \n     but perhaps not forever.\n       A second concern was the widely understood knowledge of the \n     great wealth of these institutions with endowments, in some \n     cases, of well over $1 billion and annual gifts in excess of \n     $30 million a year. As the view persists and expands that the \n     Ivy League universities are extremely well off, it will \n     become more difficult to secure support in the face of the \n     rising concerns of drug abuse, the deteriorating environment, \n     and the obvious need to refurbish the physical infrastructure \n     of the nation.\n       A third concern that must be on the list of these \n     institutions is the rising quality of both instruction and \n     research at the public universities and their recent \n     successful efforts to raise private funds. Indeed, he \n     reported, two of the five wealthiest educational systems, in \n     terms of endowment, were public--Texas and California. And \n     reports of large and successful endowment drives and annual \n     fundraising on the part of the large public universities had \n     become commonplace in the press. The private universities are \n     obviously uneasy at the successful invasion of the private \n     sector by the public universities. But they have no easy \n     reply to the counter-complaint that public funds, both \n     federal and now state, are finding their way into the private \n     institutions.\n\n[[Page S 9820]]\n\n       To top off this report on the fragility of success, the \n     Englishman said that perhaps the biggest difficulty he and \n     his colleagues saw in the Ivy League was a tendency towards \n     complacency. They felt they ``had it made'' and deserved \n     support just because they were who they were. He was \n     sensitive to this matter because he felt that some of the \n     difficulties of Oxford and Cambridge in his own country was \n     traceable to their belief that they had a right to public \n     support which it was the government's duty to make good.\n       However, he concluded by saying that, as Europeans, they \n     were jealous of Ivy League success, astonished at the way it \n     was accomplished, but far from clear as to how far the U.S. \n     experience could be transferred to Europe. He thought it was \n     impossible to believe that anything like the Ivy League could \n     be reproduced in Europe. The heavy hand of the Napoleonic \n     belief that the university was a public utility, the faculty \n     appropriately civil servants, and the chief administrators \n     who reigned but did not rule would preclude any similar \n     development. Their higher education would remain public, but \n     he did see the real possibility that there would be an \n     increase in private support of these public institutions and \n     a closer relationship between them and the private sector \n     that would take the form of tuitions providing a larger \n     fraction of income and the business community a larger \n     fraction of research as well as of general costs. On this \n     last score, the hard work of the Ivy League universities over \n     decades of time was a lesson that all European universities \n     could well take to heart.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9817-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       FLY AND PROTECT OLD GLORY\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, Congress is again considering a \nconstitutional amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of our \nflag. As always, I stand firm in my belief that this amendment is both \na necessity and a salute to our country.\n  As our national symbol, the U.S. flag deserves to be honored and \nprotected. Freedom of speech is one of the most cherished and defended \nrights of the American people; however, desecration of our flag goes \nbeyond the premise of free speech.\n  As the time nears for this issue to once again come before Congress, \na strong division of opinion remains. Constitutional scholars and \neditorialists have weighed in on both sides of this debate with some \nvery thoughtful columns. One insightful article, in particular, was \nwritten by Mike O'Callaghan, a former two-term Governor of Nevada and \nthe current executive editor of the Las Vegas Sun. I ask that this \narticle be printed in the Record, and I encourage my colleagues to \nconsider the interesting points raised in this column.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       Fly and Protect Old Glory\n\n                         (By Mike O'Callaghan)\n\n       Today is Flag Day and time to honor Old Glory. Few, if any, \n     Americans will dispute the honor we bestow upon our symbol of \n     national unity today or any other day. There has been some \n     strong disagreement about amending the U.S. Constitution to \n     give Congress and the states power to make unlawful the \n     physical desecration of our flag.\n       There is nothing wrong with disagreeing with any attempt to \n     amend the document which spells out the strengths of our \n     nation. The Constitution was written so it can be amended \n     from time to time. Before it is amended, there should be long \n     discussions about the content of any amendment before it is \n     approved by Congress and/or the state legislatures. Those who \n     argue against this latest suggested amendment are no less \n     patriotic than are those who believe the amendment is a \n     necessity.\n       Many people believe that this proposed amendment isn't \n     necessary. I must agree with them to a point, but they must \n     recognize that our own Supreme Court has made it necessary. \n     Twice the justices have ruled that neither the states nor \n     Congress has the power to make flag desecration illegal. Now \n     that they have told Americans that such flag-protection laws \n     are unconstitutional, the next move for many flag-loving \n     Americans is to amend the Constitution. This is a very \n     American response to what they believe is an illogical \n     Supreme Court ruling.\n       The American Legion has taken the forefront in pushing for \n     a ban on flag desecration. The American Civil Liberties Union \n     has taken the opposite point of view because that \n     organization views such an amendment as weakening the First \n     Amendment's protection of free speech.\n       The ACLU isn't the only group that has taken a stand \n     against the proposed amendment. Assistant Attorney General \n     Walter Dellinger, speaking for the Clinton administration, \n     warned that the amendment will ``create legislative power of \n     uncertain dimensions to\n      override the First Amendment and other constitutional \n     guarantees.'' Also, Sen. Ted Kennedy sees it as a \n     ``troubling and unprecedented effort to politicize the \n     Constitution.''\n       In addition to Dellinger, Kennedy and the ACLU, the Los \n     Angeles Times refers to the proposed amendment as one we \n     don't need. The Times editorial writer asks, ``But should \n     such contemptible disrespect be seen as imperiling the basic \n     fabric of American life? Are we as a people so insecure in \n     our love of country and esteem for its institutions that we \n     let the childish behavior of a few justify the profoundly \n     serious and worrying step of eroding one of the \n     Constitution's most noble and vital protections?''\n       I find it necessary to disagree with the ACLU, the Clinton \n     administration, Sen. Kennedy and the Los Angeles Times. This \n     won't be the first or last time that I have or will disagree \n     with this distinguished group of intellectuals. As for \n     politicizing the Constitution, I can only shake my head in \n     disbelief after reading Kennedy's worry about amending the \n     Constitution. The entire amending process is a series of \n     political actions provided for by the instrument being \n     amended.\n       As I have written before, I'm more than a little insulted \n     by the inane argument that such a constitutional change will \n     be an infringement on our right of free speech. That \n     argument,\n      made by many who oppose an amendment to protect the flag, \n     has little or nothing to do with damaging the First \n     Amendment. A person can write and talk all day long and \n     into the night about the shortcomings of our city, state \n     and nation. That same person, if angry enough, can \n     renounce his or her citizenship without being worried \n     about being jailed. Millions of Americans believe public \n     desecration of our nation's symbol is taking it one step \n     beyond acceptable behavior and is an act beyond the bounds \n     of free speech.\n       Today is Flag Day. Let's honor Old Glory and do our best to \n     protect her from desecration by supporting an amendment to \n     the Constitution. And let's not forget the words of my Navajo \n     friend Thomas Begay who watched our flag unfurl over Mt. \n     Surabachi on Iwo Jima 50 years ago. Recently, he wrote me and \n     said, ``Passage of this amendment is but one small step \n     toward restoring some accountability for one's actions. \n     Responsibility for one's actions is part of being a citizen \n     of this country. Responsibility, values, a sense of what's \n     right and wrong are taught at a very early age here on the \n     Navajo reservation. These values come from the family and are \n     reinforced in our school. Respect for the flag is one of the \n     basics that every Navajo child is taught before they even \n     start school. Our nation as a whole could still learn a lot \n     from its Native American population.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9820-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            SPECIAL OLYMPICS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have all looked with awe and \nadmiration toward the playing fields of Connecticut and the largest \nsporting event in world this year--the Special Olympics World Games.\n  We all know that this singular event is the product of a visionary \nmind and an energetic spirit, both in the person of Eunice Kennedy \nShriver. It was she who dreamed the dream and did the hard work \nnecessary to make that dream come true. Thousands are now involved, but \nit was Eunice Shriver who made Special Olympics a vital, reliable part \nof lives that otherwise would have lacked focus and achievement.\n  People from my State have come east to participate, and today I rise \nto honor Larenson Henderson and the basketball players of Team New \nMexico from Shiprock. This is an all-Navajo team, Mr. President, the \nfirst completely American Indian team in any sport in the history of \nthe Special Olympics.\n  The New York Times had a story on this outstanding group of young \nmen, and quoted their coach as saying, `` `They have heart,' '' and \nindeed they do. Heart is the tie that binds all Special Olympic \nathletes, and it is the driving force behind the Games themselves.\n  We've seen wonderful things happen in New Haven during these Special \nOlympics, but perhaps the best is yet to come. One of the Navajo \nplayers said, ``Losing these games doesn't bother me. We're playing \nwith the best teams. It gives us more confidence just playing them.''\n  Mr. President, I'd say it makes us all proud that this excellent \nprogram has produced such an attitude through an atmosphere of healthy \ncompetition guided by the simple creed of doing one's best. Eunice \nShriver and all associated with this fine effort deserve our warmest \nthanks and praise for helping these athletes win by simply giving them \nthe means to try.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9820-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9820-S9821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, President \nClinton announced his decision to fully normalize relations with \nVietnam. I rise today to offer my strong support for this initiative.\n  I believe it is time for the United States to close the final chapter \non a \n\n[[Page S 9821]]\nsad history with Vietnam, and open a new chapter with the optimism that \na mutually beneficial relationship is now warranted, appropriate, and \npossible.\n  Mr. President, last year in response to Vietnam's heightened efforts \nto help account for the American servicemen lost in the war in \nSoutheast Asia, President Clinton ended our economic embargo of \nVietnam. At that time, many argued that ending the embargo would halt \nVietnam's efforts to help us locate these men.\n  In fact, Mr. President, just the opposite has occurred, and Vietnam \nhas actually strengthened its efforts to resolve POW/MIA cases.\n  By normalizing relations with Vietnam, we will continue on this path \nof mutual participation and strong efforts to account for these men, \nand increase our access to evidence in Vietnam.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars, which represents over 600,000 Vietnam \nveterans, now supports normalizing relations with Vietnam. They are \noptimistic that normalizing relations will in fact further progress on \naccounting for POW/MIAs in Southeast Asia.\n  A senior-level Presidential delegation, including Assistant Secretary \nof State Winston Lord and Deputy Secretary for Veterans Affairs Hershel \nGober, visited Vietnam in May to review the four categories the \nPresident laid out for examining progress on the POW/MIA issue; their \nfindings were highly reassuring.\n  The Vietnamese government provided them with valuable new \ninformation, including analyses, maps, and witness data, that will help \nin reaching the fullest possible accounting of POWs and MIAs.\n  Mr. President, we made a commitment to the Vietnamese government. The \nBush administration laid out specific goals that the Vietnamese would \nhave to meet as conditions for normalization, and the Vietnamese have \nworked diligently to meet them. We should keep our commitment.\n  A sad truth of war is that many who courageously fought and gave \ntheir lives for the sake of freedom will never be located. The \ndistinguished Senators from Arizona and Massachusetts, who have \nprovided outstanding leadership on this issue, have pointed out that \nefforts to account for MIAs in Vietnam have been far more extensive \nthan similar efforts after any previous war:\n  They emphasize that of the approximately 2,000 Americans who remain \ntechnically classified as missing-in-action, only 55 cases still hold \nserious questions, and all of these cases have been investigated at \nleast once.\n  Mr. President, we must remember that there are over 8,000 remaining \nMIA cases from the Korean war and 78,000 from World War II, as noted by \nthe Wall Street Journal. And the Vietnamese, who have made great \nstrides in accounting for our MIAs, must live with the knowledge that \n300,000 of their own people remain unaccounted for, according to the \nVietnam Veterans for Reconciliation, a group of veterans who, although \nnow involved in an array of fields from law to public policy, volunteer \ntheir time to try and resolve MIA cases.\n  All United States military personnel who have been involved in \nefforts with Vietnam to account for MIAs and POWs, including General \nJohn Vessey, who has led these\n efforts, state unequivocally that Vietnam's cooperation has been \nextensive.\n\n  Of course, the families and loved ones of the missing deserve our \nstrongest efforts to know what happened to these brave Americans. But I \nbelieve that, at this point in time, 22 years after the United States \nwithdrew from Vietnam, to normalize relations will be the best way to \nreach whatever closure to these cases is realistically possible.\n  Mr. President, normalizing relations with Vietnam will not only \nfurther our interests in accounting for our missing servicemen, it will \nserve other important United States interests in the region as well, \nparticularly by advancing U.S. commercial interests in Asia.\n  The Pacific Rim holds 60 percent of the world's population today. It \nis the fastest growing trade area of the world, with many strong and \ndynamic economies. The Vietnamese economy has been growing at a rate of \n8 percent a year and foreign investment in this nation has been rapidly \nincreasing, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n  Just last month, the European Union announced an expansive economic \nagreement with Vietnam, including providing Vietnam with most-favored-\nnation status. This agreement will give the EU a substantial edge in \ntrading in one of the world's fastest growing markets. And the EU is \nnot alone: a total of 160 countries, including all of our major trading \npartners, enjoy full diplomatic relations with Vietnam.\n  With a population of over 70 million and enormous economic potential, \nVietnam could become a major market for American services and products. \nAlready, dozens of major United States companies are establishing a \npresence in Vietnam. But until now, they have been unable to reach \ntheir full potential.\n  Some of the companies involved in setting up ventures in Vietnam are \nCaterpillar, Inc., Proctor and Gamble, Boeing, Eastman Kodak, IBM, \nLockheed Martin, and McDonnell Douglas. And the list goes on and on: \nCitibank, Nike, General Electric. In fact, over 100 companies belong to \nthe Coalition for U.S.-Vietnam Trade, which endorses fully normalized \nrelations. These companies are awaiting the opportunity to invest in \nVietnam's dynamic economy.\n  Mr. President, for Americans, these opportunities mean more jobs at \nhome. One of the great benefits of this new chapter in United States-\nVietnamese relations will be that ordinary Americans will benefit \neconomically from the trade that will result.\n  There is an additional benefit that will flow from fully normalized \nrelations with Vietnam. Greater contacts and expanded trade will put \nthe United States in a better position to encourage respect for human \nrights and democracy in Vietnam. Increased cooperation and contact will \nlead to a more active exchange of ideas.\n  As we saw with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, when the barriers \nbegan to come down, Western ideas about democracy and freedom soon took \nhold. So too, with Vietnam: as the American and Vietnamese peoples come \ninto greater contact with each other, the people of Vietnam will \nbenefit by enjoying greater democratization.\n  Mr. President, today is a day of hope and optimism for the United \nStates and Vietnam. Today, we put the tragedies of the past behind us \nand begin to work together to build a better relationship. Our \nchildren, and the children of Vietnam, will have a brighter future \nbecause of this decision. I commend President Clinton for taking this \nbold step.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9820-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9821-S9823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        DRUG THERAPY IN PRISONS\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently the New York Times had a \nseries of three articles on addiction.\n  The second of the three articles titled ``Drug Therapy: Powerful Tool \nReaching Few Inside Prisons'' tells a tragic story of our failure to \nprovide drug treatment for those in our prisons.\n  Those who serve on the Labor and Human Resources Committee with me \nknow of my discouragement over our failure to pay more attention to \ndrug treatment.\n  About a year ago, I visited Cook County Jail in Chicago, and in the \nprocess of going around a minimum security area where there were \nperhaps 40 men on cots in a large room similar to my old Army basic \ntraining barracks, I asked one of them what he would like to see to \ngive him a better chance for the future. He told me he would like to \nget into the drug treatment program.\n  I turned to the jail official taking me around and asked why he could \nnot. I was told they had 9,000 prisoners and places for only 200 in the \ndrug treatment program. I asked for a show of hands among the other men \nin the dormitory who would like to get into drug treatment, and 25 or \n30 raised their hands. Our failure to provide that opportunity for \nthese men is as short-sighted as anything I can imagine.\n  As Mr. Treaster points out in his story: ``Only a fraction of \ninmates--about 2 percent--undergo the kind of serious rehabilitation \nthat can change destructive behaviors that have been congealing for a \nlifetime.''\n  The article also accurately points out: ``Drug treatment is a glacial \nprocess. Powerful changes can occur, but they take months, not days.''\n  Many of the drug treatments are being cut back in time and, as a \nresult, being cut back in effectiveness. \n\n[[Page S 9822]]\n\n  We should be listening to the practical words of experience that come \nforward from Joseph Treaster's article.\n  I ask that his article be printed in the Record and urge my \ncolleagues and their staffs to read the article.\n  The article follows:\n        Drug Therapy: Powerful Tool Reaching Few Inside Prisons\n\n                        (By Joseph B. Treaster)\n\n       On a summer night as sweet and soft as any he had ever \n     known, Pierre Mathurin and another young man pulled to the \n     curb in a quiet section of Queens, snorted a couple of lines \n     of cocaine and set out down the sidewalk. They had spotted a \n     man and a woman strolling alone, and now they were going \n     after them, Mr. Mathurin's fingers tightening on a chrome-\n     plated .25-caliber pistol.\n       It was just a week shy of Mr. Mathurin's 20th birthday, and \n     his career as a drug dealer and armed robber was gathering \n     momentum nicely. But that evening did not go as expected. The \n     woman screamed, and Mr. Mathurin, fleeing with a wallet and a \n     gold chain, was chased down by neighbors with baseball bats, \n     turned over to the police and eventually sent to a prison \n     drug treatment program that transformed his life.\n       Now, more than four years later, Mr. Mathurin says he is a \n     retired criminal and recovering cocaine addict, earning a \n     living as a barber and a partner in a video shop, paying \n     taxes and finding it hard to visualize the frightening \n     predator who stalked the streets in his skin. An energetic \n     fireplug of a man who has traded the excitement of the \n     streets for the dreams of a budding entrepreneur, Mr. \n     Mathurin seems to be living proof that drug treatment, long \n     viewed by skeptics as just so much touchy-feely hokum, can \n     have a powerful impact on the lives of those who sustain the \n     drug culture.\n       With more than one million Americans now behind bars and up \n     to 80 percent of them involved with powerful drugs like \n     cocaine and heroin, rehabilitation programs, at their best, \n     offer a potent weapon for decreasing addiction, crime and the \n     spiraling costs of incarceration.\n       Yet only about one in six inmates receives any kind of \n     treatment, and much of it amounts to little more than ``just \n     say no'' admonishments. Only a fraction of inmates--about 2 \n     percent--undergo the kind of serious rehabilitation that can \n     change destructive behaviors that have been congealing for a \n     lifetime.\n       A result is that prisons perpetuate a kind of pinwheel of \n     failure among drug users, who return to the streets unchanged \n     and end up back in prison, sometimes within weeks. The best \n     programs drastically cut the rearrest rate of participants. \n     And they seem to be economical. One study in California \n     showed that every $1 invested in solid drug treatment saved \n     $7 in future costs of crime and incarceration.\n       Abstinence alone would not end the longing for drugs, \n     experts say, but abstinence is not even an issue at most \n     prisons, where drugs are available for those willing to pay.\n       Drug treatment advocates say the country could be providing \n     intense anti-drug therapy to everyone in prison who needs if \n     for a tiny fraction of what is being spent on the most \n     explosive prison-building spree in history. But the nation's \n     political leaders have stuck with bricks and mortar. Last \n     fall, the Democratic-controlled Congress authorized $8 \n     billion to build new prisons over the next six years, and \n     only $400 million for drug treatment in state and Federal \n     prisons. This year, the new Republican majority in Congress \n     increased the prison construction allotment to $10 billion, \n     leaving the treatment money the same.\n        few states, like California and South Carolina, are \n     expanding drug treatment for prisoners. Texas began a \n     sweeping new program four years ago, but is now scaling it \n     back. And in New York, one of the pioneers, Gov. George E. \n     Pataki, has cut treatment for several thousand prisoners as \n     part of his plan to reduce state spending.\n       Joseph A. Califano Jr., the former aide to President Lyndon \n     B. Johnson who now heads the Center on Alcohol and Substance \n     Abuse at Columbia University, said society has a warped image \n     of the inmate population that works against greater \n     allocations for drug treatment.\n       ``The average American thinks we've got guys in jail like \n     the ones Jimmy Cagney and Humphrey Bogart played in the \n     1930's,'' Mr. Califano said. ``In reality, the prisons are \n     wall to wall with alcohol and drug abusers and the mentally \n     ill. They're not hardened criminals; they're people who can \n     change. But they can't change without help.''\n       But Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican who \n     heads the House subcommittee on crime, said he and many \n     others remain skeptical about the rehabilitative powers of \n     treatment and about its power to reduce prison populations.\n       ``The priority is in taking violent criminal offenders off \n     the street and locking them up for long periods of time,'' he \n     said. ``That comes before drug treatment.''\n\n\n                            reshaping people\n\n                      ``My life started changing''\n\n       Prison is an ideal place to apply drug treatment, in large \n     part because that is where the addicts are.\n       On the outside, heavy drug users are scattered through \n     almost every community. It is often hard to locate them and \n     even harder to persuade them to enter treatment. Inside \n     prisons, most inmates are motivated to enter treatment not \n     because they are concerned about their drug problems but \n     because they have something else to gain: early release, in \n     New York; a relief from boredom; a cell in a prison closer to \n     home.\n       After months in a treatment program, however, many inmates \n     find that they have been drawn into the process despite \n     themselves. That was the case with Mr. Mathurin. ``It just \n     started growing on me,'' he said. ``Stuff started happening \n     and my life started changing.''\n       Keeping addicts from dropping out of treatment is almost as \n     big a problem as coaxing them to enter in the first place. In \n     prison, though, partly because the alternative is just \n     another bunk in another cell block, the dropout rate is much \n     lower.\n       Drug treatment programs, even the least intense ones, seem \n     to bring tranquility to prisons. Administrators and officers \n     say inmates in treatment programs fight less and give their \n     keepers less of a hard time. John P. Erickson, who is in \n     charge of substance abuse programs in the California prison \n     system, said, ``There is a ripple effect in terms of the \n     overall prison environment.''\n       The kind of treatment that has proved most effective with \n     inmates is done in a so-called therapeutic community. \n     Residents are housed together, and they eat, sleep and work \n     on their drug problems together. They begin the day at the \n     crack of dawn by cleaning up their cells and making their \n     beds with military tucks. Then, after a peppy morning \n     meeting, they march through a schedule of encounter groups \n     and seminars that continues into the early evening. The \n     structure itself is part of the treatment.\n       While drug abuse is the universal link in these programs, \n     it is addressed as a symptom rather than the heart of the \n     problem.\n       ``The therapeutic community is a school about life,'' said \n     Ronald Williams, a former heroin addict and armed robber who \n     now runs New York Therapeutic Communities, which operates \n     treatment programs in prisons in New York and Texas. ``It's \n     teaching how to live a life that is crime free and drug free, \n     and providing the tools to accomplish that.''\n       It amounts to reshaping people, and researchers say the \n     best results usually take 12 to 18 months. But a therapeutic \n     community at the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility, a medium \n     security prison in southern California, has shown a striking \n     impact after only 9 to 12 months. In that therapy program, \n     the reincarceration rate has been cut by about a third. A \n     year after leaving prison, 42.6 percent of the inmates who \n     graduated from the program were back behind bars again--\n     compared with 63 percent of those who had served their time \n     merely lifting weights, playing basketball and doing chores.\n       The results have been even better at a therapeutic \n     community in a Delaware prison with a program that runs 18 \n     months.\n       Drug-treatment programs promise eventual savings because \n     they reduce the recidivism rate among graduates. But they \n     require more initial spending, raising the cost per prisoner \n     by about $10 a day in Texas and California and $15 a day in \n     New York. Without treatment, Texas spends $44 a day to keep \n     an inmate in prison. In California the cost is $57, and in \n     New York it is $71.\n       States try to cut costs while still offering treatment by \n     offering lectures on the dangers of drugs--which are pretty \n     well known to most addicts--and weekly meetings of an hour or \n     two of Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous. \n     California and New York offer some drug education programs \n     that run over several months, and Alabama and Florida have \n     been providing eight weeks of intensive treatment for many \n     prisoners. But experts say such abbreviated treatment has \n     little lasting effect.\n       ``It's a false economy,'' said Dr. Lewis Yablonsky, a \n     sociologist at East Texas State University who has been \n     working with therapeutic communities for years. ``If the \n     states get behind the therapeutic community concept, we will \n     cut our prison population in half over the next 25 years. \n     That would save billions of dollars.''\n\n\n                            showing the way\n\n                    Once an inmate, now a counselor\n\n       Drug treatment is a glacial process. Powerful changes can \n     occur, but they take months, not days.\n       In a session shortly after breakfast one Monday morning at \n     the Donovan Correctional Facility in California, on a sun-\n     parched plateau overlooking the Mexican border, a handful of \n     inmates sat in a circle of armchairs in a pleasant, carpeted \n     room with paintings and color photos on the walls.\n       Michael Watkins, an imposing young burglar who likes crack \n     cocaine far too much, was hunched over, glowering.\n       ``I dreamed I was getting high,'' he said. He was upset. He \n     had been working to rid himself of cravings for three months, \n     and now he worried that he was sliding back.\n       But across the circle, Phillip Serrato, a 25-year-old drug \n     smuggler and heroin addict, could not have been happier with \n     himself. He had been out on the grassy prison yard, between \n     the plaza filled with barbells and weight lifters and the \n     asphalt basketball courts, he said, when some friends from \n     his old neighborhood started passing around heroin and \n     crystal methamphetamine.\n       ``It gave me the chills,'' he said. ``But I didn't take \n     any, and I feel real good in my chest.''\n       Gregory Kuhn, a 30-year-old drug dealer, had just turned \n     down a marijuana joint in the yard. ``Being right there, \n     smelling it,'' he \n\n[[Page S 9823]]\n     said wistfully. ``I looked at it and I know I couldn't touch it.''\n       It was the start of another week of treatment at Donovan, \n     where the drug culture that persists behind bars is so \n     accepted that it goes unremarked upon by prisoners and \n     counselors alike. Russell Power, who has the name Rita \n     tattooed on his neck in small, loopy script, was leading the \n     group. Like many of the counselors working in the program at \n     Donovan, run by Amity, a private treatment organization also \n     operating in Arizona and Texas, Mr. Power, 38, is a former \n     inmate and recovering drug addict methamphetamine was his \n     drug, manufacturing it was his crime.\n       Like most of America's inmates, many of the men came from \n     households and neighborhoods where conversations about ideas, \n     emotions and dreams were rarely held. Thinking broadly and \n     deeply about their lives was not easy for them. And so Mr. \n     Power's objective that morning was simply to get them talking \n     and, in turn, thinking, first steps in recognizing and \n     changing habits that repeatedly landed them in prison.\n       The addict-counselors, like Mr. Power, often seem to be \n     participating as equals. But they are quietly suggesting \n     ethical approaches to life, ways to get along without drugs, \n     often using their own recovery and return from crime as \n     illustrations.\n       Later that Monday, departing from his notes in a seminar \n     dealing with truth, information, priorities and support, Mr. \n     Power talked about using the group sessions to let off steam \n     and tension. ``If you're dreaming about using, you need to be \n     talking about it in groups,'' he said. ``If you're thinking \n     about killing somebody you need to be saying it in the group.\n       ``I use the group that way. If I talk about it, I usually \n     won't do it.''\n       On another afternoon in group therapy, after watching a \n     film about German concentration camps intended to provoke a \n     conversation about hatred, one inmate, Jimmy Carpenter, an \n     heroin addict and shoplifter, objected to comments from \n     another, Larry Jones, that compared the new Republican \n     leadership to the Nazis.\n       Certain that Mr. Carpenter, who has two years of college, \n     was putting him down Mr. Jones sprang to his feet, veins \n     pulsing in his neck, and lunged across the circle. Standing \n     inches apart, the two men blustered and sputtered. Finally, \n     with everyone shouting them down, they slumped into their \n     chairs.\n       It has been a close call, two men at the precipice of what \n     would have been the first fist fight since drug treatment was \n     started at Donavan in 1991. And, as it turned out, it was not \n     about Nazis and Republicans at all.\n       Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Jones had been friends for 25 years. \n     A year ago, when they entered the treatment program, they \n     promised each other they would stay away from drugs. But not \n     long before the holocaust discussion, Mr. Carpenter had \n     broken his word. He had got hold of some marijuana and \n     crystal methamphetamine in the yard and, after everyone else \n     went to sleep, he turned on the light by his bunk and began \n     to party. He stayed up all night, reading, listening to music \n     and savoring the drugs.\n       A guard notice the light and, in the morning, Mr. Carpenter \n     was asked to give a urine sample, which, of course, proved he \n     has been using drugs.\n       Though they try not get so close to the edge, the explosion \n     was the sort of thing the counselors strive for.\n       ``It teaches the inmates how to work through emotions,'' \n     said Rod Mullen, the executive director of Amity.\n       ``If they don't learn to control their emotions.'' he said, \n     ``the first bad thing that happens will set them off. They'll \n     go rob a store, beat up their girlfriend, get drunk, get into \n     a high-speed chase and then, of course, they're right back in \n     the institution again.''\n\n\n                           gradual acceptance\n\n                      Success brings more programs\n\n       Drug treatment in American prisons has had a rocky history. \n     From its inception in the 1930's at Federal institutions in \n     Lexington, Ky., and Forth Worth, it has generally been poorly \n     administered and ineffective. By the mid-70's, criminal \n     justice experts had come to believe that nothing works.\n       Some of the first convincing evidence that treatment could \n     have a significant impact on crime came in the late 1980's \n     from a therapeutic community in a New York State prison. \n     Tracking inmates who had been out of the Arthur Kill state \n     prison on Staten Island for three years, Dr. Harry K. Wexler \n     found that of those who had spent a year in the Stay'n Out \n     drug treatment program there, 27 percent had been in trouble \n     with the police again, compared with 41 percent of the \n     inmates who received no treatment.\n       Gradually, drug treatment in prisons began to expand as \n     word of the success at Arthur Kill and at a prison in Oregon \n     spread among professionals and Federal officials began \n     financing pilot projects around the country. In a bit of \n     horse trading in 1989, the New York State Assembly, which was \n     Democratically controlled, agreed to go along with Gov. Mario \n     M. Cuomo and the Republican-controlled Senate to build more \n     prisons on the condition that drug treatment also be \n     increased. By last year, there were eight therapeutic \n     communities, treating about 8 percent of the state's 68,000 \n     inmates.\n       Except for Stay'n Out, the therapeutic communities in the \n     New York prisons run programs that last six months, about \n     half as long as most experts think is the minimum necessary. \n     Most of the inmates who go into therapeutic communities are \n     primed with about six months of anti-drug education. But \n     experts say the combined programs have far less impact on \n     inmates than a full year of intensive treatment.\n\n\n                          living without drugs\n\n                      On his own, tempted no more\n\n       Pierre Mathurin's journey to recovery started in the Mohawk \n     state prison in the gently rolling farmlands of central New \n     York. He had been in prison for about a year and he had been \n     getting high on marijuana and cocaine about every other week, \n     depending on how supplies were running. Once in a while, he \n     would get some heroin, he said, and sell it for 10 times its \n     street value.\n       One morning at Mohawk, he said, he woke up and said to \n     himself, ``I don't want to get high no more.''\n       He was not particularly interested in drug treatment. He \n     did not think he needed it.\n       But he was told that the only way he could get into the \n     work release program that would get him back on the street a \n     year earlier was to go into treatment. So he signed up, and \n     was sent to a therapeutic community run by a Phoenix House, \n     the largest residential drug treatment organization in the \n     nation at the state prison in Marcy.\n       He was not a model patient. Twice he became incensed in \n     encounter groups and threatened to punch other inmates. Each \n     time, he was punished with extra chores and required to \n     repeat parts of the treatment. Therapeutically, that may have \n     worked to his advantage, because he ended up with nine months \n     of treatment, three months more than the standard in New \n     York.\n       Though experts say that follow-up treatment outside prison \n     further diminishes the likelihood of inmates' being \n     rearrested by as much as 20 percent, Mr. Mathurin, like most \n     inmates around the country, was not required to continue his \n     treatment after being released.\n       But something had taken hold in him, and he arranged to \n     participate in encounter groups at a Phoenix House center in \n     Manhattan three times a week. Then it was twice a week. Then, \n     once a week and finally, he was on his own, except for the \n     Narcotics Anonymous meetings that he attends three times a \n     week.\n       He is back with some of his old friends now, and some of \n     them are still using drugs. One of them is the young man with \n     whom he did his last stickup. He got away that night, was \n     picked up for gun possession a couple of years later, but got \n     off with five years' probation. He is still using drugs, and \n     he and Mr. Mathurin are still close. But Mr. Mathurin said he \n     did not feel tempted to get high with his friend.\n       ``He doesn't do it in front of me, and we don't talk about \n     it,'' Mr. Mathurin said. ``One day, he'll probably be like \n     me. But I'm not going to preach recovery. He's got to want \n     it.''\n       In the old days, Mr. Mathurin said, he considered himself \n     mainly a drug dealer and had gone out to rob people only when \n     sales were slow. There was, though, a certain amount of \n     excitement, he said, in ``putting somebody in fear.''\n       ``Now,'' he said, ``I don't think that was right. I'm not \n     going to say I'm making more money now. But I'm feeling \n     better. I may make less, but you spend more wisely when you \n     actually earn it.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/12/senate-section/article/S9821-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
