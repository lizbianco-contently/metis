Thank you, Mr. President. The Senate will immediately begin \nconsideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, the concurrent budget \nresolution. Under the agreement of last week, there are a limited \nnumber of first-degree amendments in order to the resolution. Senators \nare urged to offer and debate those today. Senators are reminded there \nwill be no rollcall votes today. Any votes ordered on amendments will \noccur on Tuesday, and Senators can expect numerous votes Tuesday in \norder to complete action on the budget resolution.\n  I know that the managers of the bill will be here shortly. I might \npoint out that there has already been an order of amendments agreed to. \nShortly, we will begin with the first of those amendments, I believe by \nthe Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, regarding the payroll tax \ncut, to be followed by an amendment by Senator Harkin, and so on down \nthe line.\n  I note that the last thing scheduled today, to begin on or before, I \nguess, 7 p.m., is the Chafee-Breaux so-called bipartisan amendment. I \nbelieve there will be considerable amount of time devoted to that \nparticular amendment--3 hours being reserved for tonight.\n  So I wanted to make Senators aware that there is a list of \namendments. An order has been agreed to, and we will be prepared to \nbegin with those shortly. I know the majority leader, Senator Dole, is \nvery anxious for us to work very hard in debating these amendments so \nthat we can complete action as soon as possible this week.\n  We do have other very important legislation pending that we are \nanxious to have considered. Senator Dole's bill dealing with the \nnational missile defense, Defend America Act, we are trying to work out \nan agreement on how that will be brought up and considered.\n  I know the distinguished President pro tempore, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, is anxious for the defense authorization bill \nto be considered, hopefully this week, so that we can have a conference \nbetween the House and Senate this year early in June, rather than later \non in the summer, which would cause problems in trying to get the \nauthorization done at the same time trying to get the appropriations \nbill done.\n  So we have a lot of work to do in a limited amount of time before we \ngo out for the Memorial Day recess period.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we need to report the resolution \nso that further action can be taken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5305-4", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, the centrality of resource to government, the power to \ntax, the impact and effect of taxation upon our economy is something \nwhich is well known and understood across our culture. The development \nof a budget for this country is perhaps one of our most important \nresponsibilities. It has to do with the fundamental ways in which we \nview ourselves. It helps us focus on who we are and what we can be when \nwe have the right balance between spending and the rest of the \neconomy--the private sector of the economy; when we have the right \nbalance between taxes that are spent by government and resources that \nare spent by individuals in the culture.\n  When I think about America, I think about it as a place of hope, a \nplace of opportunity, a place that can solve problems that might not \nhave been susceptible to solution anywhere else. I think about the \nwords on the base of the Statue of Liberty, Emma Lazarus' poem, which \nis so aggressive. It is so hopeful. It says:\n\n     Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shores,\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me:\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door.\n\n  America so brash, America so capable, America so resilient, so \noriented to growth and opportunity that it says to the rest of the \nworld, ``Send me your most troublesome problems. Send me the most \ndifficult of your cases, we lift a lamp of opportunity here. Give me \nyour tired, your poor. We will take care of it here because we are \ngrowing, we are on the move.'' What troubles me perhaps more than \nanything else is that of late instead of saying, ``Give me your tired, \nyour poor,'' we seem to be reciting that we are the tired, we are the \npoor.\n  It has been said that America is the ``city on the hill,'' a special \nexample to the rest of world, a place to look to, a city of hope and \nopportunity. Well, perhaps it might be said that if we are a city, we \nare in need of renewal. We sure would not want the kind of urban \nrenewal that has been inflicted on American cities, but the sense that \nwe need to again restart the engine, regenerate the opportunities of \nthis culture. Perhaps we ought to look carefully at what is it that has \nmoved us from a culture that could say, ``Give me your tired, your \npoor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse \nof your teeming shores, send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to \nme.''\n  What it is that has moved us from saying that to being doubtful about \nthe future, to be insecure, having this sense of social discomfort, of \nsocial disease, social insecurity, if you will, which we find in \nAmerica today? I have to say to you that I think it has been the \nflatness in growth which we have normally expected in this culture but \nwhich we are not seeing in the American culture.\n\n  Economic growth has always driven the idea that America could be a \nspecial place of opportunity. It was that sense of endless opportunity \nin this country that drove us to say, ``Give me your tired, your \npoor.'' It was this understanding that we could always grow our way \nthrough circumstances and difficulties. Growth has been a marvelous key \ntoward providing some new hope for individuals at all times in our \nhistory.\n  Yet, what has happened to growth? What has happened to our culture? \nWe have seen a tremendous flatness in recent years. Take-home pay is \nstagnant at best. The average household income is 6.3 percent below its \n1989 level--6.3 percent down; 6.3 percent is $1 out of every $18. So \nwhere you used to get $18 you now only have $17. That is just in the \nlast 6 or 7 years.\n  Zero growth in worker income for the first 3 years of the Clinton \nadministration. Working families are being taxed. They are being \nstressed.\n  We find they get up early; they work late; they sacrifice time with \neach other and with their children, and they have less and less for it. \nThey are squeezed.\n  What is the reason? Why is it that we as a culture find ourselves \nlaboring\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\nunder this weight rather than soaring toward the opportunity of a \nlifted lamp that can greet any challenge boldly and say, ``Give me your \nbest shot?'' We cannot only roll with the punch; we can succeed.\n  I think it is simple. I think it is because the Government has begun \nto take so much of the wage of working Americans that Americans no \nlonger have the resource to spend for themselves. Tax liberation day is \na day that is calculated each year which says that since the Government \nhas the first claim on your wages, how long do you have to work into \nthe year in order to pay all the Government's claim?\n  Tax liberation day was just a little over a week ago. The truth of \nthe matter is it is awfully substantial in our culture, the burden that \ntaxes place on each of us. As a matter of fact, as a percentage of the \ngross domestic product, that is, the output of this economy, we have \nhigher rates of taxation at this moment in history than we have ever \nhad in the history of this Republic, higher than the rate of taxation \nthat it took to throw the British out of this country, higher than it \ntook to win the Civil War, higher rates of taxation than it took to \nmake the world safe for democracy in World War I, higher rates of \ntaxation than it took for us to spend our way out of the Depression of \nthe 1930's, and more taxes in terms of gross domestic product than it \ntook for us to win World War II. The American people are being taxed at \nthe highest rate in history when measured by gross domestic product.\n  That is a shame. It is a substantial burden on the American people. \nAnd as their incomes are being eroded, repressed, held back, they are \nwondering what happened to their income. I think it is pretty easy for \nus to say what has happened to their income because the growth of \nGovernment spending has soared. We have gone to an income tax which was \n2 to 3 percent of income in the 1950's to more than 10 times that much \nnow. And we have levels of taxation which are just incredible. Of the \nfamily budget, in 1955, 27.7 percent was total taxes--in 1955. It is \n38.2 percent in 1995. That is more than a third increase in what the \nAmerican family is being asked to pay in taxes.\n  Just looking at the data from this decade, it is not a happy picture \nbecause in 1990 we had a substantial tax increase, and in 1993 the \nClinton administration and the Democrats in the Congress imposed upon \nthe American people without a single Republican vote the largest tax \nincrease in the history of America. And so when the American worker \nlooks around to say, what happened to my wage increase, it is pretty \neasy to say what has happened to your wage increase, what has happened \nto the growth in this economy, what has happened to the dynamic \npotential of hope that America represents and ought to be. It has been \nstolen by Government. What the people cannot spend is what Government \nhas taken. And when Government takes well over 38 percent of your \nincome, you cannot spend it, and if Government did not take it, you \ncould spend it. Government is out of control. It is taxing at \nincredibly high rates and families are suffering.\n\n  Senator Coverdell of Georgia is eloquent in describing how taxes have \ngone up regularly since the 1950's and 1960's. You can trace and \ncorrelate the number of families where people feel it is necessary for \nboth parents to be out of the home working. Taxes have not only stolen \nthe resource of money from our families but they have stolen the \nresource of parenting in many respects by forcing people who would \notherwise want to stay in the home to be parents to leave the home in \norder to go into the marketplace to try and make enough. So that the \nworkers are not getting increases.\n  The record of the recent past is the workers are not getting \nincreases, but the record is that the Government is getting increases, \nand so we not only have the diversion of the important financial \nresource from family, we have had a diversion of other resources. And \npeople are not able to make their own decisions about whether they want \nto go into the marketplace or to stay in the home or spend time with \ntheir family or devote themselves to the development of family \nconcerns; you have a situation where they are simply compelled to be \nthere.\n  This is a situation of Government that is out of control.\n  This chart here just gives us a little indication of where the money \ngoes. House and household, in the average family, 15 percent pays for \nits home and its household. That is 2.5 times less, or this is 2.5 \ntimes more total taxes; food, 6 percent of the normal family's income; \ntaxes, over 600 percent more than that; transportation, 6 percent; over \n600 percent more than we spend on transportation; to put clothes on the \nbacks of Americans costs 4 percent of family income; it costs almost 10 \npercent that much to pay taxes.\n  This is the largest total tax figure. This represents more of the \ngross domestic product than at any time in the history of this country, \nand it is no wonder that we find ourselves in a period of stagnation, \nof retrogression, of reduction rather than in development and growth, \nand it is time again to unleash the engine of opportunity, the driving \nforce of growth in our culture and society.\n\n  Government has stolen the wage increases of American workers by \nregressing growth in the American culture. It is the reason, if we are \nthe city on the Hill, we need renewal. It is the reason we no longer \nsay give me your tired, your poor. We have people complaining that they \nare tired and they are poor, and it is time for us to grant to the \nAmerican people the kind of relief which will make a difference to \nthem. I think we need to find a way to relieve the American public of \nits tax burden, but we need to make sure that this goes to the people \nwho need it most. We need to find a way to make sure that the American \npublic, the working public, the middle class, the forgotten middle \nclass in everything but campaign years, is remembered.\n  Let me just say that I think I have a way to get that done. I think I \nhave an effective way to deliver tax relief to the middle class, and \nlet me describe it to you. Almost all of us--well, all of us who do \nwork--pay what is called payroll taxes. These are taxes that go to \nsupport Social Security. And I would not touch those taxes in any way. \nWe need to pay those in order to make sure that the Social Security \ntrust fund is maintained. But these Social Security taxes are a tax. We \npay those to the Government. They go to make sure that our ability to \npay individuals who are on Social Security their benefits is \nmaintained. We do not want to impair in any way the ability of this \nculture to pay those citizens who are on Social Security what they \ndeserve and what they have earned by paying their Social Security taxes \nin the past.\n  But it is a tax. And when you pay the 6 point something or other \npercent of your wages as a Social Security tax, it is a tax. There is \nno two ways about it. It is a tax. It is not an investment program for \nyou. They do not take your money and invest it and put it away so that \nyou will have something when you retire. It is simply a tax that is \nlevied on you so they can meet the current demands of the Social \nSecurity system.\n  What is interesting about that tax is that you have to pay that tax \nafter you have already had your income tax calculated. So that you have \npaid a tax on that money, and then you pay a tax again. This is a \nclassic setting where we have asked the American people to be subject \nto a tax on a tax.\n  That is unfair. Double taxation for the American people in this \nsetting is grossly unfair. It is something that we have rejected in \nvirtually every other category of our existence, but we are asking \nAmerican workers, working families, to pay a tax on a tax. As you know, \nthe Social Security tax is only levied on the first $62,000 of your \nincome, $63,000; $62,700 is the real number. So if you are paying a tax \non that amount and it is also being taxed for income tax purposes, you \nhave a double tax.\n  I think we ought to make that deductible. You still have to pay the \nSocial Security tax, but you no longer have to pay the income tax on \nthings that are never income to you, because this money never reaches \nan employee. The working families of America never see it. It is \ndeducted. It is called the payroll deduction tax. It is a tax that goes \nstraight from your employer right into the Federal Government. You do \nnot even get a sniff at this resource, and yet you are taxed on this \ntax.\n  Strangely enough, interestingly enough, this is not a tax which hits \nAmerican business in the same way,\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\nbecause the business community has a right to deduct from its taxes the \npayments that it makes that match the workers' tax. So the business \ncommunity, the giant corporate citizens of America--and we need them \nand they are good and appropriate--they get fair treatment by being \nable to deduct this as an expense. But the citizen, the worker, pays on \nthe first $62,700 of our income, we pay Social Security taxes out of \nmoney that we have already paid taxes on. We have a tax on the tax, and \nit is time that we stopped that. It is time that we elevate the \nAmerican worker at least to the tax standing and tax position of \nAmerican corporations. It is time that we gave that tax break to the \nAmerican worker.\n  It is important that this tax break, by providing for deductibility \nof the Social Security tax before the income tax is paid, go to the \nAmerican worker. It is important to note that it is only on the first \n$62,000 of income. So, as a matter of fact, for the millionaires, they \nonly get the break on $62,000 of their income, just like the average \nworking family would only get the break on that first segment of \nincome.\n  So for those who are fond of saying every time there is a tax break, \nthat this is a tax break for the rich, well, you need not apply here, \nbecause this is limited automatically to providing the deduction for a \ntax you are paying to Social Security, and since nobody pays it above \n$62,700, it is not a deduction for the rich. It is a deduction in terms \nof proportional deductions of your wages that favors, dramatically \nfavors, the middle class. What an important thing that is, because \nmiddle-class families are the families that desperately need help.\n\n  What would happen to the middle-class family? How would the middle-\nclass family be affected? For middle-class families, the Social \nSecurity tax is the single largest tax that is paid. No other tax that \nwe pay takes a bigger chunk out of the average family's income than \nSocial Security taxes. So to give a deduction on that would be \nsubstantial. It would really mean they would have about a 1-percent \ndecrease in their income tax rate for these families, the average two-\nincome family. That means that you would pay about $1,770 less in taxes \nfor the year than you would if we did not have this deduction.\n  What happens to the economy of the United States of America if you \nlet working people who have earned the money just pay tax once by \nsending it to the Social Security trust fund but not being taxed on \nthat money twice, therefore, having the extra $1,770 in income? What \nwill happen in the United States? Growth, that is what will happen. It \nis universal. No one projects anything but substantial growth. The \nmiddle number is about 500,000 new jobs, about 10,000 jobs per State.\n  I had the privilege of being Governor of my State for about 8 years \nbefore I became a U.S. Senator, and it is a great privilege. If someone \ncame to your State saying they had 10,000 jobs for you, I mean, \nstopping the Governor from doing cartwheels would be a major endeavor. \nWe care about growth; we care about opportunity.\n  That is the equivalent of two large car assembly plants. States have \nfallen all over themselves. I remember the competition for the Saturn \nplant, eventually won by Tennessee, I sadly say. Good for Tennessee, \nbad for Missouri. We would like to have had it. But several of those in \nevery State in the United States of America? It is estimated that the \ngross domestic product would raise by one-half of 1 percent as a result \nof letting the people spend the money instead of having the Government \nspend the money.\n  I think we need to remind ourselves on a regular and consistent basis \nthat when we tax people, it is a question of not whether money will be \nspent, it is whether we are going to spend the money in the Government \nand whether we can decide best for people how to serve their needs or \nwhether they can decide best by having the money at their own disposal \nand by having the money for themselves to spend.\n  I believe that the families in America know best, and the economists \nindicate that, if we will stop spending this money and just let it be \nspent in the private sector by the families, it will mean about \n500,000--500,000--new jobs in America, about 10,000 jobs per State. The \ngross domestic product will go up by .5 percent. That would mean that \n77 million--77 million--working Americans would have more resources to \ndevote to themselves, to their families, do more for themselves, do \nmore for their families, and do more of the good things that American \nfamilies want to do.\n\n  So often we say that Government is required because families will not \ndo what they ought to do, but I believe we have come to a place where \nGovernment has made it impossible for families to do what they ought \nand want to do. They want to share, they want to be involved in their \ncommunities, they want to be involved in their churches and synagogues \nand mosques and temples. They want to be involved in reaching out to \nother people. But when Government takes such a big share, when you have \nto work 3 hours every day to get the Government's share out of the way \nand you struggle through the rest of the day to meet your own needs, it \ndoes not leave much opportunity for sharing.\n  So we have a situation where we really need to provide relief to \nAmerica's working families. They are struggling. We talk about the \nproblems of the family. It is time for us to do something about the \nproblems of our families.\n  We talk about Government as if it all was involved in something that \nwas fundamental, essential, and necessary--and frequently is--but \nfamilies are fundamental, essential, and necessary. One hundred years \nago, Williams Jennings Bryan said, if you tore down your cities and \nleft your farms, the cities would grow back up. But if you destroyed \nthe agriculture and the producing capacity of this country, grass would \ngrow in the streets of the cities.\n  I think if you tore down government, it could spring back up if you \nleft the families in place, but if you were to tear down the families \nof America, I can guarantee you that grass would grow over this \nCapitol, and it may if we do not provide relief in some way to the \nfamilies of this country that are hard pressed by this weight. It is \nnot inconsequential that the governmental share is in red here, because \nmuch of this is the resource of the next generation as well. We are not \nonly on a binge of taxation, we are on a binge of spending, and that \nbinge of spending threatens the well-being of young Americans and those \nwho are yet to be born.\n  This is a program and proposal that basically comes down to the \nquestion of, do you want more taxes or less taxes? Do you want to grow \nGovernment, or do you want to grow people? What is the purpose of \nGovernment? The purpose of Government is related to growth, but it is \nnot related to the growth of Government; it is related to the growth of \npeople. It is our responsibility to maintain an environment in which \npeople grow, in which their enterprises grow, in which citizens grow \nand in which their corporations grow.\n  It is a place where individuals grow and institutions grow, but if we \nmake it so that government is the only thing that can grow because it \nsucks up so much of the resource of this culture, we will have \ndestroyed the genius of America, we will have destroyed the opportunity \nof it, we will have destroyed the character of it. It is time for us to \nget out of the destruction business and to get into the restoration \nbusiness.\n  That is why the Working Americans Wage Restoration Act is what we \nought to be focused on. This is a way, without impairing Social \nSecurity in any respect, to place into the hands of the American people \nthe capacity to do for themselves and for their families and for others \nwhat they ought and want to do and to do so by balancing a taking by \ngovernment of an inordinate amount of their resources.\n  Remember, it is time to curtail this tax on tax. The American family \nhas been treated unfairly. It has been taxed where corporations have \nbeen given a deduction. We are taxed at the highest levels in history. \nNot even to prosecute the most disastrous of all wars have we taxed our \npeople as much as we have. It is time for us to provide the relief to \nthe American family which will allow the American family to flourish, \nand allows us to again have the kind of bold, brash, and aggressive \nbehavior of hope that said: Give us your best shot. Give us your tired, \nyour poor.\n  We can make something of anything in the United States because we are\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\ngrowing. It is time for us to be the city on the hill again and not the \ncity in need of urban renewal, but a city of hope and opportunity.\n  It is time for us to give the American worker a chance to do what \nneeds to be done and to provide a basis upon which the American worker \nand the American economy can again grow.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4008, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING BIENNIAL BUDGETING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that the current budget \n     process--\n       (1) results in constant and redundant congressional action \n     on spending measures and budget issues;\n       (2) causes instability in financial markets and creates \n     budgetary uncertainty for recipients of Federal funds, \n     thereby inhibiting the efficient operation of these programs; \n     and\n       (3) allows insufficient time for Congress to consider \n     national needs as a basis for sound and efficient policy \n     approaches, thereby fostering piecemeal solutions that \n     contribute to unrestrained growth of the Federal Government.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) a biennial budget process would--\n       (A) create an orderly, predictable process for \n     consideration of spending decisions responsive to policy \n     priorities and improve congressional control over the Federal \n     budget and therefore promote better accountability to the \n     public;\n       (B) provide greater stability and certainty for financial \n     markets, Federal, State, and local government agencies which \n     need sufficient time to plan for the implementation of \n     programs; and\n       (C) allow sufficient time for the fulfillment by the \n     Congress of its legislative and oversight responsibilities, \n     including the consideration of authorizing legislation, \n     budget resolutions, appropriations bills, and other spending \n     measures; and\n       (2) the Congress should enact legislation in the 104th \n     Congress to establish a biennial budget process.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I offer to the Senate a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution which states that we would have biennial budgeting.\n  I make this recommendation for several reasons. The primary factor is \nmy personal experience with biennial budgeting. I come from the Wyoming \nlegislature where we employ a 2-year budget cycle. It works very well. \nIt seems to me that we ought to bring that Western wisdom inside the \nbeltway. I know it has been considered before, but obviously Congress \nhas not enacted the concept.\n  I want to take just a moment to recognize the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, who has been a real leader on this issue \nfor a number of years. In fact, he and Majority Leader Bob Dole joined \nme when I recently introduced a bill, S. 1434, that would create a \nbiennial budget process.\n  Obviously, there are some great benefits from biennial budgeting. One \nof them is being demonstrated here today. This Congress we have spent \nmost of our time working on the budget. I am not sure what the numbers \nare, but if you looked at last year, I suspect that we will have spent \nfully two-thirds of the year in this place talking about the budget.\n  The alternative to that, it seems to me, is the opportunity of having \na biennial budget in which basically we could talk about a budget, \ndebate a budget, discuss a budget, enact a budget in 1 year, put that \nbudget into place for a period of 2 years, and have the following year \nto do one of the other major responsibilities of the Senate, and that \nis oversight.\n  I strongly believe that we do not spend enough time on oversight in \nCongress. That is one of our basic responsibilities. This failure has \nled to the continuous growth of the Federal Government.\n  So there are a number of reasons why biennial budgeting would be \nimportant. One is that it would promote timely action on budget \nlegislation. We would not drag the process out as much as we do now. \nAnother benefit is that it would provide an opportunity for Federal \nagencies to plan a little further ahead. Although it is not long term--\n2 years--it would create more stability in executive branch programs.\n  A 2-year budget cycle would also eliminate some of the redundancies \nof the current process. I am not on the Appropriations Committee here. \nI was, however, in my legislature, and I know how much time and effort \ngoes into it and how important it is. Quite frankly, it is not any more \ndifficult to do it for 2 years than it is for 1.\n  I suspect that there is not generally a great deal of support by \nappropriators for this concept. Obviously, one of the reasons is that \nappropriators have a great deal of authority around here, primarily \nbecause they consider the budget every year. Naturally, they don't want \nto relinquish that power. Appropriators who want something out of the \nbudget for their State are beholden to the current budget process. I do \nnot say that unkindly, that is just the way it is. Consequently, I do \nnot\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\nexpect the appropriators to support this reform.\n\n  One of the other benefits, of course, is you reduce the frequency of \nPresidential/congressional conflicts, though those instances will \nalways occur. There is a responsibility on the part of the Congress, of \ncourse, for the House to initiate and the Congress to put forth a \nbudget. Under the Constitution, the President has an opportunity to \napprove or disapprove it. I think this is one of the areas where there \nis a certain amount of frustration; where we find ourselves sometimes \nchanging and fixing everything to meet the President's requirements. \nThe fact is, the President has some requirements, too, to accommodate \nhimself to the Congress. It is not a one-way street down Pennsylvania \nAvenue. So biennial budgeting would reduce these conflicts. It would, \nas I mentioned before, encourage long-term planning, particularly in \nthe executive branch and in State governments.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take a great deal of time to discuss \nthis issue. I know this is not the time to go into great length to \ndebate it. This is the time, however, to give it some consideration, \nwhen we are in the middle of the budget process. We will be moving into \nthe appropriations cycle, when this budget is over, which will likely \ntake until October to complete. In addition, we recently finished last \nyear's appropriations process. So biennial budgeting provides a great \nopportunity, I believe, to streamline the process.\n  But making the process more efficient is not even the most important \nbenefit of biennial budgeting. In a 2-year budget cycle, more time can \nbe spent on oversight, and less time can be spent on budgeting \nconflicts with the executive branch. Mr. President, all in all, I think \nit makes a great deal of sense.\n  Biennial budgeting will not cure all of the Federal Government's \nills, of course, but it is, I believe, a solid step toward restoring \nsome fiscal and oversight accountability in our Nation's Capital. As I \nmentioned, now is not the time to debate it. However, I intend to \npursue the issue in the future. Though I plan to withdraw the \namendment, I am putting my colleagues on notice that this issue must be \naddressed. I urge my colleagues to join me in that effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment will be withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 3974) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming for \ninitiating the discussion--this has been talked about a great deal \ntoday--and for now withdrawing the amendment. That does not mean we are \nnot going to be revisiting things like this in the future, but in the \ninterests of moving the budget process along it is best to delay the \ndiscussion.\n  We have today and we have tomorrow night, which is the time the \nmajority has indicated they would like to complete work on the budget. \nWe are already way late on the budget. It was supposed to be acted upon \nearlier. So I hope we could move ahead in a brisker fashion than we \nhave before. I would simply say to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, we are awaiting more amendments. If there were either a Democrat \nor Republican Senator seeking to offer an amendment right now, this \nSenator would yield. But I send out the call once again, we are going \nto have a crammed, packed day today without any votes. The votes will \nbe stacked for tomorrow. But Tuesday is going to be one of those most, \nmost difficult times.\n  It appears to me, unless we can move in much quicker fashion than we \nhave thus far, we are going to find ourselves tomorrow night into one \nof those situations where the Senate looks awfully bad. That is when we \nrun out of the allotted time that has been yielded on the budget \namendment, that is 25 hours on each side, and then we get ourselves \ninto a situation where Members of the Senate insist upon offering \nadditional amendments--and they have that right--but even though we \njust put up the amendment, there is no debate whatsoever. And then we \nimmediately go to a rollcall vote.\n\n  It always seems to me if historians would ever look at the U.S. \nSenate and address some of our worst, our unproductive moments, it \nwould be that time that typically happens with the budget resolution, \nthat is voting without debate, voting oftentimes without a majority of \nthe Senate even having the slightest idea of what the amendment is \ndesigned to do.\n  So this is the time to offer amendments. I hope on this Monday \nmorning, before reckoning day Tuesday, we would get these amendments \nintroduced. At the present time we already have 20 votes scheduled for \ntomorrow. Even if those were 10-minute votes, which all of them cannot \nbe, we can see the difficult timeframe we are in.\n  Also tomorrow, Tuesday, is going to be shortened by what I was \nadvised recently, by the fact we will, most of us, will be going to a \nmemorial ceremony at I believe 11 o'clock tomorrow morning at the \nNational Cathedral as a result of the death of the late, great Admiral \nBoorda. So, that is going to take time out of our day tomorrow. I \nsimply appeal to Senators on both sides of the aisle to come down now, \noffer your amendments, curtail as much debate time as we can so we can \nmove ahead.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4008\n\n  There was an amendment introduced this morning by the Senator from \nMissouri that I would like to make some comments on in opposition. The \npending business I make reference to is the amendment offered by \nSenator Ashcroft, amendment No. 4008.\n  It sounds to me like deja vu all over again. While viewers of the \nSenate may have received the impression--let me repeat that--viewers of \nthe Senate may have received the impression that we are trying to \nreduce the deficit here, it seems that the Senator from Missouri has \nanother thing in mind altogether. He wants to revisit the voodoo \neconomics of the early 1980's that got us into the fiscal mess that the \nUnited States finds itself in today. His amendment would cut taxes \nfirst, before we have done the hard work of cutting the deficit.\n  This Senator is for cutting the deficit above everything else. This \nSenator, and many similarly situated, would like very much to reduce \ntaxes. That is the ultimate goal of a politician these days. It is not \na bad goal. But the thing we have to remember is that we cannot do \neverything at the same time if everyone is going in different \ndirections. And I am afraid that is what is demonstrated above \neverything else, unfortunately, by the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Missouri. He has very specific ideas about where to cut taxes and \nI suppose that everyone favors tax cuts. But he is far less specific \nabout how to come up with the money to pay for it.\n  In what I heard of the Senator's speech, he did not say one word \nabout where the money is coming from. So the arithmetic is simple. Cut \ntaxes by $276 billion over the next 6 years--that is wonderful. That is \nwhat everybody is for. Who can be against that--unless you are sincere \nabout cutting the deficit of the United States of America. I thought \nthat was the No. 1 item of concern for Members on both sides of the \naisle. Cutting taxes by $276 billion over the next 6 years, as \nsuggested by the Senator from Missouri, sounds real good and it is a \nwhopping tax cut. But the problem is, they look around to find the \ndiscretionary savings to pay for this at some later date. That is the \nkind of murky fiscal thinking that has got us into the situation we are \ntrying to address today and have been trying to address for some \nmonths.\n  Mr. President, I need to correct a few things that the Senator from \nMissouri said in his diatribe against government. That is another very \npopular thing to do. Cutting government and carrying on diatribes \nagainst how bad government is is really good politics, but is it good \nsense?\n  The Senator from Missouri said many, many things against government. \nThe Senator would have us believe that the 1993 budget bill is the \ncause of the tax burden on the middle-class citizens of America. \nNothing--nothing, Mr. President--could be further from the truth, in \nreality. In reality, 98 percent of income taxpayers do not pay 1 more \npenny in taxes because of the 1993 tax bill. I wish we had\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\nthe time to go back to listen to the attacks from that side of the \naisle on the 1993 tax bill. It would be astonishing for people to read \nabout the reasons that the people on that side of the aisle voted \nagainst the 1993 tax bill. The 1993 tax bill is the main reason for the \nfact that we have had 3 successive years of reductions in deficit of \nthe Federal Government of the United States of America--something that \nhas not happened since Hector was a pup. The fact of the matter is \nthat, primarily as a result of that bill, we have reduced the annual \ndeficit from the range of $300 billion down to an estimated $140 \nbillion to $147 billion this year. The deficit has been cut by more \nthan half. Millions of working families had their taxes cut because of \nthe changes in the earned-income tax credit in the 1993 bill.\n  Mr. President, there are seldom things that we do around here that \nare perfect. But it seems to me that at a time when we are trying \ndesperately to put things together on both sides of the aisle to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002 and return sanity to the financing \nof the Federal Government, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMissouri is the worst possible step that we could take.\n  Senator Ashcroft's amendment is a budget buster, by any definition. \nSenator Ashcroft has stated that the cost of the proposal would be $276 \nbillion over the next 6 years, over $45 billion annually. Democrats \nrecognize that Social Security taxes present a burden to lower income \ntaxpayers and have, as a result, strongly supported the earned income \ntax credit. The earned income tax credit was designed, in part, to \noffset these costs.\n  Just so that we understand, the earned income tax credit is something \nthat gives the very lowest income people of the United States of \nAmerica a credit to try to get them up above the poverty line, get them \nout of welfare so that we will not have that welfare drain that is \ncontinuing to cause us problems.\n  The Republican budget cuts eliminates that earned income tax credit \nfor the poorest among us by $17 billion over the next 6 years. Last \nyear's Republican budget would have actually increased taxes. It would \nhave increased taxes on those lowest paid people in the United States, \nwhich amounts to about 7 million working families. This year's budget \nmust include many of the same proposals.\n  President Clinton, in his 1993 budget, lowered taxes on working \nfamilies by increasing the earned income tax credit. That is designed \nto get people off welfare, get them to work, and have them contribute \nto society, as we would all like to have them do if they had an income \nabove the poverty level. But I repeat, President Clinton's 1993 budget \nlowered taxes on these working families by increasing the earned income \ntax credit.\n  In 1996, over 15 million families will receive a tax break as a \nresult of that bill. In my State of Nebraska alone, over 78,000 \nfamilies will receive a tax cut averaging about $650 for the year. I \nwant to emphasize once again that those are the lowest paid people in \nthe United States that we are trying to send a lifeline to lift them up \nby their bootstraps, if you will, Mr. President, to give them a chance \nto be what most of them would like to be--successful taxpaying \ncitizens.\n  So when we are talking about cutting Social Security taxes, I simply \nsay that I would like to do that, too. I also say that the Democratic \nParty, under the leadership of President Clinton, has done just that in \nanother form--the earned income tax credit. I am sure that amendment \noffered by the Senator from Missouri is good politics. But it is not \ngood government.\n  I yield the remainder of our time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself what additional time off the \nbill that I may need. I want to drive home again how dire our \ncircumstances are with the constraints of time. As I had announced \nearlier, we have 20 rollcall votes scheduled and more than 5 hours of \nvoting time on Tuesday. If we start voting at 12 noon, we would be \nvoting until 5 o'clock in the afternoon.\n  In addition to that, we have an hour or two that will have to be \ntaken out, obviously, for the memorial service for Admiral Boorda. In \naddition to that, we have the usual two caucuses, or conferences, of \nthe two parties, which takes place at noon. I am also advised that \nsometime during the evening tomorrow, there is a dinner planned for \nSenator Simpson, one of our most distinguished Members, who is retiring \nfrom the Senate.\n  So with that complicating factor, it makes good sense for Senators \nwho can to now come to the floor and offer amendments. I see that, \nwhile I have been talking, my colleague from Texas has come to the \nfloor, as I understand it, to offer an amendment. With that, I am \npleased to yield the floor for the chance for the Senator from Texas to \noffer what I understand is an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4009\n\n(Purpose: To express the Sense of the Congress that the 1993 income tax \n        increase in Social Security benefits should be repealed)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4009.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE CONGRESS THAT THE 1993 INCOME TAX \n                   INCREASE ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS SHOULD BE \n                   REPEALED.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the assumptions \n     underlying this resolution include that--\n       (1) the Fiscal Year 1994 budget proposal of President \n     Clinton to raise federal income taxes on the Social Security \n     benefits of senor citizens with income as low as $25,000, and \n     those provisions of the Fiscal Year 1994 recommendations of \n     the Budget Resolution and the 1993 Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act in which the 103rd Congress voted to raise \n     federal income taxes on the Social Security benefits of \n     senior citizens with income as low as $34,000 should be \n     repealed;\n       (2) that the Senate Resolution should reflect President \n     Clinton's statement that he believed he raised federal taxes \n     too much in 1993; and\n       (3) That the Budget Resolution should react to President \n     Clinton's Fiscal Year 1997 budget which documents the fact \n     that in the history of the United States, the total tax \n     burden has never been greater than it is today, therefore.\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the assumptions \n     underlying this Resolution include--\n       (1) that raising federal income taxes in 1993 on the Social \n     Security benefits of middle-class individuals with income as \n     low as $34,000 was a mistake;\n       (2) that the federal income tax hike on Social Security \n     benefits imposed in 1993 by the 103rd Congress and signed \n     into law by President Clinton should be repealed; and\n       (3) President Clinton should work with the Congress to \n     repeal the 1993 federal income tax hike on Social Security \n     benefits in a manner that would not adversely affect the \n     Social Security Trust Fund or the Medicare Part A Trust Fund, \n     and should ensure that such repeal is coupled with offsetting \n     reductions in federal spending.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am making a modest proposal that the \nPresident and the Congress should work together to go back and fix a \nproblem in the 1993 budget whereby the Democrats, while continuing to \nsay that no American making less than $115,000 a year was going to pay \nmore income taxes as a result of the 1993 Clinton tax increases, raised \ntaxes on Social Security benefits, and the President tried to impose \nthat tax on individuals making $25,000 or more.\n  We ended up in Congress seeing it adopted on a straight party-line \nvote--I am proud to say every Republican voted against it--and taxes \nwere increased on Social Security benefits for any individual who has \nearnings of $34,000, or more.\n  I want to first note that we are already moving toward repealing the \ngasoline tax that was contained in the 1993 Clinton budget. It is my \nbelief that we will break the logjam perhaps this week and allow a vote \non repealing that gasoline tax. I think we will have at least 75 \nMembers of the Senate vote to repeal it. Gasoline prices have risen \ndramatically over the past few weeks, and this is the only way we can \nimmediately lower the cost of gasoline to the American consumer. It is \nimportant to note that, in 1993, for first time in the history of this \ncountry we had a permanent gasoline tax increase that was not dedicated \nto road building.\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\n  Historically the gasoline tax has been a discriminatory tax. It taxes \npeople who live in rural areas more than those who live in urban areas. \nIt taxes people who live in the West more than it taxes those who live \nin the East, and the same is true for those living in the South \nrelative to those in the North. Overall, it hurts most those people who \nhave to drive their cars and their trucks to work.\n  To try to deal with the discriminatory nature of the gasoline tax, \nhistorically we have not used it--at least since we established the \nhighway trust fund--as a permanent revenue source for general \nGovernment. Instead, we have used gasoline taxes to build highways.\n  The argument has been that when people pay the tax, it is essentially \na user fee that goes to build roads. The people who pay the most, \nbecause they drive the most, are the biggest beneficiaries of road \nmaintenance and road improvement.\n  We are well on our way, I hope and believe, to repealing the unfair \ngasoline tax in part because it was the first time a permanent gasoline \ntax went to the general revenue and not to road building. As a result \nof this first even change in the way we handle gasoline taxes, since \n1993 we have been taxing, in the words of our colleague from Missouri, \npeople who have to drive to work for a living in order to subsidize \npeople who do not work.\n  So I think we are well on our way to fixing the first problem with \nthe 1993 tax increase proposed by President Clinton.\n  I am proposing today a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that will begin \nmoving us toward fixing the second problem: the very heavy tax that was \nimposed on Social Security benefits.\n  First of all, I want to dispel this notion, which is still embodied \nin the political rhetoric of the President and of the Members of \nCongress who voted for this tax increase, that the tax increase in 1993 \ndid not raise income taxes on people who made modest incomes. In fact, \ntheir standard line is nobody earning less than $115,000 a year paid \nmore income tax.\n  I want to begin dispelling this notion by looking at the 1994 1040 \nformats and instructions that were mailed to over 100 million \nhouseholds in the country. I think that when we look at this tax form \nwe can immediately see that the people who make the argument that \n``nobody's income tax was raised if they made less than $115,000 a \nyear'' are not leveling with the American people.\n  The way we can do this is first by looking at page 7. This is section \n1 and it says ``Before you fill in form 1040, here is what is new for \n1994.'' As you read down the first column, you see Social Security \nbenefits, and it says, ``If your income, including one-half of your \nSocial Security benefits, is over $34,000, if single--over $44,000, if \nmarried filing jointly--more of your benefits may be taxable. See the \ninstructions for lines 20(a) and 20(b) on page 18 for details.''\n\n  When you look at the actual 1040 tax form--which will be the same \nthis year as well--if you look at line 20(a) you see you have to enter \nthe level of your Social Security benefits, the amount that is taxable \nis added to your income and, therefore, your income taxes go up.\n  Let me tell you why I think this tax needs to be repealed. First of \nall, what we are beginning to do with means testing entitlements and \nwith this confiscatory tax on Social Security benefits, is basically to \ndivide America neatly into two groups: one group of people which pays \nfor programs and the other group which benefits from these programs but \nlargely does not pay for them. When we have reached the point that we \nare imposing a confiscatory tax on Social Security benefits for people \nwho earn $34,000 a year, what we are really saying to working Americans \nis, ``If you say save for your retirement, if you build up a private \nretirement fund, if you build up an annuity, if you save your money, \nand if you use the ability you had during your working lifetime to \nprovide for your retirement, we are going to come in and take a \nsubstantial part of your Social Security benefits away from you. But, \nif you do not provide for your future, if you do not save, and if you \ndo not build up your retirement, then you are not going to lose your \nSocial Security benefits.''\n  What we are in fact doing is we are encouraging Americans not to \nbuild up their private retirement because, if they do, we will then \ncome in and take their benefits away from them. This is a part of a \nlarger movement toward what is called means testing in all areas of \nAmerican government.\n  Basically the approach today is to say, if you earn a benefit and pay \nfor it, great, but unless you meet an income test, even though you paid \nfor the benefit, you do not get it. My view is that it would be wiser \nto divide earned benefits from unearned benefits. Under this system, if \nsomeone has earned a benefit by paying for it, they ought to get it, \nbut if they are getting something they have not earned, then their \neligibility should be judged based on their income. I believe that of \nall the provisions in the President's 1993 tax bill, the Social \nSecurity portion was probably the most unfair--even the President tried \nto hide what he was doing. If you will remember in the debate and all \nof the materials that were presented by the administration, what they \ntried to do was to argue that, well, if your mother has $34,000 of \nincome, she is actually much richer because she probably owns her own \nhome, and, if she moved out and lived in a tent, she could rent her \nhouse and you could count that as her income; or if she owns a \nrefrigerator, if she sold it or rented it, she could earn income on it; \nor even if she has insurance--these were all considered sources of \nincome. According to the administration, for the first time in American \nhistory that I am aware of, in 1993, the Democrats talked about imputed \nincome, and it seems to me that what the Democrats were trying to do \nwas trying to hide the fact that they were taxing Social Security \nbenefits--the President wanted to tax individuals making $25,000 or \nmore; Congress adopted a tax on those earning $34,000 or more.\n\n  What I am doing in this amendment is very simple. First, I am noting \nthe fact that income taxes were raised--you can see that right here on \nthe 1040 form. There is no doubt about it; this Social Security tax is \nnot some separate tax, it is part of your income tax. As every senior \ncitizen know--you take half your Social Security benefits, you add it \nto your outside income, and then you pay taxes on it.\n  What I want to do is to call on the President to join the Congress in \norder to come up with a proposal to repeal this unfair tax, and to \noffset it by cutting spending elsewhere. I am not in this amendment \nsaying ``do it my way,'' I am saying let us work with the President on \na bipartisan basis, and let us do it in such a way that it does not \ndamage either Social Security or Medicare.\n  I remind my colleagues that none of this tax went into the Social \nSecurity trust fund. In fact, permanent law was changed to put the \nmoney in general revenue in order to subsidize cost overruns in \nMedicare. What we need to do is to work with the President to try to \ncome up with a way to repeal this unfair tax. I think this is a tax \nthat should have never been adopted. I remind my colleagues that the \nPresident said in 1994 he raised taxes too much. I think the gasoline \ntax was one of those taxes, I think Social Security is another of those \ntaxes, and I think it is very important that this tax be repealed.\n  One final point, I see several of my other colleagues are here, but I \nwant to reiterate a point that I made the other day. Something is wrong \nin these debates when the people who want to raise taxes always argue \nthat every tax increase is only on rich people. This was the argument \nmade in 1993, but subsequently, we have discovered that everybody pays \ngasoline taxes. As our colleague from Missouri in the best line of the \ndebate said, the Government is taxing people who are driving to work \nfor a living and giving the money to people who do not work. We now \nfind that the Government is taxing Social Security benefits on people \nwho earn $34,000 a year, but in the continuing rhetoric of those who \nconstantly want to raise taxes, in 1993 we were supposedly only raising \ntaxes on the rich.\n  We have in the budget before us sufficient funding to give a $500 tax \ncredit per child for every working family in America. As we all know, \nthat credit starts to phase out for families who earn higher incomes. \nNo one disputes the fact that 75 percent of the benefits\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\ngo to people who make less than $75,000 a year--in most families by the \ntime they are making substantial amounts of money their children are \nalready grown, so it is not surprising that the well off do not \nqualify.\n  However, have you noticed that the same people who were arguing a \ngasoline tax is only a tax on the rich, and who argued that a Social \nSecurity tax on incomes over $34,000 a year was only a tax on the rich, \nare now claiming that a $500 tax credit per child is a tax cut for the \nrich?\n  When you go back and look at the rhetoric, those who want to raise \ntaxes always claim to be taxing rich people, and whenever anybody else \nproposes cutting taxes, they are accused of wanting to cut the taxes of \nonly rich people. It is as if these taxers believe that everybody who \nworks for a living is rich. It is as if they believe only rich people \npay taxes.\n  The reality, of course, is that in terms of the overall revenues of \nthe country, there are not very many rich people. We could take the \ntotal income of all of the supposedly rich, and still not fund the \nGovernment for the month. Where the real revenues come from is middle \nand upper middle-income working families. What I want to do in my \namendment is to have the Congress go on record as saying the 1993 tax \nhike on Social Security was a mistake, and have the Congress join \ntogether with the President to work out a bipartisan proposal so that \nwe can repeal this Social Security tax. This tax is unfair, it \ndiscourages people from providing for their retirement, it punishes \nthose who saved and sacrificed during their working life, and it takes \nbenefits away from them relative to people who have not saved. That \nclearly is not good public policy. It clearly is not right. I hope we \npass this amendment unanimously, and I urge my colleagues to vote for \nit tomorrow. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I \nunderstand it, my friend from Colorado is offering another amendment \nbefore we have any more debate on the amendment just offered by the \nSenator from Texas?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is correct. I think I can accomplish it in 60 seconds \nand I hope not to disturb or delay the----\n  Mr. EXON. With that--anything to preserve time--I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4010\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that there should be a cap \n    on the application of the civilian and military retirement COLA)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4010.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CAPPING FEDERAL \n                   RETIREMENT COLAS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that there should be a COLA for only that portion of \n     individual civilian and military pension levels that do not \n     exceed $75,000 per year.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as one looks at the budget, the enormous \ngulf that faces us down the road is clearly related to entitlement \nprograms and the prospect that many of our entitlement programs will \nliterally be insolvent as we get into the years 2010 and 2020. I want \nto address that.\n  One of the problems with addressing this is that many of these \nbenefits are earned. Reasonable limitations, for example, on \nentitlement programs merit consideration; it would be wise policy, but \nthe major problem is that we do not want to make changes retroactively.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It proposes a sense of the \nSenate that I hope will result in reconciliation reconstruction that \nsays any military or civilian retirement paid by the Federal Government \nis entitled to a full COLA on the first $75,000 but that portion above \n$75,000 will not generate an additional COLA.\n  Mr. President, why is it important? It would not save that much money \nonly from the very, very high pensions right now. It is important \nbecause while there are very few pensions above $75,000 a year right \nnow, 30 years from now there will be a large number of them and this in \n34 years will save literally tens of billions of dollars. It is a way \nof helping to stabilize those funds and make sure that they do not go \ninsolvent in the future and do it in a way so that it does not affect \npeople retroactively.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4009\n\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I should like to return and take time for \nthe remarks I am about to make in opposition to the Gramm amendment \nthat was offered a few moments ago.\n  Mr. President, first, on the Gramm amendment sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I want to explain exactly what a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is, so that everyone outside the Senate knows what it is? A \nsense of the Senate merely means that the Senate is saying, without \nhaving any effect whatsoever of law, that this is probably something \nthat we should do. Therefore, the sense-of-the-Senate proposition \noffered by the Senator from Texas is not binding, is not going to \naccomplish anything, but it might make some people feel good, and it \nmay well be a good political base for the majority party in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  It is not unlike the amendment previously offered in this regard by \nthe Senator from Missouri that I have made some comments on. I happen \nto feel that while we can have differences of opinion on all of these \nthings, I simply say that the world is not going to turn around, nor is \nany law going to turn around, by long debate, as if it were fundamental \nto the free enterprise system, or wasting time on sense-of-the Senate \nresolutions. That, in my view, does not make sense.\n  Mr. President, the President's historic deficit reduction package \nasks the top 13 percent of Social Security recipients--only the top 13 \npercent of Social Security recipients--to pay taxes on those funds. \nEvery penny of the revenue from this provision went to strengthen the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  The Senator from Texas conveniently overlooked that when he said, \nquite cleverly, that not 1 penny of this tax on the highest 13 percent \nof the recipients in Social Security went back into the Social Security \ntrust fund. That is true, but that is the trouble with debate \noftentimes on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are talking in half-\ntruths, and half-truths confuse the American people.\n  By and large, people who draw Social Security, and qualify to do so \nafter having paid in, are in the Medicare trust fund. We have heard a \ngreat deal about Medicare's being insolvent and going broke. I said on \nthe floor of the Senate last week that a lot of that was merely to \nscare senior citizens.\n  Where would the Medicare trust fund be today if the President had not \ndecided and the Congress had not acted to make the top 13 percent \nhighest paid recipients of Social Security pay some tax since the funds \ngo directly into their Medicare trust fund to help them out when they \nget sick.\n  This whole debate is phony, especially at a time when the Republican \nmajority is hammering, suggesting increased premium payments for \nMedicare, when the majority is cutting Medicare far more than is \nnecessary, and at a time when the majority is ``doing in'' rural \nhospitals. At the same time, they are turning around and drawing up the \n1993 tax bill as a means of a political attack during a very political \nyear.\n  I must say, for the information of the Senate, since the Republicans \nare\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\nbringing up the 1993 tax bill and saying how bad it was, that I think \nevery reasonable person would agree that because of the 1993 tax bill, \nfor the first time in modern history we have had a steady 3-year \ndecline in the annual deficit from above $300 billion down to under \n$150 billion. That helps the senior citizens and that helps America. \nBut here they are dragging up 1993 all over again.\n  If they want to talk about 1993, we at the present time are going to \nproduce some research, and if we are going to waste the time of this \nbody while we are considering a very important matter of balancing the \nbudget, bringing it into balance by the year 2002, I will take some \ntime to talk about what some Members on that side of the aisle said \nabout the 1993 tax bill. I have been handed some statements already, \nbut I will save those for another time.\n  If we are just going to be out here talking, talking, talking, \ntalking about restoring cuts in Social Security taxes to the top 13 \npercent highest income recipients of Social Security, and if we are \ngoing to be talking about that and saying how important it is and how \nunfair it was for the President of the United States to do that, then I \nthink, likewise, people who are even proposing this in the form of a \nsense of the Senate should come up and say, ``Where are they going to \nget the money?'' Where in the world are they going to get the money to \ndo all of these things that they claim they want to do, which they are \nnot doing with a meaningless, ineffective sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution? Is that being honest with the American people?\n\n  So I simply say to my colleague from Texas, what he should do, if he \nis serious about this, is to say, ``Where is the money going to come \nfrom,'' because every time we have a Republican get up with these kinds \nof arguments, Mr. President, this logical question deserves an answer. \nFine, we sure want to cut taxes, and we will go with you. Tell us where \nthe money is going to come from to balance the budget by the year 2002, \nwhich I thought, and I am beginning to have second thoughts, was one of \nthe main tenets of the Republicans' efforts.\n  The 1993 tax bill that they are now attacking, once again, did not \naffect retirees who only rely on Social Security. Eighty-seven percent \nof Social Security recipients have not paid 1 penny more--let me \nrepeat, 87 percent have not paid 1 penny more. Only the top 13 percent \nof Social Security recipients were affected by those provisions. Those \nbeneficiaries live in households with an average net worth of over $1 \nmillion.\n  Social Security benefits were first made subject to taxation in 1984 \nwhen Ronald Reagan was President of the United States. Ronald Reagan's \nSocial Security provision affected 69 percent of older Americans who \nhave lower income. Howard Baker was the Senate Republican majority \nleader and Bob Dole was the chairman of the Finance Committee. When I \nam forced to go back and make statements like this, I say to myself, \n``Jim Exon, you are doing the same thing that the Republicans are \ndoing. You're talking about history to make political points.'' \nTherefore, Mr. President, I am going to get off that, I am going to \nheed my own advice, if they will simply let up on that side about \noffering amendments that make no sense, offering amendments that will \nmake it impossible for us to balance the budget by the year 2002, at \nthe very time they are talking about offering a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  With the attitude I am hearing from that side of the aisle, Mr. \nPresident, I wonder if the American people fully realize where they are \ntrying to take us, and if they are sincere in what they are offering. \nMaybe it is all just politics.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor with an appeal once again that we \ncan get this job done. We can balance the budget if we will be honest \nwith each other. But I say we will never do it, Mr. President, if we \nare going to continue the type of diatribe that we are receiving on the \nfloor of the Senate right now, this fiscal conservative will not be a \npart of.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. This \namendment is a sense of the Senate that the Social Security tax \nproposed by the President and passed in 1993 should be repealed. Let me \nfirst respond directly to one of the comments just made by the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I will tell him where this money is coming from. It is \ncoming straight from the frugal, prudent, hard-working Americans who \nsacrificed and invested in America.\n  This tax penalizes the people who have saved for their retirement. In \nWashington, when we talk about cutting taxes, everybody asks ``Where is \nit going to come from if you allow people to keep their own money?'' I \nfeel totally comfortable telling the seniors that they are going to be \nable to keep a little bit more of the money that they worked for, that \nthey have earned, that they have saved.\n  There were so many things in that 1993 tax increase of $265 billion \nthat I thought were wrong, the gas tax being one of them, for a \nvarieties of reasons. That hits every American that drives an \nautomobile, a truck, a boat, or flies in an airplane. Everybody got hit \nby that. I objected to it when it was proposed and enacted.\n  But this one got me the most because we are taxing the Social \nSecurity benefits of our retirees, our seniors. It raised the \npercentage of taxable benefits from 50 percent to 85 percent. In my \nopinion, this was the most offensive of all the tax increases included \nin that package.\n  Was it going to go, though, into the Social Security trust fund? No. \nWas it going to go directly into reducing the deficit? No. It was moved \nover into another account. This is a precedent that really worries me. \nWe have started down a road here that I believe is wrong and will come \nback to haunt us many times.\n  This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on the budget resolution. But \nthere is no reason why we should not--and I hope that we will before \nthis year is out in a bill that comes from the Finance Committee--\nrepeal this unbelievable 1993 tax increase.\n  We fought it in 1993. I offered amendments in the Budget Committee to \nknock it out. I offered those amendments on the floor. They were \ndefeated basically on a party-line vote; although, as I recall, I think \nmaybe some Democrats actually did vote to knock it out, too. We fought \nit then, and we should not give up the fight now. That is why I \nintroduced S. 50, a bill to repeal this onerous tax and why I am here \ntoday in support of Senator Gramm's amendment.\n  We have taken action this year, at long last, to finally raise the \nlimit on earnings that our seniors can keep without being forced to \ngive up part of their Social Security benefits. At this point--or up \nuntil we made that change--if people between 65 and 70 made over \n$11,500 a year, they would start losing some of their benefits. At \nleast we are going to now hopefully get that raised up to $30,000. I \nhope we will continue to move to completely eliminate this earnings \ntest.\n  I ask people when I make speeches around this city, and back at home \nin Mississippi, ``Can you defend the fact that we have penalized people \nin just that age group?'' You do not have the same penalty if you are \n71. But if you are 67, and you want to keep working and being \nproductive and making a contribution and paying taxes, you get \npenalized. So the law that we passed recently to raise the threshold \nwas one step in the right direction that we have made. And this is \nanother one that we can make and we should make.\n\n  Some people say, ``Oh, my goodness, once again you're worrying about \ntaxing the rich. Yes, they may be elderly, but they must be rich.'' \nWell, as I recall, when the President sent this proposal up to us, it \nstarted to tax benefits if people had incomes of the princely sum of \n$25,000. In my State of Mississippi you can get by on that, but that is \nnot rich anywhere in America. As a result of our efforts to kill this \ntax increase outright, we finally wound up getting that up to $34,000 a \nyear. Once again, I ask you, is that somebody rich? I mean, if you have \nincome of $34,000 a year, then you are hit with this tax. And the \nnumber of people who have to pay this unfair tax will increase each \nyear because the thresholds are not indexed.\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\n  I think there is nothing crueler that we could do when we are \nencouraging our seniors to stay involved and be productive than to \npenalize savings and working. It is harmful to the economy.\n  We hope to make some changes in the tax area this year. Most of them \nI believe will help families with children, like the $500 per child tax \ncredit. Some will help economic growth and the creation of jobs. But \nnone is more important, in terms of fairness, than the repeal of this \ntax increase, taxes on Social Security benefits.\n  Some people say, ``Well, it doesn't really affect your income \ntaxes.'' Well, Senator Gramm, from Texas, pointed out that it certainly \ndoes. This is the form 1040. It specifically has a line for reporting \nSocial Security benefits as income.\n  I want to emphasize it again. It says that if your income, including \none-half of your Social Security benefits, is over $34,000 if single, \nor over $44,000 if married filing jointly, your benefits may be \ntaxable. See instructions on lines 20(a) and 20(b) on page 18 for \ndetails.\n  There is no question that this is a tax increase on the elderly's \nincome. I urge my colleagues to quit trying to defend it. Just \nacknowledge that it was a mistake. This is something that we can do for \nour seniors. We should clearly do it. I urge the adoption of this \namendment by my colleague from Texas. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I understand the Senator from Nebraska \nhas a question.\n  Mr. EXON. Would the Senator yield for a brief question, because I \nknow that the Senator from North Dakota has worked long and very hard \non this proposition? I assume that he is going to be talking about the \nefforts that he and I and others have been trying to put forth to bring \nsanity back into the financial structure of America.\n  Yet I am very much concerned about the fact that we have people on \nthe other side who are making critical statements and offering \nmeaningless amendments to give them a forum to talk about things that \ndo not make any sense. But the latest I hear now once again is this cry \nto reduce taxes on Social Security recipients. OK, I am for reducing \ntaxes on everybody.\n  The question I ask the Senator from North Dakota, who has done lots \nof research and is considered an expert on this, has the Senator heard \nor does the Senator understand, if we would adopt something like they \nare suggesting on that side into law, have they stipulated where the \noffset would be or does that just come from the tooth fairy?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Nebraska asks a very good question. I \nwas thinking next of offering an amendment that would repeal all taxes. \nLet us repeal them all. Of course, I do not have to pay for such a \nproposal in the context of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution--just as \nsome have not paid for their proposals.\n  I must say, for sheer hypocrisy, the presentations I have heard this \nmorning go beyond almost anything I have heard in a long time. I guess \nit is an indication that we are close to an election. On the one hand, \nour colleagues on the other side say they want to reduce the deficit \nand balance the budget. Yet they also propose reductions in income to \nthe Federal Government without a replacement, which is the height of \nhypocrisy, and it is precisely what got this country into trouble in \nthe 1980's.\n\n  I would like to demonstrate this point with some charts. We can see \nwhat has happened with the deficit when our friends across the aisle \nwere in charge.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a follow up question in that \nregard?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. EXON. As long as we are talking about history--they are talking \nabout 1993. I would just like to ask my friend from North Dakota, \nbecause I believe he will know the answer, in 1983, when Ronald Reagan \nwas President of the United States and the Republicans were in control \nof the U.S. Senate, President Reagan recommended that we, at that time, \npass the very first--the very first--tax on Social Security recipients \nabove a certain income level. Am I correct in that? That was the year, \nwas it not?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that is correct, that that was part of the 1983 \nact, which imposed a tax on Social Security of retirees.\n  Mr. EXON. I am wondering if the Senator from North Dakota would, \noffhand, know how the Senators who are now assailing that action by \nPresident Clinton, how they voted on the first act in this regard?\n  The Senator from Missouri was not a Member of either the House or the \nSenate at that time, but I believe the other Members of the Senate who \nare now assailing this, as if it were a new violation of the rights of \nSocial Security recipients--would my colleague know offhand how they \nvoted on that first act President Reagan suggested back in 1983?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not presume to know how they voted. But I assume, \nsince it was a recommendation from President Reagan, they may have \nsupported their President in that recommendation.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just say, this is one of those \nthings that is very easy to come out here and demagogue. It is \nprecisely what is wrong in this country--not just wrong on their side \nof the aisle; we have plenty of it on our side of the aisle, too. It is \nexactly why this country is in trouble. Because the easiest thing in \nthe world to support are policies that increase the deficit and add to \nthe debt. That is exactly what has been going on here since 1980.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the deficit since 1980--this is \nexpressed in dollar terms. In 1980, the deficit that President Reagan \ninherited was about $70 billion. But look what happened during the \nReagan years. The deficit absolutely exploded. It went up to over $200 \nbillion a year, finally hitting over $220 billion in 1986. The unified \nFederal budget deficit then came down as measured in dollar terms, and \nstabilized throughout the rest of President Reagan's term.\n  Then we got a new President, President Bush, and the deficit took off \nagain. There was a dramatic increase. The deficit went up to $290 \nbillion in 1992, the year before Bill Clinton became President of the \nUnited States. Since Bill Clinton has been President, these deficits \nhave come down each and every year. The deficit in dollar terms has \nbeen cut in half since 1992.\n  Why did this happen? It happened because some of us had the courage \nto vote for a package in 1993 that, yes, raised taxes, primarily on the \nwealthiest 1 percent in this country. It also cut spending. The \ncombination, an increase in taxes primarily aimed at those who are the \nwealthiest among us, coupled with cuts in spending, cut the deficit in \nhalf. Bill Clinton deserves credit for that.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle, when that 1993 deficit \nreduction bill passed, said it would crater the economy. They said it \nwould add to unemployment. They said it would put us in a recession. \nThey were wrong. They were wrong on every count. It reduced the \ndeficit. As I have indicated, it cut the deficit in half. But not only \ndid it reduce the deficit, it reduced interest rates, it sparked an \neconomic recovery that has created over 8.5 million new jobs.\n\n  Beyond that, we have had the highest level of business investment in \n30 years. We have had strong economic growth. The result has been a \nresurgent American economy. This country is now rated the most \ncompetitive nation in the world. One of the key reasons is because we \nreduced the deficit in 1993.\n  Now, some on the other side of the aisle, seeking political \nadvantage, want to go to the heart of things that contributed to that \npackage of deficit reduction. What a profound mistake that would be. We \nshould not allow deficits to start going back up, year after year, and \nto put the country back behind the 8-ball of debt. Debt, deficits and \ndecline, Mr. President. Those are the three ``D's'' of those in the \n1980's who put this country on a diet of endless deficits and debt. \nWhat a profound mistake it would be to go on that course once again.\n  I want to make clear, the Senator from Missouri has proposed an \noffset for his tax reductions. I do not put him in the same category of \nothers who do not. I disagree with the spending cuts the Senator from \nMissouri has proposed, but at least he has had the honesty to stand up \nand say how he would\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\npay for his amendment. I commend him for having the forthrightness to \nsay how he would pay for those tax cuts. That is the way we ought to do \nbusiness here. Then we can have an honest debate about whether those \nspending cuts are wise or not.\n  But I must say, I have no respect for people who stand on this floor \nand propose reducing revenue and do not say how they are going to pay \nfor it. That is precisely what got us in this spot we are in today.\n  The first chart I used today showed unified Federal budget deficits \nin dollar terms, and the record of our two previous Presidents. This \nnext chart shows it in a little different way. This next chart shows, \nas a percentage of our gross domestic product, what has happened to the \ndeficits. In other words, these are the deficits in relationship to the \nsize of our economy.\n  Again, one can see the pattern. Under President Reagan, the deficit \nsoared from about 3 percent of our gross domestic product to over 6 \npercent. The deficit as a percent of GDP then came back down as deficit \nreduction measures were put in place, to still over 3 percent. Then \nPresident Bush came into office and once again deficits soared as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product or as a percentage of the size \nof our economy. Then Bill Clinton took over in 1992, and the deficits \nhave come down sharply as measured against the size of the gross \ndomestic product--a very good start. It does not finish the job. We \nhave much more that needs to be done for deficit reduction.\n  Some say deficit reduction is not so important. Some say we now have \nthe lowest deficits in the industrialized world, that we have made \ngreat progress. We are OK.\n  Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. We have made \nsignificant progress. We have cut the deficit in half. We have cut the \ndeficit, compared to the size of the economy, in half. We have the \nlowest deficits of any of the industrialized countries.\n  The problem, Mr. President--and I would say the occupant of the Chair \nknows this well as a distinguished member of the Budget Committee--the \nproblem is, we have the baby-boom generation coming, and we have a \ndemographic time bomb that we have to face.\n  Mr. President, this next chart shows where we are headed, in terms of \nour national debt. Very often people are confused at the difference \nbetween the deficit and the debt. The Federal budget deficit is the \nyearly amount that we spend over and above what we take in in \nrevenue. The deficit is the annual difference between what we take in \nand what we spend. The deficit has been coming down. The debt is the \ncumulative total of all of our deficits. Obviously, as long as we \ncontinue to run deficits, the debt will continue to mount.\n\n  This chart shows what will happen to the gross Federal debt with no \naction, with no further deficit reduction. Mr. President, it shows that \nwhen Ronald Reagan took over as President, the debt was less than $1 \ntrillion in this country, about $900 billion. Look what has happened \nsince that time. The debt has gone up and up and up and up. Mr. \nPresident, that is a course that is unsustainable. It is especially \nunsustainable when one recognizes that we have the baby boom generation \ncoming along. Medicare is currently among the fastest growing of any \nprogram in the Federal budget in terms of its cost. When baby boomers \nstart to retire, the number of people who are eligible for programs \nlike Medicare and Social Security will double from 24 million to 48 \nmillion. Then, Mr. President, we will truly be in a circumstance in \nwhich we will face a budget calamity. That budget calamity has been \noutlined for us very clearly. If we fail to act, future generations \nwill face either an 82 percent lifetime net tax rate or a one-third cut \nin all benefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask those who are listening, those who may be senior \ncitizens who are hearing that their taxes may be cut, I ask them to \nthink, what does it mean to your grandchildren if we do not get our \nfiscal house in order? If future generations in this country face an \n82-percent lifetime net tax rate--yes, I am not misspeaking; an 82-\npercent tax rate, or a one-third cut in all benefits--because that is \nwhere we are headed if we do nothing.\n  Mr. President, let me put it another way. Last year the Entitlements \nCommission, on a bipartisan basis, told us that by the year 2012, if we \nfail to change course, every penny of the Federal budget will go for \njust entitlements and interest on the debt. There will be no money for \nany of the other things that people say they need in this country, \nwhether it is parks, education, or law enforcement. There will be no \nmoney for any of that. All of it will go for just entitlements and \ninterest on the debt by the year 2012. Mr. President, that is why we \nmust take action.\n  I have shown the chart that shows what has happened to the growth of \nthe debt in dollar terms. It is skyrocketing. There is a little \ndifferent picture that emerges when one looks at debt as a percentage \nof our gross domestic product. In other words, roughly speaking, debt \nin relationship to the size of our economy. There, too, one can see the \ntrend line. It has been extremely unfavorable. We had a national debt, \nas a percentage of our gross domestic product, it was just over 30 \npercent in 1980. Look what has happened. The debt, measured against the \nsize of our economy, measured against the gross domestic product, has \nbeen rising, rising, rising. This is a course that is unsustainable. It \nis now, as we meet here in 1996, up to 70 percent. I say to my \ncolleagues, we faced a much higher debt in relationship to our gross \ndomestic product after World War II. At that time, debt to GDP was over \n120 percent. Under every President and under every Congress from after \nWorld War II until 1980, the debt measured against the size of our \neconomy, measured against the gross domestic product, declined--\ndeclined, went down.\n  Look what happened after the Reagan administration, after we heard \nthis same swan song that you can cut revenue and you will get more \nincome and it will all add up. Hooey. Absolute hooey. It was a \ndisaster. It added to the deficits, it added to the debt, and it \ncreated economic decline in this country because interest rates were \nforced up, made this country less competitive, and hurt every sector of \nour economy. Let us not repeat that mistake. That would be a profound \nerror for the economy of this country.\n  Mr. President, the good news is since the Clinton administration and \nCongress passed the 1993 deficit reduction bill, the debt as a \npercentage of GDP has leveled off. It has quit soaring and it has \nleveled off. Now, Mr. President, what we need to do is start the debt \nas a percentage of GDP going down, to put it in decline. That is our \nresponsibility. That is our challenge. The best way to do that, Mr. \nPresident, is to adopt a budget plan that cuts spending because further \ndeficit reduction, at least in my judgment, should be based on reducing \nspending, not on further tax increases.\n\n  In fact, I have been part of a group, a bipartisan group, 22 \nSenators, who will present an alternative plan this evening that not \nonly cuts spending but also has a modest tax cut as well. Mr. \nPresident, we should not and we cannot have an overall plan that \nincreases the deficit year after year or that fails to move us toward \nbalance. That would be a profound mistake. Let me just show how \nprofound a mistake it is to give up on this deficit battle. I \nunderstand, it is not particularly popular to cut spending, nor is it \nparticularly popular to oppose further tax cuts that are not paid for. \nMr. President, it is critical that we have the courage to do so. The \nfuture of our children is at stake.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows our children's economic position in \nthe year 2025 under two different scenarios. These are not my \nprojections. These are the estimates of the General Accounting Office. \nThis is a study they did a year or two ago. They concluded that if we \ntake no action, by the year 2025 our children's economic position will \nbe at about $28,000 a year. If, instead, we have a balanced budget by \n2002, our children's economic position in the year 2025 will be \nimproved to over $37,000. That is a dramatic difference in the economic \nfutures of our children.\n  The question is, do we have the will to stay on the deficit reduction \ncourse that we have been pursuing for the last 3 years? Do we have the \ncourage to continue to reduce spending? Do we have the courage to \nmaintain the revenue base so these deficits continue to\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\ngo down and so the debt in relationship to the size of the economy \nstarts to go down, so that interest rates are lower, so that more money \nis invested in this country, so that we can have greater economic \ngrowth? You cannot have investment without savings. The best way to \nimprove savings in this country is to stop the ``dissavings'' by the \nFederal Government. The deficits represent dissavings. The deficit \nrepresents reducing the pool of money that is available in our society \nfor investment. It is that investment that will fuel future economic \ngrowth.\n  Mr. President, another way of looking at what the future holds is our \nchildren's debt in 2025. Again, in the no-action scenario versus a \nbalanced unified budget by the year 2002, Mr. President, you can see \nvery clearly under the no-action scenario, our children's debt in 2025 \nwill be over $60,000 for every person in this country. Mr. President, \nthe alternative, if we balance the budget by the year 2002--and that is \nunified balance rather than true balance, but unified balance by 2002--\nour children will have a debt of $4,800 instead of $60,000. That is why \nwe have to be deadly serious about the job of deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, this chart presents where we are headed in a different \nway. It shows very clearly that current trends are not sustainable. \nThis chart shows the total revenues of the United States. Again, this \nis measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product, Federal \noutlays as a percentage of the gross domestic product. The green line \nshows revenue, current revenue, projected until the year 2030. Revenue \nruns right below 20 percent of our gross domestic product. That is \nhistorically what Federal revenue has been. This chart shows \ndiscretionary spending as the blue bar. It shows net interest as a \nyellow bar. It shows entitlement spending as a red bar.\n  Look at what this chart shows. This is 1970. Discretionary spending \nwas by far the largest. Entitlements were relatively small in \ncomparison. By 1980, discretionary spending was about the same size as \nentitlement spending. But entitlement spending was growing rapidly.\n  In 1990, the deficit is worse. Discretionary spending is now smaller \nthan entitlement spending. The yellow portion shows interest growing \ndramatically. In the year 2000, you can see the trend--entitlements, \nagain, now much larger than discretionary spending. In 2010, 2020, the \nsame pattern until we reach 2030. By that time all revenue of the \nFederal Government will be eaten up by entitlement spending.\n  Mr. President, this is not a course that is sustainable. I indicated \nthat, later today, a bipartisan group of us--22 Senators, 11 Democrats \nand 11 Republicans--are going to present what we call the centrist \nbudget. It is a compromise between things that Republicans have \nadvocated and policies that Democrats have advocated. It is an attempt \nto break through the gridlock, to actually achieve an agreement so that \nwe can get this country on a course of deficit reduction that is \nsustainable and that will lead to unified balance in the year 2003. It \nis a 7-year plan of deficit reduction, but one that does not only \nreduce the deficits in the next 7 years, but creates a platform that \nwill encourage deficit reduction beyond that point, and that will \nsecure deficit reduction beyond that point because of entitlement \nreforms that are critically important to our economic future.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows what happens under the Republican \nplan that is before us, which is the blue line. The green line is the \nPresident's budget plan. This lighter colored line, is the centrist \nplan. The red line shows what happens if we fail to take action. It is \nthe so-called baseline. You can see that deficits will rise inexorably \nif we fail to take action.\n  Under any of the other three plans, we will see steady downward \nprogress with respect to the deficit.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will give serious consideration \nto the centrist plan when we present it later today. I wanted to \noutline the differences on the 7-year plans between what the \nRepublicans have before us, what the President has advocated, and what \nthe centrist coalition has agreed to.\n  Mr. President, this part of the chart compares the plan on a 7-year \nbasis. It looks at the major categories of spending and compares the \ncentrist plan, the Clinton plan, and the Republican plan. On \ndiscretionary spending, the centrist plan proposes savings of $268 \nbillion over the next 7 years. The Clinton plan, which is a 6-year \nplan, but if you extend the policy for 7 years, would have $312 billion \nof savings out of discretionary spending. The Republican 7-year plan \nwould have $393 billion of savings out of discretionary spending.\n  Our group, the bipartisan group, concluded that both the Clinton plan \nand the Republican plan are unrealistic in their discretionary savings. \nThey are heavily backloaded in both cases --both the Republican plan \nand the President's plan. Frankly, we believe future Congresses are \nunlikely to hold to the path that they have outlined. That is precisely \nwhat has been wrong around here. We adopt plans that do not have any \nrealistic prospect of coming true.\n  Mr. President, on Medicare, which has been such a hot-button issue in \nthis Chamber and across the country, the centrist plan saves $154 \nbillion over 7 years. The President's plan--and, again, he has a 6-year \nplan, but if you extend the policy 7 years, he has about $156 billion \nover 7 years. The Republican plan, $228 billion in savings out of \nMedicare over 7 years.\n  Many of us would conclude that the Republican plan goes too far. \nThose savings are going to require reductions from what current law \nprovides in a way that will be very difficult, especially for rural \nhospitals in the State that I represent.\n  On Medicaid, the centrist plan, $62 billion over 7 years; President \nClinton's plan, $81 billion over that period of time; and the \nRepublican plan before us, $106 billion. Again, this is assuming you \ntake their 6-year policy and extend it to 7. Welfare, EITC, centrist \nplan, $58 billion savings over 7 years; Clinton plan, $52 billion; and \nthe Republican plan, if you take the 6 years of policy and extend it, \n$87 billion.\n  A major difference between the centrist plan and the other plans \nbefore us is that we have made a technical correction to the Consumer \nPrice Index of one-half of 1 percent. I just say, if there are those \nwho are serious about entitlement reform, if there are those who are \nserious that we are on a course that is not sustainable. If there are \nthose who are serious that we face a situation that will lead to either \nan 82-percent lifetime tax rate for future generations or a one-third \ncut in all benefits, because entitlement spending is running out of \ncontrol, a technical correction of one-half of 1 percent in the \nConsumer Price Index is something that will help secure the economic \nfuture for not only senior citizens, but for the American economy as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, economist after economist have told us that the \nConsumer Price Index overstates the cost of living. Of course, we use \nthe Consumer Price Index to alter Social Security payments, to index \nthe tax system, because we want to make adjustments for increases in \nthe cost of living. The problem is that the best evidence we have is \nthat the Consumer Price Index is overstating increases in the cost of \nliving. There is a mistake, and that mistake is very, very costly. A 1 \npercent change in the Consumer Price Index, if it is overstating the \ncost of living by 1 percent, that is over $600 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. President, we had a group of economists--a bipartisan group--\nreview this question for the Senate Finance Committee. They came back \nand told us that the Consumer Price Index overstates the cost of living \nby from 0.7 percent to 2 percent.\n  Mr. President, our bipartisan group decided that we would make a 0.5 \npercent technical correction in the Consumer Price Index in order to \nmore accurately reflect the cost of living. Mr. President, this will \nsave $125 billion over 7 years. Neither of the other plans have this \nfeature. I believe this is one of the most important parts of the \ncentrist coalition plan. It is a significant long-term entitlement \nreform that will help to get us off the unsustainable fiscal course we \nare on.\n  I say to my colleagues, if we cannot make this kind of technical \ncorrection, which has been supported by Alan Greenspan--he said the \noverstatement of the cost of living by the Consumer Price Index is most \nlikely 1 percent, and Alice Rivlin in her book of deficit\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\nreduction options that she put out indicated the overstatement may be \nfrom 0.4 percent to 1.5 percent. As I stated previously, a bipartisan \ngroup of economists, led by Michael Boskin, former chairman of the \nEconomic Advisers under President Bush, recommended the overstatement \nis from 0.7 percent to as much as 2 percent. Our group has said that we \nought to at least make a change of 0.5 percent and save $125 billion.\n  On the question of tax cuts, we do have a tax cut in the centrist \nplan. Not all of us thought it was the better part of wisdom. Mr. \nPresident, the view prevailed in our group that there ought to be a tax \nreduction. I personally believe that we ought to balance the unified \nbudget first. I mean, I have been here 9 years. I have heard over and \nover the swan song that we have a plan that is going to reduce the \ndeficit, and over and over the deficit has gone up. It has not gone \ndown. Only after the 1993 plan that we on this side supported, did we \nactually see the deficit go down both in dollar terms and measured in \nterms of our gross domestic product.\n  Mr. President, over and over before that we were told there were \nplans that were going to reduce the deficit. They did not. They failed. \nMy own judgment is we that ought to prove that we are balancing the \nbudget and getting the job done before there is a tax reduction. But \nthat was not the view of the centrist group. The consensus was there \nought to be a tax reduction.\n  So in our group there is a net tax reduction of $105 billion over 7 \nyears. That compares to the Republican plan of $151 billion over 7 \nyears and President Clinton's plan, which is roughly a wash over a 7-\nyear period, if you extend the first 6 years' policy.\n  Mr. President, we will have a lot more to say about the centrist plan \nlater tonight. I feel deeply that the greatest challenge facing this \nbody and facing this country is to stay on the path of deficit \nreduction. Let us not be distracted by those who say that we cannot cut \nanything. That is not right. And let us not be distracted by those who \nsay we can cut taxes and we will get more revenue. We heard that swan \nsong before. All it led to was escalating deficits, escalating debt, \nand a decline in the strength of this country.\n  I hope deeply that we have the courage to stay on the course of \ndeficit reduction. The only group that on a bipartisan basis has been \nable to reach agreement is this centrist coalition of 22 Senators--11 \nDemocrats and 11 Republicans. All we have gotten around this town in \nthe last year has been partisanship and gridlock. I suppose, if you \nwere looking at where we are and where we are headed, you would say the \ngreatest likelihood is that, with the course that we will stay on in an \nelection year, that there is a low probability that we will be able to \nget together and do something even as important as putting together a \nplan that will allow us to achieve significant deficit reduction over \nthe next 7 years. I hope very much that the conventional wisdom is \nwrong. I hope very much that somehow out of the partisanship of an \nelection year, we will find the ability and the will to work together \nto do something which would be great for our country, which is to \nreduce the deficit, keep us on a path moving toward balance so that we \ncan reduce interest rates, so that we can see this economic revival \ncontinue and strengthen, and so that we can look at our children and \nsay honestly that we are helping to secure their economic futures.\n  Mr. President, nothing could be more clear than that deficit \nreduction has helped strengthen this economy. That is a course we ought \nto stay on. That is a commitment that we ought to make to each other, \nthat somehow we find a way to bridge the differences and reach \nagreement, agreement on a plan to at least give us a unified balance by \nthe year 2003. We can do that. The model is before us. We have a group \nof Senators who on a bipartisan basis have done it.\n  Mr. President, let us complete the job. I thank the Chair. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair as to the pending \namendment and as to the time remaining on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Gramm amendment. \nThe sponsor has 35 minutes 45 seconds, and the other side has 8 minutes \n54 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair please inform me when there are 25 \nminutes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor acknowledging in his remarks that my particular amendment contained \noffsets. There was some misunderstanding about that. The Senator from \nNebraska indicated that we had been inadequately focused on offsets. \nThe truth of the matter is I would not propose reductions in taxes \nwithout reductions in spending. I think that is important.\n  I want to make a few remarks about the Gramm amendment because I \nthink it is related to the things that ought to concern us the most.\n  The Gramm amendment talks about relief for individuals who are paying \ntaxes on their Social Security benefits. But what is interesting to me \nis that the Democratic side of the aisle seems to be so reluctant to \ngrant that relief. There seems to be every reason to say that the \nrelief is appropriate, because when a worker pays his Social Security \ntax--that is a tax, and the worker, under our current law, has to pay \nincome tax on the money that he uses to pay his Social Security tax. So \nthat is a double tax.\n  Then, if the individual gets that money back from the Government and, \nbecause he is working, he has to pay a tax on that money again, that is \na triple tax. The old song ``Sixteen Tons'' said it right. ``If the \nright one doesn't get you, the left one will.'' But it looks to me like \nin this instance we say, ``If the right one doesn't get you and the \nleft one misses you, we are going to kick you out of the ballpark.'' It \nis just simply wrong for us to tax the money first, then to ask people \nto pay the Social Security tax with what is left over, and then when \nthe person is eligible for the Social Security to tax them a third \ntime.\n  I do not know why the Democratic side of the aisle would insist on \nthis triple whammy. It is just unreasonable, inappropriate, and \ncounterproductive. It inhibits growth and stifles the enterprise that \nwe want people to continue to have into their later years in life.\n  Senator Gramm has cogently outlined his proposal. Senator Lott spoke \nclearly in its behalf. Somehow to let people have money that they have \nalready paid tax on twice seems to be an affront to the folk on the \nother side of the aisle. We need to understand that when people earn \nmoney, it is their money, and taxing it once is enough. Taxing it twice \nis an outrage. Taxing it three times is just totally unacceptable. The \ntriple tax that exists here is something that we ought to abandon and \nabandon rapidly.\n  Senators from other side of the aisle have stood to talk about and \nquestion the sincerity of people on this side of the aisle as it \nrelates to tax relief. They have said that every time we propose tax \nrelief it increases the deficit.\n  Well, that is kind of an interesting thing that suggests because we \nlowered tax rates, somehow there was less money coming into the \nGovernment, and because there was less money, we had much, much higher \ndeficits.\n  Frankly, that misrepresents, misguides, misleads and promotes \nmisunderstanding in the public. They talk about the so-called siren \nsong of lowered tax rates, and they say it always leads to higher \ndeficits. I do not think so.\n  I quote from an article in the Wall Street Journal. As a matter of \nfact, these statistics were provided to the Journal by Senator Abraham \nfrom the State of Michigan. ``The growth of real tax revenues was 65 \npercent higher per year in the low tax rate 1980's than in the high tax \nrate 1990's. From 1982 to 1989, Federal revenues adjusted for inflation \nexpanded by an average of 3.8 percent per year despite a sharp \nreduction in tax rates.'' So what we had in those years was lower tax \nrates, but because of the growth in the economy, we had higher revenues \nfor the Government.\n  Now, that was a formula for growth. It was a formula where \nindividuals could find growth in their own lives. It was a way to have \na better economy. It was a way to decrease the deficit. When you have \nmore money coming in, the only way to increase the deficit is to\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\nhave sharply increased spending. Conveniently, those on the Democratic \nside of the aisle in this Chamber never associate the deficit of the \n1980's with the sharply increased spending. They want to talk about a \nreduction in tax rates. They never want to talk about the fact that the \ntax revenues went up and that their spending went up much, much higher \nthan the revenues. And I do not blame them for their reticence. But the \ntruth is that every time the other side of the aisle talks about \ndeficit reduction, it means more money out of the American working \nperson's pocket. Every time they talk about debt, Americans should grab \ntheir wallets, because the only way they see to reduce the federal debt \nis to increase taxes. They do not see debt reduction by way of \ncurtailing spending, and they certainly do not see it as a means of \ngrowth.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for recognizing that my \namendment to stop making people pay income tax on their Social Security \ntax includes cuts in spending which fully offset any costs. Some \nspeakers on the Democratic side of the aisle literally questioned the \nsincerity of my proposal. I think that is inappropriate, because I know \nwhat it means to operate with fiscal reliability and integrity.\n  During my time as Governor, I learned what it meant to balance a \nbudget. We balanced every one. We did more than that. We established a \ncash flow operating reserve with hundreds of millions of dollars, \nmaking sure that we always could cover our expenditures in a timely \nway. In addition to a cash flow operating reserve, we established a \nrainy day fund for the State so that when troublesome times came, we \ncould have money set aside in advance to accommodate unanticipated \nexpenses. That is not the kind of thing that comes from demagoguery or \ninsincerity. It comes from understanding that if you have the right \ngrowth rate and you have the right restraint in spending, good things \nwill happen.\n  The folks on the other side of the aisle seem to think that it is \nalright to tax the so-called rich--that it is easy to do and it will \nnot hurt anybody. I think that is a fallacy that ought to be exposed. \nTaxing the rich usually hurts everybody. They talk about the fact that \n98 percent of the tax increase of 1993 was on people who were so-called \nrich. Well, you know and I know that their definition of rich is \ndifferent than that of most people.\n\n  Not only that, the point is that by having that tax increase, the \nlargest tax increase in the history of the country, they stifled this \neconomy. They put a lid on it.\n  Although wages were up 1 percent last quarter--listen to this--this \nis the first time in 5 years that wages have inched ahead of increases \nin the cost of living.\n  One quarter out of 5 years we finally had wages get up by 1 percent \nover the cost-of-living increase, and the Democrats are claiming that \ntheir tax increase did not have a negative impact on the economy. I \nwould call that a pretty negative impact. No wonder the people across \nAmerica feel a wage squeeze. We have a situation where economic \nstagnation is hurting folks.\n  The truth of the matter is that workers saw no growth in their income \nin the first 3 years of the Clinton administration compared to robust \nannual growth during the Reagan years. I believe that we ought to be \ngrowing our economy. We ought to be growing it aggressively.\n  Here is what the Heritage Foundation said about the 1993 Clinton tax \nincreases. They said, ``The Clinton tax increases robbed every \nhousehold of $2,100 and cut personal savings by $138 billion.'' When \nyou put a lid on the economy, even with a tax increase which you say \nthreatens only the wealthy, you indeed hurt all of the people.\n  I would ask that the Chair allot me an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator may resume.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So I have risen today to say that yes--we should think \nabout reducing the deficit, but let us think about it by way of \nproviding the restraint in spending which accompanies the tax break in \nmy amendment, so that there would be absolutely no increase in the \nGovernment's debt burden.\n  Second, the economic growth effects of my proposal to provide a \ndeduction for Social Security taxes would help us pay off the debt much \nmore quickly. Since we have already offset all of the loss in revenue, \nthe growth in the economy would provide a tremendous opportunity to \ngarner additional revenue from the 500,000 new jobs from the 0.5-\npercent growth in the gross domestic product, and that would accelerate \nour ability to pay the debt.\n  For the Democrats who are loathe to allow people to spend their own \nmoney and prefer to have Government do all the spending, this should be \na win-win situation. For modest cuts, a 1.8-percent cut in total \nFederal spending in fiscal year 1997, we give the people an opportunity \nto create 500,000 new jobs, 10,000 new jobs in every State, to boost \ngross domestic product by one-half of 1 percent, and to aggravate the \ndeficit not at all. If the economic activity from the surge in jobs and \nthe surge in gross domestic product resulted in the anticipated \nincrease in tax revenues, we would accelerate paying off the debt \nsubstantially. Those who have said they have been around here for years \nand they have heard this song before should talk not about the proposal \nbut should talk about their performance.\n  Their performance in prior years has been, yes, on occasion to cut \ntaxes, but, no, never on occasion to cut spending. On average, spending \nwent up 1\\1/2\\ times for every one time that taxes were reduced. The \ntruth of the matter is, you cannot overgrow spending and have \nreductions in taxes and expect the deficit to disappear, but you can \ncombine the therapeutic impacts of spending cuts and tax cuts together \nto give a one-two punch to the deficit.\n  It is time for us to say that the proposal to reduce the tax burden \non working Americans by providing a deduction for Social Security taxes \nis a responsible one. There are offsets. It is not a set of offsets \nthat are imposed only in the outyears. They begin large and they stay \nlarge, because this is substantial tax relief to the American people. \nIt is not a budget buster, it is a budget booster, because the growth \nin the economy will help all American families. The average American \nfamily with two working adults will benefit by $1,770. For those \nMembers of the opposition who would be interested in a responsible tax \ncut, I invite them to confer with me, because this is one that can be \ndone and will work.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, am I correct in that the Gramm amendment is \nthe amendment before the body at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. EXON. Following my remarks, which will be brief, I ask unanimous \nconsent, since it will be this side of the aisle that will be up for \nthe next amendment, that following my remarks, the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Texas be temporarily set aside so that the Senator \nfrom Iowa can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been listening with keen interest and \nappreciation to my colleague from Missouri with regard to his \namendment. I will simply say to the Senator from Missouri that as him, \nI was the Governor of Nebraska. I will simply say that everything that \nthe Senator from Missouri took credit for during his tenure as the \ndistinguished Governor of a neighboring State follows almost exactly \nthe record of this Senator as a Democratic Governor of the great State \nof Nebraska.\n  So I think, as far as our background credentials are concerned with \nregard to fiscal sanity, we are generally parallel.\n  I simply say that I am opposed to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Missouri for the reasons that I stated previously. We \nstill do not know the details of where the offsets would come from to \nmake up for the big, huge tax decrease that is being suggested.\n  I believe that, while they are not spelled out in the detail that we \nwould anticipate, by and large, most of the cuts that are being \nproposed, without specifics from the Senator from Missouri, will fall \ninto discretionary spending. As has been pointed out by the excellent \naddress to the body by the Senator from North Dakota a few\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nmoments ago, those particular discretionary spending items are the ones \nthat already have been dramatically reduced.\n  I was particularly struck, though, by statements from the Senator \nfrom Missouri with regard to what has happened to the economy. The \nSenator from Missouri indicated that the economy had been stifled--I \nbelieve that was the word, or something akin to it--that the economy of \nthe United States of America had been stifled as a result of the 1993 \naction which, I will point out again, was not supported by a single \nRepublican in the House of Representatives or a single Republican in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  If the economy was stifled as a result of that action, right or \nwrong, then we should do a whole lot more stifling because, by and \nlarge, the economy of the United States has grown at an adequate rate, \nthe stock market has reached the highest record in history during this \nstifled period, unemployment has gone down, and the confidence of the \nAmerican public has gone up. In reality, we have 8.5 million new jobs \nas a result of that stifling that the Senator from Missouri cites. We \nhave a faster growth rate than any other comparable industrialized \nnation in the world.\n  In bringing up the 1993 budget that was authored and suggested by the \nPresident of the United States, the people on the other side of the \naisle are continuing to bring up statements that simply are not \naccurate. Calling the economy of the United States stifled since 1993 \nis something that no one--no one--can justify or believe if one looks \nat the record.\n\n  I indicated earlier that I was doing a little bit of research on what \nsome of the Republicans said about that budget when it was enacted in \n1993. Evidently, they are trying the same tomfoolery on the U.S. Senate \nwith a debate on this matter that has nothing to do with 1993, but \nevidently they think it is a good political thing to do. They were way \noff base with all of their pronouncements, with all of their arguments \nat that time, and I think they are just compounding their errors and \ntheir illogical prognostications here today. As I remember it, the Vice \nPresident of the United States had to cast the deciding vote in the \nSenate.\n  I will simply cite here--I will not mention names because names are \nnot particularly important--but certainly one of the most prominent \nleaders in the U.S. Senate from that side of the aisle said on page \nS4169, March 13, 1993:\n\n       Four years from now, we are going to have a deficit of \n     about $400 billion and the economy is going to be on its \n     back.\n\n  Well, it is not quite 4 years, but close to it and no one can say \nthat the Senator's statement was accurate.\n  Another leader on the Republican side of the aisle said in a similar \nregard on page S4170, March 31, 1993:\n\n       This is an invitation to continued recession and slow \n     growth, because business cannot create jobs with this kind of \n     a new burden.\n\n  And then another Republican, one of my really good friends, said on \npage S3109 on March 18, 1993 about the 1993 bill:\n\n       I think it may be the most recessionary ``deficit reduction \n     package'' in history.\n\n  There are a litany of those kinds of statements that were totally \nwrong, inaccurate. Though I say that I suspect many of us have said \ntotally inaccurate and untrue things, I do not for a moment question \nthe sincerity of the Members that I have just quoted from on that side \nof the aisle. But I think it is clear that their predictions of things \nto come if that 1993 act was enacted into law would be a disaster--they \nmay have been sincere in that belief at the time, but I think the \nrecord clearly indicates that they were wrong. Their predictions were \nway off base, and they were inaccurate.\n  I think basically the same thing, therefore, would follow with regard \nto their continued speeches and amendments attacking that 1993 act. I \nwill match the record of the last 4 years with regard to the economy of \nthe United States of America against the previous 4 years on any \neconomic indicator--jobs, growth, deficit, you name it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I was about to yield the floor. I hope, \nwith regard to the previous agreement, the Senator from Iowa will be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4011\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that the first reconciliation bill not include \nMedicaid reform, focusing mainly on Welfare reform by shifting Medicaid \n       changes from the first to the second reconciliation bill)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. Biden, \n     Mr. Bryan and Mr. Dorgan, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4011.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 46, line 12, decrease the amount by \n     $72,000,000,000.\n       On page 49, line 17, increase the amount by $1,900,000,000.\n       On page 49, line 18, increase the amount by \n     $72,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send this amendment on behalf of myself, \nMr. Biden, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Dorgan. This is the first of two \namendments which I will offer. I will try not to take too much of the \nSenate's time. I just want to explain them briefly, what they do.\n  First, this amendment which I just sent to the desk, Mr. President, \nis very simple and very straightforward. It takes the first \nreconciliation bill, which is supposed to have both welfare and \nMedicaid together in it, and divides it. So what my amendment would do \nis, welfare reform and welfare would still be in the first \nreconciliation bill, but Medicaid would become a part of the second \nreconciliation bill, the one concerned with all of the other \nentitlement changes.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is overwhelming support in this body \nand in this country for tough, commonsense welfare reform. The Senate \npassed such a bill by a vote of 87 to 12 last year. The President has \nrepeatedly said he would sign such a plan, and even leaders in the \nother body said the bill should be passed.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate-passed measure was changed in conference in \nways that were unacceptable to the President and to many Senators. So \nit is time to get back on track. Our country's welfare system is \nbroken. It is wasting tax dollars and it is wasting human lives.\n  Our present welfare system is unfair, unfair to the taxpayers and \nunfair to the people on welfare. It is time to make welfare work for \nAmerica. In my own State of Iowa, we have a commonsense welfare reform \nthat is working and getting results. It was done, I might add, in a \nbipartisan, well-crafted manner.\n  In the late 1980's, we had experiments around Iowa on the best ways \nof delivering welfare, getting people off of welfare, that was \nincorporated into a bill that passed the Iowa Legislature in 1993. So \nwe have had it in existence now for 3 years. Quite frankly, in that \nshort span of time that it has been in effect--not quite 3 years; a \nlittle over 2 years--taxpayers have saved money, about one-third of \nthose on welfare are now working, and fewer families are on the welfare \nrolls.\n  I just have some charts here to illustrate what has happened in Iowa \nwith the Iowa welfare reform program. It came into existence in the \nlast of September of 1993--so the first of October 1993. At that time, \nwe had about 18 percent of the people on welfare working. As of March \nof this year, we had almost 33 percent working, almost a third of those \non welfare now working. You can see the trend line has been up.\n  If I am not mistaken, I believe Iowa now has the distinction of \nhaving a higher percentage of people on welfare working than any State \nin the Nation. I believe that is right. That is because of this very \ncommonsense welfare reform proposal that we passed. So that is the \nnumber working, and the trend line is still going up.\n  Here is the caseload that we have from September of 1993, when we had \n36,404. We had a big bump up when we made the changes. Everyone knew \nthat was going to happen. But since that time the trend has been \nconstantly\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\ndown. We now have 33,320. So the trend line has been down. So we are \nsuccessfully getting people off of the welfare rolls and into self-\nsufficiency.\n  The third chart shows exactly what we are talking about in terms of \nexpenditures. The green line is the expenditures on welfare in Iowa for \n1992 to 1993, the year prior to the new plan going into effect. You can \nsee we spent a total of $13.6 million that month. This is the last \nyear; this is from April of 1995 through April of 1996. As you can see, \nthere was $12.5 million, down to a little over $11 million. Just in the \n2 years it has been in existence, we have gone from $13.6 million down \nto $11.1 million.\n  So we have fewer people on welfare. We have more people working. We \nare expending less money on welfare. So by any yardstick of \nmeasurement, the Iowa program is working. Again, I think that one of \nthe key ingredients is that it puts common sense ahead of ideology. It \nis built on good ideas that work, and it is founded on the driving goal \nof achieving self-sufficiency, not just getting people into a job, but \ngetting people to achieve self-sufficiency.\n  I might add, it was done in a bipartisan manner. It passed the Iowa \nLegislature by a huge bipartisan vote, signed into law by the Governor. \nIt is working. I believe this is the way we ought to approach welfare \nreform, in a nonideological, bipartisan fashion.\n  But I think, again, the budget before us lumps welfare reform in with \nMedicaid reform. Quite frankly, Medicaid reform proposals are far more \ncontroversial. If they are added to welfare reform, it will be almost \ncertainly what has been called a ``poison pill'' that would result in a \nPresidential veto.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear, my amendment does not endorse \nthe Medicaid cuts proposed in the pending measure. It simply shifts the \nsums assumed in the resolution to the second budget reconciliation bill \nwhich can be reached in a wide variety of ways or not reached at all.\n  The reality is, there is little chance of enacting a bipartisan \npackage on Medicaid at this present time. But there is a good chance of \nenacting a bipartisan bill on welfare reform. Why do I say that? \nBecause we have already done it. We did it last fall by a vote of 87-\n12. It had overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  So let us not kill commonsense welfare reform. Let us not walk away \nfrom the common ground in favor of scoring political points. That I \nbelieve would be a tragic mistake. So this amendment says, let us put \naside ideology, let us work together to give the American people what \nthey want and what we can achieve, and that is genuine, balanced, and \nfair welfare reform. That is what our amendment is designed to do, to \nmake sure that we address welfare reform separate and apart from \nMedicaid reform and divide those issues up in the two reconciliation \nbills that we will have in front of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For the purpose of offering an amendment I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4012\n\n   (Purpose: To restore funding for education, training, and health \nprograms to a Congressional Budget Office freeze level for fiscal year \n 1997 through an across-the-board reduction in Federal administrative \n                                 costs)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Mr. Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] for Mr. Specter, for \n     himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n     Pell, proposes an amendment numbered 4012.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 25, line 17, increase the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 18, increase the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, increase the amount by $1,500,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 2, decrease the amount by $2,700,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 3, decrease the amount by $2,700,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 11, decrease the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 12, decrease the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 14, increase the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n       On page 52, line 15, increase the amount by $1,400,000,000.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield before \nhe goes into the second amendment? I have a very brief statement that I \nwant to make in support of the first Harkin amendment. From what I know \nof the second amendment I might not be in support of it. I do not wish \nto confuse the Senator or the Senate as to what the intentions are of \nthe Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield such time as the Senator desires.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4011\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Harkin amendment reveals the truth about \nthe Republican strategy, it seems to me, better than anything else. If \nthis amendment is rejected, it will prove that they are not serious \nabout enacting bipartisan welfare reform this year, legislation that I \nthink is a must. Unlike welfare reform there has not yet been a broad \nbipartisan agreement on specific Medicaid legislation. This is because \nthe Republicans have not backed down from their proposal to block grant \nthis program.\n  While Democrats and Republicans are closer to agreement on the level \nof Medicaid savings, we remain quite far apart, Mr. President, on how \nto achieve those savings. Democrats will not agree to end guaranteed \ncoverage for children, pregnant women, elderly, and disabled Americans. \nYet the Republican proposal gives no sign of maintaining those vital \nguarantees.\n  Nor are any details provided to support their claim that this \nproposal reflects the National Governors' Association plan. Democrats \nare justifiably skeptical that States would be protected from economic \nfluctuations, changing demographics, and natural disasters, a key \nelement of the Governors' plan under a Medicaid block grant. Therein \nlies the problem. If our Republican colleagues are serious, they would \nagree to enact bipartisan welfare reform first and then work to achieve \na balanced budget that restrains Medicaid spending. This amendment \nwould make that course possible. I appreciate it being offered by my \ncolleague from the neighboring State of Iowa.\n  I yield back any of the time yielded to me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nNebraska, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, for his kind \nwords and insight into this amendment. I think, again, he hit the mark \ncorrectly, that if we are really interested in passing a bipartisan \nwelfare reform bill this is the only way we are ever going to be able \nto do it. I hope we can get good support for this amendment on both \nsides of the aisle and get about the business of passing a good, \nstrong, welfare reform bill this year in a bipartisan manner.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4012\n\n  Mr. President, my second amendment has to do with education and \nhealth funding. The budget resolution goes about balancing the budget \nin all the wrong ways by undoing the modest good that was done less \nthan a month ago when the Congress finally passed an appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 1996 that the President could sign. The Senate \nvoted 88 to 11 to approve that bipartisan compromise bill, about as \nclose to a consensus as we ever get around here.\n  It is incredible to me that we find ourselves debating a budget \nresolution that undoes that deal that we had just a month ago. I hear a \nlot of talk from the other side they provide increases in education. \nMake sure you look beyond the blue smoke and the mirrors because it \nsimply is not true. As this chart shows, the resolution before the \nSenate provides about $36.3 billion for education and job training \nprograms. That is about a $1.2 billion decrease from what CBO estimated \nit needed to\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nfreeze funding for those programs in fiscal year 1997. The resolution \nalso provides for $21.6 billion, or $1.5 billion below a CBO freeze for \nhealth programs.\n\n  Here are the figures. The 1996 omnibus continuing resolution that we \npassed, 88 Senators voted for it, contained $36.2 billion for \neducation. CBO--not OMB, CBO--estimates that just to meet this \nrequirement for next year would require $37.4 billion. The budget \nresolution before the Senate only provides for $36.3 billion, for an \nactual cut of $1.178 or almost $1.2 billion in education. The same is \ntrue in the health care on the omnibus continuing resolution that we \npassed by 88 votes. There is $23.2 billion. CBO says just to freeze \nthat would require $23.2 billion. The budget resolution provides for \n$21.6 billion, for a $1.5 billion cut there.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Specter \nwho, because of other pending matters, could not be here today or else \nhe would have offered the amendment. I am offering it on his behalf, \nbut I am proud to be a cosponsor, along with a number of other \nSenators.\n  This amendment would simply restore the $2.7 billion for education, \njob training, and health programs to the freeze levels, just to the \nfreeze level. For example, the CBO freeze does not restore title I to \nits normal appropriations cycle which would require an additional $1.3 \nbillion in fiscal year 1997 on top of the $1.2 billion.\n  The offset is also simple. It cuts a little more than one-half of 1 \npercent across the board from all of defense and nondefense \nadministrative expenses. This reduction would be taken only from \nadministrative personnel services and contractual services.\n  Mr. President, during the last year, students, parents, teachers, \nschool boards, school administrators, were treated to a roller coaster \nride because of great uncertainties caused by the Federal budget \nprocess. Let us not repeat that mistake again this year. The American \npeople are sick and tired of the partisan bickering and want us to get \non with the business of governing.\n  We started last year with proposals for deep cuts in student loans. \nThe House planned to cut $18 billion; the resolution offered by the \nBudget Committee called for cuts of $14 billion. We finally adopted a \nbipartisan amendment in the Senate which reduced the cut to $4 billion. \nStudents and their parents were not thrilled but saw this at least as a \nsignificant improvement. Then the resolution went to conference and the \ncut was $10 billion. So, students and parents really started worrying \nagain. The Senate once again moderated the cuts and people said, ``OK, \nthis is good.'' The House did not, the concern intensified again.\n  The final deal drastically cut the successful direct lending program \nincluding cuts of $5 billion. This bill was rightfully vetoed.\n  That was followed by the ups and downs of negotiations on the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations bill. The Government shut down twice. For 7 \nmonths, the Federal Government was directionless because of short-term \ncontinuing resolutions instead of annual appropriations.\n  Parents worried that their children would not get the reading and \nmath assistance they need because title I funding was cut by 7 percent. \nTeachers worried about whether or not they would have a job next year. \nSchool boards and administrators were unable to plan for the upcoming \nyear because they did not know what their budget would be. In short, \nchaos reigned.\n  We should promise the American people that we will never do that \nagain. Passing this amendment would be a good place to start. I do not \nbelieve that this takes us fully where we need to go, but it is a \nstart. As I said, we are going to need more money than just this simple \nfreeze to meet the increasing needs that we have out there. Especially \nfor title I programs in this country, we are going to need some \nadditional money in fiscal year 1997. But both Senator Specter and I, \nand others, felt that at least with the budget resolution we ought not \nto be starting in the hole, that we ought to, at least with this budget \nresolution, start where the freeze was from last year.\n  I can only say that this Senator will support efforts by others to \nget it above the freeze from last year because I think the need is \nthere for education and job training money. But if we start from a \nposition of where we are $1.2 billion already in the hole in education \nand job training, or $1.5 billion in the hole on health, then it is \ngoing to make it that much harder to get above a freeze later on.\n  So, again, this amendment is designed to put us in the same position \nas we were just a month ago, when 88 Senators voted to approve the \nSpecter amendment and send this bill on, which increased the funding up \nto this level, as I said, in the fiscal 1996 omnibus continuing \nresolution. This would provide for us to get to the freeze level. \nBeyond that, I am hopeful that we will be able to add more money for \neducation and job training, especially in the area of title I.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the subcommittee which I chair addresses \na wide array of programs--from the educational needs of children, the \ntraining and retraining of this nation's work force, to confronting the \nproblem of teen pregnancy, AIDS, and the causes and cures of disease \nCollectively, the programs in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation bill address many of the present needs of this nation's \npeople and are investments in our future.\n  Because of the wide array of funding needs contained in the Labor-\nHHS-Education appropriations and given our tight budget situation, it \nhas become exceedingly difficult to craft a bill that addresses all of \nthese needs. The amendment which I offer today adds a total of $2.7 \nbillion to levels in the resolution for education, training, and social \nservices programs in function 500, and to health activities in function \n550. This increase will bring funding in these functions to freeze \nlevels as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office and will help in \nfunding the education, job training and health programs under my \nsubcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  Just last month, the Senate voted 88-11 to approve a compromise \namendment offered by Senator Harkin and myself to the Labor, HHS, \nEducation appropriations for fiscal year 1996. That compromise is what \nit took to break loose the stalemate on fiscal year 1996 funding for \nLabor, HHS and Education programs and to get a bill through the \nCongress. Without the amendment I am offering today, I think that we \ncould see a repeat of last year's long and disruptive appropriations \nprocess, and that would be an embarrassment that this body ought not \nlet occur again. The fiscal year 1996 bill required an additional $2.7 \nbillion, and I believe that we will again need this amount to get the \nbill through fiscal year 1997.\n  The increase in the amendment applies only to fiscal year 1997 and \ndoes not increase spending in the outyears. The amendment is offset by \nan across-the-board cut of a little more than one-half of 1-percent \nfrom all executive branch administrative expenses. That is, \nadministrative and personnel services and contractual services on a \npro-rata basis from funds available to every Federal agency, \ndepartment, and office in the executive branch, including the Office of \nthe President.\n  The resolution before the Senate provides $36.3 billion for education \nand employment and training programs, a decrease of $1.2 billion below \nwhat CBO has estimated to freeze these programs in fiscal year 1997. \nThe resolution also provides $21.6 billion or $1.5 billion below a \nfreeze for health programs. This amendment simply restores funding for \neducation, job training and health programs to a very modest freeze \nlevel.\n  Even at a freeze level, the Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee will be \nfaced with the formidable task of maintaining our commitment to the \ncore education programs, including Pell grants, campus-based aid, title \nI, and head start.\n  For employment and training programs, an additional $67 million is \nneeded in fiscal year 1997 just to cover the operational cost increases \nresulting from opening four new Job Corps centers. Without passage of \nthis amendment, the subcommittee will be forced either to not fund the \noperation of these new centers or further reduce services in other \ntraining programs for this nation's workforce at a time of heightened \nanxiety over economic security.\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\n  Last week was Brain Awareness Week and many of my colleagues visited \nwith researchers and advocates urging the Congress to expand support \nfor research on the brain. Others, attended the Wednesday's May 15 \npress conference with actor Christopher Reeve of ``Superman'' fame in \nwhich he appealed for increased funding for spinal cord injury \nresearch. Still others, have met with constituents urging us to expand \nfunding for research on cancer, heart disease, AIDS, diabetes, and \nAlzheimer's disease. Without this amendment, we will be unable to \nmaintain level support for critical health care priorities, \njeopardizing funding for the National Institutes of Health, for \ncommunity and migrant health centers, for breast and cervical cancer \nprevention, and for childhood immunizations.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues once again to join Senator Harkin \nand me in supporting this $2.7 billion amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution \ndeserves accolades for its goal of achieving a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002. I support this worthy ambition, yet I cannot fully support \nthe manner in which it achieves this result.\n  Unfortunately, the resolution before us today requires education to \nshoulder an unhealthy portion of discretionary cuts in order to achieve \na balanced budget. As I have said countless times in the past, cutting \neducation spending may--on paper--help balance the budget. In reality, \nhowever, cuts in eduction do the exact opposite. Decreases in education \nspending gut already scarce dollars for programs designed to raise the \nstandard of living, provide better jobs and training, and consequently \nincrease our tax base resulting in more revenue to fill the Federal \ncoffers. Let us not be shortsighted and limit the most critical \ninvestment we can make toward a future downpayment on our debt.\n  For these reasons I support the amendment offered by my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania to restore funding for education discretionary \nspending. My colleagues may argue that we are not cutting education \nfunding but simply limiting its growth. It is true that this resolution \nprovides an increase of $1 billion in fiscal year 1997 over last year's \nallotment. I will concede that this does not constitute a decrease in \nthe strict sense of the word. However, it clarly is a decrease when \ntaking inflationary costs into account. In fact, CBO has indicated that \nit represents a decrease in outlays of approximately $1.7 billion in \nthe first year alone.\n  The foundation of Federal education leadership is built on keeping \npromises to our young children at risk; creating greater access to \nhigher education for all; and guiding the country to help keep our \nchildren's education at a standard that is competitive with the rest of \nthe world's. We cannot possibly keep this promise if, as this \nresolution proposes, we decrease education discretionary spending by \nclose to $2 billion in fiscal year 1997 alone.\n  Public awareness of our need to reform education is growing. Polls \nshow that the public is coming to understand the enormous costs of the \nfailure to educate our children. Eighty-six percent of those surveyed \nby the recent PBS/National Issues Convention felt that we are spending \ntoo little money on education and training.\n  However, we continue to ignore the clear desires of our constituents. \nDuring last year's budget debate we essentially went through the same \nroutine. The fiscal year 1996 resolution also cut education \ndiscretionary spending but a successful floor amendment, offered by my \ncolleague from Maine, restored funding for education programs. \nAmericans understand intuitively that investing in education is the key \nto our future success, and the best possible national investment that \nwe can make as a country. When the rest of the country gets it and we \ndo not, I sometimes wonder who really needs the education.\n\n  Support of the Specter amendment is truly critical. Countless studies \ndocument that American children are not keeping peace with their \ninternational counterparts. Well publicized reports continue to show \nthat in math and science we have not kept pace with our foreign \ncounterparts. In a recent study, American students came in last, behind \nSlovenia.\n  More astonishing, reports indicate that 50 percent of those who \ngraduated from high school in recent years graduated functionally \nilliterate. The basic problem is reading comprehension. Keep in mind \nalso that nationally, up to 30 percent of our ninth graders eventually \ndrop out of school altogether. This is totally unacceptable. How can \nour businesses be expected to compete when they are delivered potential \nworkers of this quality?\n  Money is not the solution, by any means, to the trouble our society \nfaces. However, when programs, specifically designed to address \neducationally disadvantaged students in reading and writing, only serve \na fraction of the eligible population we do those children and our \ncountry a disservice. When programs designed to prevent dropout barely \nkeep pace with inflation yet dropout percentages boom, we know that \nmore funding is critical. When governors and high powered CEO's come \ntogether--on their own time and money--to speak about education needs, \nyou know that indeed education is of such national significance that it \ncan no longer be pushed aside as the stepchild of Federal public \npolicy.\n  And while money may not be a panacea it does make a difference. What \nhave we done when we needed to highlight a major problem or national \npriority? We committed the resources necessary to match our goals. Take \nfor example the space program during our race to the Moon with the \nRussians, we did not decrease funding in order to beat our competition, \nwe increased it considerable and the dividends paid off. We are in no \nless of a crisis today with our education situation than we were with \nSputnik--now is the time to take action.\n  The Specter amendment achieves, the very basic first step--level \nfunding for education in this year's budget. We cannot, in good \nconscience do anything less. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Mexico if I might \nhave about 3 minutes of the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course. I yield it off the resolution.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed on the Gramm amendment. I am not asking to lay the current \namendment aside but that I may proceed to discuss that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4009\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I do that in order to strongly support the \namendment of the Senator from Texas calling for the repeal of the \nClinton tax increase on Social Security benefits. He spoke of this \nabout an hour ago. It is a measure that I had offered in the House of \nRepresentatives within hours of the time, on August 6, 1993, that the \nSocial Security tax increase cleared the Senate. I had offered the bill \nthere to repeal it. I also supported Senator Lott's bill to repeal the \ntax, which he called the Senior Citizens Tax Fairness Act. And I am \nvery pleased to stand in support of the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas to do the same.\n  This is the tax increase that President Clinton pushed through the \nCongress in 1993 to impose higher taxes on seniors with incomes of only \n$34,000 a year and couples with annual incomes of $44,000 a year. The \nClinton administration talked about taxing the rich, but we did not \nbelieve that couples making $44,000, or individuals making $34,000 a \nyear, should be considered rich. As a result of the Clinton tax \nincrease, 85 percent of these people's Social Security benefits are now \nsubject to tax. That represents an effective tax increase of 70 percent \nover prior law.\n  The CBO estimated that, in 1994, 9.5 million Social Security \nbeneficiaries were hit by the Clinton tax increase. That is a figure, \nof course, that will rise every year--to roughly 13.5 million in 1998, \nand much more each year thereafter--because the tax is not indexed for \ninflation.\n  It was very clever the way the President crafted the proposal, \nletting inflation do the dirty work of continuing to raise taxes long \nafter the bill was signed into law in 1993.\n  Repealing the Clinton tax on Social Security will put over $55 \nmillion back into the pockets of retired Arizonans\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\nevery year, and nearly $3.7 billion into the pockets of seniors \nnationwide. If we really care whether seniors have enough resources to \npay for adequate health care, to put food on the table, or pay heating \nand air conditioning bills, we ought to support the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Whether or not this amendment is supported, I think, comes down to a \nquestion of who we trust, Mr. President. Who do we trust more to spend \nthe money wisely, the people that worked hard an entire lifetime to try \nto ensure themselves a secure retirement, or Government bureaucrats in \nWashington? I put my faith in people to use their own money to provide \nfor themselves and their families.\n  It is important to emphasize that the Clinton tax increase applies to \nindividuals with incomes of only $34,000 a year. I do not think that is \na definition of a wealthy person. Yet, that is who pays the bill. I \nthink, by now, most people realize that Clinton's talk of taxing only \nthe ``rich'' is just an excuse to raise taxes on everybody. He raised \ntaxes on seniors making $34,000 a year. He raised the gas tax, which \nhits the poorest Americans hardest of all.\n  I note, parenthetically, Mr. President, that according to the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics, in 1987, the poorest 20 percent of Americans \ndevoted 8.8 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil, \nwhile the wealthiest 20 percent devoted only 3.1 percent of their \nexpenditures to such things. So the gas tax, like the Social Security \ntax, hits those who are not the most wealthy in our country.\n  I predict that we are going to repeal the Clinton gas tax and the tax \non Social Security benefits. Neither is defensible. The Gramm amendment \nthat is before us today will put Senators on record about whether they \nfavor the repeal of the tax increase on seniors, and whether we put our \ntrust in older Americans or whether we put our trust in bureaucrats.\n  I commend Senator Gramm from Texas for raising this amendment. I hope \nwe all support it. I thank the other Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, for standing aside and letting me take this time.\n  Mr. President, I earlier posited two amendments--3995 and 3996. In \nthat order, I ask for the yeas and nays on those two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection for it to be in order to \nrequest the yeas and nays at this time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We need to have a Member of the minority party present.\n  Mr. KYL. If there is no one present, I will defer until then.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Why do we not let the Senator from Texas go.\n  Mr. KYL. I will defer until then.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is Senator Hutchison going to speak to the IRA \namendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That has been adopted by voice, right?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It was my understanding that the two managers would \nput it in at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We agreed to it on Friday. The Senator is assured of \nthat sense of the Senate for this bill. I am hopeful that any tax bill \nwe do includes that. She knows of my high regard for that amendment and \nfor her leadership on it. If the Senator cares to speak to it, it would \nbe appropriate at this point.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would appreciate the opportunity to explain what we \nhave done for the homemakers of America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4006\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to say how much I appreciate what Senator \nDomenici has done, with the acquiescence of Senator Exon. Clearly, this \nis a bipartisan issue, and it is something that will really make a \ndifference for the homemakers and the one-income earner couples in \nAmerica. In fact, it makes them equal with every person who works \noutside the home. Now people who work inside the home will have the \nsame opportunity for retirement security.\n  Senator Barbara Mikulski and I cosponsored the homemaker IRA bill in \n1993. It was included in the balanced budget that was passed by \nCongress and sent to the President last year. But it was vetoed, so we \nare coming back this year in the balanced budget resolution and saying \nthis is a priority. This amendment is adopted. It is in the bill. It \nwill be a priority, and here is what it does. It says that, if you work \ninside the home, you are now only able to set aside $250 for your \nretirement security, whereas, if you work outside the home, you are \nable to set aside $2,000 a year for your retirement security. So this \nhas created a real hardship on a one-income-earner family or on a \nhomemaker who may lose his or her spouse in the future. Our bill says, \nif you work inside the home, you can set aside $2,000 a year just as if \nyou worked outside the home. This allows the one-income-earner couple \nthat may be sacrificing for the homemaker to stay home and raise the \nchildren to have the same retirement benefits and options as if the \nspouse had worked outside the home.\n  What it does for the homemaker who may lose her spouse in later years \nis to have in her own name, her own retirement account, her IRA just as \nif she had worked outside the home all these years. This, Mr. \nPresident, just makes everybody in this country equal if they work \ninside the home or outside the home. They will be able to set aside \nthat $2,000 a year for their retirement security.\n  What difference does it make? It makes a big difference. A lot of \npeople do not take advantage right now of the $2,000 that they can set \naside that will earn interest tax free so that at the end of their \nworking lives they will have a nest egg. The conservative estimates, if \nyou just think of a 6-percent return, would be that a one-income-earner \ncouple now would be able to set aside enough to build, over a 30-year \nworking life, almost $200,000 for a nest egg. But if you allowed the \nhomemaker to contribute equally, it would go up to about $335,000, so \nalmost $350,000. If you do better than 6 percent in your investment, of \ncourse, it would be more than that. A $335,000 nest egg is a lot for a \nfamily that has just to set aside $4,000 a year. For an individual to \nset aside $2,000 a year, you can get into the $200,000 to the $250,000 \nrange in your retirement nest egg. That can help a lot. When you have \nSocial Security, which is a supplement, and then you have an IRA, if \nyou have set aside that $2,000 a year, you can have an income that you \nwill be able to live on.\n  This is what we should be encouraging in our country. We should be \nencouraging savings. Every statistic you see says that our country has \nthe lowest savings rate of any industrialized nation in the world. That \nis really a shame. We ought to encourage savings, and this is the way \nwe can do it.\n\n  So what we have done by having this amendment adopted by Senator \nDomenici and Senator Exon is we have said that this will be a priority. \nWhen all of the Washington mumbo jumbo ends and we have had our House \nbill and our Senate bill and our conference committee, what we are \nsaying is in the end when we reconcile all these differences and all of \nthe things that we have passed, that the high priority will be for \nequity for the homemakers of our country for their retirement security.\n  Mr. President, it is a win for everyone. It is a win for the \nhomemaker. It is a win for the one-income-earner family. It is a win \nfor America because the more people who have a retirement security, the \nmore people who will be happy, who will be stable, who will not have to \nworry about looking to the Government for help. This is a very modest \ninvestment for us to say these earnings will be tax free through these \nyears to give that stability in retirement to that couple, or that \nindividual that has worked for 30 years and should be able to plan for \ntheir own retirement security.\n  So I am very pleased that we have taken one more step. We have passed \nthis bill once. It was vetoed by the President. Now we are coming back. \nWe are going to pass it again. I hope that we will be able at the end \nof this year to say we have finally done what we should have done a \nlong time ago in this Congress, and that is acknowledge that the work \ndone inside the home is every bit as important as the work done outside \nthe home and maybe even more so.\n  So I am pleased that we are doing this once again. We are going to \nstress how important the homemakers and the family units are in our \nsociety. This is the right thing to do.\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to say that the original cosponsors of our \nresolution, this amendment, are Senators Dole, Robb, Feinstein, and \nSnowe.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Helms, Murray, and Moseley-\nBraun, at their request, to be cosponsors of this with Senator Mikulski \nand myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time \nbe charged to the majority time for the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. Once again, I appreciate \nSenator Domenici for realizing what a priority this is and for agreeing \nto this amendment. I appreciate the Democrats who are also accepting \nit. This is the right thing for the homemaker and the families of \nAmerica. I hope that by the end of this year we will be able to declare \nvictory and say that this option is now open for all of the people who \nwork in our country whether the work is inside the home or outside the \nhome.\n\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  I just wanted to say to the Senator that a lot of people talk about \nmaking our policies more friendly toward families and friendly policies \nfor our Nation. The Senator has talked about it as well as anyone here, \nbut she does something about it. There was a discriminatory situation. \nIt is the denial of IRA's for homemakers.\n  It seems to me that, on the one hand, we say that is among the most \nsignificant work being done in behalf of our families and our Nation, \nand then, on the other hand, we say, however, if you are out of the \nhousehold and not a homemaker, you will be able to set up an IRA \naccount for your retirement but not if you are a homemaker. I believe \nyou have hit the nail right on the head. If you want to be profamily, \nyou had better start right here at this level and stop discriminating \nagainst these activities of men, women, or children who are doing \nthings that are profamily and make that more difficult.\n  So I commend the Senator for it. I do not have much to say directly \nabout what the Finance Committee writes. But I think you have a very \nexciting approach and one that fits the rhetoric of the day to a ``t.'' \nYou are to be commended for it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield, although it will be the \nFinance Committee that has the final word on this, what the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and Senator Exon have done by accepting this amendment \nis to give clear direction to them with a unanimous vote of the Senate \nsaying this is what we want to be a priority. I do think because of the \nleadership of the Senator from New Mexico and Senator Exon that we will \nbe able to declare victory at the end of this year. It is a long time \ncoming.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Before the Senator from Texas leaves, I would like to join \nmy colleague, Senator Domenici, in complimenting her for moving ahead \non family. Family matters are so important. Maybe we cannot do a lot \nabout it directly here, but as the Senator from Texas knows, we \naccepted her amendment because we thought it was a good one. I thank \nher for bringing it up.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, what is the pending matter before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 4011, \nthe Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, for the purpose of \nentertaining amendments that are about to be offered by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, that the Harkin amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4013\n\n(Purpose: To restore common sense to the budget rules by reversing the \n               rule change on the scoring of asset sales)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I send an amendment to the desk, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Bradley, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4013.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add the following new section at the end of Title II:\n\n     SEC.   . SALE OF GOVERNMENT ASSETS.\n\n       (a) Budgetary Treatment.--For purposes of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget and the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, no amounts realized from sales of assets shall be \n     scored with respect to the level of budget authority, \n     outlays, or revenues.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``sale of an asset'' shall have the same meaning as under \n     section 250(c)(21) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (c) Treatment of Loan Assets.--For the purposes of this \n     section, the sale of loan assets or the prepayment of a loan \n     shall be governed by the terms of the Federal Credit Reform \n     Act of 1990.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment deals with a change the \nRepublican majority made to the budget rules last year which permitted \nthe use of revenue from asset sales to be scored against the budget. \nThe last two CBO Directors, Mr. Reischauer and Mr. Penner, have \ncriticized this change to the budget rules as being bad public and \nfiscal policy.\n  From 1987 to 1995, we had a firm policy that you could not sell \nassets and use the revenues derived from those sales to count against \nthe deficit. Nobody quarrels with the occasional selling of an asset. \nAt times it makes perfectly good sense. But when you score the asset \nsales against the deficit, you have to ask yourself, next year, what do \nyou do for an encore?\n  When I was Governor, I received a revenue sharing check from the \nFederal Government for $21 million. I did not put the money in the \nState operating budget because I knew then, even as a freshman Governor \nof Arkansas, it was bad policy. I did not have to come to the Senate to \nfind that out.\n  It was bad policy because if I had put it in the operating budget, \nrevenue sharing could have came to an end the next year, which it did \nafter I came to the Senate. We received revenue sharing for several \nyears and were glad to get it, but it was eventually discontinued. All \nI could think about was the poor Governors out there who had been using \nrevenue sharing for operations--their share of Medicaid, their \neducational budget, and when suddenly you find $100 million not coming \nin next year, what do you do? You raise taxes or reduce services to \nmake up the difference.\n  And so, in 1987, this body very wisely said: In the future, you \ncannot sell assets and score the revenue for budgetary purposes. That \nwas the rule we operated under until 1995. All of a sudden, in 1995, \nthe Republicans took control of Congress and began proposing to sell a \nnumber of assets, including the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve; the \nFederal power marketing administrations, which generate hydroelectric \npower at Federal dams; the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; oil from \nthe strategic petroleum reserve, which we have been filling up with oil \nfor almost 15 years now for the rainy day when we might have another \nArab oil embargo; and the Uranium Enrichment Corporation. Incidentally, \nI have no quarrel whatever with selling the Uranium Enrichment \nCorporation. I was glad that the Federal Government privatized the \nCorporation, but do not score it against the budget deficit.\n  Mr. President, not only was there a proposal to sell these assets, \nbut a senior Member of the House of Representatives introduced a bill \nto appoint a commission--listen to this one, Mr. President--to decide \nwhich of the national parks should be sold.\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n  So where are we headed Mr. President? We are going to have a big \nnational yard sale and sell some of our most valued national treasures \nin an attempt to mask the budget deficit, including some of the \nnational parks.\n  If you think this is just rhetoric, look at this chart outlining last \nyear's proposal to sell the naval petroleum reserves, the major part of \nwhich is the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in California. It \nproduces about 63,000 barrels of oil a day. Let me show you what a \nsilly idea the proposed sale is. According to CBO, the sale of the \nnaval petroleum reserves would produce $1.55 billion in revenue. \nHowever, over the 7-year budget scoring window we would lose the $2.47 \nbillion in revenue that would have been produced had the Government \nretained title to the asset. That would result in a net increase in the \ndeficit of $992 million over 7 years. Selling the naval petroleum \nreserves now in a rush to make it appear that you are going to balance \nthe budget makes absolutely no sense. If we can balance the budget--and \nGod knows, we ought to over the next 6 or 7 years--that is fine. But do \nnot do it by selling off the Nation at a loss.\n  As the chart demonstrates, the $1 billion loss occurring over the 7-\nyear budget period is just part of the story. If the asset were sold, \nthe Federal Government would continue to forgo approximately $400 \nmillion in revenue annually. This would add an additional $12 billion \nin losses over the approximate 30 year lives of the reserves.\n  So we are going to sell an asset for $1.55 billion in order to try to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, and if you consider the 30 \nsubsequent years we lose $12 billion. Bad policy? No; insane policy.\n  A moment ago I mentioned the power marketing administrations. For the \nuneducated, the power marketing administrations, or PMAs, market \nhydroelectric power generated at Federal dams. The Southwestern Power \nMarketing Administration serves my State, and I do not want it \nprivatized, I do not want it sold, and I am going to do everything I \ncan to keep it from being sold.\n  Here is why. It is not just because the people of Arkansas use the \npower; it is because I believe in honest budgeting. This chart is \nintended to demonstrate the actual impact the sale of a PMA would have \non the deficit.\n  Assume that in 1996 the Federal Government receives $1 billion from \nthe sale of a particular PMA. What do we lose? The first year, 1996, we \nwould lose $100 million in revenue that would have been produced if the \nPMA stayed in Federal ownership. So what happens? It is true that we \nget $900 million more in 1996 than we lose. We get $1 billion, we lose \n$100 million in revenues, and, on its face, the deficit would fall by \n$900 million.\n  But look at what happens in the future. In the year 2000, we still \nhave only gotten $1 billion, but we have now lost half of it in \nrevenues foregone. By the year 2002, when we are supposed to balance \nthe budget, we've received $1 billion, but now we have lost $700 \nmillion in lost receipts, and the net effect on the deficit is only \n$300 million. But here is where the proof of the pudding is. Look at \nthe year 2020. We still only got $1 billion in 1996-1997, but in the \nyear 2020, considering the $100 million a year in revenues we have \nlost, the Federal Treasury is a net loser of $1.5 billion. No wonder \nReischauer said it is bad policy. It is crazy policy.\n  Last year the Senator from Alaska took strong exception to my last \ntwo charts which point out that the change in the budget scoring rule \ncould produce crazy proposals such as the sale of Mount Rushmore or the \nStatue of Liberty. Mount Rushmore is a moneymaker. There is no telling \nwhat we might get.\n  But you know, there is something more important than that. Mount \nRushmore is a national symbol. I have been there; you have been there, \nMr. President. It is a magnificent thing. They are designing a portrait \nthere out of that stone of an Indian on a horse. I think it is Crazy \nHorse. It is not finished yet. It is going to be magnificent. But let \nus say we are going to put Mount Rushmore up for sale. Do not worry \nabout the fact that this honors four truly great Presidents of this \nNation that the United States wanted to honor forever. Sell it off.\n  I do not know what the Republicans in the House have in mind with \nthis bill to sell off natural parks. Maybe they have the Statue of \nLiberty in mind. Now that would probably bring a lot of money. Is that \nnot magnificent? But you know something? It is no more magnificent than \nYellowstone, Yosemite, the White River Wildlife Refuge in my State, or \nHot Springs Natural Park in my State, which are near and dear to me.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Alaska that I do not think these sales \nare going to happen. I am just giving the worst-case scenario I can \nthink of, and based on some things that have happened around here in \nthe last 2 years, I am not making any promises.\n  But I can tell you we had it right in 1987 that we would not score \nassets sales for deficit reduction purposes, for a very good reason: It \nis bad fiscal policy and it is bad public policy because you have to \nmake it up. If you reduce the deficit $1 billion by selling the PMA's \nthis year, how do you make up that deficit next year to make sure the \ndeficit stays on a downward slide? You have to come up with $1 billion \nsomeplace else.\n  Mr. President, I serve on the Energy Committee. This year the budget \nresolution instructs the Energy Committee to report legislation that \nwill produce savings of $1.4 billion over 6 years. However, the \nresolution only directly mentions how the Committee is expected to meet \n$400 million of the savings. There are only three options available to \nthe committee to meet the additional $1 billion requirement: First, we \ncould sell the PMAs; second, we could impose royalties on hardrock \nmines; or third, we could allow oil and gas drilling in ANWR. My \nfriend, the senior Senator from Alaska, obviously supports the latter \napproach.\n  He and I are good friends. We fight like saber-toothed tigers on the \nfloor, but we are good friends. We just could not disagree more on the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. Let me just say this: It is my firm \nbelief that the President of the United States will veto any bill that \ncomes to him that allows drilling in ANWR. I will certainly urge him \nto.\n  The other two possibilities are political nonstarters. A large number \nof Senators oppose the sale of the PMA's and the mining industry will \nagain fight tooth or nail against any royalty.\n  Everybody in this body knows that I have fought for 7 years to reform \nthe 1872 mining law. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and \nI cannot believe: First, that I have been fighting that battle for 7 \nyears and second, that, because I have not yet won, the Secretary of \nthe Interior continues to be forced to deed valuable public land and \nminerals for practically nothing. He does not have any choice. He is \nrequired to under this 122-year old law.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, several weeks ago was forced to give a \ndeed to a mining company for 40 acres of public land for the princely \nsum of $200. What do you think was on the 40 acres that the taxpayers \nof this Nation got $200 for? Eighty million dollars' worth of gypsum. \nTwo years ago, he deeded land containing 11 billion dollars' worth of \ngold.\n  So a third possibility would be to impose a mining fee to produce $1 \nbillion over the next 6 years. But if I am any judge of the makeup of \nthe U.S. Senate, about the only votes for that will be on this side of \nthe aisle. There will be few votes on the other side--maybe five.\n  You talk about balancing the budget; you talk about wanting a \nconstitutional amendment. Oh, yes, let us go back and tinker with what \nJames Madison did, and John Adams and John Jay and Alexander Hamilton \nand Ben Franklin. Let us go back and tinker with what they did 206 \nyears ago drafting the Constitution that has made us a great nation, \nthe freest nation on Earth, the longest living democracy, the oldest \nconstitution in the world, tinker with that to bring about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, but do not disturb \nthose big international mining companies who have been raping and \npillaging the U.S. taxpayer since 1872.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend for his \nforbearance. He is, as he says, a good friend\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\nfrom Arkansas. We have postponed this debate until this afternoon, and \nthat enabled me to return to my home.\n  May I have some of the Senator's time, by the way?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, we have used no time in \nopposition. I yield the Senator whatever time he needs, up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is it possible for me to yield the Senator from Alaska \ntime under the unanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to yield time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have 2 hours total; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 hour.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. One hour for all three amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 36 minutes, 48 \nseconds remaining on his time on this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I had the \npossibility of three amendments, two for sure. I understood that there \nwould be 2 hours, that I could allocate that 2-hour period any way I \nwanted to in offering those three amendments. Is that correct or not?\n  Mr. EXON. There would have had to be a unanimous-consent agreement \nfor that. I believe that every amendment that he offered, whether it \nwas 1, 2 or 3 or 10, the Senator would have 1 hour under the control of \nhis time and 1 hour for the opposition. And if there are second-degree \namendments, it would be half an hour.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask the Senator this question. Who controls the \ntime in opposition, then?\n  Mr. EXON. In this particular case, it would be the Senator from New \nMexico. The Senator from Arkansas controls that hour for his amendment. \nThe Senator from New Mexico would control an hour against it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from New Mexico could yield the Senator from \nAlaska time on this amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Which I just did. I will do that again. I yield up to 1 \nhour in opposition for that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I was saying, due to the forbearance of our friend from Arkansas, I \nwas able to go home to my State. I have just gotten back from Alaska. I \nwas able to go home on Friday. I have been all over my State at various \nfunctions, the regional meeting of the Ahtna Native Corporation up in \nthe Gulkana area, down to Homer and Kenai and Fairbanks and Anchorage. \nI want to report to my friend that one of my constituents asked me \nabout the comments we make here on the floor. He said, ``That fellow \nfrom Arkansas certainly can't be your friend, Senator.'' And I told \nhim, ``No, that's not true. He is a friend. We just disagree \nviolently.'' And it is possible to disagree violently and still be \nfriends.\n  I came in just as the Senator from Arkansas had his shell game card \nup, talking about the budget shell game. I was reading, as I came back \ninto Washington, a summary that my staff had given me about the budget \nthat President Clinton had submitted. This budget, at first glance, \nlooks like it balances, but it relies upon a trigger that is in the \nbudget that reduces discretionary spending by $67 billion in 2001. In \n2002, it does not indicate which programs will be cut, but, \nmiraculously, the President that takes office in 2001 would be asked to \ncut the discretionary budget by 20 percent.\n  If you want to talk about a shell game, we ought to talk about shell \ngames. As a matter of fact, if you want to look at the defense portion \nof the President's budget, you would find that it is a very interesting \ndefense budget. It goes through the year 2000--that is what stuck in my \nmind as I looked at that--it goes through the year 2000 with a \ndeclining amount for defense, and then, miraculously, in 2001-2, the \ndefense budget goes up, so it looks like over that period of time there \nis a level spending for defense; but that money is there for defense \nonly if that President who is in office in 2001-2 cuts discretionary \nbudgets 20 percent.\n  I have to tell my friend, the shell game here is that part of the \nPresident's budget that provides what he seeks to provide in this \nperiod of time if the asset sales that the Senator from Arkansas is \ntalking about cutting out occurs. If the Bumpers amendment is agreed \nto, that President, after the year 2000, when he takes office in 2001, \nis going to have to present us with a budget that increases the cut in \ndiscretionary spending even more.\n  Strangely enough, the problem about this is that we voted on this \nlast year. I understand my friend from Arkansas's position, but from my \npoint of view, you know, it is unfortunate that once again we have seen \nthe Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore, and the indication is that, \nsomehow or other if we approve this bill, it is possible to sell one of \nthose national treasures. No one is suggesting that in connection with \nthis bill. There is a suggestion in the other body about selling some \nof the park lands.\n  And I find some difficulty in addressing the Senator from Arkansas' \namendment because what we are talking about is a lot of assets that are \nout there that do have value now, and the question is not really \nwhether we sell them but whether asset sales should be counted in the \nbudget process.\n  The President has submitted the request that the budget take into \naccount the receipts from the sale or lease of assets that are owned by \nthe Federal Government. That has not been the case in the past. If it \nis the case that we take into account the sale or leasing of Federal \nassets, then we do have an entirely new circumstance, those of us who \ncome from public land States, because there has been a lack of \nunderstanding of the value of Federal land to this country. We have \nsome developing attitudes concerning areas such as those controlled by \nthe National Park Service.\n  Mr. President, I served in the Eisenhower administration in the \nDepartment of the Interior and I remember well that President \nEisenhower wanted to double the Park Service land areas and create new \nparks over a period of 10 years from 1956 to 1966. He did. The idea \nthat somehow or another we would be against national parks, those of us \nwho believe in asset sales, does not really ring a bell with me. I do \nnot understand how those charts enter into this debate.\n  I do understand there is a lot of land that is surplus to the \nGovernment's needs. There are many assets that could be used during \nthis period of very tight budgets to raise a considerable amount of \nmoney. I remember when other Senators raised similar objections when I \nfirst suggested that, instead of having people apply and file a request \nto lease spectrum from the Federal Communications Commission, we have \nan auction of those licenses. Some people here laughed about that. It \ntook two Congresses for us to get around to authorizing the FCC to \nauction spectrum.\n  As a matter of fact, the first time the Congressional Budget Office \nlooked at it, as I recall, they said the maximum that could be raised \nwas somewhere around $250 million over a period of time if we auction \nFCC licenses. They did not understand what some of us understand--the \ndeveloping technology of telecommunication. We have raised over $20 \nbillion so far from the sale of spectrum licenses.\n  Now, we believe there are substantial portions of public land in the \nWest that are needed and can be used in the economies of those Western \nStates that could, in fact, be leased or sold. One of the assets \nhappens to be the area that was set aside by my good friend, Senator \nScoop Jackson in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of \n1980--1.5 million acres on the arctic plain, specifically set aside for \noil and gas exploration and development. The act provided for a special \nenvironmental impact statement to make sure the area would not be \ndamaged by exploration. It is an area just east of Prudhoe Bay, the \ngreat development of Prudhoe Bay, which incidentally is on State land, \nMr. President; it was not on Federal lands. The Federal lands adjacent \nto Prudhoe Bay are the 1.5 million acres Senator Jackson set aside. We \nhave, since 1981, tried to obtain approval to proceed with the leasing \nof those lands for oil and gas exploration and development.\n  The asset sale authorization in this budget resolution could lead to \nthat if the Energy Committee reports a bill and the House approves that \nbill and the President approves it. Mr. President, President Reagan \nrequested that every year. President Bush requested that every year. It \nwas denied under the former leadership of the House and\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\nSenate. Now, with new management of the House and Senate, we approved \nlast year two bills to authorize the Secretary of Interior to proceed \nwith leasing of that area. The bills were vetoed.\n  What we are really talking about in this amendment is whether we \nshould use the assets that the people in the United States own now, \nparticularly those in public land States, to derive income, or whether \nwe should drive forward to the day we have to increase taxes. The net \nresult of Senator Bumpers' position is, do not count asset sales as \nincome for the purpose of trying to balance the budget, which \nautomatically means you have to raise income from somewhere for the \nFederal Government. The only way to do that is taxes. There is another \nalternative. You could cut further either defense spending or \ndiscretionary spending.\n  The issue of our arctic plain is just one portion of this debate with \nthe Senator from Arkansas. What we are really talking about is whether \nthe sale or lease of assets should lead to income which should score in \nthe budget process. The budget process is hard for anyone to \nunderstand, but there is no question that I do not think there would be \nanyone outside of the Congress that would disagree with counting as \nincome money actually put into the Treasury. We are talking about \nbalancing the budget. That is really what the heart of the Bumpers \namendment is. It gets rid of the scoring process for the sale or lease \nof assets that belong to the Federal Government, which process enables \nus to count that money and tell the American public that income will, \nin fact, be counted toward balancing the budget.\n\n  The benefits to the taxpayers are exactly the same as from the \nrevenues that came from the sale of the spectrum by the FCC. That is a \nsale of an asset that belongs to the public. We changed the method of \nleasing. Prior to my concept of auctioning spectrum, people filed no \nlease--really, a permit--to use spectrum. They just paid an annual fee. \nNow they pay substantial amounts of money for the privilege of \nobtaining that permit. That is what comes from a competitive lease of \noil and gas potential on Federal lands. Exactly the same thing.\n  Today the law does not count the money you get from the leasing of \nFederal lands for oil and gas but it does count the income you get from \nspectrum. I hope the Senator understands this. If money comes into the \nTreasury, it makes sense we record it as money received for the purpose \nof balancing the budget.\n  The Senator from Arkansas fears once we discover the amount of money \nyou can get from that, from development on Federal lands, we will go \nwild and we will start sending the message that we should sell the \nnational parks. Nothing is further from the truth. What we should \nrecognize, though, is that we should not keep putting our head in the \nsand and say there is no money coming into the Treasury, when, in fact, \nthere is. The asset sales ought to be recorded as income that are to be \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office. There is no question we \nshould do exactly what we did last year. That is, we should defeat this \namendment to the budget resolution. It is the same thing offered by the \nSenator from Arkansas last year.\n  Let me go back to my visit. I have just come back from home. I talked \nto a lot of people in Alaska. I talked to many of our labor leaders. We \nare a State where when we get together there are not very many of us. \nWe have our labor leaders, people from the chamber of commerce, and \nheads of the various corporations--Native and non-native--in meetings \ntogether. One thing we lack right now is the ability to create new \njobs. Our economy is flattening out. It is more and more related to \ntourism which is very seasonable, obviously, in Alaska. There are not \nmany people getting off cruise ships when it is 60 below zero. We do \nhave a lot of industry that is capable and does work through the \nwintertime. Strangely enough, that is the best time to work on Federal \nlands in our State, during the wintertime. What we want to do is to \nfind a way to expand the availability of Federal lands in Alaska for \noil and gas exploration.\n  Mr. President, at the height of the transportation of oil by the \ngreat Alaska pipeline, the pipeline carried 2.1 million barrels of oil \na day to Valdez for delivery to markets in the United States. Now it is \ndown to 1.3. The reserves at Prudhoe Bay are playing out. They are not \ngoing to disappear overnight. They will just steadily decrease. \nAdjacent to Prudhoe Bay, as I said, on Federal lands--Prudhoe Bay being \non State lands--is an area that we believe is the greatest reservoir \nfor oil and gas in the North American continent. It has been explored, \nit has been analyzed. Everyone has accused us of all kinds of things, \nbut I wish I could take the whole Senate up there, show them Prudhoe \nBay, and show them the area we are talking about, the 1.5 million acres \nalong the same arctic coast. There is no difference. One is not \npristine, and the other, somehow a waste land. They are arctic tundra \nlands. They are not in the mountains. They do not have lakes and trees.\n  I remember one day I came out on the floor and showed a brochure that \nhad been prepared by the Wilderness Society showing lakes and trees and \na Caterpillar coming over the hill, and moose standing down by this \nnice lake. It was a fabricated brochure. To their credit, they withdraw \nthe brochure when I held it up in front of God and everybody. There are \npeople who somehow think there is a difference between the lands we \nhave developed at Prudhoe Bay and the lands that are available for \nexploration and development just east of Prudhoe Bay.\n  That great reservoir, if it does produce oil and gas, is going to be \na significant asset for the United States. Mr. President, it will bring \nin more money than the spectrum sales brought in. But you cannot count \nit until it comes. What you can predict--and we do--is there will be a \nsubstantial bonus for the lease, a bonus paid by people for the \nprivilege of exploring. Those are the assets covered under the Bumpers \namendment. The Bumpers amendment would deny us the right to count the \nmoney paid for the privilege of exploring. More generally, it would \ndeny us the right to count any revenues from asset sales.\n  I am not going to continue, except to say to my friend that I hope we \nall realize that when I stood on this floor and we finally got the \nprivilege to develop the Alaska oil pipeline, the amendment passed by \none vote. It was a tie vote, the only vote that Vice President ever \ncast. Every time we want to bring about some development in my State, \nwe face horrendous odds. That was in the 1970's, and this feeling \nexisted then. We were told we would destroy the caribou and it would be \na terrible thing for the fish and wildlife. Mr. President, the caribou \nherd at Prudhoe Bay is six to seven times the size it was when the \npipeline was authorized. The difference now is that, through new \ntechnology, we can tell the Senate that the amount of land that would \nbe utilized in the development of the production facilities for oil and \ngas, if it is a good discovery on that million and a half acres, will \nbe about one-twentieth the size of land used in the development of \nPrudhoe Bay. Also, we have made an absolute commitment that, once oil \nand gas production is over, the natural contour, natural vegetation \nwould be totally restored.\n  That is why I like to take people up to Alaska to show them the \npipeline camps. I took one group over a pipeline camp and said, ``We \nare going to fly by helicopter up this road, and I want you to tell me \nwhere the pipeline camp is. We will be going to go over two camps.'' \nNot one saw the area where the camps were. It is totally restored to \nits natural condition. That same thing will happen when the day comes \nthat Prudhoe Bay is over and production in the ANWR area, the million \nand a half acres I am talking about. It is an area that is within the \nwildlife refuge --it is not the wildlife refuge. It is a million and a \nhalf acres that Senator Jackson, in his great wisdom, decided should be \nset aside in the early 1980's for oil and gas exploration.\n  So I believe Senator Bumpers presented, once more, an opportunity for \nus to talk about the differences between those who deny us the ability \nto use public lands to raise money to legitimately bring in income and \nto count it toward balancing the budget and those who want to drive on, \nnot make the changes necessary in order to bring about a balanced \nbudget and know that, ultimately, we have the power to tax. Ultimately, \nthe final result of the Bumpers amendment is,\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nsomeone following us will be standing here urging the American people \nto increase their contributions from their own personal income to \nsupport this Government.\n  One thing I found out this last weekend at home, I will tell you, is \n``that dog don't hunt in Alaska.'' No one up there wants any more \ntaxes. As a matter of fact, they all urge us to find some way to reduce \nthe cost of Government. They urge us to find a way to bring about a \nbalanced budget. They want us to find some way to restrain the growth \nof the expenditures of the Federal Government. I think this budget \nresolution, to the great credit of the Senator from New Mexico and also \nthe Senator from Nebraska, who also contributed to this process--even \nthough he may disagree with us on some things, I know that he, too, \nseeks to balance the budget without raising income taxes.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will defeat this amendment \nand that we can go on with the process of trying to use the Federal \nlands that are available for oil and gas exploration, mineral \ndevelopment, and basic utilization to develop the economies of the \nWestern States. We can use those sensibly and count the income from the \nutilization of those lands towards balancing the budget.\n  Mr. President, the one election I lost in my lifetime--well, I lost \nin another one, too--but one I lost even before I got in the Senate \nhere was an election to be the president of the Alaska State \nConservation Society. I believe that we do things in our State in a \nwise way in terms of protecting our environment. We go out of our way \nto do that. Unfortunately, we get tarred by a brush such as the one you \nhave just seen. I see a new chart that my friend has, so I will yield \nthe floor here in a minute. Clearly, there is no proposal before the \nSenate to do what Senator Bumpers says. This is not a national yard \nsale, if I can borrow from the chart. This is not a proposal to sell \nthe national parks. It is a proposal to use the unreserved lands, the \nlands that have not been set aside for a specific conservation purpose \nfor development in the Western States, and to produce income to help us \nbalance the budget without raising taxes. I thank my friend from New \nMexico and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if Senator Exon and I and Senator Bumpers can \ntake 5 minutes to discuss with the Senate where we are amendmentwise in \nthis process, and we will get right back to where we are.\n  I yield up to 5 minutes off the resolution, to be charged equally, on \nthis discussion.\n  Let me just give the Senate a report. We have done very well, \nconsidering that we had no scheduled votes on Friday and none today. \nNormally, it is difficult to get Senators to offer amendments under \nthose circumstances. We got a unanimous-consent agreement that \neverybody is aware of. Two lists were sent to the desk containing 87 \nfirst-degree amendments. It was agreed to by the Senate that there \nwould be no other first-degree amendments and that that was the extent \nof them; is that not correct, Senator?\n  Mr. EXON. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We asked Senators, in good faith, to help us with this \nbill, unless they wanted to pile up amendments and vote on them without \ndebate. We have disposed of 32 first-degree amendments as of this \nmoment--I am sorry. That is as of Friday night when we went out of \nsession. Then we have done seven here this morning. So that is 39 of \nthe 87. So if our arithmetic is right, we have about 47 amendments. \nSome of them are very vague, and I am not sure whether they are going \nto be amendments.\n  My purpose for getting some time to talk with the Senate is as \nfollows. When we finish tonight--and we plan to be here until about 10 \no'clock, I gather--we will have 8 hours remaining on this budget \nresolution, and it will be Tuesday morning, for all intents and \npurposes. We need to know from more Senators on our side--and we will \nleave it up to Senator Exon to ask his side--who have amendments that \nare still pending that are in that 87. If you are not in that 87, you \ncannot offer an amendment anyway. But if you are one of those 47 \nremaining, we need to know if you are going to offer your amendment. \nTell us as soon as you can during this day. And, staff, while helping \nyour Senators, get the word to them that we would like to know in the \nnext couple of hours what their intention is on the amendments. Are you \ngoing to offer every single one? Are you willing to tell us that many \nof them are not going to be offered? We have to know, or we are going \nto be in a tremendous jam tomorrow because unless things change we are \nalready going to have somewhere around 30 votes, maybe 35. The Senator \nfrom Nebraska is going to talk about how long that might take I assume.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I am.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We need to know. We are going to stack these votes but \nnot all of them for one voting session. We will arrange, we hope, for \nabout 7 or 8 votes in the morning before the Senate temporarily closes \nup the Senate while Senators go to the funeral of the very \ndistinguished Chief of Naval Operations sometime around 11, or maybe \n10:30.\n  So we will have some votes in the morning. So, again, please let us \nknow. Are your amendments going to be offered? If so, can we start \nlisting them specifically so we know that they are going to be called \nup and how much time they need?\n  I now yield to Senator Exon.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to join in the appeal. I say to my \nfriend, the chairman of the committee, that I have made two appeals \nearlier to date. I renew it again, and invite all to take advantage--\nboth Democrats and Republicans--to come down and offer your amendments. \nThe view that I have of this right now is that we have 25 amendments \nthat have been debated and are stacked for votes tomorrow. Then we \nhave, as near as I can tell, 47 to 50, amendments on a list that still \ncould be offered. We do not know. Their could be second-degree \namendments to that. That would make the list even longer.\n  But the situation basically is this: we know we are going to have at \nleast 25 votes. If we take those 25 and even figure 10 minutes to a \nvote--and history tells us they run a little longer than that--that is \n6 hours as of right now for voting tomorrow. The manager has just said \nthat when we finish tonight about 10 o'clock there will be only 8 hours \nremaining on the resolution. The 6 hours of voting will not count \ntoward the 8 hours remaining and there will be more votes after that.\n  It is very clear, therefore, that we are going to have another one of \nthose ridiculous situations where amendments are going to be offered. \nThere is going to be no debate, and then we are going to vote. It looks \nterrible for the U.S. Senate to engage in that procedure. But we are \ngoing through it again. I will say that the figures that I have just \nused include no time for debate. That is just voting.\n  Another way of putting it is we are going to be on this resolution \nfor the next few days. When we finish today, we are only going to have \n8 hours left on the resolution. In addition to those 8 hours we already \nhave 6 hours committed just for voting.\n  I would just like to say, since we had a discussion, to my friend \nfrom New Mexico that it would appear that on both sides of the aisle we \nmay have great difficulty in getting any votes in the morning. After \nthe announcement was made of the funeral for the Chief of Naval \nOperations, Admiral Boorda, that many Senators on both sides of the \naisle, therefore, made their plans to come back into town to go to that \nfuneral and then come back here.\n  So I would simply say that although I would like to start voting in \nthe morning it would appear that the efforts we were talking about in \nthat regard may be very, very difficult. But that further complicates \nmatters.\n  Let everyone understand. We are scheduled, as you know, to be out of \nhere Friday sometime for a week's recess for Memorial Day. As is usual, \nwhen that happens, many Senators say, ``OK. We will finish Thursday \nnight, and we will not be here Friday.'' I do not know how that is \ngoing to be possible because in addition to finishing this conference \nreport we have the defense authorization measure that is supposed to be \nfinished before we go on the recess.\n  So I simply say, please, Democrats and Republicans, Senators who have \namendments either come down and offer them, or tell us that you are not \ngoing to offer them so that we can best manage the hours or minutes \nthat we\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nhave remaining to accommodate as many of our colleagues on both sides \nas possible.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to ask for the yeas \nand nays on two amendments which I previously offered and have spoken \nto. As far as I am concerned, they do not need further debate. Of \ncourse, there could be if anyone wanted to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Is the Senator asking the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays separately.\n  Mr. EXON. We have no problem.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment No. 3995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Second, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the yeas \nand nays on amendment No. 3996.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief in concluding the \ndebate on my amendment.\n  First of all, I want to in the interest of fairness and honesty in \nthe debate say to my good friend, Senator Stevens from Alaska, that, \nnumber one, while we are debating what I consider to be a terrible \npolicy of scoring asset sales, in all fairness to the Senators from \nAlaska, there is no proposal to sell ANWR. There is a proposal to lease \nit. It is calculated to bring $2 billion. But the Federal Government \nonly gets half of that. Is that not correct, Senator? And we would \nproceed to withdraw royalties once it is developed.\n  So, as I say, in the interest of fairness, while we are debating \nasset sales, ANWR is technically not an asset sale. And I must confess \nthat my principal objection to leasing ANWR is because I consider it \nbad environmental policy. That is not to say that at some point in the \nnot too distant future in an emergency or something we will not \nconsider it. I might consider it myself. And I know all the arguments. \nI have heard the chairman of the Energy Committee, with whom I sit on a \nregular basis, make all those arguments for opening ANWR. We just \nhappen to have a disagreement on that. I consider ANWR just like I do \npeople who save money as a nest egg for their old age.\n  One other thing: In my argument a moment ago, I pointed out that when \nI was a Governor I got a check for $21 million from the Federal \nGovernment and I did not put it into the operating budget for sound \nbusiness reasons. I gave it to the Arkansas Highway Department to build \nhighways with. In that way, if revenue sharing ever came to an end, we \nwould not be all discommoded by having to fire 1,000 State employees, \nor cut the education budget, or cut the State police, or something \nelse.\n  Let me say to my Republican colleagues. The Republican Party \nconsiders itself a party of business in this country. You are friends \nof the business community. We like to think we are too. But I know the \nRepublicans for the most part take pride in being probusiness. I am \nprobusiness too. But let me say to my colleagues before you vote on \nthis amendment which will amend the Budget Act to provide that you \ncannot sell assets and score it for deficit reduction purposes call, \njust call three of your closest friends who have a business of any size \nand ask them: Would they as a sound business principle sell off a \nbuilding? Let us assume you have three buildings. You sell one building \nbecause you do not need it anymore. Ask how many of them would go out \nand hire a bunch of people knowing that next year they will not have \nthat money, and they have to increase sales, or do something to make up \nfor that shortfall?\n  I can promise you every single president of the company you call will \nsay exactly what the two previous heads of CBO have said: it is bad \npolicy.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, to be crystal clear to everybody, this \namendment does not prohibit asset sales. If the Senate voted to sell \nthe Statue of Liberty, it could do that. This amendment could not \nprohibit it. I would not vote for it. I would consider that horrible \nnational policy. All I am saying is if you do sell an asset--we have \nand we will continue to--I have voted for some asset sales--do not \nscore it. It is bad business.\n  The Senator from Alaska said his people do not want any more taxes. \nWell, now, that is not the most profound statement I ever heard, with \nthe utmost respect to the Senator from Alaska. Folks in Arkansas do not \nwant any more either. But everybody wants a balanced budget. Everybody \nwants to go to Heaven but not just yet. So I want to balance the \nbudget, but I do not want a dishonest budget. To score assets is \ndeceptive. It is dishonest. And you will miss the mark of a balanced \nbudget in the year 2002 or 2003 if you do nothing else except sell \nassets and score them. You will miss achieving a balanced budget by \nexactly the amount of the asset you sell and score.\n  Now, Mr. President, I offered this amendment last year and we got 47 \nvotes the first time I offered it, and we got 49 votes the second time \nI offered it. I am hoping we will continue the trend of increasing our \nmargin by two votes to 51 this year. Maybe not. But I can tell you this \nfight is just like me fighting with Mrs. Bumpers; the ones I win just \nare not over. This one is not going to be over until this Senate \naccepts that scoring of asset sales is bad policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Mexico will yield \njust a minute, one thing I wanted to do was to read into the Record a \nlist of organizations that support this amendment: Taxpayers for Common \nSense, National Parks and Conservation Associations, National Audubon \nSociety, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Friends of \nthe Earth, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, National Wildlife \nFederation, National Wildlife Refuge Association, Alaska Coalition, \nAlaska Wilderness League, American Public Power Association, Defenders \nof Wildlife, Greenpeace, National Resources Defense Council, Northern \nAlaska Environmental Center and the Sierra Club.\n  Now, those are mostly environmental groups, some in Alaska, and I can \ntell you what they are concerned about. Some of these people are just \nconcerned about the sale of power marketing administrations, but most \nof these organizations are worried about the sales of wildlife refuges; \nthey are concerned about selling off national forests; and they are \nconcerned about selling national parks. If you think that is \nfarfetched, just bear in mind there is a bill already in the House to \nset up a commission to do exactly that, to report back to us on the \nnational parks we do not need and that can be sold.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield to Senator Murkowski \nin just a moment. I have been here wanting to say a couple of things \nabout this approach that Senator Bumpers is talking about. Then I will \nyield to the Senator, and as I understand it the Senator wants 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Twelve to fifteen.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to yield back now and reserve about 3 \nminutes for my myself, and then in sequence I believe the order is that \nSenator Thompson is next with his amendment.\n  How long is the Senator going to take?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Probably 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator has an hour if he would like it \nbut Senators who have amendments--Senator Snowe will follow on our \nside. She seems to be ready. So we will do that sequencing.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, before the Senator moves on, I understood \nI had the right to offer 2 amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Three.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Well, one I may not offer.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You want to offer your second one right now after this \ndebate is finished?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think the Senator from Alaska wants to speak on my \namendment.\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. And then I will offer the second. We will make it brief.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So we make sure we understand, Senator Murkowski will \nhave ample time to rebut the first amendment. The Senator can offer his \nsecond amendment. He has up to an hour. I hope he will not use it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I say to my good friend from Tennessee, I will try to \nconfine my remarks to 5 or 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to talk about the \npracticality of this amendment and the budgets that are before us.\n  First, the President sent us a budget. I think my friend, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, voted for the President's budget. I checked again, and I \nbelieve the Senator did. I believe the Senator did.\n  Now, that budget has $4 billion in asset sales, $2 billion of which \noccur in the last year, using the definition that the Senator has used \nof asset sales. But let me tell you what else it has. It has $38 \nbillion in spectrum fees, $18 billion of which occur in the last 2 \nyears--the last year, and then under the triggering mechanism there is \n$6 billion more.\n  Now, frankly, I would think if you want a definition that talks about \nsingle events that you get a bunch of money into the Treasury and then \nyou do not keep getting in, you ought to expand your definition and \ntalk about the President's spectrum fee.\n  Just to put it in perspective, it is twice as much in the last year \nas the Republicans say that sale will yield and without it the \nPresident's budget is way out of balance, so it is a very important \nthing, and in all of the rationale that the senior Senator from \nArkansas used, the same rationale for the most part could have been \napplied to the President's budget and to spectrum fees.\n  Having said that, I want to make sure that everybody understands we \njust approved as part of last year's appropriations the sale and \nprivatization of uranium enrichment functions of this country. A \npreviously chartered public corporation will become private and, \nbelieve it or not, this was recommended way back in the days of \nPresident Nixon. It took us that long to understand how to privatize \nsomething that should have been privatized a long time ago. But we are \nvery grateful we got it done. I am particularly grateful; I happen to \nhave introduced the bill. It has some innovative and exciting things in \nit for this private corporation that is going to run that, including \nfor the first time ever futures are going to be sold on uranium because \nwe are going to buy a bunch of uranium from Russia, and we do not want \nto flood the market from it, so we came up with the idea of this new \ncompany having the right to take that in phases and issuing futures \nlike you do in other futures markets.\n  Under this definition, that would not have been permitted. The \nSenator indicates everybody agrees with that. But strictly speaking, \nmany privatizations would have a difficult time becoming reality.\n  My second point is the wilderness that is spoken of up there, ANWR, \nis not being sold, and I believe is not even in this budget resolution \nas assumed that it is going to be leased or otherwise. It is not in the \nbudget resolution. And as the senior Senator from Alaska said, to be \nsupplemented by Senator Murkowski, there is not a sale plan. It is a \nlease. And the lease will continue to yield royalties.\n  Why should you not count that if it ever happens? It is not in this \nbudget resolution. But if it does, clearly you ought to apply that to \nthe deficit. I do not know what else you ought to do with it. Just put \nit in the Treasury and say the deficit did not come down?\n  When you put it in the Treasury, it comes down and then you keep \ngetting royalties after that. I do not choose to speak the opposite \nside of the coin on ANWR, which has been spoken of on the floor, \nbecause I do not think I want to make ANWR the prime focus of this \namendment since it really is not.\n  This amendment does not apply to ANWR. It applies to the things I \nhave been speaking of and many more, and we ought not adopt it. We \nought to leave that flexibility where it is, as it is, in this budget \nresolution. And when you bring the budget down as much as we are and \nyou get a few $1 billion of asset sales, I believe you are not \ndistorting anything unless you cannot depict after that a steady stream \nof reduced deficits following this balanced budget. If it was the only \nthing and then it was shooting back through the air, I would be down \nhere saying that is pretty phony, but we are bringing it down so much \nthat the additional amount you bring it down by asset sales I believe \nis a pretty adequate and accurate picture of where we are.\n  I yield the floor and yield 12 minutes to Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the floor manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my \ngood friend from Arkansas. I find it rather curious he is speaking in \nopposition to asset sales today when he voted for them.\n  We had the privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, \nsupported by the Clinton administration. It is my understanding it \nwould be about $1.2 billion, or net over 7 years between $1.6 and $1.8 \nbillion.\n  The second asset sale was a sale of the helium reserve, supported by \nthe Clinton administration, a $47 million revenue stream supported by \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  Lease of excess capacity in SPRO is supported by the administration, \nsupported by my friend from Arkansas, and I think it would generate \nsome $359 million. That is proposed leases to foreign countries.\n  Then there was the sale of surplus assets by the Department of \nEnergy, supported by the Clinton administration, to generate $110 \nmillion. I believe my friend from Arkansas supported that as well.\n  Prepayment of outstanding loans: One was, as I recall, the central \nUtah project, supported by the Clinton administration, $219 million, \nand I believe supported previously by my friend from Arkansas.\n  My good friend seems to cite his problem with the formula for asset \nsales, where we are selling assets to raise revenues under the Budget \nAct. Without the change in scoring, the Federal Government receives \nmoney, but it does not count. In some instances, such as prepayment of \nloans, the Federal Government does not receive future payments which do \ncount as cash. The result is that you have a Budget Act point of order \nfor cash because you did not count the revenues. The theory there, Mr. \nPresident, is you sell something, you have lost revenues, therefore, it \nis a loss. Well, how do you get rid of anything around here?\n  A few quick points for those who are not familiar with the process \naround here. We have heard discussions on this issue before. This \namendment, offered by the Senator from Arkansas, would prevent the sale \nof assets from scoring in the budget process. This change was made in \nthe budget process last year at the request of the President, who, I \nmight add, is from Arkansas. It was not something we dreamed up at the \nlast minute. It came from the President. We happen to agree.\n  The change made last year allows us to score the sale of assets that \nare already, basically, a part of the process, and, in this case, the \ngroup that I just read off, Mr. President, is about $4 billion in \nassets that would be recognized as part of the President's budget.\n  It makes no fiscal sense to say after Congress authorizes the sale of \nan asset that they cannot count it in the budget process. It is \nabsolutely absurd to this Senator that if we sell something that \nproduces $1 billion, we have to borrow money to balance the budget \nbecause we cannot count that money that comes into the Treasury.\n  There is no reason why these asset sales should not count and should \nnot help us reduce the deficit. How could we ever sell surplus \nGovernment property? If we can lease some land, get rid of some \nGovernment surplus, then why should we not be allowed to have it go \ntoward deficit reduction? Why should it not be appropriate for the \nGovernment to be able to sell some of its assets and use the money to \nhelp reduce the size of the deficit?\n  Additionally, Mr. President, these asset sales are auctions on behalf \nof the Government. They create jobs and opportunities for Americans. \nWhether it be a mineral lease sale, a spectrum\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nauction, or a privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, as we \ndid last year, these actions create private sector jobs. Here we have a \nsituation where we can sell Government assets, use the money to reduce \nthe deficit, and create real private sector jobs.\n  I get somewhat of a chuckle when the Senator from Arkansas shows a \npicture of the Statue of Liberty with a for sale sign on it. That kind \nof hype, obviously, may be appealing to some, but it is not factual, \nand the Senator from Arkansas knows it. Does anybody in this body truly \nbelieve we would sell the Grand Canyon or the Statue of Liberty to \ngenerate a cash flow? Of course not.\n\n  What does make sense is to sell something that the Government has, \nsuch as the use of a closed Army base for low-income housing or a \nspectrum auction. Then it makes sense that we use this money to attack \nthe deficit and not to throw it away on some other project the Senator \nfrom Arkansas dreams up. The money comes into the Treasury, and it \nmakes sense that we record it as such.\n  I find it rather ironic that in this extended discussion, ANWR seems \nto have come in. My understanding today is that the United Nations \nauthorized Iraq to put about $1 billion worth of oil each quarter on \nthe world market so that we can look to that source to ease the \nshortage associated with the supply and demand of oil.\n  My memory suggests it was only a few years ago that we had a half \nmillion men and women in the Persian Gulf for one specific reason: to \nkeep Saddam Hussein of Iraq from controlling the supply of oil from the \nMideast.\n  At that time, we were trying to put Saddam Hussein in a cage. \nUnfortunately, we did not achieve that, but it is rather ironic that \ntoday we are looking to him for relief when we have areas at home that \nwe can open safely using the science technology and experience that we \nhave.\n  My friend from Arkansas cited an extensive list of national \norganizations, some in my State of Alaska, that object to the asset \nsale concept. I find that rather amusing because spokespersons in those \norganizations have come to me and said, ``Murkowski, there's absolutely \nno question in our minds that you can open up the Arctic safely to oil \nand gas exploration and to production, if the oil is there. But you \nknow and we know that this issue is a national cause. It gives us \ndollars, it gives us membership.''\n  It is too far away for the Senator from Arkansas or others to go up \nand look at it and see for themselves the technological advancements \nthat have been made, or to go down in the Gulf of Mexico in the delta \noff the Mississippi River and see how the technology has developed to \nwhere they are now drilling in 2,300 feet of water. To suggest that we \ncannot drill on land in a very, very tiny sliver, roughly 2,000 acres \nout of 19 million acres, and do it safely is an effort to hoodwink the \nAmerican people.\n  So I am a little surprised that my good friend from Arkansas would \nattempt to roll in the national environmental groups' major issue \nrelative to membership and dollars. I am disappointed too that he would \nallow himself to be used by those groups, so to speak, who admit \nwithout question that we have the capability to develop oil and gas \nresources safely. But they know they need an issue. It creates dollars. \nIt creates membership. As a consequence, we have it brought up in this \ndebate today.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to look behind the motives associated \nwith the objections by the Senator from Arkansas who reflects on an \nobjection to the process under which the Federal Government sells its \nsurplus property, leases, if you will, its resources to generate \nfunding so this funding can come back in the Treasury and be utilized \nfor deficit reduction or the budget process.\n  I think it is an extraordinary set of circumstances that we find \nourselves in a situation where some would have this particular asset \nsale issue be seen as a vote on a resource development issue that would \nmake our Nation less dependent on imported sources of energy.\n  I serve on the Energy Committee with my friend from Arkansas. And I \nappreciate his sensitivity to the fact that we are increasing our \ndependence on imported oil. We are about 51.5 percent dependent on \nimported oil. But, you know, the other day we also saw an effort by the \nadministration, an announcement of the sale of some of the oil that \nwent into the strategic petroleum reserve, that it would be sold, about \n12 million barrels.\n  This was hyped up by the media as way of bringing down the price of \ngas. None of them were sensitive enough to really pick up on the issue \nof how insignificant it was, because when you discuss 12 million \nbarrels, and we consume 18 million barrels a day, you can readily see \nthat this is simply a drop in the bucket. But nevertheless, it was \nsignificant to the media. And we note that the President has proposed \nfurther sales of SPRO. And we are going to be debating that in the \nEnergy Committee.\n  But the single most important thing, Mr. President, is we created \nSPRO as a consequence of the oil embargo in 1973. We saw a disruption \nin our supply of oil. Congress acted in the national security interests \nof the country by creating a strategic petroleum reserve with \napproximately a 90-day supply in mind. We did not achieve 90 days \nsupply, Mr. President. We got up to about 37 days. But I find it \nextraordinary that at that time we were 36 percent dependent on \nimported oil. Today, we are over 50 percent and there is a suggestion \nthat we sell some of SPRO.\n  Mr. President, it is only a matter of time. We are losing our \nleverage on the Mideast because we are becoming too indebted to them as \na single energy source. We will rue the day in this body when we have \nnot met our obligation to reducing this country's dependence on \nimported energy by encouraging domestic development where we are most \nlikely to find it and where, indeed, we have the proven technology to \ndo it safely.\n  I also find it rather ironic on some of the issues in Alaska some \npeople would rather see a check written for the impact of people rather \nthan benefit from the creation of jobs, such as was the case proposed \nin the Tongass for $110 million, to take care of their needs. The \nenvironmental community does not suggest that is applicable to taking \ncare of the concerns of the Gwich'ins or the porcupine caribou herd in \nthis case.\n  No. It is an issue that emotionally is charged with unfounded \nrhetoric, based again on those unscrupulous, extreme environmentalists \nthat want to use this as the single most important issue to generate \nfunding, generate membership, because Americans cannot go up to see it \nfor themselves, and time after time we simply sell American technology \nand ingenuity short.\n  I can tell you as a businessman, Mr. President, if the position of \nthe Senator from Arkansas prevails, this Government is not going to be \nable to generate, from the sales of surplus, leases, or whatever, \nfunding to reduce the deficit or fund the Government, as the case may \nbe. So as a consequence, Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to \nfocus in on the real issue at hand here.\n\n  That is the issue specifically of scoring. And that is what the \nSenator from Arkansas is opposed to. That is what this Senator from \nAlaska supports, because without it we simply cannot get there from \nhere. We cannot properly address the sale of Government property and \ngenerate the funding into a worthwhile cause whether it be deficit \nreduction or other budgetary needs. So I encourage my colleagues, Mr. \nPresident, to vote against this amendment as they did last year and the \nyear before, and I believe the year before that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say that the Senator from Alaska, \nhe is correct, I voted for the sale of the Uranium Enrichment \nCorporation. I did not vote to score the money received from that sale \non the budget to reduce the deficit, to mask the size of the deficit. \nHe is incorrect in characterizing my support for his proposals to sell \nassets. I voted against the reconciliation bill out of our committee.\n  Mr. President, my point is this--I do not know how many times I have \nto say it--I am not suggesting we prohibit asset sales. I am suggesting \nthat we not mask the size of the deficit by scoring revenue from asset \nsales against the deficit. If you want to put the sale of the Uranium \nEnrichment Corporation into infrastructure that you would otherwise \nspend, be my guest.\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4014\n\n (Purpose: To restore common sense to the budget rules by eliminating \n                         the defense firewalls)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily laid aside in order to offer another \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Simon, and Mr. Kohl proposes amendment numbered 4014.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike line 9 on page 52 through line 22 on page 53 and \n     insert the following:\n       ``(1) with respect to fiscal year 1997, for the \n     discretionary category $489,207,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $531,365,000,000 in outlays;\n       ``(2) with respect to fiscal year 1998, for the \n     discretionary category $489,153,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $521,660,000,000 in outlays;\n       ``(3) with respect to fiscal year 1999, for the \n     discretionary category $493,221,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $525,742,000,000 in outlays;\n       ``(4) with respect to fiscal year 2000, for the \n     discretionary category $500,037,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $525,071,000,000 in outlays;\n       ``(5) with respect to fiscal year 2001, for the \n     discretionary category $492,468,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $517,708,000,000 in outlays;\n       ``(6) with respect to fiscal year 2002, for the \n     discretionary category $501,177,000,000 in new budget \n     authority and $515,979,000,000 in outlays;\n\n     as adjusted for changes in concepts and definitions and \n     emergency appropriations.\n       ``(b) Point of Order in the Senate.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider--\n       ``(A) a revision of this resolution of any concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998 (or amendment, \n     motion, or conference report on such resolution) that \n     provides discretionary spending in excess of the spending \n     limit for such fiscal year;''.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment would abolish what we \nrefer to around here as the firewall that protects the defense budget \nagainst any diminution if you try to take any money out of defense to \nput it in something else. If you had 5 million homeless people in this \ncountry that were hungry, and you wanted to decide, as a matter of \nnational policy, we did not want those 5 million people on the streets \nhungry, and you felt like you might cut the defense budget it would \nrequire a supermajority--60 votes.\n  Now let me explain what the firewalls do. The 1990 Budget Act \nestablished caps on discretionary spending and imposed firewalls on the \ndefense portion of the discretionary budget for fiscal years 1991 to \n1993. In fiscal years 1994 and 1995, we did not have these so-called \nfirewalls. All of a sudden last year it came back. And so the last 2 \nyears, 1995 and 1996, the firewalls were up again.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me tell you, in the 2 years, 1993 and 1994, \nwhen the firewalls were down, I want anybody here to tell me how \ndefense suffered. Did anything happen in those 2 years that would \njeopardize the national security of this Nation? I can answer that. You \ncan answer it. The answer is no.\n  I am just offended by the philosophy that every day of every year \nthat approximately $270 billion for defense is sacred at the expense of \neverything else. You might have 10 million children unimmunized. You \nmight have 5 million children who have been kicked off Medicaid and \ntherefore are ineligible for health care. You may have hungry children \nwho are not getting fed because the only meal they get is at school. \nUnder the firewalls you cannot take $1 to redress any other of the \nmillions of problems we have in this country unless you can muster 60 \nvotes.\n  The thing that I think is almost as offensive to me as that is that \neverything around here is couched in terms of either you vote for every \nsingle dime anybody can conjure up for defense or you are perceived as \nbeing weak on defense. The Budget Resolution provides more than $11 \nbillion for defense above what the President asked for. I sit on the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee. I get a chance to decide later \nwhether I think that is enough money, too much, or not enough.\n  Let me discuss what is happening to this country and you tell me \nwhether or not you think we can continue with this policy and continue \nto be a great nation. First, the argument I have heard most is that we \ndo not spend as much on defense as a percentage of the national budget \nas we did when Jack Kennedy was President. Well what is so startling \nabout that? We did not have Medicare then, either. Social Security \nexpenditures were around $10 billion to $15 billion a year; now it is \nalmost $300 billion. Entitlements did not take 60 percent of the budget \nas it does now. If you take entitlements and interest on the national \ndebt it leaves you, out of a $1.650 trillion budget, it leaves you \napproximately $500 billion for discretionary programs. Let me repeat: \nOut of $1.7 trillion, all that is left for defense and all the other \nthings that make us a great nation, a civilized nation, a democracy, is \n$500 billion--about 35 percent of the budget.\n  So here we are with 35 percent of the budget, $500 billion for \ndefense and everything else--the environment, education, law \nenforcement, medical research, you name it. So where are we heading, \nMr. President? This chart demonstrates what is going to happen. Between \n1997 and 2002 we are going to spend $1.895 trillion on defense. During \nthe same period we will spend $1.579 on domestic discretionary \nprograms. While defense spending rises during the period, domestic \nprograms are cut, down to the point that in the year 2001 defense gets \n$275 billion while everything else gets $218 billion.\n  Education, the environment, highways, medical research, law \nenforcement, our system of justice, these programs all get slashed. In \ncomparison, defense over the next 6 years get $316 billion more than \neverybody else.\n  This budget over a 6-year period cuts $60 billion in education \nspending. The other day, the majority leader of the House suggested \nthat we cut education to offset the gas tax cut. He said: ``We are not \ngetting a very good return on our dollar, anyway, for education.'' I \nswear, sometimes you would think we are living in the middle ages.\n  Mr. President, what has been happening to nondefense discretionary \nspending? We are by far the most powerful nation on Earth. One of the \nreasons is because over the next 6 years we are going to spend $316 \nbillion more than we spend on nondefense programs. I am not talking \nabout Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, welfare and all the \nentitlement programs. I am talking about just the things where we have \nsome discretion. We account for one-third of all the world's military \nspending. We spend twice as much on defense as Russia, China, Iran, \nIraq, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and Cuba; twice as much as all those \neight nations combined. We spend 17 times more than the six so-called \nrogue nations, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Syria, and Cuba--17 \ntimes more.\n  Oh, yes, we are by far the most powerful nation on the Earth \nmilitarily. This body has said, ``You can't cut a dime of it unless you \nget 60 votes.'' Bear in mind in 1993 and 1994, it did not come up. \nNobody tried to rob defense to pay for other things. There are some \nthings I would have changed. However, let me tell you where the United \nStates is not doing so well. Listen to this, colleagues: we are 21st in \ninfant mortality rates in the world. Mr. President, 27th in education. \nLet me repeat that: 27th in education by the scores the Department of \nEducation keeps.\n  Where are we in the immunization of our children? Mr. President, \n61st. Betty Bumpers has spent her entire public life since I was \nelected Governor on childhood immunization programs. I am proud of her. \nI have said many, many times if I died tomorrow, the people of my State \nand this Nation would owe her a much bigger debt of gratitude than they \nwill owe me. I do not say that to be gracious. I say that because it is \ntrue. When I think of the man hours that have been spent, I think of \nthe children's lives that have not been lost, when I think of the human \nmisery that has not been suffered because of Betty's commitment now, \nand in the last 5 years with\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\nRosalynn Carter, traversing this country back and forth, up and down, \nfor the past 5 years, trying to get these levels up, and we are 61st in \nimmunization levels. I must say, our levels are pretty high, but not as \nhigh as they ought to be. How many children in this country live below \nthe poverty line? Twenty percent of our children live below the poverty \nline.\n\n  Who has the highest teenage murder rate in the world? The United \nStates. So how are we going to address that? Not by putting 100,000 \nmore cops on the beat, because we cannot afford it. While we should be \nspending for the things that make us a great Nation, we have to keep \nthat going down, so we can keep defense spending going up.\n  So, Mr. President, I can tell you, categorically, that it is not my \nplan. I am just saying it is bad public policy, and it does not reflect \nwell on the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress to say that we consider \ndefense so important that, no matter what happens in this Nation, no \nmatter what kind of an epidemic we may have that we need to stomp out, \nno matter how many hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods we have, you \ncannot, without 60 votes, take a dime from defense to address it.\n  That is a crazy policy, and it shows how little confidence the people \nwho conjured that up have in the U.S. Congress. It is as though we will \nunilaterally disarm. We do not do it for anybody else, and we ought not \ndo it for defense. This body is not going to take leave of its senses \nif I or anybody else offers an amendment to take $1 billion out of \ndefense. If they do not like it, they can vote against it. That is \ncalled democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order that I be allowed to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on both of my amendments dealing with firewalls \nhere and also on asset sales.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I now ask for the yeas and nays on each of those \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Simon and Senator Bumpers. The amendment would \nremove the firewall between defense and nondefense discretionary caps \nand would allow defense to be used as a convenient billpayer. This \namendment encourages raiding defense accounts every time there is a \nfiscal problem. It will not restore flexibility to the budget process, \nnor help avoid any future Government shutdowns, as some would have you \nbelieve.\n  Our flexibility to determine defense spending or reduce defense \nspending, if we so choose, is not restricted by firewalls. The Congress \nwill continue to set spending priorities. Firewalls will ensure we live \nby those priorities.\n  Firewalls and spending caps are important tools for maintaining \nfiscal discipline. Firewalls guarantee that if defense spending is \nreduced, the savings will go to deficit reduction rather than to other \nGovernment spending. If the Defense Department develops a requirement \nfor additional funding, then firewalls will require the Department to \nprovide an offset.\n  Hard decisions must be made to balance this budget. We should not \nallow defense to be used as a billpayer without regard to the effects \nof these reductions on our military capabilities.\n  Mr. President, the defense budget is in its 12th straight year of \ndecline. The Secretary of Defense, service Secretaries, and Chiefs of \nthe military services have all testified about their concerns regarding \nmodernization funding. But we already have had a good debate on defense \nspending and had a vote. I do not need to waste more time going over \nthose arguments. We must maintain discipline in the budget process. \nFirewalls contribute to that discipline. There is no easy way out. \nThere is no convenient billpayer that will take care of all of our \nproblems.\n  I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, \nhas arrived on the floor. He is my No. 1 cosponsor.\n  Is the Senator from Illinois willing to defer? Senator Thompson from \nTennessee has been waiting an inordinate length of time. He has been \nwaiting on me to finish speaking. I promised him that he could go \nimmediately after me. He will not take very long for his statement. But \nI do want my colleague to be heard on this asset sale amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. I certainly agree to that--particularly if the Senator \nfrom Tennessee will agree to your amendment. Seriously, I do not have \nthe floor, but I am pleased to hear the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I inquire of the Senator from Illinois how much \ntime he needs? Since we are on that subject, it might be best if he \ngoes first.\n  Mr. SIMON. I was going to speak for 3 to 5 minutes on the Bumpers \namendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. While we are on that subject, if it is agreeable to \neverybody else, I will defer to my friend, if he wishes. Would the \nSenator prefer that, or would he prefer me to go ahead?\n  Mr. SIMON. If the Senator from Tennessee has no preference, I welcome \nthe opportunity to speak briefly, and I assure him that I will speak \nbriefly.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment offered \nby Senator Bumpers. Let me just remind you of where we were not too \nmany years ago. In 1975, I came into the U.S. House of Representatives. \nIf you take the defense budget for 1975 and add an inflation factor, \nthis year we are going to spend $22 billion more than we spent in 1975. \nIn 1975, we were involved in the cold war, a nuclear confrontation. We \nwere involved in Vietnam.\n  Now, the other side will point out that we had a draft then, and we \ndid not spend as much money on personnel. But let us face it, the world \nhas changed dramatically and, because of the pressure from our friends \nin the defense industry, we are not changing, and we ought to. Gertrude \nStein would say, ``Money is money is money.'' For us to say some money \nis more sacred than others, and we are going to give the Pentagon $11 \nbillion more than they requested, we are going to cut back on education \n$2.3 billion, I do not think that makes sense.\n\n  If someone wants to set up a firewall around education--and I \nstrongly support education--I am going to vote against that. I do not \nthink we have a firewall for anything. The Senator from Arkansas makes \ngood sense, and I hope we will have the good sense to do that.\n  I point out, about 3 years ago, by voice vote, without a dissent, I \noffered an amendment to get rid of the firewall, and the Senate \nunanimously adopted that. I remember Bill Bradley and Joe Biden were \ncosponsors of that amendment, along with Senator Bumpers. When we got \nto conference, our friends in the defense industry went to work, and we \nlost. But this amendment makes sense. This is in the best interest of \nour country, and I hope we adopt the Bumpers amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3981\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the funding levels for \n                the Presidential election campaign fund)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. McCain, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Bradley, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3981.\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION \n                   CAMPAIGN FUND.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that when the Finance Committee meets its outlay and revenue \n     obligations under this resolution the committee should not \n     make any changes in the Presidential Election Campaign Fund \n     or its funding mechanism and should meet its revenue and \n     outlay targets through other programs within its \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \ndelete the mandatory assumption in the pending resolution which directs \nthe Finance Committee to repeal the current system of financing the \nPresidential\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nelection campaign fund. The budget resolution directs the Finance \nCommittee to change the checkoff to a direct contribution to be taken \nfrom tax refunds.\n  Mr. President, as you know, we have a system now whereby our \nPresidential election campaigns are funded by a checkoff system where \ntaxpayers can check off up to $3 to finance the Presidential campaign. \nWhat the budget resolution would do is to change that to a situation \nwhere a person would have to take money out of their own pocket from \ntax refunds in order to voluntarily contribute toward this fund.\n  There is no question but what the result of that would be. It would \nbe to eventually destroy the fund and the system we have now, at a time \nwhen everybody is concerned about the way their Government is operated, \nthe way their Government is perceived, and the cynicism that so many \npeople have toward their Government, toward the role of money in their \nGovernment, and toward the role of money and the amount of money--\ntremendous sums--that is necessary to finance Presidential campaigns, \nSenate campaigns, and congressional campaigns.\n  At this particular time, the budget resolution takes exactly the \nwrong move toward all of this. We ought to be going in the opposite \ndirection.\n  There is a reason that we have the system that we have today. Along \nabout 1973, we had an affair called Watergate. We heard testimony \nduring that period of time about large suitcases full of money going \naround and cash being collected from around the country from very \nsubstantial individuals and groups of individuals, and about those \nsuitcases of cash being brought back here. In that particular \nPresidential race--it was a bipartisan problem--I remember one of the \ntreasurers for one of the Democratic candidates in the primary wound up \ngoing to jail because of some of the things that we investigated. But \nvery substantial with regard to the President's reelection campaign, \nthis was a major problem that resulted in them spending that year about \ntwice as much in real dollars--in current dollars--as was spent in the \nlast Presidential campaign.\n\n  So we were awash with money, we were awash with cash, and we were \nawash with concern in this country that the wrong people were having \ntoo much influence on the outcome of our Presidential races. So this \ndid not just appear out of the blue. It was because of a very real \nconcern.\n  I hope that we do not have such a short attention span in this \ncountry that we do not even remember things like that entire affair \ncalled Watergate back in 1973.\n  The result of the reform that came from that--there were several \nreforms, some were good, some were not so good--was PAC contributions \nor the political action system itself which was built up during that \nparticular time. But one of the results--on the Presidential level \nanyway--was that we really got more participation and have had more \nparticipation by American citizens in the Presidential campaign process \nthan we have in other elections in this country. Taxpayers somewhere in \nthe range of 15 to 20 percent participate in this program. Taxpayers \nparticipate to other elections in the range of about 7 percent.\n  Another result that has been derived from the system that we have now \nis that it has been virtually scandal free. We certainly cannot say \nthat about any other part of our system. It has also leveled the \nplaying field. I think that many of us are undoubtedly concerned about \nthe extraordinary advantages that money brings. And we have this debate \nwith regard to Senate campaigns; congressional campaigns. That is \nanother debate that we certainly are going to have in this body before \nlong, and something that is of concern to me. But because of the \nPresidential system that we have now we really have developed a pretty \nlevel playing field where there has been an incumbent involved. In \nthree out of four of the last Presidential elections challengers have \nhad one.\n  So by almost any measure at a time when very few things seem to work \nproperly, and at a time when people certainly are not satisfied with \nthe role of money and the amount of money in our entire political \nsystem, it would seem that on this Presidential level anyway the system \nhas worked better than any other. The question that you have to ask \nyourself is, If we do away with the system that we have now, what are \nwe going to replace it with? If we go to a system that is going to \ngenerate fewer and fewer dollars, as without any question this would, \nwe are eventually going to have to have a situation where people opt \nout of it. Only about three people have I think ever opted out of it \nsince we have had it. But you will have more and more people who will \nopt out of it and go back under the old system. And if you think \nraising $1 million or $4 million for a Senate campaign in increments of \n$1,000 or less is a lot of fun, somebody ought to try raising $90 \nmillion under that system. So it will be a total impossible mess where \ncandidates will be spending absolutely all of their time years in \nadvance in trying to raise these relatively small amounts of money, and \nthe people who can raise those moneys for them, of course, become more \nand more influential in policy.\n\n  So we are not leaving ourselves any fallback here, and we do not have \nanything to replace the current system with.\n  There is no doubt that the current Presidential checkoff system and \nthe current Presidential financing system could be improved somewhat. \nIt seems that my party has front-end loaded the primaries and pushed \nthe convention further back which places great difficulties on \ncandidates who have contested primaries. We may have outsmarted \nourselves there. The President this year does not have a contested \nprimary.\n  So you must look to see whether or not there are those allotments \nwhere you can raise so much money and individual States by so much and \nby such and such increments, and all of that. I would not care to put \nall of that on the table.\n  I think we can look at absolutely all of that and adjust that in a \nway that would improve our overall system. But the basic proposition \nthat we need a system at the Presidential level--I think otherwise, \ntoo, but again another debate--we need a system at the Presidential \nlevel where at least the fellow or the person that we elect as \nPresident of the United States does not have the additional baggage of \nbeing perceived to be elected by special interests at a time when \ncynicism is the biggest problem probably facing our Government because \nit permeates everything else. As I said, this is exactly the wrong \ndirection to go in. Therefore, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Members and their staffs need to be \nclear on what this particular debate is about and what it is not about. \nIt is not about the merits of the Presidential campaign fund. It is not \nabout the Watergate so-called reforms.\n  What this amendment is about is fiscal integrity. Contained within \nthe budget resolution is a provision which simply makes the \nPresidential election campaign fund tax form checkoff mechanism truly \nvoluntary. In other words, it alters it so that the checkoff no longer \ndiverts tax dollars from the Treasury. Instead, checking ``yes'' will \ndeduct $3 from that person's tax refund.\n  In sum, what this does is change the checkoff mechanism so that the \nnearly 90 percent of Americans who choose not to check ``yes'' are not \nforced to pay for the few who do.\n  At the most recent checkoff rate, this modest alteration would save \ntaxpayers about $70 million annually.\n  As I said, this modest proposal does not abolish the Presidential \nsystem, as I would like. It does not get rid of the checkoff, as I \nwould like. This is not a referendum on the merits of the Presidential \nelection system.\n  Presently, the checkoff's ``yes'' box constitutes a direct \nappropriation diverting tens of millions from the Treasury at the \nbehest of a shrinking pool--13 percent and falling at last count--who \ncheck ``yes'' on their tax forms.\n  As George Will so astutely pointed out in the Washington Post last \nyear, the current checkoff mechanism is a bookkeeping dodge. He further \nelaborated: ``The checkoff involves not voluntary contributions but \nrather a diversion of scores of millions of dollars of general revenues \nto an unpopular program.''\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\n  Mr. President, the public's disdain for taxpayers financing of \npolitical campaigns is well known so I will not belabor it further at \nthis time.\n  The budget resolution provision quite simply would modify the \ncheckoff mechanism so that people who oppose taxpayer funded political \ncampaigns do not have to pay for those who check ``yes.'' The Senate \nhas never voted on this specific question--it is not on the merits of \nthe Presidential system--so I hope colleagues who support the \nPresidential spending limit system will give careful thought to making \nthe checkoff mechanism honest by making it truly voluntary.\n  Mr. President, we ought to consider expanding the checkoff format, in \nan add-on form. I am favorably disposed to include such a checkoff to \nraise funds for America's national parks--popular national treasures. \nThere are no doubt other worthy endeavors which would be appropriate \nsubjects of checkoffs to give Americans an opportunity to directly \ncontribute, without impacting the budget.\n  The Presidential fund is very unpopular and the checkoff is \ndeceptive. To simply make it honest, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nThompson amendment.\n  I would also advise Senators that the Kerry amendment is strongly \nopposed by the National Taxpayers Union and Citizens Against Government \nWaste. In the view of these good government groups, a vote against the \nThompson amendment is a vote for taxpayers.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, to quote Yogi Berra, perhaps slightly \ninaccurately, ``This seems like deja vu all over again.''\n  It was over 20 years ago now when this Nation suffered through the \nembarrassments and dangers of Watergate. The Nation was treated to the \nspectacle of testimony about the Attorney General of the United States \nand the Secretary of Commerce shaking down the captains of industry for \ncampaign contributions, and hauling briefcases full of hundred dollar \nbills. Americans learned about expenditures that totaled over $200 \nmillion in 1996-valued dollars. They saw a genuine constitutional \ncrisis that toppled a Presidency and posed much greater risks for our \nconstitutional democracy. And they understandably were not pleased.\n  In the fallout from Watergate, the Members of Congress got the \nmessage from their constituents to fix the problems that permitted the \ncampaign finance abuses that composed an important part of that \nscandal. The Congress responded by enacting a program of voluntary \nspending limits for Presidential election campaigns in exchange for \nproviding public financing for Presidential candidates in both the \nprimaries and the general election. And, Mr. President, it has worked. \nIt has worked superbly. In all the Presidential elections since 1974, \nwe have never again seen the abuses that the 1972 election will \ninfamously represent to all who lived through it or have learned about \nit from the history books.\n  That makes it doubly difficult to understand, Mr. President, why \nanyone would want to destroy those reforms that have worked so well. \nBut that's precisely what some on the other side of the aisle want to \ndo. Just 1 year ago, when we were considering the last congressional \nbudget resolution, the Republican majority on the Budget Committee at \nthe behest of other Republican Senators made an effort to abolish the \nPresidential campaign finance system. At that time, I offered an \namendment to remove the language from the resolution that would have \nhad that effect, and by a vote of 56 to 44, obviously composed of the \nvotes of both Democratic and Republican Senators, we succeeded in \nsaving the existing system of Presidential campaign spending limits and \npublic financing that has removed corruption from Presidential \nelections, limited the amount of money spent in those campaigns, and \nreturned to the American people the allegiance of candidates for the \nhighest office in the land and the most powerful office on the face of \nthe Earth from the special interests which used to so generously pay \nfor the campaigns.\n  This year, opponents of publicly financed Presidential elections are \nusing a different approach, but the intent and the result would be the \nsame. It would end the system of spending limits and public financing \nof Presidential elections.\n  That is why I stand here with my good friend, the Senator from \nTennessee, and colleagues from both sides of the aisle. We will oppose, \nand once again we are determined to defeat, this effort to kill the \nsystem of public financing that is working to keep special interests \nfrom taking over Presidential politics once again.\n  The budget resolution says: ``This proposal would not terminate \npublic financing, only the source of the funds.'' Well come on, Mr. \nPresident, how are we going to have public financing and the spending \nlimits and clean campaigns that go with it if we don't fund this proven \nsystem? Who's attempting to kid whom?\n  This is a time for us to win back the collective faith of our \ncommunity members and the rest of the country. We should be committed \nto restoring the American trust in our electoral system. Obliterating a \nsystem of public financing that has worked for two decades is no way to \naccomplish that.\n  Plain and simple, Mr. President, the system works. In 1972, when \nRichard Nixon ran for President, he spent $60 million in that race, the \nequivalent of $200 million today. That is more than the total both \nPresident Bush and Bill Clinton spent in 1992. I challenge those \nSenators who are the proponents of the provision in the budget \nresolution to find any American who would favor a return to the days \nprior to the Watergate reforms--except, of course, representatives of \nthe moneyed special interests who would love to be able to purchase \nspecial access and influence again if we were to permit them to do so.\n  I hope we will not forget the way it used to be. We must not forget \nthat a Presidential candidate accepted a $2 million campaign pledge \nfrom an industry, and then his administration granted that industry an \nincrease in price supports that cost the American people far, far more \nthan the $2 million contribution. We must not forget the approval of an \nairline's route application shortly after a large corporate \ncontribution to the party in power. And we must remember the settlement \nof antitrust litigation on terms favorable to a corporation very soon \nafter that corporation agreed to underwrite a large portion of the cost \nof a political convention.\n  Those were the bad old days of Presidential elections, Mr. President, \nand I am totally confident the American people do not want to return to \nthose kinds of practices. These are the kinds of activities the system \nof voluntary spending limits and public financing has eliminated from \nPresidential elections, and that is why it is so important to preserve \npublic financing of Presidential elections.\n  Nearly 50 percent of Americans believe lobbyists and special \ninterests control Washington, and over 90 percent believe that campaign \ncontributions from special interest groups influence members' votes. \nSpecial interest political action committees [PAC's] contributed a \nrecord $189 million to congressional candidates during the 1993-94 \nelection cycle. It is these same PAC's that sniff out the movement of \npower in Washington as their loyalties flip like pancakes on a griddle. \nAnd in 1994, the Federal campaigns for the House and Senate cost an \nastronomical $600 million. This is a system that is out of control. The \npeople know it, and they do not like it one bit.\n  But look at the role of PAC's in the presidential election system. \nPAC's provided less than 1 percent of the funding for the Presidential \ncampaign in 1992; 1 percent. But that would change if we do not adopt \nthis amendment, if we do not save the Presidential campaign financing \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, the American people want the strings of special \ninterests cut from their Government. They want to retake control of \ntheir Government. In fact, Mr. President, that is exactly what this \ncampaign fund does with respect to Presidential elections. More people \nparticipate through the checkoff than contribute voluntarily to \ncampaigns in this country. One out of seven Americans participate in \nthe checkoff, whereas only 1 in 22 Americans contributed to campaigns \nin 1994. The checkoff could, in fact, be stronger than it is today. No \nAmerican is coerced to participate in the checkoff. It is a voluntary \nsystem. But it works.\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\n  The system of financing Presidential elections has no political or \nideological bias. And the history of Presidential campaigns in the past \n20 years demonstrate that it is warmly embraced by candidates for both \nparties. It has been accepted by both Republican and Democratic \ncandidates. Indeed, since 1976, all but one major candidate for the \nRepublican or Democratic Party nominations voluntarily chose to \nparticipate in the Presidential campaign finance system. All major \nparty candidates for the general elections have chosen to accept public \nfinancing since 1976.\n  We are faced today with a new, and ever growing sense of urgency to \nfix our campaign system. As the influence of special interests grows, \nthe distance between the American people and their Government grows. \nOur citizens, the most fundamental and critical engine to our ability \nto govern, feel they are being cut out of our democratic process. But \nthat is a debate for another day.\n  The subject for today is not to turn back the clock and retreat from \nthe single most beneficial set of changes to our system of financing \ncampaigns in our lifetimes.\n  We have the honor of representing the public trust and responding to \ntheir concerns and needs. We did the right thing a year ago when we \nrejected a very similar provision with the identical objective, and I \nurge my colleagues to once again demonstrate conclusively that the \nspecial interests will not be permitted to regain control of \nPresidential campaigns and, in so doing, unleash unlimited campaign \nexpenditures--all financed by moneyed special interests--on the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and to \npreserve the Presidential Campaign Finance System.\n  I compliment the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this \namendment. He knows, from close, firsthand observation, the destruction \nthat the abuses in the campaign of 1972 caused, and he was closer than \nmost to the further dangers that we fortunately avoided. It is \nreassuring to see him courageously stand up and resist this misguided \neffort, and I am proud to stand with him and with our other colleagues \nwho are joining as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I would like to ask the Senator from Tennessee if he would \ngive me one minute.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee who made \na very excellent case on a very difficult problem. I happen to feel \nthat this amendment should be accepted unanimously, and it might be. If \nnot, I hope when we have a rollcall vote that we would recognize and \nagree with the Senator from Tennessee who has a lot of experience in \nthe particular field that he partially cited in his remarks.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Tennessee if I might be a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator. I would be delighted.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Tennessee yield me up to 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to profoundly thank the Senator \nfrom Tennessee for bringing this to the Senate's attention. I think the \nMembers of the Senate did not realize an amendment was going to be \nrequired to do what he wants to do--return the contributions to the \nPresidential race where they were before. As the Senator from Tennessee \ncorrectly points out, it is one of the few things that has worked, in \nmy opinion, perfectly around here. I am one of the people who happen to \nfavor public financing of campaigns. We are the only developed nation \non Earth that does not publicly finance campaigns. To me that is alien \nto most people in this country. They do not like that. But I can tell \nyou that it would be the best investment the American taxpayer has ever \nmade to finance senatorial and House races and the Presidential race. \nYou take money. I do not want to be too caustic and cynical about this. \nBut I can tell you, you are never going to get things the way you want \nthem around here as long as the money plays the role it does in \nPresidential races, and certainly as long it plays the role it plays \nnow in elections for the Senate and the House.\n  So I just want to compliment him to make sure we do not move in the \nwrong direction. I would like to think that at some point we will move \nin the right direction and publicly finance these so every Senator can \nvote without worrying about who he might offend that gave him money the \nlast time. I do not mean that to be unduly critical of any Member. \nEverybody here has done it. It has become a requirement.\n  Let me just say one thing. In 1960, 70 percent of the people of this \ncountry said they had quite a bit of confidence in Congress. That was \n36 years ago. At that time you could take $100,000 in $100 bills as a \npolitical contribution and never report it to a soul. You did not have \nto do anything. Put it in your pocket. And unless somebody caught you \nat it, it was perfectly OK. You could take a 2-weeks all-expense-paid \nvacation paid for by some lobbyist. There was nothing wrong with that. \nPeople who back home came into your office seeking favors, oftentimes \nMembers of Congress would send them back to their law firm in their \nhometown and they split the profits of that law firm at the end of the \nyear no questions asked. Nobody knew, and nobody the wiser.\n\n  You could take $100,000 in hundred dollar bills for making a speech, \nand nobody knew it. Nobody cared. And 70 percent of the people in this \ncountry thought Congress was doing a pretty good job.\n  All of a sudden, CBS discovered that you could make money off the \nnews. So they developed ``60 Minutes.'' They put a little pizzazz in \nthe show business end of the news, and you could make it profitable. \nAnd they did. And ``60 Minutes'' became the most widely watched show in \nAmerica and the most profitable show CBS had.\n  Shortly thereafter, as the Senator from Tennessee alluded, the \nWatergate affair developed; scandal after scandal. From 1972 to 1974, \nuntil 1996, Congress has tried to reform itself all beginning with \nWatergate, and we have. We do not get much credit for it. But if you \nare looking for gratitude resign from the U.S. Senate.\n  What has happened? The ethics manual is that thick. Every Senator, if \nhe has any thought at all about his future, keeps the Ethics Committee \non auto dial. His secretary does. Now you have to report every dime you \ntake in over $200. You report it faithfully. You do not make speeches \nfor honoraria.\n  We passed a bill here, one of the best things we ever did, to make us \ncomply with the laws that everybody else has to comply with. I can tell \nyou a lot of people around here have found out that it was tough for \nthe business community of this country to comply with the civil rights \nbill, EEOC, to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act, to \ncomply with the wage and hour laws. We have to do that now. And you \nhave to file an ethics report, which every Member of the Senate did \nlast week, showing every dime you have, where it is, how you made it, \nevery stock you own, every acre of ground you own, everything. And \nafter all of that, today 28 percent of the people have quite a bit of \nconfidence in Congress.\n  On the one hand, you might say, well, what people did not know back \nthen was good for them. But the truth of the matter is we did it and we \ndid it right. There are about 500 Rush Limbaughs in the country. There \nare about 13 clones of ``60 Minutes.'' And so if you expect those \npeople who are in the money making business to compliment you on the \nfact that the ethics manual is that thick, forget it. But it is the \nright thing. We pursued the right course. This body, this Congress is \nbetter as a result of having cleaned up our own act. The Senator from \nTennessee is right on course when he says we do not want to go back to \neventually having to finance the Presidential campaign with private \ncontributions. It has worked fine, and again I applaud him for it. I \nwholeheartedly support it. I hope he will ask for the yeas and nays. I \nhate to see it adopted on a voice vote.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4015\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to prohibit \n    sense of the Senate amendments from being offered to the budget \n                              resolution)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending amendments, I \nthink amendments by Senator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4015.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I appreciate the attention of my \ncolleagues. I have thought a lot about this amendment. First I thought \nperhaps making this the last of the sense-of-the-Senate resolutions on \nthe budget resolution debate might be in order. But I decided that I \nwould just go ahead with the amendment.\n  The purpose of the amendment is very straightforward. I am sure it \nwould be welcomed by the managers of the bill. It is designed to \nexpedite our proceedings under the Budget Act and ensure that the \nSenate debate on the annual budget is focused on substance rather than \nrhetoric. My amendment simply states that it shall not be in order for \nthe Senate to consider sense-of-the-Senate resolutions during debate on \nthe budget resolution.\n  I see a little grin from my friend who is managing the budget debate. \nI have been around here in this body for 16 years. I have engaged in \nnumerous budget debates, and I believe as the years have gone by and as \nour debt has climbed--now it is above $5 trillion--there has been a \nlittle lessening in the quality of these debates. Perhaps it has been \ndeclining.\n  Now, the budget resolution, is supposed to lay out the framework for \nthe authorizing and appropriating committees to meet their obligations \nunder a reconciliation process. We establish ceilings for discretionary \nappropriations, and we direct the authorizers to change programs within \ntheir jurisdiction in an effort to establish what the fiscal priorities \nare and reduce, obviously, the deficit.\n  In recent years we have noticed a trend in the budget resolution \ndebate that is a little disturbing. We seem to be getting more and more \nbogged down in so-called extended debate of the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions, and as we both know, Mr. President, these are resolutions \nthat do not carry the force of law. They are resolutions that do not \nshift a single dollar from one program to the other. These resolutions \nmerely politicize a budget process that is really creaking under the \nweight of unending, unlimited amendments.\n  A brief look at today's Senate Calendar indicates that there are as \nmany as 80 amendments that we will be voting on beginning Tuesday or \nWednesday. Of those amendments, at least 1 in 4, or some 20, are sense-\nof-the-Senate amendments. We have already voted on several such sense-\nof-the-Senate amendments and more are likely to come.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendments that are offered on these budget \nresolutions are structured with only one and only one purpose in mind. \nLet us be realistic. That is an opportunity for Senators on either side \nof the aisle, whether it be Democrats or Republicans, to develop \nammunition to be used in some 30-second spot ad in the next political \ncampaign. These votes are not about substance. They are strictly about \npolitics, positioning, window dressing, and so forth.\n  This Senator from Alaska thinks that enough is enough. We ought to \nstrictly limit debate on budget resolutions to the substance of \nspending. These amendments are what a budget resolution should be \nabout, and we all know it. Unfortunately, when we begin voting tomorrow \nor the next day, we will be voting on a sense-of-the-Senate series of \namendments that again will not shift one single dollar of spending and \nwill not change a single word in a statute. Instead, these votes, which \nare merely political gestures, will be portrayed by the political ad \nmerchants as votes cast for or against the poor, the elderly, the \nenvironment, the cause, whatever. And when all the dust settles late \nWednesday night after we have allowed 30 seconds to 1 minute of debate \non each of these amendments, nothing, absolutely nothing will have \nchanged in a substantive sense except the records of all Members of \nthis body will have simply been distorted.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would note the irony in the fact that my \namendment which would provide a real change to our budget process may \nvery well be ruled out of order.\n  Consider, if you will, that Senate amendments that are not binding, \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments, are in order under our budget process, \nbut real, substantive amendments can be ruled out of order. Is it any \nwonder that public cynicism of the Congress is at an all-time high?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make one further statement \nrelative to the debate that I participated in with the Senator from \nArkansas on asset sales. It would be simply to add to my remarks a \npoint that I think we all have to consider as we vote on asset sales.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4013\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend \nfrom Arkansas, I think his interpretation has a little Alice in \nWonderland quality to it. What he says, it appears, is if you have a \npiece of property, as an example, that you own, and you rent it out for \n$500 a month, and then, if you sell that property for $75,000 or \n$80,000 to pay off your debts, you cannot use the $75,000 or $80,000 to \npay off your debts, but in fact you have to count the loss of the $500 \nper month rent as an additional debt. That just does not make sense. \nThis is a result, if you will, if you adopt the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. You will never be able to sell Government assets \nbecause it will not be counted as proceeds from the sale.\n  So I hope my colleagues will reflect on that.\n  I yield the floor at this time and ask my colleagues to consider the \nmerits of abolishing the sense-of-the-Senate resolutions as they apply \nto the budget resolution debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of \nthe committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4015\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Alaska leaves the floor, let me talk with him just for a moment \nabout sense-of-the-Senate amendments. There are pending 28 amendments, \nand 17 of them are sense-of-the-Senate amendments. That means that 17 \nof them have in no way changed the budget resolution. They do not say, \n``Increase taxes to pay for some program the budget does not cover \nadequately.'' They do not say, ``Cut taxes because American families \nneed tax cuts.'' They are just sense of the Senates.\n  I am going to address my remarks a little differently than the \nSenator. Frankly, it does not matter to me whether the sense-of-the-\nSenate amendments are politically motivated or not. I have come to the \nconclusion that when you have budgets on the floor of the Senate, there \nis a lot of politics. There is some very bona fide politics, and that \nis the parties' attempts to distinguish themselves and say this, \nessentially, is what we are for; this is what you are for.\n  But I have wondered since the very beginning, and I have managed many \nof these bills, whether the votes with reference to sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions have had any significant merit in terms of changing how the \nbudget ends up, how the appropriators end up spending the money. I have \nnot asked whether these sense of the Senates have had any impact as \npeople interpret them, but I am going to give you my own \ninterpretation. I believe it is close to right, I would say, not over 1 \npercent have any impact. Some will come to the floor and say, \n``Senator, we said you should maximize LIHEAP,\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\nthe protection for poor Americans who need help in their heating and \ngas for their homes and electricity. And because we said in a sense of \nthe Senate it should be maximized or kept at last year's level, and it \ncame out that way, therefore the sense of the Senate was effective.'' I \nwould say it probably was coming out that way anyway, in my \nunderstanding of the appropriators' autonomy in this area in deciding \nhow to spend the money, which is exclusively theirs. I do not think we \nhave had much impact.\n  On the other hand, we have spent an untold number of the 50 hours of \nthe debate talking to the American people as if these sense-of-the-\nSenate proposals are substantive and are meaningful. Let me venture a \nguess, with my friend from Alaska. There will be advertisements made in \nthis next campaign which come right out of a sense of the Senate. It \nwill not talk to the public that it is addressing, in the sense that \nthis was just a sense of the Senate, one of these, ``Gee, we hope you \ndo it,'' or, ``If everything is OK and comes out all right, we would \nlike you to do it.'' It comes out as if something substantive was \nchanged or not changed with that vote.\n\n  Frankly, I think it is time we come to our senses here and get these \nmatters debated here in the Senate, not in manners that will be most \ndifficult for the public to understand, confuse them, but rather as \nstraightforward and as substantive as you can.\n  To that extent, I will stay here the whole 50 hours and gladly debate \namendments that change the priorities in this budget which I have \nbasically produced on the Republican side in coordination with House \nRepublicans.\n  Having said that, I am going to support the Senator's proposal. There \nmay be a little downside. But I am absolutely convinced the upside to \nit for both parties, Democrats and Republicans--for the Senator knows, \nif this becomes law it will clearly mean that when the Democrats are in \nthe majority, we are not going to be offering 42--48--35 sense-of-the-\nSenate amendments, trying to set forth some feeling of ours that we \nwant them to share or not share in a vote. But I believe overall it \nwill be very healthy for budgeting if we stuck to budgeting and not to \nexpressing our views about how something should be or should not be \nthrough sense-of-the-Senate proposals.\n  I commend the Senator for it. I think he has gotten to the heart of \nsome of the problems. I submit we still have a huge number of \namendments and we are going near--at 10 o'clock tonight we will have \nonly 8 hours left on this resolution and we probably will have 30 or \nso, 35, and over half of them will be sense-of-the-Senate proposals.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may thank the chairman of the Budget Committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as he so eloquently pointed out, this \nis somewhat of a charade. The American people assume that what we are \ndoing here, debating at length, has a binding commitment of some sort. \nBut sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, as the Senator from New Mexico \nstated, do not carry the force of law. They do not shift a single \ndollar from one program to another. I guess it is the contention of the \nSenator from Alaska that they politicize, if you will, this process. It \nis heavy enough now. As I stated, it is creaking under its own weight \nof unending amendments, one after the other.\n  So I encourage Members to take advantage of an opportunity. As the \nchairman of the Budget Committee pointed out, this works both ways. \nThis simply says, in the future it shall not be in order for the Senate \nto consider a sense-of-the-Senate resolution during debate on the \nbudget resolution.\n  I ask my friend from New Mexico how long might this process go on? It \nmight go on for 50 hours, but we would have substantive debates on \namendments that would change, if you will--a shift of dollars from one \nprogram to another; meaningful debate instead of assumptions that we \nare debating things that will never become law, that will be little \nmore than a pretext, a window-dressing effort. And all without an \nexplanation or an addendum of some kind to stipulate that this is \nnonbinding.\n  If we started every debate with an explanation of what a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution was and at the end concluded with what it was, \nwhy, the American public would say, ``What are you doing? You mean you \ntook 15 or 20 minutes on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and it is \nnonbinding and does not shift a dollar, and then you reminded us again \nat the end that that is what it did? Why,'' they would say, ``what are \nyou doing? You are simply wasting the Senate's time.''\n  So I encourage my colleague to reflect on the merits of that. I see \nwe have another Member on the floor.\n  I ask that the yeas and nays be ordered on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This is not a unanimous-consent request. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You will get your yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4014\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield in just a moment to my good friend, \nSenator Exon.\n  Could I take just 2 or 3 minutes on one other issue and then yield \nthe floor? I think the debate on firewalls occurred. Let me make three \npoints.\n  One, Senator Bumpers said that outlays over the next 6 years for \nnondefense discretionary are only $1.6 trillion, and then he proceeded \nto compare that with defense discretionary and indicated that, \nobviously, there was too much money being spent on defense.\n  Everyone should know that the part of domestic spending that was \nspoken of at $1.6 trillion is only that which appears in the annual \nappropriations bills. If you put the rest of the domestic spending for \nall the other programs that are not there--that are entitlements, that \nare mandatory programs--then we put in perspective defense versus \ndomestic because $7.4 trillion over the next 4 years will be spent for \ndomestic programs, not $1.6 trillion, a tremendous number that is \nmultiples of the defense budget, and that is how it should be. But it \nis not $1.6 trillion; it is $7.4 trillion.\n  So, 82 percent of all Federal spending over the next 6 years will be \nin nondefense spending. These are facts right out of the budget. There \nis no attempt on my part to give the Senate anything but the numbers \nthat appear there.\n  Firewalls. Firewalls in the Senate budget resolution are a creature \nof concern for pressure being put on the defense budget. Whenever \ndomestic spending is tightened, the temptation is to take the money out \nof defense.\n  At one point in the history of budgeting, perhaps as much as 7 or 8 \nyears ago, or 10, the Senator from New Mexico came up with an idea that \nonce you vote on the defense numbers in the budgets, that you had to \nuse all of that for defense, and if you did not, you put the rest of it \non the deficit; you did not spend it. The definition, therefore, of a \nfirewall is, without a 60-vote majority, you cannot spend defense money \non domestic programs.\n  I believe, as we attempt to whittle down the annual deficit, which \nwill put pressure on domestic spending, that we ought to leave those \nfirewalls up. We ought to be judicious and careful when we set the \ndefense amount, but then we ought not subject it to the pressure of \nwhether we should take out of it to spend for some program on the \ndomestic side that we may not be able to fully fund. Maybe it is low-\nincome energy assistance. If you cannot fund it totally, do you take \nsome money out of what you voted for defense, or are you precluded \nwithout a supermajority?\n  So I think Senator Bumpers' amendment ought to be defeated. For the \nnext few years while pressure is on both defense and domestic, we ought \nto have the vote here on the floor on the budget resolution, and the \ndebate with reference to defense be the final vote as to how much is \navailable.\n  I repeat, we do not have to spend it all if the appropriators find \nfor some reason it is not necessary, but we ought to then put it on the \ndeficit and not turn these accounts into two lines blocking to see \nwhich one can take money away from the other part of this budget.\n  The Bumpers-Simon amendment would eliminate the firewalls between\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\ndefense and nondefense discretionary spending in the resolution for \nfiscal years 1997 and 1998. By eliminating the firewalls, this \namendment exposes the defense budget to even deeper reductions to pay \nfor higher domestic spending. Defense spending is the only category of \nspending that actually has declined over the past decade.\n  Firewalls have been a part of congressional budgeting operations this \npast year and from 1991-93. They have been an effective tool to help \ninstill discipline in the budget process and to help enforce the \nspending limits Congress sets in budget resolutions. The amendment \nwould simply enable backdoor cuts in the defense budget by permitting \nthem later in the fiscal year, after Congress has set what it thinks \nare the ceilings for defense and domestic discretionary spending. The \nfirewalls are now more important than ever. The reason is simple: The \ndefense budget is under more pressure from domestic discretionary \nspending than ever before. We are already seeing several amendments in \nthis debate to increase domestic spending either through tax increases \nor cuts in defense.\n  There are already too many cuts in the defense budget. Studies from \nCBO, GAO, and others show that there is already not enough money in the \nClinton defense budget to support even the President's own force \nstructure plan. As a result, aircraft, ships, tanks, and helicopters \nare aging beyond what even this administration believes is tolerable. \nTransfers out of defense will just make these and similar problems \nworse.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4015\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself what time I may need in \nopposition to the sense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has made several points today with regard \nto the sense-of-the-Senate amendments that are before the body that \nmight lead some to expect that the Senator from Nebraska would jump at \nthe opportunity that is being offered by the Senator from Alaska to do \naway with sense-of-the-Senate amendments.\n  Yes, the Senator from Alaska has offered an amendment to prohibit the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments. OK, there is some validity for that \nargument. Sense-of-the-Senate amendments do not have, obviously, the \nforce of law, as I have made the point on several occasions earlier \ntoday. But let us stop and think. If we prohibit them, what would be \nthe result? Frankly, I do not think very much, because Senators would, \nas a substitute, offer small changes in dollars in a regular amendment \nwith some very long statements of the purpose. There is no way, I \nsuggest, to get out of such votes, whether they are sense of the Senate \nor not.\n  In a way, I will simply say as much as we all may find sense-of-the-\nSenate amendments a bother to deal with, the alternative may actually \nbe worse. Sense-of-the-Senate amendments allow the Senate to let off \nsteam on a particular subject without actually spending any more money \nor, even better, making more laws that have not been thought through. \nSometimes that can be a useful thing just to let off steam.\n  If the Senate adopts the Murkowski amendment, this will be just \nanother limitation on the rights of the minority. I will simply say \nthat all of those years that we were in the majority, at least while I \nwas here, the majority never tried to interfere with the rights of the \nminority. Therefore, while I am not accusing the author of the \namendment of being devious, the facts are that sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions all during those years when the Republicans were in the \nminority were used quite successfully to make points that they could \nnot make in any other fashion.\n  So I simply say the minority should be prevented possibly from even \nchanging any language, if we proceed as in the fashion as suggested by \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n\n  I point out that this is a tradition in the Senate that has been \naround a long, long time. Maybe it is something that we should take a \nlook at. Maybe we could expedite the procedures of the Senate, which I \nthink we would all like to do. But let us pause for just a little bit. \nLet us discuss this for a little bit. As far as I know, there have been \nno hearings on this matter, which I think there should be when we are \nmaking such a fundamental change in the procedures of the Senate.\n  Let us talk. Let us investigate the pros and cons of taking the \naction that, as far as this Senator knows, just came out of the blue. \nLet us take a little time before we take this step that has been around \nthis Senate and sometimes used successfully, especially by the \nminority, to make a point.\n  The reason that I made inquiry when the yeas and nays were asked \nfor--I did not have a chance to state my objection then--I just wanted \nto say that the Senator's amendment is not germane, and at the \nappropriate time I will raise a point of order that the amendment \nviolates the Budget Act, which would require 60 votes to proceed.\n  I simply say that this came upon us rather suddenly. We were not \nfully advised on it. I will raise a point of order at the appropriate \ntime before the rollcall vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may respond briefly to my friend \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. While it may seem somewhat out of the blue, I think \nthe point that 17 out of 28 are sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, that \nis what we have been confronted with. So the reality is, this is not \nsomething that occasionally comes up. And 17 out of 28 are sense of the \nSenates.\n  Whether we are letting off steam or gas, I think is irrelevant. The \nfact is, so much of our time is spent on something that is nonbinding \nthat basically puts us in a posture where we are not doing anything \nconstructive other than perhaps somehow evaporating in some manner.\n  Mr. EXON. It enhances debate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I really think there is a better use of our time on \nother matters. As a consequence of the propensity of the numbers, I \nthink it is justified. And 17 out of 28----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what is left, the ones left.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The ones left. So if there is more justification for \nless steam and less gas, I do not know what it is. The Senator from \nAlaska yields the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of Senator Simpson from Wyoming. We \nhad an informal list, and he is next. I am just going to make a couple \nobservations.\n  The public sometimes, at least the few that watch this on C-SPAN, \nmust wonder what is all of this about? How come the U.S. House took the \nbudget up, and in 1 day they had whatever votes they have, and now, \nlook.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is clearly committed to the U.S. Senate. \nI do not want the Senate to become a House. But I should indicate that \nsome who are wondering, ``Can't you manage affairs better over here?'' \nwell, first of all, the U.S. House establishes amendments on the floor \nthrough a committee called the Rules Committee. So they have a \ncommittee in between that decides what amendments are going to be \nallowed on the floor in normal circumstances. There is a way to get \naround that but very seldom. So they sit and listen to the amendments \nand decide which two or three or four are going to be considered.\n  Everyone should know that while the Senate is different from that, \nand different in two ways that we are very proud of--one is that there \nis great freedom of amendment on the part of Senators. That is the \nSenate. You can offer amendments in ordinary legislation. You can offer \nthem. They do not have to be germane. They can be irrelevant. If you \nwant a vote on stopping a war on a bill that is funding education, the \nSenate lets you do that. It is one of the great strengths of this body.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Or weaknesses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Or weaknesses. Some say it is a strength because it is \nthe greatest parliamentary body in that regard in the world. But this \nbudget resolution changes all that. It says you can\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\nonly take 50 hours on this bill. You cannot filibuster it.\n  The other quality of the Senate that is unique, you can talk forever \nuntil a very compelling majority says you have to start using less \ntime, breaking the filibuster.\n  This bill cannot be filibustered, this resolution nor the bills that \nflow from it, because it is very special and important to the public \nthat we get it done. So in that 50 hours there are going to be debates. \nThe Senator from Alaska is not talking about reducing that. I will tell \nyou the truth, I have thought from time to time that it was really too \nlong, even though it is limited to 50, it is too long. We get to \nrepeating ourselves down here.\n  If I look at this list, many of the sense of the Senates are very \nclose, one to another. We do it over again, over again. It could be \nlower, incidentally. The bill itself that created this law, this \nresolution, says if the Senate, by a simple majority, wants to reduce \nthe time, they just vote. That vote is not debatable, that amendment. \nSo if the Senator and I thought we were wasting time and we ought to do \nit in 20 hours, we could move that, and it would be only 20 hours.\n  But I believe when you are limited in time, that you ought to use it \nin as substantive a way as possible. This amendment is not going to \npass, the Murkowski amendment. It is subject to a point of order. \nClearly, it has to go to the Budget Committee for its formal hearings.\n  But I commend him for making a point. The point is not going \nunnoticed by Senators from both sides of the aisle. It is not going \nunnoticed that both sides are using the sense of the Senates, which are \nnot binding, to get down here and offer matters that they probably \ncould offer nowhere else, could not find a vehicle to offer it on, even \nthough it is not binding and changes nothing.\n  It is in that context that I commend him. But sooner or later this \nSenate is going to get very upset, more upset than it is today about \nwhat occurs during this 50 hours. When they get upset enough, you know, \nsomething else beyond precluding sense of the Senates is going to \nhappen with the budget process. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I know the Senator from Wyoming is here. I will just be \nvery, very brief. I will just respond, if I might. I also thank the \nSenator for bringing this up. I am not saying this is a bad idea per \nse.\n  I say two things. First, I do not believe that we should make such a \ndramatic change without hearings or discussions. I have said before, \nthere are some problems with sense-of-the-Senate resolutions.\n  I will make the point of order, which I hope will be sustained. I \nwill be the first to say maybe we should discuss this. I simply say \nthat I pointed out in my statement that I am fearful that if we would \nproceed as has been suggested here, that Senators, being very \ningenious, would come up with another situation and we would have sense \nof Senates without having them called sense of the Senates.\n  With regard to who benefits from or who is handicapped with sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments, I think I can say very forthrightly, Mr. \nPresident, when you are in a majority, you do not like sense-of-the-\nSenate amendments and you wish that the 50 hours would be cut to 15. \nWhen you are in the minority, your views change very dramatically, I \nmight say, and you think that 50 hours is not enough. But I say, \nspeaking for the minority, and I hope the majority, of the Senate, that \nwhile I would agree we should take a look at this, I do not believe we \nshould take action to that effect as suggested by the Senator from the \ngreat State of Alaska. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Certainly this is not obviously the most propitious time \nto come here, just wandering in from my post in the Dirksen Building, \nto find that this spirited debate is being participated in by my \nfriends. I have just come to the floor on behalf of my fine, bipartisan \nparty crew of Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Hank Brown of \nColorado and Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Robb and myself to place \nbefore the body nothing more than a sense-of-the-Senate resolution--\nwhich that type of resolution has taken certainly some heavy abuse in \nthese last moments.\n  However, in regard to everything we do here, if everybody else is \ndoing it, I get to do it. Therefore, with regard to Senator Murkowski, \nI hope he will repair to his chambers until I finish mine. That would \nbe perfectly appropriate.\n  I was trying to think of a new name for it. Mr. President, SOS. That \nis what it is, an SOS--sense of the Senate. It means I could not get \nthis handled in committee; nobody will vote for it in any other way. I \nthought I would SOS the thing out to see what would happen to it, kind \nof throw it up on the pole, and then people can say when they get home, \n``Well, I voted for it, but it was just a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution,'' getting you off the hook, or you voted against it, saying \n``Well, it was just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.'' Thus, it is \nsomething that enables you to get off the hook.\n  So it is. But my friend, Frank Murkowski, is right. So is Senator \nDomenici and so is Senator Exon. They really get to the point of \nwretched excess. But they bring before the body issues which do not \nseem to find their way into any other niche. I think sometimes they \nbecome, especially in foreign policy, they become quite dramatic.\n  I can remember being in other countries and suddenly one of the \nemissaries of that country will come up and say, ``Why does your U.S. \nSenate vote to do this to our country?'' I will say, ``I am not aware \nof that.'' They will say, ``Yes, here is the rollcall vote''--a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution, usually at 2 a.m. in the morning, maybe 11 \no'clock at night. We see them in the Cloakroom. We come out and we pass \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is usually best described in \nforeign policy as ``totally meddlesome,'' usually about religion or \nwhatever they do in their own culture. It passes 90 to zip, or 95, and \nwe know not what we do on those.\n  This is about domestic policy, and we know what we do. You will not \nwant to do this if you think about it because this sense of the Senate \nis about the entitlements, the eternal discussion, the eternal plea, \n``Well, if we could just do something with the entitlements.'' I tell \nyou, if we could, we would solve all of the problems of this fine \nchairman, Pete Domenici, and his ranking member, Jim Exon, who have \nsolved them all because we are in a situation where none of us in this \nbody even vote for 67 percent of the national budget--do not cast a \nsingle vote. It all just ``goes out,'' automatic pilot.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4016\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on long-term entitlement \n                                reforms)\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I send an amendment to the desk with regard to long-term \nentitlement reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], for Mr. Kerrey, for \n     himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Simpson, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4016.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING LONG TERM ENTITLEMENT \n                   REFORMS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that--\n       (1) effective January 1, 1997--\n       (A) the age for eligibility for civil service retirement \n     should be increased to--\n       (i) 60 years with 30 years of service;\n       (ii) 62 years with 25 years of service; and\n       (iii) 65 years with 5 years of service; and\n       (B) this proposal should not apply to anyone currently or \n     previously employed by the Federal Government as of January \n     1, 1997:\n       (2) effective January 1, 1997--\n       (A) the age for eligibility for military retirement \n     benefits for active duty personnel should be increased to 50 \n     years of age with benefits reductions for personnel retiring \n     before 50; and\n       (B) this proposal should not apply to anyone currently or \n     previously serving in the United States military as of \n     January 1, 1997;\n       (3) effective January 1, 2000, the age at which a person is \n     eligible for medicare should be gradually adjusted to \n     correspond\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\n     with the age a person is eligible for normal social security \n     retirement;\n       (4) there should be a COLA for only that portion of \n     individual civilian and military pension levels that do not \n     exceed $50,000 per year;\n       (5) the eligibility age for social security retirement \n     should be gradually adjusted to 70 years by the year 2030 in \n     2 month increments;\n       (6) workers should be allowed to divert 2 percent of their \n     total payroll tax into their own  personal investment  plan \n     as long as there is no effect on the solvency of the social \n     security program;\n       (7) the consumer price index should be reduced by .5 \n     percentage points so as to more accurately depict the cost of \n     living.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, my colleagues will be over momentarily to \ndebate this and discuss with you, but let me just say I feel this \namendment is extremely important to help to establish the greatest \ncredibility for this balanced budget resolution. This resolution \nalready represents a tremendous, laudable effort on the part of the \nBudget Committee chairman. No one does this with greater energy and \ndedication than Senator Pete Domenici and Senator Exon. They have done \nso much.\n  This is the work product we will soon vote upon. I believe we can \nmake the effort a bit stronger, a bit more credible, by expressing in \nthis resolution how we intend to make good on the promises that it \ncontains. All of us have heard the directives leveled at the \nPresident's budget and on the budgets offered by the Republican \nmajority for deferring too many of the ``tough decisions'' until future \nyears, leaving them to future Congresses and future Presidents.\n  We have a great tendency here to want to take credit for setting up a \nbalanced budget path, but not to enact any of the tough choices. We all \ndo it. I do it. We all do it. We will not do the tough choices right \nnow which would give any force or effect to those aims. So we could \neasily wind up in a situation we could have a balanced budget in the \nyear 2002 but it explodes again into massive deficits afterward. Or \nquite likely we might not get there at all, even in the year 2002, \nbecause we leave too many ``tough calls'' to that Congress legislating \nthose last few years. We have all been through that process before and \nwe know how it goes. We sure do. It goes nowhere.\n  If we are going to make good on the promises of balancing the budget, \nI believe we have to make the choices which once made now will produce \nsignificant savings in those distant years. This resolution attempts to \nput the Senate on record with respect to the central factors which \ncaused the explosive growth caused in this Nation's entitlement \nprogram. Those factors, my colleagues, are population aging, the \ncompounding of generous cost-of-living allowances, COLA's, and our \ntotal failure to structure our Nation's pension systems, Social \nSecurity systems, to generate real savings and economic growth.\n  This issue of eligibility ages for retirement benefits is a serious \none. This is one we cannot duck. This country is aiming at a tremendous \nrate. Recently we did away with much of the Social Security earnings \nlimit for seniors who work. That has been discussed heavily today. We \ndid that because we recognize that America is growing older gracefully. \nPeople can work longer and be productive longer. We find that very easy \nto do when it comes to handing out benefits, or perhaps I should say, \nshoveling out benefits, regardless of your net worth or income, you get \nit.\n  At the same time, we are not dealing with population aging as far as \nit affects the amount of time which people are spending collecting \nretirement benefits. That failure is driving the Federal deficit, the \nSocial Security system and the Medicare system to absolute extremity. \nIf we ignore that one, I can assure you we are dooming today's young \nAmerican worker. When we started a few months ago, Medicare was going \nto go broke in the year 2002. Then we shaved it a little, broke in \n2001, and now we say 2000.\n  With Social Security, we do not even touch that. We are not supposed \nto utter the word or crawl under your desk and try to get out of the \nbuilding before the AARP detonates your chair. That is where we are \nleft. If they do not detonate your chair, the great deed will be \nreported by Martha McSteen and her crew, or perhaps by the Gray \nPanthers, who will lob over types of explosive devices.\n\n  That is what we get out of this debate. Do not touch CPI. Do not \ntouch this. Do not touch that. We will fix it some day, but we will not \nfix it now. When we do fix it, we know there are three ways to go: \neither you reduce the benefits of that system, you increase the payroll \ntaxes, or you borrow more money. That is the subject of another debate. \nDo not think that my colleagues and I are leading you down the path of \nSocial Security long-term solvency reform. We are not that dazed.\n  So, we are going to have to phase in these changes. We are saying in \nthis resolution that we will make the gradual changes in eligibility \nages to bring some realism to them, that we should phase in the changes \nover generations to give Americans ample time to prepare for the \nchanges.\n  Consider what it means to be a young worker today to retire on Social \nSecurity at the age of 70. Hear this one. Today's 26-year-old will turn \n70 in the year 2040. Guess what? If we do not make changes, Social \nSecurity will be bankrupt a full decade before then. Who will be hurt \nby asking the worker to wait until the age of 70? Certainly not that \nyoung worker. That is the only way he or she stands to collect one \nsingle nickel. Today's retirees would not be affected one whit.\n  This debate has been polluted by seniors who continue to raise hob \nwith us who will not be affected in any way by what we are doing. \nAnybody over 51 might get a little ding and anybody over 55 is not \ngoing to get a ding at all. They are the ones that show up all the \ntime. I think it is not very seemly.\n  Another provision in this resolution should be a cost-of-living \nallowance only for that portion of civilian and military pension levels \nthat do not exceed $50,000 a year.\n  This is an extremely modest gesture. Indeed, I personally have \nconcluded, after years of study and my service on the Entitlements \nCommission with Senators Kerrey and Danforth, that we have to take a \nharder look at these COLA's than that--not only within the Federal \nemployee COLA's, but also our own COLA's regarding Congress and within \nSocial Security. But this provision in our resolution does not even \nsuggest that we deal with Social Security COLA's at all. It is an \nextremely tentative step, which I feel represents a bare minimum of \nwhat this body should support.\n  Let me just say that we talk of COLA's and limiting it to the first \n$50,000 of a retirement pension. We do not mean that people with \npensions greater than $50,000 will get no COLA at all. They will still \nget a COLA no matter how large a pension they are receiving. We simply \nsuggest that the cost of living for an individual with a $100,000 \npension is not really any higher than that individual with a $50,000 \npension. So the wealthier individual should not be getting a greater \ncost of living allowance. If you go out in the land and ask them \nwhether Federal employees with $50,000 pensions in retirement are able \nto keep up with the cost of living, I can assure you most Americans \nwill say that they are and give you a horrid horse laugh in the \nprocess.\n  Only 6 percent of the people in America, while they are working, make \nover $60,000 a year. Here we have a figure that we probably will have \ndifficulty dealing with some of the senior groups about. But that is \npart of the problem. The sooner the American people realize it, the \nbetter off they will be.\n  Finally, the key provision in this resolution says that workers will \nbe allowed to divert 2 percent of their total payroll tax into their \nown personal investment plan, ``as long as there is no effect on the \nsolvency of the Social Security program.'' That last part is a key \nphrase because no one who votes for this can fairly be accused of \nattacking the ``solvency'' of Social Security.\n  In fact, quite the contrary is true. The President's own Advisory \nCouncil on Social Security Produced a series of recommendations about \nhow to actually guarantee the solvency of the Social Security program, \nand more than half of the Council suggested that some form of \npersonally owned investment accounts must be part of the solution.\n  So there are a variety of reasons why that is so. One is that all \nconventional solutions to the solvency problem tend to hurt the very \npeople who stand to get a ``raw deal'' from Social Security--today's \nyoung workers. Already,\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\ntoday, they stand to get a ``negative return'' on their Social \nSecurity, as compared with the bonanza enjoyed by today's retirees--and \nthat is so even if the system remains solvent. In order to keep solvent \nvia ``conventional'' solutions--raising payroll taxes, delaying \nretirement ages, cutting benefits, all of it, borrowing money--the deal \nfor these young Americans gets far, far worse.\n  I will let my colleague from Nebraska speak further with regard to \nthe personal investment plan, which he and I have been talking about \nfor a long time.\n  Somewhere along the line, we have to see people saving, let them know \nthey own these plans, and that their heirs can inherit it. The \nGovernment cannot ``get to it,'' or spend it. Hopefully, we can get \naway from the old adage that this Congress steals from the Social \nSecurity fund and that we pillage the fund and rip, unravel, and ruin \nall the things that go with it.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, there is no fund. There is no trust fund. It is \na great stack of IOU's. You know it, I know it. The trustees of the \nSocial Security system know it. It is a huge ``trust fund'' consisting \nonly of T-bills, mere ``promises to pay,'' that the Government will \nraise the money at some distant future date through general revenues--\nnot from such trust fund, but from general revenues, and we have an \nunfunded liability in Social Security of $8 trillion. So here we go.\n  I commend my friends, Senators Kerrey, Brown, Nunn, and Robb, for \ntheir fine work. We have been in this a long time. I think the first \ntime we got 18 votes. The second time we got 27 votes. The last time we \ngot 43 votes. This time, it will probably drop like a rock. But we are \ngoing to keep coming right back. Maybe we can get to where we can see \nthat the American people see this as a vital vote for the Senate. It \nwill reveal much about whether or not we are truly serious about facing \nup to the long-term problems facing this country. I hope we might send \nthat message even in the form of a resolution that we can indeed be \ntrusted to deal with these long-term challenges, regardless of the \nresponse from the special interest groups whose sole function in life \nis to terrorize people so they can pick up the dues money. I am tired \nof those people.\n  That does not mean that you should not stay at the Westin Hotel for \n$70 a night instead of $140, or not take advantage of all the airline \ndiscounts and rental car discounts. But whatever they send you about \nlegislation, toss it, give it the deep-six, because every bit of it is \nfurther destined to bring this country to its knees. I do not \nunderstand that philosophy, unless they have no children or \ngrandchildren. To those who are going into the 21st century, I intend \nto be right there with them. But in the year 2030, tap on my box and \nlet me know how it is going. Right now, it does not look too good.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I cannot say that I look forward to \ntapping on Senator Simpson's box in 2030. But I am enthusiastic about \ncosponsoring this resolution with him. One of the most difficult things \nto learn in life is that you are wrong. An awful lot of us--and I \ncertainly arrived here in 1989 thinking the problem of eliminating the \ndeficit--which was, I believe, $270 billion, or something--was going to \nbe a relatively easy transaction, that we just needed to get rid of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, cut congressional pay, and all the odds and \nends that you hear a lot, that it was going to be a relatively easy \ntransaction. Then I started to listen to two Senators who, every year, \ncame down with an amendment to the budget resolution--Senator Nunn of \nGeorgia and Senator Domenici of New Mexico. They came down making this \nargument for reform of our entitlement programs.\n  I must say I voted against them the first time it came up. I think \nthey had 12 or 13 people who voted for it, and it kept getting larger. \nEventually, by presenting the facts they persuaded me that looking for \nan easy solution, as I said, like waste, fraud, and abuse, and other \nodds and ends, was not looking in the right place.\n  Basically, if you want to balance the budget, or, as important, if \nyou want to restore some balance to the expenditures that we make in \nthis country, taking us back to a point where we can say we are \nendowing the future with investments in education, transportation, and \nother sorts of things, then you have to change current law to affect \nthe proportion of our budget that goes to entitlements. One of the \npieces of misinformation perpetrated in this country is, A, we are \nbroke, which we are not; the Nation is wealthier than any other on \nEarth. Our Nation is wealthier than at any point in the history of our \ncountry. We are wealthier than we were in the 1980's, 1970's, 1960's, \nand 1950's.\n\n  The proportion of taxes collected and used for Federal expenditures \nis about the same as in the last 50 years. It went up end of the \n1920's, and during World War II, and then the same during the Vietnam \nwar. It is roughly 19 percent. What is changing dramatically is the \npercentage of that 19 percent that goes to entitlements versus what \ngoes to those investments in our future. In this year's budget, it is \nabout 67 percent. It is drawing to 72 percent at the end of the 2002 \nperiod.\n  When the baby boomers start to retire--and demography is doing this, \nand there are 77 million baby boomers. This is not caused by Ronald \nReagan, or conservatism, or liberals, or anything like that. It is \ncaused by demographics. There are 77 million in the baby boom \ngeneration--the largest generation in the history of this country. When \nthey start to retire in very short order, approximately 2013--unless we \ninterrupt it with this kind of change--what happens is the entire \nFederal budget is converted to transfer payments. You cannot cut \nwelfare enough, and you cannot cut all the other mandatory programs \nenough to be able to make up the difference.\n  So this country will have gone in a span of approximately 2\\1/2\\ \ngenerations, or about 45, 50 years, from a point where 70 percent of \nthe budget was taken up for investments in space, investments in \ntransportation and education, all those sorts of things that do produce \na long-term benefit; 30 percent for entitlements and interest, will \nhave gone from that point to a rather balanced approach, where 100 \npercent of it will be transferred for current consumption, and will not \nbe good for the future or for the economy. We know, looking at the \nnumbers, that at some point we have to interrupt that trend. The only \nquestion is when.\n  When we collectively say, ``I wish it were otherwise, I wish it was \nan easier approach, I wish what Senator Nunn and Senator Domenici have \nbeen talking about all the way through the late 1980's and the 1990's--\nI wish they were wrong,'' they, in fact, were not wrong. They were \nright.\n  This proposal tends to do something that is actually relatively \nmodest. Those who will describe it as Draconian--as the senior Senator \nfrom Wyoming has said, AARP has already indicated that they are going \nto describe an adjustment in the CPI as Draconian--I remind my \ncolleagues that we did not have a cost-of-living adjustment until 1973 \nafter Wilbur Mills, who was thinking about running for President, \nenacted a back-to-back 20-percent increase in the payments for Social \nSecurity. After that occurred in 1970 and 1971, along comes the need to \nrestrain the Congress. The COLA took place as a method of restraint in \nthe initial days. Now it is considered to be sort of a sacred item \nwithout any regard for how it might adjust in an unfair fashion, \nwithout any regard for how it might, in fact, not bear resemblance to \nwhat is going on in the individuals' lives who are receiving the \npayment, and, most particularly, Mr. President, without any regard for \nwhat is happening for those people who are paying for that COLA; that \nis, to wit those individuals in the work force whose wages are taxed at \n15.4 percent in order to provide not just a COLA but the income and the \npayment for the hospitalization under Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk specifically about \nthe CPI. The two biggest proposals, the ones that produce the biggest \nbenefits out in the future, are the adjustment in the CPI down half a \npoint--you can see it is a $35 billion annual savings by the time you \nget out to the year 2003. I just challenge anybody to come up with a \nlist of $35 billion worth of cuts in the appropriated accounts. Make a \nlist of $35 billion and explain that to people who will be adversely \nimpacted by this. Ask them: ``Do you want to cut defense by $17.5 \nbillion? Do you want to cut the\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nDepartment of Energy, or the Department of Transportation? Are these \nthe things that you really want to do?'' Because unless you are \nprepared to walk to the floor--and some are; there are still a few left \nwho will want to come down to the floor and say, ``Americans are \nundertaxed. Let us raise their taxes to be able to get the job done.'' \nYou have to come to the floor to propose some offsetting cuts to be \nable to make up this kind of money, $35 billion in the year 2003. These \nyears, as everybody with gray hair like mine will tell you, go by just \nlike that. That 6- or 7-year period of time will be gone in a hurry, \nand we will be wondering as we stare 5 years into the future and see \nthe baby boomers coming on line why we did not do it in 1996 when it \nwas easy. Understand that it will never get easier than it is right now \nto make these kinds of adjustments. It only will get harder. Every year \nwe wait these kinds of adjustments get more difficult.\n  The second big item in our proposal is adjusting the eligibility age \nfor retirement to 70 years. I caution citizens who are watching this. I \nam not talking about either current beneficiaries who are retired, nor \nam I talking about beneficiaries who are over the age of 50, nor am I \nsaying that you have to wait until you are 70 to retire. That is not \nwhat Social Security is. It does not dictate that you retire at 65 or \ndictate that you retire at 67. What the program does is say this is \nwhen you are eligible.\n  Many of our citizens, in fact, wait now to take a later payment \nknowing it is going to be larger because they have managed to save \nmoney. They have managed to save money. They have a private pension. \nThey have private savings. They wait. They delay the eligibility for \nthis collective payment to age 70 right now. This does not affect any \ncurrent beneficiary. It does not affect any beneficiary over the age of \n50. Most importantly, it does not affect the age at which you can \nchoose to retire, if you regard Social Security as a supplement.\n  One of the problems we have with this program is it began as a \nsupplement, and increasingly we have been telling people it should be \nregarded as your only source of retirement income. The more we say that \nto people, the more we encourage people to regard Social Security as \ntheir only source of retirement and the less likely it is that we pay \nattention to what is going on in private pensions and pay attention to \nother Federal law that needs to be changed in order for people to \naccumulate that supplemental income.\n  When Social Security was started in 1935, normal life expectancy was \nabout 60 years of age. The normal eligibility age when this program \nbegan was age 65, 5 years after normal life expectancy. It took 1 \npercent of wages to meet that promise. Today normally life expectancy \nis 76 with the promise in payments beginning at 65, and the life \nexpectancy by the time you get out to this point--actually this point \nhere--life expectancy is forecast to be at 80. That does not take into \naccount the possibility that you are going to have a decreasing number \nof people who are smoking and decreased mortality as a consequence and \nincreased life expectancy. All sorts of things could happen in this \ncrucible of good news that happens every single day. We are discovering \nnew ways to prolong people's lives, to enable them to live longer, and \nfor many people they are now discovering that they have the glory of \nliving longer with the difficulty of trying to figure out how to pay \nthe bills over that period of time.\n  So the second big change in adjusting the eligibility age for these \ncollective payments is 70 years. You can see, Mr. President, again the \nkinds of future savings--nothing in the year 2000 because this thing is \nphased in. I say that because my mailbag fills up every time I talk \nabout moving the eligibility age. It does fill up for people who are 35 \nor 40 years old, or even 50. It fills up for people already retired. \n``Gosh, are you proposing something to reverse the eligibility age and \ntake something away?'' The answer is no. What we are trying to do is \naccommodate this enormous generation that is going to begin to mature \nin the year 2008, or 2010 depending upon how you calculate it. Moving \nthe eligibility age for Social Security generates tremendous savings.\n  Again, I just challenge colleagues. If they do not like this, imagine \nyourself out here at 2010 coming up with 2.5 billion dollars' worth of \ncuts because you have to do that. We are not going to be able to have \nthese bake sales that we have been having in the last couple of years. \nWe do not want to raise taxes. We do not want to cut entitlements. As a \nconsequence, we sell the spectrum. How many times have we sold the \nspectrum? I mean, I have said facetiously that maybe we should call \nDisney and see if they want to convert the mall into a theme park. At \nsome point you run out of assets to sell. You have, if you are not \nwilling to come down and propose a tax increase, to get it out of \nentitlements.\n  Mr. President, let me add briefly--other Senators want to speak--that \nthe CPI adjustment is an entirely fair and appropriate thing for us to \ndo. It is justified by economics, if you look and examine what the CPI \nis supposed to cover. It is justified most importantly by the fact \nthat, if I do not make this adjustment, I have to get it out of the \nhides of people who are out there right now struggling to pay the cost \nof education and struggling to pay their property taxes.\n  It is remarkable if you look at the State expenditures on people in \nthe age group 5 to 18 that are in our primary and secondary school \nsystem versus the expenditures that we make on people over the age of \n65. I am not trying to set up generational warfare here. There is \nstrong generational commitment for these programs and intergenerational \ncommitment. Social Security is perhaps the most popular program in the \ncountry. We are not trying to set up generational warfare. We are just \ntrying to present the facts. The facts are that we are spending on a \npercentage basis less and less on education and our children and more \nand more on our seniors. As I have said, we have not seen anything yet. \nWait until the baby boomers retire and the number of people working per \nretiree drops to 2 to 1. Justified by economics, justified by budget \nconsiderations, and justified by any American who wants to see this \ncountry become and remain hopefully an endowment rather than an \nentitlement society.\n  Of all the things I hope this amendment does, the key amongst them, \nto me, is I hope that it presents an opportunity to change the terms of \nthis debate from one of blasts being fired back and forth across the \naisle between Republicans and Democrats. The facts of the matter, I \nbelieve, call upon us to come and say, ``Let us just present the truth \nto the American people.'' They may not like the truth any more than \nthousands of us who have discovered it.\n  But in presenting the truth, let us not try to level the playing \nfield. Give the American people the facts. In my judgment, they will \nlevel the playing field themselves. To continue to perpetuate a myth \nthat all we have here is a paid-up system and have no problems and no \nadjustments are needed and we can solve this deficit by eliminating \nwaste, fraud and abuse and all the other sorts of things we talk about, \nMr. President, we are going to pay a very big price for it. I hope that \nwe are able to muster a majority for this amendment. Those of my \nfriends who have looked at this thing who are not perhaps as \npolitically foolish as I, say you cannot survive this kind of vote. I \ndo not believe we can survive the absence of this vote. I believe very \nmuch, like the votes on the Nunn-Domenici proposal, the more people \nexamine the facts, the more they look at the truth, the more they will \nsay, ``God help us if we do not change the law in this fashion.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the pending \namendment, which simply expresses the sense of the Senate that \nadjustments be made to the eligibility criteria for certain Federal \nbenefit programs. It would also permit individuals to designate a \npercentage of their payroll taxes to a private investment plan, and it \nwould make an equitable adjustment to the Consumer Price Index.\n  I commend my colleagues for their work on this particular amendment. \nI commend them for their candor. This\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\ncould be the most important matter that we pass this Congress, if we \npass it.\n  This amendment would extend the civil service retirement age for \nfuture Government workers but affect no current Federal employee. It \nwould extend the military retirement age for future enlistees but \naffect no current sailor, soldier, airman, or marine. It would limit \ncivilian and military COLA's to the first $50,000 of retirement income \nbut eliminate COLA's for no one. It would gradually track Medicare \neligibility with Social Security eligibility. It would extend the \nretirement age for Social Security but affect not a single American who \nretires in the next 16 years.\n  The pending amendment would also allow individuals to designate a \npercentage of their payroll taxes to a personal investment plan, if \nthere is no impact on the solvency of the Social Security system. This \nought to engender in our children and our grandchildren a greater sense \nof confidence that they are going to get a return from their \ninvestments when they retire.\n  We face an explosion in entitlement spending not just because we have \npromised too much to too many--we do, of course--but principally due to \nsimple demographics. Our people are living longer and the great baby \nboomer generation is getting closer to retirement. In 1940, the average \nwoman in America who retired at age 65 received Social Security \nbenefits for 13.4 years. By 1995, women and men were living much \nlonger, and the average woman retiring in 1995 will receive 19.1 years \nof Social Security or nearly 6 more years of benefits because the \nretirement age remains unchanged at 65. In 1950, seven workers \nsupported each Social Security beneficiary. By 1990, there were just \nfive workers per beneficiary. By the year 2030, there will be fewer \nthan three workers per beneficiary.\n  We all know the statistics. By the year 2012, if no changes are made, \nentitlements and interest on the debt by themselves will consume every \nsingle dollar the Federal Government takes in. This stifles our ability \nto invest in our Nation and protect our most vulnerable citizens, and \nit does not have to be. Small steps today can save billions tomorrow, \nbillions of dollars of debt we will not leave to our children--the \n``baby bust generation,'' as Pete Peterson calls those who will inherit \nour debt.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Otherwise, the day \nwill surely come when we will have to explain to our children why, when \nwe could have made a difference, we failed to enact entitlement reform, \nas modest, as fair, and as justified as the proposals contained in this \namendment.\n\n  These kinds of choices are never easy politically, but they just get \ntougher as the problem becomes more acute. Now is the time to act if we \nare going to act responsibly. Courage, colleagues, it will attract \nattacks from just about everyone, but it is the right thing to do, and \nI commend my colleagues who have worked hard for giving us the \nopportunity to do the right thing.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, for those from my generation, they will recall the \nname of James Dean. Some will recall him as a movie actor, others as a \nmodel for a generation, or at least a portion of a generation. He was a \nfree spirit by anyone's description. Some folks may recall a drag race \nin one of his movies. The drag racing was popular at a time when young \nAmericans fell in love with their cars, which has been for much of our \nhistory but, following World War II, gained strength and power.\n  In the particular scene of this James Dean movie, he and another \nfellow line up their cars at a cliff overlooking the ocean, and they \nrace toward the cliff, both accelerating as hard as they can. Of \ncourse, the contest is to see who can get ahead and stay in there the \nlongest without turning away from the cliff.\n  One can see that this is not long-term planning. It did fit the \nparticular egos of the characters involved. Some may think that is \nfanciful. Surely, no rational person would point their car toward a \ncliff and accelerate. Some would say, ``Well, they didn't believe a \ncliff was there.'' But, of course, no one who was in that gang in the \nmovie was under the impression the cliff was not there. They knew very \nwell it was there. It was part of their ego, part of their image to \nshow how brave they were to accelerate the cars as they moved toward \nthat cliff.\n  Mr. President, if somebody can find a better analogy, I would like it \nhear it. There is not anyone in this Chamber, I do not believe--and \nperhaps Members listening in their offices will come and correct me if \nI am mistaken, but I do not believe there is a single Member of this \nChamber, liberal, conservative, Democrat or Republican, who does not \nthink we are heading this country's economy off a cliff. I do not mean \njust unpleasantness, I mean absolutely running the economy off a cliff.\n  A few years ago, the President appointed a long-term entitlement \ncommission--the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform--to study \nthis question. They looked at the potential problems and opportunities \nfor entitlement programs. Here are some of the numbers from the \nCommission's final report that outline the problem. If they do not \namount to a cliff toward which we are moving this country, I hope \nsomeone will correct me and let me know what they do mean. The deficit \nas a percent of gross domestic product, of what we produce, was at \nroughly 2.3 percent by 1995. The Commission forecast that this figure \nwould increase to 2.5 percent by the year 2000 if changes are not made, \nif we do not address the problems of the entitlement spending. This \nfigure more than doubles by the year 2010 to 5.9 percent of our GDP. It \nalmost doubles again by the year 2020 to 11.6 percent and by the year \n2030 to 18.9 percent.\n  What do all those numbers mean? It means almost a fifth of our GDP \nwill be in deficit. It means that we will have astronomical interest \nrates and rising inflation as we attempt to borrow that much money each \nyear from the economy. It means the accumulated deficit will swallow \nthe future of our children and grandchildren.\n\n  No one could say that we are going to run the car off the cliff, but \nif you point the car off the cliff and you push on the accelerator and \nyou guide that car towards the cliff, and if you do not do something to \nstop the car, it is going to go off the cliff. That is where this \nChamber is right now. We are playing a game of chicken. Each side says \nwe are not going to turn back. Of course, we all know of the need to \nreform Medicare, but we sure do not want to get blamed for turning \naway. We do not want to get blamed for making adjustments in the rate \nof growth of Medicare. So the race toward the cliff continues.\n  No one can claim that this race to run our economy and our country \noff the cliff is good policy, and no one can claim that running our \nNation off the cliff shows how much we care, because the fact is, to \ncontinue on the road we are now shows exactly the opposite. To refuse \nto reform Medicare, to refuse to look at the Social Security Program \nand make lasting changes that make it solvent, shows not ``caring'' but \nthe absence of caring--a gross, callous disregard for our children and \nour grandchildren and the future of this Nation that we love so much.\n  There is one more thing I ought to mention. Because the Bipartisan \nCommission has used estimates, anyone who has looked at congressional \nestimates over the years, I think, has to be struck by one fact: Our \nestimates have proved consistently too optimistic. We put out 5-year \nreports on the future of Social Security. The Social Security trust \nfund trustees produce these reports. They are remarkable documents. \nThey project the assets involved in the fund and the earnings from \ninterest and so on. They project future payouts. There is not a single \none, not one of those 5-year reports from the Social Security trustees, \nthat has not been overly optimistic.\n  No one expects you to be able to forecast the future with exact \nnumbers. We would be foolish to think that any of these are engraved in \nstone or designed to come true without changes. But you would be \nfoolish to look at these numbers and not understand the background \nthat, consistently, we have\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nbeen too optimistic. We have not been overly pessimistic; we have been \noverly optimistic.\n  The estimate that roughly a fourth or fifth of our economy--without \nchanges taking place--will be consumed in deficits each year to the \nyear 2030, is almost certainly too optimistic as well. If we do not \nmake changes and adjustments, the skyrocketing deficit will be worse \nthan this projection.\n  Here is an interesting fact Social Security trustees put out in their \nreport. They used to do an actuarial soundness test. Actuarial \nsoundness tests are important because any program in this country is \nrequired to be actuarially sound. If it is not, what you are in effect \ndoing is selling people insurance that you do not have the ability to \npay off. In the private sector, if you do that and sell it on that \nbasis, you are subject to suit and perhaps even imprisonment. It is a \ncalled fraud.\n  What are we doing with these programs? We have them designed in a way \nso they will become insolvent or go bankrupt. The facts are very clear. \nBy the year 2013, the long-term report indicates that Social Security \nexpenditures will exceed the FICA tax. By 2013--that is not very far \nfrom now. By 2024, they will exceed not only the tax, but all the \ninterest income as well. By 2029, the estimate is the trust funds will \nreach total exhaustion. That is, we are insolvent.\n  The Social Security Program is heading toward a cliff, and to refuse \nto make adjustments or changes will destroy Social Security, not save \nit. This amendment is about saving Social Security, saving our \nentitlement programs and making them work, as well as investing in the \nfuture of our country.\n  Anyone who does not believe we need fundamental changes in where we \nare headed now, please come to this floor and debate it. The \nprojections of the Commission indicate, as my colleague from Virginia \njust pointed out, that by the year 2012, if we do not change, you can \nliterally eliminate all money for Department of Justice and eliminate \nthe Army and the Navy and the Air Force and the Marines, you can \neliminate all costs of Congress, you can eliminate all costs in our \ndiscretionary programs, and still not have enough money just to cover \nthe entitlement programs.\n\n  There is not anybody here who is willing to vote to eliminate all of \nthose programs we just mentioned. Trim them back, yes, I think we \nshould. There are a lot of programs we can and should trim back. But \neven if we eliminate every one of them by the year 2012, we are not \ngoing to have money to meet our entitlement obligations and meet \ninterest.\n  It is a nondebatable fact that we have to make adjustments in these \nprograms if this Nation's economy is to survive and thrive. It is a \nfact that we will be unable to fund these programs unless we make \ndramatic changes.\n  We can wait until that car is on the edge of the cliff before we \napply the brakes, or turn in a different direction. I suppose that is \none thing that some Members of this body will want to do, but I do not \nthink anybody thinks that is good policy. A couple of things will \nhappen. One is it will be much more difficult to solve the problem. \nTwo, it is very likely such attempts will be too late.\n  This amendment is very simple. It is very modest. It is not at all \ndraconian. What it says is, we see the danger and we want to make a \nmodest adjustments so we do not have the kind of problems that lie \nbefore us.\n  The Commission vote, I think, was nearly unanimous, save one person \nwho did not vote for the report. That individual did not think the \nforecasts were necessarily inaccurate; rather he had trouble with some \nof the Commission's recommended solutions.\n  The fundamental facts, though, are undisputed. We are headed toward a \ncliff. What can we do? Whenever you talk about entitlement programs, \none of the things that you hear, and hear for valid reasons, is, ``Wait \na minute, these are programs that people have paid into directly or \nindirectly. If it is civil service retirement, people have paid in \nthrough much of their service. So do not change the ground rules after \nsomeone has paid in.''\n  That is fair enough. If you have a choice, obviously you should not \nwant to change the ground rules, and that is the whole precept of this \namendment. This amendment says, we are going to make some modest \nreforms, but we are not going to apply them to people who are involved \nin the programs right now.\n  I hope Members will keep that in mind as they review this particular \nproposal. It does involve a number of modest changes--a modest change \nin the civil service retirement, a modest change in military \nretirement, a modest change in a variety of other areas--but they do \nnot apply to any Federal employee now employed by the Federal \nGovernment. It only applies to Federal employees hired after January \n1997.\n  The choice is not whether you adopt these reforms or not. These \nreforms will be adopted because when the fund runs out of money, you \nsimply cannot raise taxes enough to continue on. They are going to be \nchanged. The question is whether you are going to change them after \npeople have paid into the programs for many of their working years or \nwhether you will make the necessary changes before people begin paying \ninto them.\n  Our suggestion is that you ought to change these programs before \npeople pay into them. Thus, the very modest change in civil service \nretirement, very modest change in military retirement, specifically \nexcludes anyone who is now in the armed services of the United States \nor works for the Federal Government. They only apply in the future. The \nchanges in Social Security are modest. They adjust the retirement age. \nIt is phased in so it takes full effect by the year 2030.\n  Some would say, ``Why do we have to do that?'' We have already noted \nthe problems with Social Security funding. It is quite clear there will \nnot be money to meet the obligations by the year 2029. Social Security \nwill be insolvent. When Members think about this issue we ought to give \nsome thought to what has happened since this program was started, \nbecause the facts have changed.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia went through the changes that \nhave taken place in the number of workers per the number of retirees. \nThat is one of the big dynamics. Perhaps less well known is the fact \nthat in 1935, when Social Security began, life expectancy in this \ncountry was 61 years. In the year 1994, though, it was 76 years; from \n61 to 76, a 15-year change in life expectancy. Can you ignore that when \nyou have a program based on retirement? Of course not. The facts have \nchanged. There has been a 15-year increase in life expectancy, and I do \nnot think you can possibly ignore that when you begin to look at the \nprogram and how it is designed.\n\n  The Commission indicates life expectancy in the year 2025 is even 2 \nyears higher, 78. The percent of the population over 65 years old was 7 \npercent in 1935 when the program began. It was 13 percent in 1994 when \nthe commission began to take its look at this. It goes to 20 percent by \nthe year 2025. The facts have changed and we have to change with them. \nThe number of Americans over the age of 70 was 24 million in 1995. By \nthe year 2030, it will be 48 million.\n  Mr. President, the reality is this: If we cannot make modest \nadjustments in the retirement programs, an adjustment to make the CPI \ncorrect or at least closer to being correct--this does not take it all \nthe way, but a little closer--if we cannot make modest adjustments in \nthe Social Security retirement age, one of two things will happen: The \nprograms will either become insolvent or we will have to raise taxes to \nthe point in this country where we simply destroy the economy.\n  All of us are familiar with the dramatic differences in economic \nprojections and economic philosophy. Some think Arthur Laffer is a \ngreat visionary; others pooh-pooh his ideas. But, Mr. President, these \nare facts. They are not in the realm of disagreement. The President's \nown budget, brought out by a liberal Democratic administration, \nacknowledges that taxes would have to be raised to 82 percent of the \ngross domestic product simply to fund the programs that are already on \nthe books.\n  No one contends we will be a competitive, viable economy with taxes \nlike that or even taxes half of that. What we are looking at is an \neconomy and a plan for entitlements that is racing toward the edge of a \ncliff. The question is, Does this body have any more\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\ncommon sense than James Dean did when he got into that racer? The fate \nof our children rests on the answer. The fate of our children and our \ngrandchildren rests on our wisdom in taking modest steps in advance of \nthe tragedy to make it work.\n  I do not know of other proposals that are around that address the \nlong-term problem. I was somewhat amused by a former Governor of \nColorado, Dick Lamm, when he observed some caustic comment that the \nRepublican proposals for Medicare reform which received so much \nattention last year were, indeed, outlandish and inaccurate. He said \nthey were not near enough. Instead of going too far, they did not go \nfar enough, because you see, the goal here is to save the programs. The \ngoal here is to make them last.\n  In the long run, what this amendment is about is saving those \nentitlement programs. When we cast our votes on this, please do not \nthink that we are helping future retirees by ignoring the facts. Those \nwho care about retirees, those who care about our future will want to \nvote for this amendment.\n  Are the reforms modest? Of course, they are. Do they not have any \nimmediate impact? That is probably true, no immediate impact. But, Mr. \nPresident, 20 to 30 years from now they will have an impact, and the \nimpact will be significant. But more important than that, they will \nhave an impact today not in financial terms, but they will have an \nimpact in terms of hope, hope for our future, confidence in the \nAmerican dream, because facing our problems and solving them is part of \nthe strength of this great country.\n  I yield back the remainder my time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to be here on the \nfloor and listen to my colleagues and join them in presenting this \namendment to our Senate colleagues today.\n  I certainly subscribe to the comments made by the Senator from \nColorado, Senator Brown, as well as Senator Kerrey, Senator \nSimpson, and Senator Robb in offering this amendment which provides \nimmediate and long-term budget reforms that are absent from the budget \nresolution before the Senate or is absent from any other resolution \nbefore the Senate that I am aware of.\n\n  In the 1995 Kerrey-Danforth Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and \nTax Reform report, the Commission identified the following principles \nfor its approach to long-term reform. These principles were:\n  No. 1, we must plan for the future by addressing and solving our \nlong-term fiscal problem head on. That is exactly what this amendment \ndoes.\n  No. 2, we must lead by example. Congress cannot be exempt. That is \nalso what this amendment does.\n  No. 3, we must plan for the aging of America's population, and that \nis precisely, again, what this amendment does.\n  No. 4, we must address rising health care costs by emphasizing market \nincentives and personal responsibility. Again, what this amendment \ndoes.\n  No. 5, we must fulfill our promises to today's retirees and ensure \nthe long-term solvency of Social Security. Again, right on point.\n  No. 6, we must design a solution that is fair to all Americans. I am \nnot sure we will ever have anything every American considers absolutely \nfair, but we have strived toward that goal.\n  No. 7, we must act now to give people time to plan for the future and \nto avoid significant future revenue increases or benefit reductions.\n  Again, as the Senator from Colorado laid out, that is what we are \ndoing. We either take these steps now in modest steps, in doing what \neverybody who has studied this series of problems and challenges knows \nis inevitable, or we will wait longer and longer and longer, as we have \nbeen doing, and then the medicine will have to be more and more \ndisagreeable in years ahead and even dangerously disagreeable.\n  Senators Kerrey, Simpson, Brown, Robb and I are offering an amendment \nwhich lives up to the principles of the Kerrey-Danforth Commission and \nto put before the Senate and the American people some of the hard \nchoices that have to be made in the near term if we are to have any \nhope of fiscal soundness over the next 20 to 30 years.\n  A proposal to balance the budget in 6 or 7 years is a necessary \nstart, but it is only the beginning step, and that is what we are \ndebating on the underlying resolution. We can balance the budget in \n2002. If every projection works out as envisioned, whether it is under \nthe proposal presented by the Budget Committee or whether it is under \nthe President's proposal or whether it is under the Chafee-Breaux \nproposal--which I support. Even if we do that, however, and get a \nbalanced budget in 2002, we will still have a dismal fiscal picture for \nthe years following 2002, particularly for our children and children's \nchildren, because the cost of our entitlement programs, which are \nalready the major cause of our persistent budget deficits, will become \ncompletely unaffordable when the baby boom generation begins to retire \n20 years from now.\n  The Chafee-Breaux proposal, I think, is a solid proposal and a solid \nbeginning for the first 7 years. This proposal is entirely consistent \nwith that, indeed is consistent with the other alternatives, because it \ngoes further. It talks about what we call the outyears, but these are \nthe crucial years, and these steps have to be taken, in my opinion, \nnow.\n  To give my colleagues some idea of the challenges ahead of us in \nAmerica, consider the following.\n  In 1963, mandatory programs, entitlement programs plus interest on \nthe debt--and make no mistake about it, these are the popular programs \nthat are supported by the American people--in that year, 1963, this \nspending represented 29.6 percent, or about 30 percent of total Federal \nspending.\n  Ten years later, 1973, mandatory spending represented 45 percent of \noverall Federal spending.\n  In 1983, mandatory spending represented 56.3 percent of Federal \nspending. In 1993, mandatory spending consumed 61.4 percent of the \nFederal budget. In 2003, 7 years from now, the mandatory spending, or \nentitlement programs plus interest on the debt, is projected to consume \n72 percent of the Federal budget. We have gone from 1963, 30 percent, \nto 2003, 72 percent, of the Federal budget.\n  In 2012, less than 20 years from now, mandatory spending is projected \nto consume 100 percent of Federal revenues as the programs are now \nstructured.\n  Unless things change significantly, Mr. President, before 2012 there \nwould be no Federal funds left for the defense of our Nation, no \nFederal funds left for education, no Federal funds left to have a \nFederal court system, environmental protection, transportation, \nprisons, Border Patrol, housing, foreign aid, cancer research, disease \ncontrol, or any other appropriated account. All of these would be gone. \nThat is what we are talking about within 20 years. The entire cost of \nall these basic functions of Government which Congress provides each \nyear through the appropriations process, as opposed to mandatory \nspending, would have to be financed by deficit spending at the very \npoint in time when Social Security itself will start to run huge \ndeficits on its own.\n  In 2013, as the baby-boom generation begins to retire en masse, \nbeneficiary payments for Social Security recipients will exceed \nreceipts from working Americans. In 2030, when all the baby-boom \ngeneration will have reached age 65, Social Security alone will be \nrunning a cash deficit of $766 billion per year--not million, but \nbillion.\n  Or consider the following. Because Social Security has been \nconsidered off limits for so long, the program has not changed with the \ntimes and with demographic realities the way many other programs have \nhad to, and certainly the way the private sector has had to.\n  When Social Security was established by law in 1935, the elderly were \neligible to receive retirement benefits at age 65. In 1935, the life \nexpectancy of the average American was 61.4 years. Today, the \nretirement age for full Social Security benefits remains the same: 65 \nyears. Today, the average life expectancy is almost 76 years. Thirty \nyears from now, average Americans, based on projections, will live to \nalmost the age of 79.\n  Mr. President, if we had this same actuarial plan that President \nRoosevelt and the New Dealers had when they started this important \nSocial Security Program, the retirement age for Social\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\nSecurity recipients would be almost 80 years old today. We certainly do \nnot suggest that, but we do suggest fundamental and modest adjustments.\n  The current Social Security Program is unaffordable in the 21st \ncentury because this increase in life expectancy is occurring at the \nsame time as the number of workers supporting each Social Security \nbeneficiary is decreasing. I know the American people believe that when \nthey pay into Social Security, it all goes into a little account, that \nmoney sits there and draws interest and waits for them to retire.\n  Mr. President, it has never been that way. It never will be that way. \nPerhaps that is the way it should have been set up. It was not set up \nthat way. We all know it was set up based on today's workers paying for \ntoday's retirees.\n  In 1950, there were approximately 15 people working to support each \nSocial Security retiree or recipient. By 1960, there were five people \nworking to support each Social Security recipient. Today, because of \ndemographics, because of health care, there are now only----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notifies the Senator that all of the \ntime for the proponents has now expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield me about 5 minutes \noff the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, today there are now only 3.3 workers per recipient. \nThirty years from now, the ratio will be two to one. And this ratio \nwill continue to decline.\n  My friend from Nebraska, did----\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield the Senator time, but I guess he \nhas some over there.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I know there are many people who will debate this in \nan emotional fashion, but, in my view, this is not a Democratic or \nRepublican philosophical debate. It is not about philosophy. It is not \nabout anything but basic actuarial statistics and arithmetic. That is \nthe way it ought to be debated. I know people get off on an emotional \nbinge on this, and I know that it is considered the third rail of \npolitics, but the facts are the facts. Two and two is four. The \nactuarial basis of any kind of a retirement program has to be taken \ninto account.\n  I know that many question what will happen if we do nothing. \nCertainly I do. As our former colleagues, both Senator Tsongas and \nSenator Rudman, correctly noted not long ago, and I quote:\n\n       If we ignore our mounting debt, if we just wish it would go \n     away and do nothing about it, it will grow and grow like a \n     cancer that will eventually overwhelm our economy and our \n     society. The interest we owe on the debt will skyrocket. We \n     will continue our vicious cycle of having to raise taxes, cut \n     spending and borrow more and more to pay interest upon \n     interest. Our productivity growth will remain stagnant; more \n     of our workers will have to settle for low-paying jobs; and \n     our economy will continue its anemic growth. America will \n     decline as a world power.\n\n  Mr. President, this means, in short, that if we refuse to act now, \nfuture generations will have two choices. The Senator from Colorado has \nalluded to this and my other colleagues have, but it bears repeating. \nThe choices will be to drastically cut benefits for people who are \nabout to retire or already retired; or the other choice is to increase \ntaxes on the working Americans to unsustainable levels to support the \nretiree. I do not know of any other choices. Taxes at the required \nlevel would not only be a political albatross; it would break our \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, the sooner we act, the more choices we have, the \neasier it will be over the long run. The longer we wait, the stronger \nthe medicine will have to be. The amendment before the Senate is one \nset of choices. Others might come up with a better approach. If so, \nthey should come forward with their own amendment. But now is the time \nto join this issue. It needs to be joined.\n  We have to know where we are going in the future. We have to make \ntough decisions. Everyone who has studied this challenge realizes that \nwe must reduce the future costs of our entitlement programs. We must do \nso without damaging our elderly population and those about to retire.\n  We do not pretend here today to have the only approach. We are \ncertain, however, that even if we get only five votes--and that is \nentirely possible, I recognize this--the issue must be joined. The \nnational debate on entitlements must begin.\n  For many years now the word in political circles is--and we all know \nit--the word is, do not talk about entitlement restraint during an \nelection year. At least do not do anything about it seriously. Nor can \nyou do anything in the year before an election. Mr. President, every \nyear is either the election year or the year before the election. So \nthat means you never do anything. That means we never do anything but \ntalk in very general terms about entitlements.\n  Politicians of both parties are reluctant to believe the American \npeople will ever understand or agree that these programs must be \nrestrained if our children are to have a future.\n  With this amendment, we attempt to frame the debate and return our \nNation to the same path our forefathers blazed for us.\n  While the Senate cannot amend all the actual statutes needed to \nimplement these changes in a budget resolution, the proposals contained \nin this amendment represent strong but lifesaving medicine.\n\n  We propose the following: First, to adjust the Medicare eligibility \nage to correspond with the Social Security retirement age. This \nadjustment would add 2 months to the Medicare eligibility age each year \nbeginning in the year 2000. Not any real big problem for any \nindividual. By the year 2003, the Medicare eligibility age would mirror \nthat of the Social Security system. Once Medicare and Social Security \nretirement ages are equal, the Medicare eligibility age would mirror \nthe increases in retirement age planned for the Social Security system. \nCurrent Medicare eligibility age is frozen at 65 years.\n  The second major step we would take: to accelerate the date of the \nSocial Security eligibility age by eliminating the 12-year plateau in \nthe law now and increasing the rate of the eligibility age by 2 months \nper year. Eventually, the Social Security and Medicare eligibility \nretirement age would increase to age 67 in 2012 and 70 in the year \n2030. Current law increases the Social Security retirement age to age \n67 in 2026 and does not propose to increase beyond that age. Again, \ncurrent law for Medicare eligibility age is frozen at age 65.\n  Third, and this one would apply now. We would limit the full cost-of-\nliving--COLA's--cost-of-living increases to the first $50,000 in \nFederal retirement benefits. That will affect everybody in this body, \nlikely, that retires. It will affect all of the people who retire with \na very large benefit. For example, if a Federal retiree is eligible to \nreceive $60,000 in Federal retirement next year, our proposal would \nallow this retiree to receive a cost-of-living increase on the first \n$50,000 in retirement but not on the other $10,000.\n  It seems to me that is a modest and a fair step higher-income \nretirees can be expected to take.\n  The fourth thing we would do would be to reduce the Consumer Price \nIndex [CPI] inflation calculation by 0.5 percent each year for years \n1996 through 2003. This is identical to the CPI recommended by the so-\ncalled centrist coalition.\n  The fifth thing we would do is adjust the civil service retirement \nage by allowing full retirement at age 60 with 30 years of service, age \n62 with 25 years of service, age 65 with 5 to 25 years of service. Mr. \nPresident, this compares to current law with civil service retirement \nthat provides full benefits at age 55 for 30 years of service, age 60 \nfor 20 years of service, age 62 with 5 years to 25 years of service. \nThis does not apply to anyone who is currently in or has been in the \ncivil service. It would apply to new people coming in. Again, a very \nfair proposal.\n  The same with the military retirement change which is a modest \nproposal that applies to everyone coming into the military after this \nproposal becomes law, if it does. We would adjust active duty military \nretirement by allowing active duty personnel with 20 years of service \nto retire with full benefits at age 50. Benefits would be discounted if \nthe person begins drawing them before age 50. There would be no change \nin Reserve retirement. Mr. President, this compares to current\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\nlaw for military retirement which provides full retirement benefits \nafter 20 years of service, regardless of age.\n  This means that some people coming into the military can retire when \nthey are 36 years old. Many of them retire when they are 38 or 40 years \nold. That has been based on the old military, where people had to move \nup or out, and you had to have everybody young and vigorous. Today we \nare in an age of technology. It is, fundamentally, time. Military has \nto adjust time in grade and make other adjustments. We do it over a \nlong period of time so the military can make those adjustments without \nreally having any harm on people who are nearing retirement, or with \nthe grandfather provisions on anyone who is in the military today. Both \nthe civil service and military retirement changes would be prospective. \nAgain, would apply only to new civilian and military personnel entering \nFederal service.\n  When you think someone retiring at age 36 will live until they are 76 \nyears old on average, or something in that neighborhood, they will draw \nretirement for 40 years. Now, we just cannot afford that kind of \nretirement system to continue on and on.\n  Seven, we establish a personal investment plan which would allow \nworkers to divert 2 percentage points of their monthly payroll taxes to \ntheir own personnel investment plans. It is our intent to allow the \npersonal investment plan to be enacted in a fashion which does not \nadversely impact Social Security long-term solvency.\n  Mr. President, this is modest medicine. Some may consider it strong \nmedicine. I believe it is required to save the fiscal life of the \nfuture generations of American citizens. I believe it is fair medicine. \nWe offer this amendment in good faith, but we realize we are asking our \ncolleagues to join in programs touching the so-called third rail of \npolitics in America, the rail which provides programs that affect \npeople who are elderly. However, my colleagues should understand that \nthis amendment, with the exception of providing a more accurate \ncalculation of the Consumer Price Index and the COLA increase \nadjustment for retirees receiving more than $50,000 in Federal benefits \nannually, does not impact current retirees or those about to retire. We \ngrandfather and grandmother our constituents who fall into these \ncategories.\n  Our amendment maintains the important commitments between generations \nthat form a foundation of Social Security, Medicare, and other \nprograms. Most importantly, this amendment offers a hope that these \nprograms and benefits will continue to exist in the future, for future \ngenerations.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you think these choices are unpopular, \nwait until you see the choices you will face if we continue to ignore \nthese problems. These problems are not going to go away. They are not \ngoing to go away. They are not going to get any easier. Arithmetic is \nnot going to change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will wrap up in 30 seconds.\n  Pete Peterson has spoken out on this subject and been a stalwart in \ntrying to bring these matters to the attention of the American people. \nHe had a recent article, and I will quote from the Atlantic Monthly \narticle:\n\n       The long great wave of baby boomers retiring could lead to \n     an all-engulfing economic crisis unless we balance the \n     budget, rein in senior entitlements, raise retirement ages \n     and boost individual and pension savings. Yet politics of \n     both parties say that most of the urgently necessary reforms \n     are off the table.\n\n  Mr. President, we have to take these matters and put them on the \ntable. That is what we seek to do here today. I have great faith in the \nAmerican people. I think they have good judgment. With the facts, I \nthink they will make fair judgments. I believe if we present the \nAmerican people with the facts about our future, they will support \nsensible and fair conclusions what we must do today if we are to \npreserve the future for our children and for our grandchildren.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time did the proponents use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have consumed their entire \nhour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Exon, I know we have two different amendments \nwaiting here on the floor. Senator Snowe has an amendment that was \nscheduled for some time ago but it did not get worked in. How much time \nwould you need?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And we have Senator Breaux to be accompanied by Senator \nChafee, and you want about 3 hours.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We want to work until 10 o'clock tonight if we can.\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Simon wants to be recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. If I could have 4 minutes in the process of this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are not finished with the previous amendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. I wanted to speak on that amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So we could get Senator Snowe in, and then the \nbipartisan proposal, and still try to get a couple more amendments \nafter that this evening.\n  Could I ask the Parliamentarian, if we went until 10 o'clock tomorrow \nand all of that time was used because there would be no votes, how much \ntime would we have used of the 50 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises the Chair we are \nup to 41 hours.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So it would be approximately 9 hours left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I thank the Parliamentarian. I \nshould not have asked such a complicated question. He is a \nParliamentarian, not a budgeteer. Maybe Parliamentarians would do \nbetter than budgeteers.\n  Mr. EXON. Or vice versa.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we might suggest to our leadership, because \ntomorrow they want to take off around 10:30 for a while, that we come \nin again in the morning at 9 o'clock, and for an hour and a half take \namendments up and then continue right on through the afternoon with as \nmany amendments as we can get in, and try to get some unanimous consent \non how we take up amendments, and then start tomorrow night around 5 \no'clock or 6 o'clock with a series of amendments and return on \nWednesday with a series that would be all the rest of the amendments.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It was our understanding we would try the so-called \nChafee-Breaux substitute, use 3 hours this evening and have an hour to \nconclude tomorrow, sometime. I do not know if that fits in with your \nplan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It fits in fine.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time is allowed?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Four hours.\n  Mr. EXON. You would use 3 hours tonight and 1 hour tomorrow?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes, equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To the extent the opposition does not use that much \ntime, we could have less time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Or you could always give it to us.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume 2 hours of discussion on a budget like yours \nought to be more than adequate. That is not true. It is a great budget. \nWe could spend a whole evening on it.\n  In any event, let me make sure that everybody understands. We are \ngetting to a situation where, because we have to take off a little bit \ntomorrow, we are probably going to start voting no sooner than tomorrow \nnight.\n  Mr. EXON. From what I can gather, probably in the neighborhood of 6 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. We will have a series of votes. We \nwill strike some agreement on a tiny amount of time for each one for \nSenator Exon and I to explain the amendment. Then we will come back in \non Wednesday, and there will still be a long list of amendments--unless \nwe stay in all night, which I do not think we want to do Tuesday. We \nare not going to have a series of votes of five or six amendments. We \nare going to try to do it this way. If you can help us by not insisting \nthat your amendment be voted on, maybe we can voice vote some. But that \nis the way things look right now.\n  Having said that, I yield myself 5 minutes in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senators Simpson, Kerrey, Nunn, and Robb.\n  First of all, Mr. President, these Senators who offered this sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment deserve the highest accolades. They are \nattempting, in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, to address issues \nthat are profoundly important to the future. What we have the\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nmost difficulty with as legislators, Senators, Representatives and, I \nmust say, even Presidents, is addressing future problems, because it is \nso easy to talk about only current problems and the current status of \nprograms, and, for some reason, it is very difficult, even if the facts \nare known, to address issues that are clearly out there, which are \ngoing to be very damaging to our seniors, or to young people, or to our \neconomy 10, 12, 15, 20 years out.\n  In fact, I think that the distinguishing feature for modern times \nbetween leaders that lead and leaders that propose to do things that do \nnot require any leadership is those who deal with today only are not \nreally leading very much, because today's problems and solving them \nright now is pretty easy. What is difficult is to solve problems that \nhave long-term implications and you must convince yourself and people \nthat you have to start solving them or they will not be solved right.\n  An example is, if one were a mayor of a city where a huge plant \nclosed down and thousands of people were put out of work, you could get \nthe community together quickly and rapidly, and they would join forces \nalmost with one voice of harmony to do something about it. But if you \ntalk about a master plan for highways for a city, it is pretty hard to \nget everybody together, because you do not need the highways tomorrow \nor next week. It is the same for our Federal Government. You have to \nstart fixing entitlement programs today, because the handwriting is on \nthe wall. You can tell the public precisely what is going to happen and \nwhat the options and alternatives are 6, 8, 10, 20 years out.\n  In that context, those who offered this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution had the courage to do that. I wish it was not a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. I wish that we had a budget before us that \nliterally did these things, or a mechanism for having a real vote on \nthose kinds of issues. To some extent, in terms of the Consumer Price \nIndex, the bipartisan proposal that is coming up shortly does address \nthat. But I personally believe that the problem with the resolution \noffered by the four distinguished Senators, led by Senator Simpson, is \nthat they have included in it that we fix the Consumer Price Index \nright now, that we change it to limit it and reduce it by five-tenths \nof 1 percent.\n\n  Frankly, I am not going to take a lot of time tonight. I believe I \ncould convince Senators that we do not know enough about it to do five-\ntenths right now, and that there are real reasons to debate some \nalternatives. I believe I could spend time convincing the Senate that \nthe small group of economists that came up with the conclusion that we \nwere off by anywhere from 1 percent to 2.7 percent are not an official \ncommission of the Congress, or of the President, and that we should not \nbe changing Social Security based upon their reasoning.\n  But I also believe that we made a commitment this year that we were \ngoing to take some very tough medicine with reference to some of the \nentitlement programs--welfare, Medicaid, Medicare, public employees, on \nand on--but the commitment was that we would not touch Social Security \nin this round of budgeting, where we were attempting to reduce the \nbudget deficits and ultimately to be in balance.\n  I believe we should live up to that commitment through this year. I \nbelieve, under whatever guise anyone wants to make it, a five-tenths \nmandatory change in the Consumer Price Index is changing that \ncommitment and is going to impact on Social Security. I believe that \nthe arguments made here today may very well be correct. We may get to \nthat point. But I also believe that when we get to that point, it is \ngoing to have to be a very broad-based, bipartisan effort. I am \nbeginning to think that you cannot do it without a President of the \nUnited States joining. If you are going to change the Consumer Price \nIndex, and even if you want to make the point and even if you are \nright that it should be changed because it is not as accurate as it \nshould be, I do not believe you can do that in the same year that you \nare reforming Medicare, welfare, and Medicaid, without the President of \nthe United States and a bipartisan coalition saying let us change it.\n\n  We have part of that in this institution, for there is a large group \nof bipartisan Senators--not large enough to equal 51, but a large \ngroup--that will be in support of this approach. I have never shirked \nfrom making long-term budget decisions when they are clearly understood \nand when you can see the handwriting on the wall. I have never been \nafraid to tell those who are getting benefits from the Government that \nwe overpromised. I have never been afraid of that. I believe we have \noverpromised in a lot of areas. I believe the reason Senator Simon \nstands on the floor and so eloquently says, ``Let us have a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget,'' is because he, too, \nbelieves--perhaps not in the same areas--we have overpromised, \novercommitted, and we too easily tell the populace we are going to do \nmore for them.\n  I believe the time has come when more and more of us have to stand up \nand say, in the interest of the future, in the interest of a growing \neconomy and a better opportunity for our children and the next \ngeneration, we have to kind of harness in some of those commitments and \nmake some changes, do them prudently. Most of the suggestions in this \nsense of the Senate are prudent and are way out there.\n  I want to close tonight by saying every one of those Senators have \njoined me--all four of them--in the past when we were on the cutting \nedge. We were there ahead of everybody saying let us fix the \nentitlements. My friend from Washington remembers, and Senator Nunn and \nthe Senator from New Mexico. We almost shocked this place by passing a \nmandatory change in the growth of the entitlement programs. It came as \na shock that Senators were finally opening their ears, minds and eyes \nto these problems. That was a few years ago. We are making headway on a \nnumber of those programs. We need to make more. The idea of changing \nthe law in the future so that anybody who is now a beneficiary of one \nof the pension programs does not get affected is a brilliant \nidea. Eventually it will be done, or you will not be able to change \nthose programs. But I repeat: You cannot avoid the reality that 0.5 \npercent on CPI is a change in Social Security. I truly believe we made \na commitment to the contrary. We need more of an authentic commission \nand bipartisan support, along with a President to get it done. Maybe I \nam wrong. But that is how I feel here tonight.\n\n  What that means is that I will argue less on the total budget that \nSenator Chafee has so diligently--along with Senator Breaux--put \ntogether. But I will have a few words about it, and most of it will be \ncomplimentary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course, in opposition, as much as you want.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would first like to yield 4 minutes of the \nopposition time to the Senator from Illinois, who has been patiently \nwaiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I confess I have some mixed feelings on \nthis. While I have been recognized on opposition time, it is possible \nthat I will vote for it because there are things that I think are very \ngood in this.\n  Mr. EXON. You just lost your time.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, let me say that there is one area where I \ndiffer with my colleague from New Mexico, and I have great respect for \nhim. I think he is one of the finest Members of this body, and his \nleadership in trying to move us toward a balanced budget I applaud. But \nI think, outside of the philosophy in the budget where the two sides \ndiffer--here you see fundamental differences. How much should go for \neducation? How much for this? But two basic deficiencies are: First, we \nare having a tax cut when we have not balanced the budget. I just do \nnot think that makes sense at all. Our colleague, Senator Feingold, is \ngoing to have an amendment on that.\n  Second, we have to deal with the CPI. Senator Moynihan has been \nexcellent and eloquent on this. Senator Nunn was great. Pete Peterson \nhad the article in the Atlantic Monthly. Anyone who is serious about \nthis question, take a look at Pete Peterson's article. We simply have \nto balance the budget,\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nand that means we are going to have to address the CPI question sooner \nthan later, and the sooner we do it, the better. It is politically \nawkward. There is no question about that.\n  I have to say, the other side of this, without having studied where \nwe are going, to say that we want to divert 2 percent of the total tax \npayroll to a private investment plan without doing any studying on it \nand without having hearings on it, I think is a questionable procedure. \nI really have qualms about doing something like that. So I have real \nunease about that portion of the amendment, but facing up to the CPI \nproblem is something that we ought to be doing.\n  I yield the time, and I thank my colleague from Nebraska as well as \nmy colleague from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois. I was going \nto ask him a question. I am going to be addressing this matter a little \nbit more in response to the Breaux-Chafee amendment. I think there are \na lot of good things in the Breaux-Chafee amendment, and there are some \ngood things in this amendment, which, as far as I can tell, is similar \nto Breaux-Chafee, but evidently this particular proposition is not \nentirely subscribed to nor is it endorsed by all 11 Democrats and 11 \nRepublicans who make up the people who have been doing the good work \nunder the direction of Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux.\n  Let me say briefly about the CPI that we have to do something about \nGovernment and about Government overspending, but for the life of me I \nhave never been able to figure out how we can justify, with the \nupcoming problems that we obviously have in Social Security and its \nsolvency around the year 2030, changing the CPI without looking at the \nlarger question of making solvent the Social Security trust funds or \nthe Medicare fund.\n\n  I am not for making arbitrary adjustments other than those \nrecommended by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They have told us there \nshould be an adjustment of, I believe, about 0.3 percent to make it \nfair and equitable, the way it was intended. I am for that. But these \nautomatic, arbitrary cuts in CPI, it seems to me, is robbing Peter to \npay Paul, Paul in this case being the budget deficit.\n  I think that is not well thought through. I simply say that rushing \ninto things from time to time just because they sound good might not be \nthe smartest thing to do.\n  If there are any sponsors of the amendment on the floor, I would like \nto pose a question to any of them, or to anyone who can explain this. \nOn page 2 of the amendment before us, line 24, under 6 it states: \n``Workers should be allowed to divert 2 percent of their total payroll \ntaxes into their own personal investment plan.'' Then listen to this: \n``As long as there is no effect on the solvency of the Social Security \nProgram.''\n  I wish someone could explain that to me. I do not know what they are \nsaying. Are they saying that they want to make a fundamental change \nwithout hearings in the U.S. Senate on the historic Social Security \nplan by diverting 2 percent of the total payroll taxes into a personal \nfund so long as there is no effect on the solvency of the Social \nSecurity Program? What does that mean? Does that mean that the 2 \npercent would not be paid or could not be taken out unless it had an \nill effect on the program? Does that mean we would have to have a \nmassive tax increase to make up for the difference of money that is \ncoming out of the Social Security trust fund that is already projected \nto go bust by the year 2030? Does that mean that we would have to have \nsignificant reductions in Social Security payments at that time? Can \nanyone explain to me what that phrase means, we can take 2 percent and \nput it in your own personal fund ``as long as it has no effect on the \nsolvency of the Social Security Program?'' Can anyone explain that?\n  Hearing no one, I can only assume that there is no explanation, or at \nleast the people that know the answer to the question that I posed are \nnot here to answer it. I hope they will take the opportunity to do that \nat another time.\n  I am going to be very brief on this. I first want to commend the \nmotivations of the sponsors of this amendment, most all of whom are \nclose friends and associates of this Senator during the years I have \nbeen in the Senate. We all can agree that we need to look at \nentitlement reform. Chairman Domenici said much the same in remarks he \njust concluded. But I will have to oppose the amendment because it \ncalls for piecemeal changes to the Social Security system that may \ncompromise reform of that program and endanger rather than ensure its \nsolvency.\n\n  In addition, this is, once again, one of those famous sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions. Sometimes these sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \ntake on a life of their own. We all agree that sometime in the not too \ndistant future we are going to have to address this problem. We need to \nlook at the entire pie before we decide to endorse these piecemeal \nchanges.\n  We have, for example, Mr. President, a Social Security advisory \ncouncil due to report, as I understand it, very soon their findings. \nThey are not an official body of the Senate. I am very much interested \nin what they have to recommend. We should also have hearings. We have \nseen neither their report, nor their recommendations. So although the \nproponents are well-intentioned, before we get into an area like these \nwe need to make reasonably sure you know what you are doing before you \ndo it.\n  We all recognize we will have to make substantial changes in Social \nSecurity to ensure the solvency of the program for the baby boom \ngeneration, but we should think those proposals through. We should have \nhearings. We should know for sure, as best we can, what we are doing. \nThe relevant committees should study, have hearings, debate the issue \nand make a recommendation to the floor of the Senate for action. We \nhave not done that in a comprehensive way as far as I know in this \ncase.\n  This amendment also contains two proposals--cutting the cost of \nliving adjustments and moving back the age at which seniors become \neligible for Medicare. These proposals are similar to a very large \nextent under the Chafee-Breaux budget substitute, which, I understand, \nwe are going into as soon as we finish the remarks of the Senator from \nMaine. I will have something more to say on that.\n  I think that basically covers some of my concerns with regard to the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution presently before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the pending sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment be set aside so that Senator Snowe can proceed with \nher amendment in the normal fashion and that she be recognized to do \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4017\n\n (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate that the aggregates and \n   functional levels included in this budget resolution assume that \n  savings in student loans can be achieved without any program change \n     that would increase costs to students and parents or decrease \n                    accessibility to student loans)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4017.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) over the last 60 years, education and advancements in \n     knowledge have accounted for 37% of our nation's economic \n     growth.\n       (2) a college degree significantly increases job stability, \n     resulting in an unemployment rate among college graduates \n     less than half that of those with high school diplomas.\n       (3) a person with a bachelor's degree will average 50-55% \n     more in lifetime earnings than a person with a high school \n     diploma.\n       (4) education is a key to providing alternatives to crime \n     and violence, and is a cost effective strategy for breaking \n     cycles of poverty and moving welfare recipients to work.\n       (5) a highly educated populace is necessary to the \n     effective functioning of democracy and to a growing economy, \n     and the opportunity to gain a college education helps advance \n     the American ideals of progress and social equality.\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\n       (6) a highly educated and flexible work force is an \n     essential component of economic growth and competitiveness.\n       (7) for many families, federal student aid programs make \n     the difference in the ability of students to attend college.\n       (8) in 1994, nearly 6 million postsecondary students \n     received some kind of financial assistance to help them pay \n     for the costs of schooling.\n       (9) since 1988, college costs have risen by 54%, and \n     student borrowing has increased by 219%.\n       (10) in fiscal year 1996, the Balanced Budget Act achieved \n     savings without reducing student loan limits or increasing \n     fees to students or parents.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the aggregates and functional levels included in this \n     budget resolution assume that savings in student loans can be \n     achieved without any program change that would increase costs \n     to students and parents or decrease accessibility to student \n     loans.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank, first of all, the distinguished chairman from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, for his tremendous efforts on this budget resolution. \nAs chairman of the Budget Committee, he has an unusually difficult \nresponsibility to set a fiscal course for this country. Although faced \nwith great challenges, he certainly has assumed those responsibilities \ntime and time again with great skill and has demonstrated true \nleadership. I truly wish to express my appreciation to him for what he \nhas tried to accomplish this year as well as in the past in trying to \nachieve a balanced budget.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution I am proposing addresses the issue \nof education. I think it is critically important that the Senate go on \nrecord to reaffirm its commitment to higher education and to education \nin general. I think it is important that we establish a reaffirmation \nand support for a student loan program. I cannot think of a greater \nissue for the future of this country than to ensure that we provide an \nadequate funding level for higher education and in particular for \nstudent loans.\n  That is one of the greatest issues to the American people at this \npoint. In fact, a recent USA Today/CNN poll indicated for the first \ntime the American people regarded education as the top priority beating \nout all other issues, and regardless of party, regardless of age, \nregardless of income group, it crossed all party lines, all age groups, \nall income groups with respect to this issue. In fact, two-thirds of \nthe American people feel that their children will be no better off than \nthey are, and they see education as the key to survival.\n  That is why I think it is important to recognize just how significant \nstudent loans are. In the last resolution that we adopted and \nultimately in the balanced budget reconciliation package that was \npassed by the Congress, we, indeed, restored almost $3.1 billion in \nfunding to the student loan program. The final analysis was that there \nwas no increase in cost to students or their parents, and that is what \nthis sense-of-the-Senate resolution is all about. It is to restate that \nposition and commitment for this fiscal year and for the process that \nwe are adopting in this budget resolution, and with final acts down the \nroad with respect to budget reconciliation.\n  So my sense-of-the-Senate resolution would build upon the work we did \nlast year. It would restate our commitment to the student loan program, \nand that in fact we would not increase the cost to students or their \nparents or decrease accessibility to student loans. Half of the \nstudents who are enrolled in classes today rely on the student loan \nprogram. As we look at the skills and the occupations that will be \ndeveloping over the rest of this decade and into the next century, only \n27 percent will be in the low-skill occupation categories. So it is \ngoing to require in the future higher education.\n  In fact, today we have 40 percent of those jobs with low skills in \nthat category, but those jobs will now require higher education in the \nfuture. And so it is all the more important that we here in the \nCongress make sure we provide adequate funding for the student loan \nprogram. We have seen that in the past it has contributed to our income \ngrowth as a country. In fact, the Brookings Institution did a study to \nlook at the contributions that higher education funding by the Congress \nhas made, that in fact it has contributed 37 percent to the income \ngrowth in America. For every dollar, based on another study that was \ndone, the Federal Government has contributed to the student loan \nprogram, it has a return of more than $4, so you can see it makes an \nenormous difference to this country as well as to the collective \nability of families and individuals to be able to achieve the American \ndream. And education and higher education has given that opportunity to \nso many who would otherwise not be able to afford a higher education.\n  So it is not just an individual problem that they cannot afford an \neducation. It is not just a State problem. It is a national problem. We \nare seeing the cost of higher education increasing by 6 percent over \nthe last few years, and that cost is only going to continue to grow. So \nwe must as a Nation try to do everything we can to support an \nindividual and their families by providing this access to an affordable \ncollege education.\n  It clearly is in our interest if we are going to remain as a major \ncompetitor in the global economy, particularly as we approach the 21st \ncentury, and we are going to have to emphasize continuing education and \nlifelong learning. The only way we can do that is to provide adequate \nsupport to the student loan program. If there is one issue that I hear \nfrom my constituents time and time again, it is the issue about having \nan affordable education for their children. Never have we had a \ngeneration that has not aspired to present a better world for the next \ngeneration.\n  But now that is a cause of concern to so many people across America, \nbecause they see America as the opportunity to a better life and a \nhigher standard of living than even their parents enjoy. So if they do \nnot have that opportunity, clearly they are going to see the future \nwith pessimism rather than with optimism.\n  I hope we will get broad bipartisan support for this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to ensure that we maintain the commitment, not only \nto Americans all across this country, but to our Nation. I cannot think \nof a greater gift that we could give to the American people and to \ntheir families and to their children and grandchildren than the \nopportunity to better themselves. It is certainly a step forward.\n  John F. Kennedy once said that the task for every generation is to \nbuild a road for the next generation. I cannot think of a more \nimportant road to build than education. So I hope the Senate will \nunanimously adopt this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Snowe \namendment be temporarily set aside and Senator Chafee be recognized to \noffer his amendment, on which we understand there was an agreement we \nwill take 4 hours equally divided, 3 of which will be spent this \nevening and 1 hour tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4018\n\n(Purpose: Setting forth the congressional budget for the United States \n  Government for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and \n                                 2003)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Brown, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Graham, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnston, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. \nKerrey, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Robb, Mr. Simpson, Mr. \nSpecter, and Ms. Snowe, I send to the desk an amendment and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Breaux, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Brown, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Cohen, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Graham, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Jeffords, \n     Mr. Johnston, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Nunn, Mr. Robb, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Specter, and \n     Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 4018.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I know Senator Snowe has further engagements, so if she \nwould like to proceed for a few minutes now before I start, she is very \nfamiliar with the amendment as a cosponsor. I will be glad to yield to \nher such time as she needed.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. I certainly appreciate that \nconsideration. I rise in support of the bipartisan balanced budget that \nwas worked on by more than 20 Members. There were numerous discussions, \nnegotiations and votes in the course of the last few months. I commend \nSenator Chafee and Senator Breaux for their outstanding work and \nleadership in guiding us through those difficult negotiations.\n  This has been an extraordinary effort and undertaking by more than 20 \nMembers on a bipartisan basis to present a balanced budget plan. This \neffort really was derived from the time in which the balanced budget \nnegotiations between the President and the Congress failed and we also \nhad the subsequent Government shutdown. We were committed to the idea \nof creating a balanced budget plan and we feel the only way we can pass \na balanced budget plan is on the basis of bipartisanship.\n  I commend Senator Domenici for his work and the work he has done in \nthe past on the issue of a balanced budget. One of the things we have \nrecognized and have acknowledged is clearly we cannot get a balanced \nbudget plan through this Congress unless we have strong bipartisan \nsupport. So our effort is not to condemn any other alternatives or the \nbudget resolution that has been put forward by Senator Domenici and the \nBudget Committee, because it has been outstanding. Our effort is to \nmove forward in unison, together, so we can pass a balanced budget \nplan. If you look to the future and the escalation of deficits, it is \nstaggering. In the year 2002 we will have a $6.4 trillion debt. In the \nnext 15 years it will double, 5 years thereafter it will double. And in \nthe year 2025, in that year alone we will have a $2 trillion deficit.\n  Given that current spending spurt, we will definitely be requiring \nthe next generation to pay an 82-percent tax rate and they will see a \nreduction of benefits by more than 50 percent. I do not think that is \nthe kind of legacy we want to leave to the next generation.\n  That is why this proposal is so important. We made decisions that \nwere not simple. We did not agree with all the proposals that were \nincorporated in this balanced budget plan. If we all had our druthers, \nwe would probably make different recommendations. But we came together \non a broad, bipartisan basis, to ensure in the final analysis we would \ndevelop a bipartisan balanced budget plan that could get the support of \nthe majority here in the Congress.\n  I hope Members of this Senate will look at this plan very carefully, \nbecause clearly it does split the differences on some very contentious \nissues between the President and this Congress. Although we might not \nlike everything that is in this balanced budget plan, I daresay there \nwould not be any balanced budget plan everybody would agree with when \nyou are talking about reducing Federal spending by more than $700 \nbillion.\n  The deficits we are facing in the future, as I said earlier, are the \nones we have to be concerned about. Everybody can make projections \nabout how the deficit is coming down and the CBO reestimates based on \nprevious efforts has reduced the deficit. The fact of the matter is, \nthe deficits are astronomical in the next century and will only \ncontinue to grow. I do not think that is the kind of legacy we want to \nleave for future generations.\n\n  If you look at the current indicators, we should be concerned. If you \nlook at the Treasury bonds of 30 years, which is a good indication of \nthe economic health in America, that interest rate has gone up by more \nthan 1 percentage point over a 3-month period. We have seen this is the \nweakest recovery in more than 28 years, if you look at the job growth \nrate. So we really have to address the issue of the debt and the \ncurrent deficit because, if we fail to do that, then clearly we are not \ngoing to show that we have the capacity to grow as a nation. We cannot \ngrow with the kind of debt we are compiling for now as well as into the \nfuture.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux \nfor giving me this opportunity to speak first on this amendment. I hope \nwe will get some very good consideration for its passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine. She has been a very loyal and superb contributor to our \ndeliberations which have gone on since last October. We greatly \nappreciate the fine support the Senator from Maine has given us.\n  Mr. President, Senator Breaux and I, along with 19 of our colleagues, \nare offering this alternative, centrist budget resolution in the hopes \nthat we can provide a bridge between the two parties. We strongly \nbelieve, and I will challenge anybody here to say something to the \ncontrary, that this plan we have represents the only hope of obtaining \na balanced budget.\n\n  Why do I say that? Because Democrats will oppose the Republicans' \nproposals. And Republicans already have shot down the Democrats' \nproposal, the administration's proposal, the President's proposal. That \nleaves us in exactly the same place we were in at the end of last year, \nhaving done little to address the real reforms to put this country's \nfiscal house in order.\n  The plan that the centrist coalition, which is the name of the group \nthat Senator Breaux and I have the privilege of leading, is presenting \ntoday, offers a way to reach a consensus on fixing this problem. It \nbalances the budget in 7 years using the Congressional Budget Office \nassumptions. We do not have any gimmicks here. We do not have any \nsunsetting of tax cuts. We do not have any triggering of additional \nincome in the outyears. These represent both reforms in the entitlement \nprograms and a modest tax cut for working families.\n  I invite Senators' attention to be directed to this chart. This is \n1996, where the deficit is something around $150 billion. If we do not \ndo anything in connection with balancing this budget, this is the way \nit will go, up, so that 10 years from now the deficit will be $400 \nbillion. Everybody who spent any time on this problem at all knows it \nkeeps on going upward. Something has to be done about these deficits \nand nothing will occur in reducing them unless we make some changes, \nnot solely in the discretionary programs but in the entitlement \nprograms as well.\n  Where does all this leave us? As I mentioned before, the Republicans \nhave shot down the Democrats' proposal. The budget will pass here but \nwhen it comes to the reconciliation bills, undoubtedly those will have \nno Democratic votes and will have a high probability of being vetoed by \nthe President. So what happens then? Republicans and Democrats both \nwill have offered budgets that they like but which are unacceptable to \nthe other side. Each side will proclaim itself a champion of fiscal \nresponsibility. But at the end of the process, we will have failed to \nsolve this problem. The country will not be on the path toward a \nbalanced budget. Instead, higher and higher deficits will result.\n\n  Now I will turn to the second chart.\n  Here in the red at the bottom, we have what is known as discretionary \nspending. This is spending that deals with all the programs we are \nfamiliar with--the FBI, the State Department, the parks, health care \nand education. All of these are under this so-called discretionary \nspending.\n  As anyone will note looking at this chart, it goes up very, very \nslightly. This is not where the problem is. The problem is in the \ngreen. The green is what is known as the entitlements. The entitlements \nare Medicaid, Medicare, welfare, Social Security, and this is where the \ngreat portion of the budget not only is now, but it increases. You can \nsee that what goes up is not the red of the discretionary programs. \nWhat goes up is the green of the entitlement programs.\n  In the budget that has been presented by the Budget Committee, it is \nprojected that over the next 6 years, $300 billion will be saved from \nthe discretionary accounts. What that means is\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\nthat what you see here, these tiny little increases, will be held flat \nand, indeed, decrease over the next several years, over the next 6 \nyears.\n  The President does something quite similar and did something quite \nsimilar in his budget. He proposed that there be $229 billion of \nsavings in these programs. I think it is safe to say that very, very \nfew Members of this Senate believe that either of those levels of cuts \nin discretionary spending can be achieved. They are just plain not \ngoing to be there, particularly in the last 2 years of the plan.\n  In our plan, which we have submitted, we recognize the near \nimpossibility of those savings being made in discretionary accounts. \nOur proposal saves $179 billion from those programs over the next 6 \nyears--$179 billion, not $300 billion as is proposed by the Budget \nCommittee, not $229 billion as the President proposed, but a far more \nrealistic $179 billion.\n  We recognize that even getting the $179 billion savings represents a \nmonumental effort to extract that money from NIH research or law \nenforcement or environmental protection or whatever it might be.\n  However, we believe that these savings can be achieved. It will be \ndifficult but certainly far easier than doing anything like $300 \nbillion or $229 billion, as the other programs have suggested.\n  Now let us talk a bit about the entitlement programs. As you can see, \nthis is the great bulk of the spending of the Nation. This is where the \nincreases are. These are very politically popular programs. The \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform laid out the \nproblem very succinctly in its August 1994 report.\n  The commission found that by the year 2010, spending on entitlement \nprograms--now listen to this carefully because this is very dramatic. \nThis is not me saying this. This is a bipartisan commission. This is \nwhat they said: The spending on entitlement programs--namely Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare--and interest on the national \ndebt by the year 2010, the spending on that will exceed all of the \nFederal tax revenues that come in. That will leave no money to pay for \nthe FBI, the Park Service, or all the other discretionary programs that \nwe previously mentioned.\n  The centrist plan addresses that problem by making changes that will \nbring the entitlement programs under control. I know that my fellow \nSenators who are part of this will go into these in greater detail, but \nI will briefly touch on them.\n\n  In Medicare, our plan makes substantial reforms to improve the \nprogram's effectiveness and to shore up the trust fund solvency. We \nmaintain the traditional fee-for-service programs, but also pave the \nway for a broad range of managed care plans.\n  We propose that there be affluence testing for the so-called part B \npremium. Others will touch on this, but that is a program that ought to \nbe inaugurated under the Medicare Program and, thus, reduce the drain \non the Federal Treasury, because what the individual does not pay for, \nsome 70 percent, comes directly out of the General Treasury.\n  We address the long-term viability of the Medicare Program by \nconforming Medicare eligibility age to the Social Security Program. \nUnder current law, Social Security retirement age is scheduled to \nincrease from 65 currently to 67 years beginning in the year 2003. This \nincrease will occur gradually, taking 22 years to become fully \neffective. In other words, starting in 2003, it goes up.\n  The plan we have significantly improves the current Medicaid Program. \nThis is something that greatly concerns the States. We give the States \nfar greater flexibility in delivering health care to the aged and to \nthe poor. States will be able to design systems which best suit their \nneeds without having to go through the lengthy waiver process with the \nFederal Government.\n  We repeal the so-called Boren amendment, which will allow States to \nestablish their own reimbursement rates and free them from much of the \nlitigation that now exists.\n  Importantly, the centrist plan maintains a national guarantee of \ncoverage for low-income pregnant women, for children, for the elderly, \nand the disabled. We also have important safeguards to prevent States \nfrom shifting their Medicaid costs to the American taxpayers.\n  We make needed improvements in the welfare system. Our plan is based \nupon the welfare reform bill that passed this Senate 87 to 12 last \nyear. That plan stresses going to work. It requires States to meet a \n50-percent work requirement by the year 2002. We accept many of the \nrecommendations of the National Governors Association, particularly for \ngreater child care funding.\n  Over the next 7 years, the centrist plan also provides tax relief in \nthe shape of $130 billion, much of that going to working families and \nto small businesses. This includes a $250 per child tax credit.\n  We have capital gains relief, incentives for families to save by \nexpanding individual retirement accounts, and a State tax relief for \nfamily-owned businesses.\n  Finally, our plan incorporates a one-half percentage point correction \nin the Consumer Price Index. The Consumer Price Index, as most of us \nknow, is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments to Social \nSecurity and other Federal retirement programs and also for indexing \nthe Tax Code. The problem is the following, Mr. President: The CPI \noverstates inflation. This is not just me saying this, this is not just \nthe members of the 19 or 21 of us, it comes from lengthy testimony that \nwe have had before the Finance Committee in the U.S. Senate.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, believes that \nthe CPI is overstated by 1 percentage point. The Boskin Commission, \nwhich was established by the Senate Finance Committee to study this \nmeasure, has reported that the overstatement ranges from seven-tenths \nof 1 percent up to 2 full percentage points.\n  Our proposal does not go the 2 percentage points, it does not do the \n0.7 percent. We go lower than all of those. We take a modest five-\ntenths of a 1 percent adjustment to the CPI to correct this error. That \nchange will reduce the deficit by $126 billion over the next 7 years \nand will continue to provide tremendous savings in the outyears.\n  Over the past few months I have had the privilege, as many of us have \nhere, to discuss this program with my colleagues and with others. \nUsually there is approval. But then there is the ``but,'' ``But I do \nnot like this.'' ``I would like your proposal, except the cap on direct \nlending is too low'' or ``the tax cuts should be larger'' or ``there \nshouldn't be any tax cuts'' or ``the Medicare savings are too large'' \nor ``the welfare savings are too small.'' Everybody has some small \nreason.\n  These are all important considerations, Mr. President. I understand \nthat many Members have strongly held views on these subjects. But we \nare never going to tackle and succeed in reducing this deficit if we \nlet the perfect be the enemy of the good. If everybody takes a way out \nby saying, ``I like it, but I don't like any tax cuts,'' we do not have \nas many tax cuts as the other programs do. We have more than the \nPresident's, but certainly less than the Budget Committee has.\n  Yes, we do not do everything everybody likes. As the Senator from \nMaine indicated, she and I believe every single member of our group has \nsome better way of doing it than this. But we all stood together and we \nvoted, and we do not all get what we wanted, but we decided to hang \ntogether or otherwise nothing will be achieved.\n  So, Mr. President, the alternative that Senator Breaux and I and the \nothers present today offers the Senate the only opportunity to have a \nbalanced budget for this Nation this year. Is it tough? Certainly it is \ntough. The CPI change is not an easy vote, nor is the vote to shore up \nMedicare and the affluence testing on Medicare, for example. But here \nyou have a group of Democrats and a group of Republicans who have \njoined hands to take these important steps forward and to end the \npartisanship and to move forward in doing something about these \nhorrible deficits that our country faces.\n  So we ask each of you to join our efforts. For the sake of our \nchildren and our grandchildren, and the young people, all the young \npeople of our Nation, we want to pass this country on in better shape \nthan we found it. Here is the way to do it. I want to thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I make an inquiry. It is my understanding, \nunder the agreement, that there are 3 hours equally divided among the \nproponents and the opponents.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield whatever time Senator Breaux uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Louisiana, \nthere are 3 hours this evening, 1 hour tomorrow.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask, if it is possible, if the Chair could notify the \nSenate when the Republican side has used 45 minutes in support of the \namendment and when the Democrats have used 45 minutes also so we can \ndivide the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will make that notification at that \ntime.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 10 minutes. I ask the Chair to notify me \nwhen 10 minutes is used.\n  Mr. President, I first start by commending both the distinguished \nranking member, the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, for the good work that they have done. This is not an easy \ntask. These two gentlemen have worked tirelessly, been here every day. \nThey have worked very, very hard in trying to get this accomplished.\n\n  Having said that, I start my remarks by saying, well, here we are \nagain. Yogi Berra also said it in a different way. He said, ``It's deja \nvu all over again.'' The younger generation sort of uses a different \nterm. They say, ``Been there. Done that.'' But it all really adds up to \nthe same thing, that we have been through this practice once before.\n  Does anybody remember last year? Does anybody remember, despite the \ngood efforts of the chairman, the ranking member, and the \nadministration, that the end result of last year's effort is we had two \npartial Government shutdowns, 13 Government continuing resolutions, \nwhich were sort of like sort of funding the Government but not really \ndoing it? All of that was because we on this side could not agree with \nour colleagues on that side, and neither could agree with the \nadministration down Pennsylvania Avenue on how to run the Government. \nIs it any wonder that the numbers I saw in the Wall Street Journal, I \nthink Friday, said that 68 percent of the American people do not today \ntrust Congress to get the job done that they feel they elected us to \ndo?\n  Yet, despite those numbers and despite the failures, I am very \nconcerned that here we go again. Deja vu all over again. Been there. \nDone that. Because what I see so far in this session of this Congress, \nis going along the same paths that brought us to almost a disastrous \nshutdown of the Government that we could not keep going. Yet we are \nstarting out this time the same way.\n  The Democrats have all voted for the Democratic proposal. The \nRepublicans all voted against it. Ultimately, when the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico presents his budget, I imagine just the \nopposite is going to occur, all the Democrats will vote no, all the \nRepublicans will vote yes. Because our Republican colleagues are in the \nmajority, their budget will pass. But then you have a person down on \nPennsylvania Avenue, the President of the United States, who is going \nto disagree with many of the things in that budget, and therefore when \nthose programs come before him to reach those numbers, he is going to \nveto that.\n  Have we not done that before? Have we not been there before? Is there \nnot a better way to do it? The economist and sometimes humorist Herb \nStein had a great quote I was reading the other day. It said, ``If your \nhorse dies, we suggest you dismount.''\n  What he was trying to say is, ``If it doesn't work, try something \nelse. Get off the dead horse.'' Yet I am very afraid we are going right \ndown that same path we just tried. Everybody in this Chamber, and \nprobably in the other Chamber as well, and everybody in the public \nknows that it is not going to work.\n  We have suggested a better way, a different way, maybe a \nrevolutionary way in the sense that we are asking both sides to \ncooperate and make tough decisions together. There is no more gain to \nbe gained from the blame game. We can no longer say it is the \nRepublicans' fault, and they can no longer say it is the Democrats' \nfault and make any headway in getting the people to believe that we are \nreally serious about getting the job of Government done.\n  Senator Chafee has outlined the fact that there were 22 Senators who \nhave worked since October of 1995, sometimes three and four times a \nweek, in the Chamber here in the Senate and Senator Chafee's office, \nand generally, and worked up an agreement that says, ``Yes, there is a \nbetter way.'' The only way we are going to get it done is by making \nthese tough decisions together.\n\n  Senator Chafee is exactly right. Some will say the tax cut is too \nhigh. Some will say not high enough. Some will say the Medicare cuts \nare too big. Some will say they are not big enough. But we have come \ntogether in what I think is the last best effort to say, yes, we still \ncan govern this country, and, yes, the only way we are going to do it \nis working from the center out.\n  Is there anybody here who still believes we are going to be working \nthe Government, working from the far left or far right, to come \ntogether to make a majority? We have proven that will not work.\n  We have a 7-year balanced budget. Seven years is what most people \nhave talked about for over a year. We decided to stick to those \nnumbers. Here are our numbers. We compared our numbers of 6 years to \nthe President's 6-year proposal and to the Republican 6-year proposal. \nThen we looked at it from a 7-year plan. It makes it a little easier to \nget to the balance. The bottom number is $679 billion over 7 years that \nwe save, that we get to balance in those 7 years.\n  It has not been easy, but it is not impossible. It is not impossible \nif you do it in a bipartisan way. It is impossible if you do it in a \npartisan way. I believe what we are presenting is the last best \nopportunity to get the job done.\n  Senator Chafee has gone over what we do on Medicare. We save $154 \nbillion out of Medicare. Look how our 6-year number compares to the \nPresident's. It is lower than the President's. Ours is only $106 \nbillion in savings. We do it by giving people a lot of different \noptions. Fee for service is one, HMO's, points-of-service plans, \nprovider-sponsored networks. We make some substantive changes.\n  The same thing on Medicaid. We save $62 billion out of Medicaid. We \ndo it by taking a lot of the Governors' proposals and recommendations \nand modifying them. We did not give them everything they wanted, but we \nmade substantive changes in Medicaid, giving a great deal more \nflexibility to the States, which I think most of the States want. I \nthink, quite frankly, it is the right thing to do.\n  In welfare, the earned-income tax credit, $58 billion. The numbers \nare very close to the administration's. The $70 billion from the \nRepublicans, I think, is higher than is justified. We come in somewhere \ndown the middle, which most of our numbers do.\n  We are tough on work, good for kids, provide more child care money \nfor children. But we have a time limit. We end the old program. We make \nsome major changes in welfare, which I think is important. We have a \ntax cut, a $105 billion net tax cut. Some will say it is not big \nenough. Some will say it is too large. We come down the middle.\n  We have about a $25 billion so-called corporate welfare adjustment, \nbut a real net tax cut for families with children, a $250 tax credit, \nand are working to try to get it up to $500 if they invest in an IRA \naccount.\n  We also have estate tax relief for small businesses. We increase the \ntax deduction for health care for self-employed people. Yes, we have a \ncapital gains tax cut in this package both for businesses and \nindividuals.\n  I want to talk about the CPI because some say you cannot do the CPI; \nthat is something that is absolutely impossible. We did it because \neconomists have all said the Consumer Price Index that is used to base \nall the entitlement increases overstates the cost of inflation in this \ncountry by anywhere from between 0.7 and up to 2 percent. We take 0.5 \npercent and say we will have an adjustment in the Consumer Price Index \nover what the Bureau of Labor Statistics is talking about of 0.5 \npercent. That saves us, over a 7-year period, $126 billion.\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n  We are saying to the American public who are beneficiaries of \nentitlement programs, we will try and save those programs. We say to \nSocial Security recipients, just like they told us, we will extend the \nyear of solvency in the Social Security Program from the year 2030 to \nthe year 2036. We are giving it at least 6 extra years, just based on \nour Consumer Price Index.\n  In addition to that, we cut the long-term imbalance of Social \nSecurity funds, the imbalance of the trust fund by one-third over the \nnext 75 years and extend the life of Social Security by an additional 6 \nyears by making this adjustment. I want to show the chart. Some say you \ncannot do that. The only thing we are saying to the people in this \ncountry who get automatic adjustments in their cost of living is that \nwe will ask that adjustment more accurately reflect the real cost of \ninflation to you. That is not asking from people too much. We are still \nsaying, you will get an increase. We are simply saying, your increase \nwill be more accurately reflective of the cost of living.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. GORTON). The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BREAUX. What we are saying is, people who get Social Security \nretirement, railroad retirement, all the other benefit programs, when \nyou look at the recommendations from the special commission which has \ngiven us an interim report, that report says very clearly that the \nConsumer Price Index overstates the cost of inflation and adjustments \nin these entitlement programs. They say, ``Changes in the CPI will \noverstate changes in the true cost of living for the next few years.''\n  The commission's interim best estimate of the size of upward bias \nlooking forward is 1 percent per year. The range of plausible values is \n0.7 of 1 percent to 2 percent. We picked a number in between, 0.5, \nactually lower than their estimated range, a 0.5 percent adjustment.\n  I was saying what it would mean with an adjustment, using a CPI \nadjustment between 1996 and 1997. You are talking a difference of only \n$3 per month, we say to Social Security retirees, what they would get \nless under a CPI-adjusted Social Security increase. I think to say to \npeople on retirement programs that if you are going to help everybody \nsolve this problem, I think you should be very pleased to receive an \nincrease that more accurately reflects what the real cost of living is, \nI do not think there is a senior in this country that says, ``I want to \nget more than it costs to keep up with inflation.'' I do not hear a \nsenior citizen saying, ``I want to get more than I am entitled to.'' \nThey say, ``I want to make sure I get what I am entitled to, our \ncontract with our Government, but I do not want to get more than I am \nentitled to.''\n  This small adjustment guarantees the solvency of the program for an \nadditional 6 years. It saves us $126 billion over 7 years and allows us \nto get to a balanced budget in 7 years, I think with the least amount \nof difficulty and trouble.\n  In conclusion, the only way we will get it done is if we work \ntogether. We will never get it done if we continue to try the same path \nwe have tried in the past. We suggest there is a better way. We suggest \nan amendment offered by Senator Chafee and myself on behalf of some 20-\nodd other Members of the Senate should be the way to go.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an actuarial statement \nregarding the CPI be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 16, 1996.\n     From: Harry C. Ballantyne.\n     Subject: Long-Range Effects of Reducing Automatic Benefit \n         Increases--Information.\n       In response to a request from Cynthia Rice in Senator \n     Breaux's Office, we have prepared estimates of the long-range \n     effects, on the OASDI Trust Funds, of reducing future \n     automatic benefit increases by 0.5 percent, beginning with \n     the increase effective for December 1996.

Ballantyne,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the so-called \ncentrist coalition's substitute for the fiscal year 1997 budget \nresolution. I congratulate Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux for their \nleadership in bringing this substitute before the Senate.\n  As Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux have indicated, this bipartisan \nsubstitute is offered by 22 Senators--11 Republicans and 11 Democrats. \nThe substitute is the result of many months of bipartisan work. I \nbelieve it is a sustainable package which if enacted would bring the \nFederal budget into balance in 7 years.\n  We offer this Chafee-Breaux substitute in the spirit of compromise. \nEach one of its sponsors can point to elements which he or she \ndisagrees with. However, on the whole, we believe it to be more \nrealistic than the proposals offered by the White House or the Senate \nBudget Committee. For instance on entitlement reform, the substitute \nreduces the expected growth rates for Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and \nother mandatory programs more than the proposal President Clinton \noffered in January, but less than reductions offered by the Senate \nRepublicans in the underlying budget resolution. The same is true with \nrespect to the proposed tax cuts included in the substitute.\n  For the record, I question the necessity and the wisdom of a tax cut \nat this time. For Congress to propose to enact a tax cut which runs \nconcurrent with or actually precedes the spending reductions set forth \nin the budget resolution is akin to the board of trustees for a \nbankrupt company declaring a dividend before it begins the necessary \nsteps to bring the company's operations into balance.\n  However, I realize that compromise is an essential part of this \nprocess and I support the Chafee-Breaux substitute's tax provisions. \nThese provisions call for a net tax reduction of $105 billion over 7 \nyears--which is roughly two-thirds the size of the proposed cuts in the \nSenate budget resolution, but larger than those cuts proposed by the \nPresident.\n  The areas where the Chafee-Breaux substitute diverges dramatically \nfrom either the Budget Committee proposal or the White House's proposal \nare: First, the change in the calculation of the consumer price index \n[CPI]; and second, the proposed reductions in discretionary spending.\n  With respect to the CPI calculation, the Chafee-Breaux substitute \ncalls for a reduction of .5 percent per year every year for 7 years. \nSuch a change would produce $126 billion in savings over 7 years. \nAlmost every economist agrees that our current method of calculating \nCPI overstates inflation due to substitution bias, the difficulty in \nmeasuring changes in quality, and other factors. The Boskin Commission, \nheaded up by Michael Boskin, the chief economic advisor to President \nBush, believed that the CPI should be reduced from between .7 percent \nto 2.0 percent annually. I realize this component of the substitute \nwill not be popular with many of our colleagues and our constituents, \nbut such a step is necessary not only to reach our short-term goal of \nbalancing the budget in seven years but in order to sustain a balanced \nbudget in the longer term when the ``baby boom'' generation begins to \nretire.\n  The budget resolution before the Senate proposes to reduce \ndiscretionary spending by over $296 billion over 6 years. I do not \nbelieve such reductions are realistic or sustainable. This figures \namount to a hard freeze plus about $30 billion in additional \ndiscretionary spending cuts. If enacted, I foresee future Congresses \nfaced with the choice of devastating popular domestic programs like \nHead Start or the space station, or foregoing the defense modernization \nneeded to make sure our military maintains its technological edge in \nthe next century.\n  The Chafee-Breaux substitute calls a reduction of $268 billion in \ndiscretionary spending over 7 years. These are significant, but \nsustainable savings.\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\n  I would like to add a final note. If we do enact this proposal and \nget the budget balanced in 7 years, we still have a long way to go. \nThis Congress and this country will have to look at a 20- to 30-year \nfiscal picture. We will have to set in motion today reforms that can be \nimplemented very gradually and very slowly. We have to reform Social \nSecurity. We have to reform Medicare. We can do both gradually so that \nretired people or people about to retire are not harmed, but we must \naddress these issues now for the generations that will follow us.\n  Mr. President, the Chafee-Breaux proposal is the last train in the \ncongressional station if we are going to enact a balanced budget \nproposal this session. The proposal shows that a bipartisan agreement \non balancing the budget is achievable--we only need the willpower to \nachieve it. An agreement is within reach. If we fail to act, it will \nonly make future efforts more difficult.\n  Our forefathers worked and toiled to provide us with our current \nprosperity. If we fail to do the same, by continuing to ignore the \ndeficit problem, our legacy to our children and grandchildren will be a \nhigher debt and a lower standard of living. But if we succeed, once we \nget beyond the difficulties of adjusting our spending down to what we \ncan actually afford, we will start to reap the benefits that flow from \na balanced budget: higher investment, higher productivity, more \neconomic growth, and higher standards of living.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, in my short 3-year tenure in this body, I have never \nseen a better experience in working across the aisle than the effort \nthat the centrist coalition has gone through since last October. I can \nonly give my strongest accolades to Senator Chafee and to Senator \nBreaux, who called us together in meeting after meeting and listened \npatiently to what each one of us had to say. We discussed it. We voted. \nWe went back and forth, figures and calculations were done and redone \nwhen they had to be, and decisions were made.\n  I think everyone in this coalition, all 22 of us, 11 Republicans, 11 \nDemocrats, accepts a basic premise that we have to address the budget \ndeficit. I want to give you three basic facts on which this premise is \nbased. In 1963, less than 30 percent of all Federal spending paid for \ninterest and entitlements; more than 70 percent of our spending paid \nfor discretionary programs--defense, education, training, R, roads, \nand bridges. Today, it is reversed. Two-thirds of spending addresses \nentitlements, not on budget, and interest, about which we can do \nnothing. Only one-third goes for discretionary programs.\n  By 2003, more than 70 percent of all spending will be directed at \ninterest and entitlements, blocking our ability to make needed \ninvestments in education, research, and strengthen the economy. I will \nnever forget when friend and colleague Senator Conrad, in one of our \nmeetings, said in a very emotional and very forthright way, ``You know, \nthe choices are twofold: Either we agree to act now or we agree to \nreduce all benefits across the board by one-third and set tax rates at \n80 percent or more for our children.'' In fact, that is the choice. \nEither do one of those options or do something that crosses party \nlines.\n  I, like Senator Chafee, like Senator Breaux, like the others amongst \nus, truly believes that unless we have something that is bipartisan and \ncrosses the aisle, we will not have the votes to affect a 7-year \nbalanced budget. If we do nothing, by the year 2012 entitlements and \ninterest payments will grow so rapidly that they will consume all tax \nrevenues. By 2000, interest payments will increase by more than 50 \npercent, pass national defense in size, and trail only Social Security \nas the second-largest Federal expenditure.\n  So we have to move. The bottom line of this budget is that it is \nbalanced over 7 years after thorough and comprehensive review of all \nareas of spending and continues the strict spending discipline for \ndiscretionary spending.\n  As you have heard, the centrist plan includes approximately $154 \nbillion in Medicare savings, $62 billion in Medicaid savings, $50 \nbillion in welfare savings, and more than $50 billion from a diverse \nrange of other programs, including housing, energy, natural resources, \ncivil service retirement, veterans, debt collections and \ntelecommunications. Additionally, the plan adopts $25 billion in \nsavings by closing tax loopholes.\n\n  Let me quickly walk through some of the elements of the plan. For \nMedicare, the plan adopts about $154 billion in savings over the next 7 \nyears. The centrist plan rejects the steep cuts in Medicare to pay for \ntax breaks, but generates the needed savings through sound and \npragmatic steps. It reduces the rate of increases for payments to \nphysicians, hospitals, and nursing homes, outpatient services, durable \nmedical equipment, and other payments. It establishes means testing on \npart B premiums for the wealthy. It freezes certain payments for home \nhealth agencies, such as visiting nurses in the home, while a system of \nfixed, preset payments is implemented. It strengthens enforcement \nagainst fraud and abuse. If the savings are applied to the trust fund, \nthe funds solvency is extended just like the other budget plans.\n  I would also like to address Medicaid. The centrist plan preserves \nMedicaid as the insurer for the disabled, the elderly in nursing homes, \nand low-income Americans, who have no other coverage. It reduces \ntaxpayer costs by changing to fixed allocations and fixed growth rates. \nIt facilitates expansion of managed care, a cost savings trend that \nCalifornia has led. However, we offer a balanced plan. It rejects the \nidea of permitting each Governor to define disabled, continues the \ncurrent State partnership matching rates and it retains Federal nursing \nhome standards.\n  We also enact substantial welfare reform. The centrist plan creates a \nwelfare block grant, and requires States to continue to pay their fair \nshare. It creates a contingency fund, provides more child care funding \nthan the other plans, with about $14.7 billion, requires 100 percent \nmaintenance of effort and a State matching fund. It has 50 percent work \nstandard by the year 2006, but maintains the Nation's safety net. It \nallows a waiver for work for single parents with children who cannot \nwork or have no access to child care. It has a 20-hour work option for \nStates, and a State would have the option to deny benefits to \nadditional children born while on welfare. It clamps down on SSI, \ndenying benefits for addicts or alcoholics.\n  The CPI, which Senator Breaux has just addressed, is an important \nelement of the plan. Senator Breaux raises an important point that we \nshould all keep in mind. This centrist plan will continue to provide \nthat someone receiving a COLA for a Federal benefit will, in fact, \nreceive a full, accurate COLA. They will be able to count on it.\n  I want to touch on the tax plan. Some say we should adopt no tax plan \nat all and that has been a point of contention between the two parties. \nWe take what I believe is a modest, fair tax plan--providing a net $105 \nbillion in tax cuts and a gross $130 billion of tax cuts.\n  This is how the plan works out: About $67 billion of the tax cut is \nour child tax credit. We all agreed to a plan put forward by Senator \nLieberman of Connecticut creating a KidSave IRA, where there is a $250 \nchild tax credit, which increases to $500 if that money is put into an \nIRA. The plan seeks to provide about $11 billion for IRA increases and \n$1 billion is for educational assistance, offering a deduction for \nhigher education expenses, interest on student loans, and penalty-free \nIRA withdrawals for education. Additionally, our centrist plan raises \nthe self-employed deduction for health expenses from 30 to 50 percent.\n  I would also like to address capital gains tax reform. I am one \nDemocrat that ran for this office on capital gains reductions. Why? \nBecause it makes sense. It helps the economy create jobs. It spurs \ninvestment. Our plan includes capital gains reform, dropping the \ncorporate capital gains rate, from 34 to 31 percent, and seeks to cut \nindividual capital gains, maximum bracket, from 28 to 19 percent. Our \nplan also provides estate tax reform to assist family-owned businesses \nand extends important, expired tax provisions like the R tax credit \nand the orphan drug\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\ntax credit and others on a revenue-neutral basis.\n\n  This plan may not have everything. In fact, it includes some things I \ndo not support. However, I am never going to get everything I want. Nor \nis anyone else in this body. So maybe by acknowledging that is sort of \nthe first point of a budget anonymous program, somewhat like Alcoholics \nAnonymous. The only way to stop is to agree to something that, in the \nmain, meets our basic contention and goals.\n  This plan will help strengthen the economy. It will promote economic \ngrowth. It is fair, it is just, it is balanced, and it affects everyone \nevenly, right across the board. I believe the other House can support \nit, and I believe that, if the President takes a good look at it, he \ncan support it, too. If we enact this plan, this Congress will have \ndelivered on its commitment to enact a balanced budget within the 7-\nyear period.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I congratulate all the speakers \nthat have spoken so far this evening.\n  Now I will yield such time as the Senator from Utah would like. Would \nhe suggest 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you. Mr. President, I want to join in paying \ntribute to Senators Chafee, Breaux, and Domenici. Even though Senator \nDomenici is not part of our group, he has given us at least a friendly \nhandshake as we have gone about this and made it clear that he is not \nopposed to our effort. I certify my support for these Members of the \nSenate because, as I sit here and listen to them, I realize that unlike \nsome of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, indeed, unlike \nmyself on occasion, they have approached this problem with a desire to \nlegislate the solution rather than craft a political position. And I \nthink that is in the highest tradition of this body. I am proud to be \nassociated with them, and I am proud of them.\n  There are those who have tried to craft a political position out of \nthe budget on both sides of the extreme. And there are those, frankly, \nwho have tried to craft a political position in the middle and posture \nas the reasonable ones in the middle. The problem with those who have \ntried that is that they have never reached across the partisan aisle \nand tried to bring in people who really disagree with them in an effort \nto legislate. My father used to say, ``We legislate at the highest \nlevel at which we can obtain a majority.'' I find that to be a good \nsummary of the process around here. I congratulate, again, these \nSenators for their effort to try to obtain a majority and try to \nlegislate the problem.\n  Now, when I am out in my home State and I tell people about this \ngroup and then say to them that I am part of it, I receive the highest \napplause and the highest praise of any position that I take. The people \nof my State, who are viewed generally in the Nation as being fairly \nright-wing--Utah is viewed as being the most reliable Republican State \nin the Nation--are as excited about the idea of a bipartisan solution \nto this problem as they are about any Republican position that I \npresent to them as I am there in town meetings and in other \nconversations.\n  Now, this is an enormously complicated problem. We have heard some of \nthe details from the Senator from California, and we have heard some of \nthe statistics and details from the Senator from Rhode Island. We will \nhear more as this goes on.\n  Whenever you are faced with a problem as complicated as this one--I \nknow of none more complicated--the one thing you want to be absolutely \nsure you are working with is correct numbers. You cannot run the risk \nof making these gigantic decisions on the basis of numbers that are \nwrong because, if you do, you are going to get a result that is wrong \nsure as you are sitting here.\n  If I may go back to my private life experience and give you an \nexample that comes to mind as I deal with this, I was once a consultant \nto a business that was having some problems. One of their problems was \nthat they were shifting from a manual accounting system over to a \ncomputer accounting system. That dates me, I suppose. This obviously \ntook place in the last decade when computers were new. As a result of \ntheir shifting from a manual accounting system to a computer-driven \nsystem, they flew for about 6 months without any accurate numbers. They \ndid not really know what their sales were. They did not really know \nwhat their costs were. Most important, in retrospect, they did not know \nthat they had by a very small amount missed the percentage of their \nsales that should be ascribed to inventory costs. Their inventory costs \nwere off just a small percentage all the way through. When they finally \nfinished the transfer from the manual accounting to the computer \naccounting, now they were 6 months behind and they had to bring these \nother statements up to speed.\n  Finally, they got to the end of the year and they did what every \nbusiness does at the end of the year. They took physical inventory. \nThey were flying along knowing that they were losing a little bit of \nmoney, and they took physical inventory where they were forced to \nadjust to reality, and, instead of a narrow loss, they had a $3 million \nloss. For a company that size, that was sufficient to cause the bank to \ncall the loan, the board to fire the chief executive officer, and a \nseries of assets to be sold to try to make up the difference. If they \nhad only known while they were flying in that mission that they had \nmade this small adjustment that kept chipping away at their profits at \nevery single sale, a few cents here, a few cents there, a dollar or two \nhere, a dollar or two there, and as the sales washed through for a \nwhole year, a $3 million inventory adjustment at the end of the year.\n  We are doing the same thing, Mr. President. The CPI is wrong. It is \nwrong on the high side, and everybody knows it. But we are flying just \nas blind as that business did, and we are letting that adjustment chip \naway every day in every Social Security check, in every Medicare \npayment, and in every wage adjustment that little error gets chipped \naway again and again and again. When the bill finally comes, not in the \nform of the physical inventory at the end of the year but in the form \nof an enormous national debt and national deficit, we will not be able \nto solve it by firing the Chief Executive. We renew his contract every \n4 years anyway, and we only give him two shots at the job by the \nConstitution.\n  We will not be able to solve it by selling off a few assets. We will \nnot be able to solve it by renegotiating our line of credit at the \nbank.\n  The most important thing in this centrist coalition proposal is the \ncourage to face the facts that the CPI is wrong. I have heard on the \nfloor we have not had hearings on this. Yes, we have. The Finance \nCommittee has had enough hearings. The leading and senior members of \nthe Finance Committee take the floor and say to us that this is \nsomething we must do. We are being told it is going to hurt people too \nmuch. Is it going to hurt people as much as having the whole program go \nbankrupt? Is it going to hurt people too much to make that little \nadjustment and thereby avoid the end of the year inventory adjustment \nthat hits you like an atomic bomb? No; Mr. President, the most \nimportant thing you have to do when you are faced with the problem of \nthis complexity is to have good numbers. The most important people in \nthe world, dry and dull as they may be in this kind of a circumstance, \nare the cost accountants, the ones who give you the sound numbers that \nyou are dealing with. Once they have given you the numbers, fine, get \nthem out of the room and let the policymakers make the decisions, but \nlet them make the decisions on sound numbers.\n\n  So there are many things in this proposal that I disagree with. There \nare many things in this proposal that I really do not like, and I would \nhave gone a lot farther than the centrist coalition would have gone in \na number of areas. There were times when I was willing to walk out of \nthe room and say, ``No. You have crafted something I can't possibly \nsupport.''\n  The thing that brings me back and the thing that brings me to the \nfloor tonight is the courage of this group to move in the direction of \nright numbers, to move in the direction of properly monitoring what is \nreally happening in the economy and thereby avoiding that\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\ninevitable day of reckoning that comes when you let the wrong numbers \nchip away at you day after day, month after month, and year after year.\n  In the chart that the Senator from Rhode Island gave us, we see the \nresult of that constant chipping away, and we see the projection of \nwhere it will be.\n  Mr. President, this is a courageous act of proper legislation, and I \nam happy to be a part of the effort.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I commend the statement of the Senator, and I yield 10 \nminutes to Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I, \ntoo, want to join our group in thanking Senator Chafee and Senator \nBreaux for an outstanding effort to have the two sides, Republicans and \nDemocrats, join together in an attempt to bring our fiscal house into \norder.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Senate now 9 years. As I look back, \nI have never been more proud to be part of a group than I am proud to \nbe part of this one because I think for 5 months--maybe 6 months now--\nwe have worked together in good faith to do something important for our \ncountry.\n  I just say that this is the way I think the Senate ought to operate. \nThere were no raised voices. There were no press conferences. There was \nno political posturing. There were honest disagreements. There were \nserious debates. At the end of the day, we resolved matters, we reached \nagreement, we bridged differences, and we came to a conclusion.\n  That conclusion is a plan that is before us now; a 7-year plan to \nbring unified balance to our budget. I stress unified balance to our \nbudget and doing it in a way that is, I believe, a fair and responsible \ncompromise between two sides that have some distances on many issues.\n  Mr. President, again I want to salute Senator Chafee and Senator \nBreaux. They provided outstanding leadership in keeping this group \ntogether.\n  But I also wanted to commend publicly each and every member of this \ngroup because they were willing to put partisan differences aside in \norder to accomplish a larger result.\n  I commend the statement that was earlier made by my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein. I thought it was an outstanding \nstatement of why this group hung together and why this group felt it \nwas important to reach a result. I thank her not only for her \noutstanding statement here on the floor this evening but for the \nexcellent work that she did in participating in the efforts of this 22-\nmember group.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein.\n  I also want to thank the Senator in the chair, Senator Bennett, who I \nhave come to appreciate greatly for the kind of background that he has \nas evidenced by the story he told tonight, an excellent story that \napplies to what was happening in the real world in business to what is \nhappening to our country, because there is no question that we are \nheaded for a cliff.\n  Our colleague from Colorado this afternoon described it well. We are \nheaded for a cliff in this country. There is absolutely no question \nabout it. There is nobody in this Chamber who can stand up and dispute \nthe fact that we are headed for a circumstance in which future \ngenerations either face a lifetime net tax rate of over 80 percent or a \none-third cut in benefits.\n  Maybe we are off by a couple of percentage points here or there. \nMaybe the entitlements commission, maybe the generational accounting \neffort are off by a few percentage points, but the unmistakable \nconclusion that any rational person can arrive at is that we are on a \ncourse that cannot be sustained. It must be changed. And the sooner we \ndo it, the better off we are.\n  I see my colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, on the floor. He \nmade a significant contribution to this group as well, willing to \ndebate and discuss these differences and to resolve them in a way that \ndid not satisfy either side completely. There is no question the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Bennett, would have preferred more Medicare \nreform--very clear to this Senator. The Senator from Utah was ready to \ngo further in cuts in many of these categories. I think that is true of \nthe Senator from Washington as well.\n  On the other hand, I would have preferred no tax cut until we balance \nthe budget--my own preference. But that was not the consensus of the \ngroup. Those in this group believed that achieving a result was more \nimportant than any one of us getting exactly what we wanted. That is \nexactly the example that needs to be set for this body and for the \nother one, because if we are going to act like grownups, we are not \ngoing to get precisely what we want. But for the good of the country, \nwe desperately need to achieve the result of moving toward balance and \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n  I feel very, very strongly about the need for us to come together to \nachieve this result. We all know where we are headed. We are headed for \na calamity. I think very often about what I am going to say to my \ndaughter, who is 18 years old, 10 years from now, 20 years from now \nwhen she asks me: ``Dad, what were you doing there in the Senate? You \nwere on the Budget Committee. You were on the Finance Committee. Our \ncountry is in deep trouble now and all of this must have been known \nwhen you were there. Why didn't you act?''\n  Mr. President, all of us are going to face those questions at some \ntime in the future if we continue to fail to act, because it is \nabundantly clear where we are headed.\n  I am going to speak just momentarily on the question of the CPI. I \nknow there are people who feel very strongly in opposition to that \nproposal. I feel very strongly in support of it because I think it is \nclear that measures like a technical correction in the CPI are \nabsolutely essential if we are going to get our fiscal house in order. \nIf we are going to preserve Social Security, if we are going to \npreserve an economic system in this country that is strong and \ncompetitive, we have no choice.\n  We are headed for a circumstance in which Social Security is \nexhausted of funds in the year 2030. The first year in which \nexpenditures exceed total income will be 2020. The first year in which \nexpenditures exceed tax income will come in 2013. These are not my \nnumbers. These are not the numbers of the centrist coalition. These are \nthe numbers of Harry Ballantyne, the chief actuary for the Social \nSecurity system. He says we are headed for the cliff.\n  It was said earlier in the Chamber that there have been no hearings \non the question of CPI. That is not the case. We have had three \nhearings in the Senate Finance Committee--March 13 of 1995, April 6, \nand June 6 of 1995--three hearings on this question. And it is very \ninteresting to recount what happened in those hearings. We had witness \nafter witness who told us the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, is \noverstating the cost of living.\n  Let me just put in perspective what that means. A 1 percent \noverstatement, a mistake by 1 percent, will cost this country \n$600 billion over 10 years--not $600 million, $600 billion. That is a \nmistake, a mistake that is going to cost this country $600 billion. Can \nwe not correct a mistake in this Chamber?\n\n  Now, let us look at the evidence. What did the experts who came and \ntestified before the Senate Finance Committee tell us? And I might add, \na bipartisan group--a bipartisan group.\n  Chairman Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, came in in the first \nhearing, and he said the overstatement is from 0.5 to 1.5; Dr. Robert \nGordon, Northwestern University, Department of Economics, minimum \noverstatement, 1.7 percent; Director June O'Neill of the Congressional \nBudget Office, 0.2 to 0.8. At the April 6 hearing, Dale Jorgenson, \nHarvard University, chairman of economics, overstatement of the CPI, 1 \npercent; Dr. Erwin Diewert, University of British Columbia, Department \nof Economics, acknowledged expert in the field, overstatement, 1.3 to \n1.7 percent; Dr. Ariel Pakes, Yale University, Department of Economics, \noverstatement of 0.8 percent. June 6 hearing, Dr. Michael Boskin, \nsenior fellow, Hoover Institute, Stanford University, overstatement of \nthe CPI, of the cost of living, at least 1 percentage point, maybe 2; \nDr. Ellen Dulberger, director, strategy and economic analysis for IBM, \nCPI overstatement is greater than others have stated and likely to \ngrow; Dr. Zvi Griliches, Harvard University, Department of Economics, \noverstatement is 0.4 to 1.6 percent.\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\n  I would ask my colleague for one additional minute.\n  Mr. BREAUX. One additional minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Two other witnesses on that day offered no estimate as to \nthe overstatement.\n  The evidence is clear and abundant. The Consumer Price Index \noverstates the cost of living. If that is true, and I believe it is, \nthen we know that if it is a 1 percent overstatement, it is costing \nthis country $600 billion over the next 10 years.\n  We are on a course now we know cannot be sustained. Why would we not \ncorrect a mistake if we know it is occurring?\n  It was earlier stated that correcting the CPI will not improve the \nsolvency of the Social Security trust fund. That is not accurate. We \nhave a memo from Mr. Ballantyne, the chief actuary, in which he says: \nThe actuarial balance over the next 75 years as a percentage of taxable \nearnings is out of balance by a negative 2.17 percent. Just this \nchange, a modest correction of one-half of 1 percent, will improve that \nactuarial balance by a factor of one-third. It does one-third of what \nwe need to do if we are to secure the future solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and again commend my colleagues for \nwhat I think has been an outstanding effort.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for a \nvery powerful statement. He has always made outstanding contributions \nand continued those contributions today.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the function of the debate in this U.S. \nSenate is only on rare occasions designed to persuade other Members of \nthe U.S. Senate to adopt a particular position. This is one of those \noccasions. If we reflect on previous budgets, we understand that if the \nmajority party in Congress is the party opposite the President, the \noperative phrase is, ``The President's budget is dead on arrival.'' If \nthe majority party is the same as that of the President, all \nreservations about a budget are withheld and that party will defend \neven those elements in a budget it knows to be fraudulent or unsound.\n  In other words, most of the time we use our opportunities here, not \nto talk to our colleagues, but to talk either to the people of the \nUnited States as a whole or in an attempt to come up with some blithe \nphrase that will appear in television or in the morning newspaper. But \nagain, Mr. President, this is not such an occasion. It is an occasion \non which we are genuinely addressing ourselves to many of our \ncolleagues on a vitally important issue on which they have not entirely \nmade up their minds.\n  Why? Because for years, perhaps for decades, we have not had a sound \nand thorough and broadly supported bipartisan approach to the major \nfiscal and budgetary issues that are facing this country. So many of \nthe colleagues beyond the 11 of us on each side who have prepared this \nhave talked to us privately and said, ``I really sort of like what you \nare doing. Gosh, I don't know whether I can afford to vote for it if it \ndoesn't have any chance for success, but I think you are moving in the \nright direction.'' We are here to persuade them that not only are we \nmoving in the right direction, but the time has come for them to move \nin that direction with us.\n  First, of course, because this is the first truly bipartisan \nopportunity we have had to pass something that will be accepted by the \ncountry as a whole and, we hope, ultimately by the President of the \nUnited States. One of the reasons that it should be so is that this is \nsubstantively the soundest of all the proposals with which we have been \npresented. It has the best and most effective and broadest based \nreforms of entitlement programs, some of which do not even appear in \nthe statistics for these 6 years because their impact will primarily or \nsolely be felt after the 6 years are up, but will have a tremendous \npositive impact toward solving challenges that we know will exist at \nthat particular period of time: The age of Medicare eligibility, the \nConsumer Price Index, means testing the premiums for Medicare part B, a \npretty thorough welfare reform.\n  Second, this is the most realistic budget because it deals most \nfairly and realistically with domestic discretionary spending. The \nPresident's budget allows it to go up in the immediate future and then \nit drops off the cliff in the end. We know that will not happen. The \nRepublican budget does much less than that, but nonetheless the further \nwe get down the road, the more unrealistic its figures for domestic \ndiscretionary spending are. What is that? Spending on education, on law \nenforcement, on medical research, on all forms of transportation, on \nthe environment, on national parks, on myriad responsibilities which \nhave been increasingly squeezed.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico knows very well, dozens of the \namendments that he has had to deal with in the last 2 or 3 days have \nsaid, ``hold harmless--'' you fill in the blank, whatever the \nindividual sponsor's pet project is, hold that harmless. We will \nprobably vote for a bunch of those, but we know they are utterly \nunrealistic. If we follow the road we are on today, there will not be \nany money left for them. None of them, not even the defense of the \nUnited States of America, will be held harmless.\n\n  This is a good budget because it does provide for tax reductions for \nAmericans who feel they are overtaxed. It spreads them out more \nmodestly than do some other budget proposals, but nonetheless in all of \nthe areas in which legitimately people can claim that they are too \nhighly taxed.\n  My friend, perhaps my closest friend in this body, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, said something a \ncouple of hours ago which really struck home. He said maybe we will \nnever get to this real solution, including the hard kind of choices \nthat are involved in this budget, until we have Presidential \nleadership. For years at home I was saying exactly that, maybe even \nmore pessimistically. I felt you would never get to it except in the \nfirst year after a brand new Presidency, when a new President can say \nthat none of this was his or her fault. Yet I think the actions of my \nfriend, the Senator from New Mexico, belie that statement because last \nyear he led us in this body and in the House of Representatives to pass \nan honest balanced budget, the first one in 30 years. It was, \nunfortunately, vetoed, but he must be eternally optimistic. He has \nanother one for us here. The problem is, if we enforce it, it will \nprobably be vetoed as well.\n  So it seems to me that we ought to try a different course of action, \na course of action that binds together Members of both parties. Maybe \nit will not work. It certainly will not work if those Members who \nprivately agree with us say, ``It will not work and I do not dare vote \nfor it.'' Maybe if it does work in this body, it will not work in the \nHouse of Representatives. But we will never know unless we pass it in \nthis body. Maybe if it passes both this body and the House of \nRepresentatives, the President will still veto whatever enforcement \nmechanisms come out of it. Certainly he has given us no encouragement \nso far. But we will never know unless we give him that opportunity. \nThat veto would be in the teeth of almost every important group and, I \nsuspect, newspaper and editorial writer in this country who really does \nlong for a solution like this one proposed by Senator Chafee and by \nSenator Breaux.\n\n  So, to those in this body who say privately this is a good idea if \nonly someone else higher up would go along with it, I say, ``Please \ncome on in. You have an opportunity that you and your predecessors have \nnot had perhaps for decades. The time is now. The challenge is \ntremendous. We need to do it for ourselves, for our children, for our \ngrandchildren, for our country.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Washington \nfor a very, very powerful statement. I think it greatly helps our \ncause. I thank him very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me join with my colleagues on the floor \nin\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\ncommending Senators Breaux and Chafee for their bipartisan leadership \nin bringing us to this moment. I think for the American people who have \nwatched this body from the viewpoint of their television sets in their \nhomes, or who have listened to what we have said about each other in \ncountless news reports, it will come as a complete surprise that during \na very labored and extended period of negotiations on this budget there \nwas an absence of recrimination, there was an absence of harsh, \npartisan rhetoric at all points throughout the entire period of the \npast 7 months where we have endured two Government shutdowns and 13 \ncontinuing resolutions. Always we pushed forward, trying to achieve \nultimately a balanced budget agreement that represented a consensus.\n  Our coalition considered a number of balanced budget proposals. We \nlooked at the President's proposal, we looked at the National \nGovernors' proposal, and we looked at the House and Senate versions of \nthe bill, and we included elements of each of these proposals in our \nfinal plan. Our burgeoning Federal deficit is the greatest domestic \ncrisis facing our country today. It is devouring our savings, robbing \nour ability to invest in infrastructure and education, and saddling our \nchildren with a staggering debt that will eventually have to be paid.\n  As recently as 1980, cumulative Federal debt in this country was $910 \nbillion. A decade later that debt tripled. Today it stands at nearly $5 \ntrillion. If we do not balance the budget today and if we continue on \nour path of irresponsible spending, here are a few examples of what \nwill occur.\n  In the year 2000, annual interest payments on the Federal deficit \nwill grow to approximately $305 billion, an increase of more than 50 \npercent in just 4 years. And in that same year, interest payments on \nthe debt will surpass defense spending and become the largest Federal \nexpenditure.\n  By the year 2012, unless policies changes are enacted, projected \nspending on entitlement programs and interest on the debt will grow so \nrapidly that they will consume all tax revenues collected by the \nFederal Government.\n  In that same year of 2012, unless changes are made, theoretically we \ncould close all Federal prisons, national parks, the Pentagon and \neliminate spending and research and development, education, roads and \nbridges and still not have enough savings to eliminate the deficit.\n  By the year 2030, to bring the deficit down to the current level, the \nBipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform has concluded that \neither all Federal taxes would have to be increased by 85 percent or \nall Federal spending programs would have to be cut in half.\n  Mr. President, history has shown that nothing is more desired and yet \nnothing is more avoided than the will to make the tough choices. The \nlast time that we balanced the Federal budget, Richard Nixon was in the \nWhite House and the year was 1969.\n  The centrist coalition balanced budget plan is fair. It restructures \nand reforms Federal programs that are inefficient while scaling back \nspending. We have adopted a responsible policy of gradual reduction in \nspending over 7 years to reach a true balanced budget.\n  For instance, our balanced budget plan saves $106 billion in Medicare \nover 6 years and protects its long-term solvency. We expand the choices \nfor Medicare beneficiaries by allowing them to remain in the \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare Program or to choose from a range \nof private managed care plans.\n  By creating a new payment system for managed care and by slowing the \nrate of growth in payments to hospitals, physicians and other service \nproviders, our plan extends the solvency of the Medicare trust fund.\n  Our Medicare reform plan saves $41 billion over 6 years and protects \nthe most vulnerable in our Nation. In so doing, we incorporated another \nseries of proposals advanced in a bipartisan fashion by our Nation's \nGovernors. Our plan maintains a national guarantee of coverage for low-\nincome pregnant women, children, the elderly and the disabled, and we \nallow States to design health care delivery systems which best suit \ntheir needs without obtaining waivers from the Federal Government.\n  Under this plan, States can determine provider rates, create managed \ncare programs and development home and community based options for \nseniors to help them out of their problems.\n  Our welfare reform language saves $45 billion in 6 years and includes \nvery strong work provisions as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator for another \nminute.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield another minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me just say, although a number of us would have \npreferred our focus be exclusively balancing the budget and deferring \nany tax reductions until after that balanced budget was achieved, we \nrecognized that the only way we could build a consensus to bring 22 of \nus together was if we yielded to those concessions by striking what I \nbelieve is a responsible compromise with those who would offer far more \nin terms of tax cuts, which I believe we can ill-afford to incur until \nwe do balance the budget with a reasonable midline approach.\n\n  Finally, let me just say, Mr. President, that I think the window of \nopportunity is narrowing. We have an opportunity in this Congress, with \nthe momentum that this coalition has brought together, to achieve a \npositive and lasting result. I urge my colleagues to accept this \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on the \nallocation of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield the additional 3 minutes that the \nSenator from Louisiana needs to assist the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank very much the distinguished Senator from Nebraska \nand yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia, Senator Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my fellow Senators.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the centrist coalition \nsubstitute budget resolution. I join in commending Senators Chafee and \nBreaux for their leadership in this effort. This resolution reflects \nthe hard work and compromise of over 20 Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who came together months ago in search of a realistic \nsolution to a serious problem. We came together out of a sense of \nfrustration, but we worked together with a sense of purpose, believing \nthat our fiscal problems really can be solved. We vowed at the outset \nthat we would produce a balanced budget plan that was credible, and we \ndid. We vowed we would confront the tough choices, and we did. The \nbudget we produced deserves the serious consideration of every Member \nof this body because it is real, it is tough, it is principled, and it \nreaches balance in 7 years.\n  Mr. President, as we craft a blueprint for the way we spend our \nFederal dollars in the next few years, we have a responsibility to find \nways to continue to strengthen our Nation economically.\n  How can we do that? We strengthen our Nation when we reduce the level \nof Government borrowing from the private sector. We strengthen our \nNation when we make investments that enhance productivity and increase \nwages. We strengthen our Nation when we provide real economic \nopportunity to all of our citizens. And while these are bedrock \nprinciples of our centrist plan, the existing budget plans backload \ncuts in discretionary spending which make it virtually impossible to \nget there from here. Either discretionary programs will be decimated in \nthe outyears or the budget will go right back in the red.\n  The other plans being considered require deeper cuts with respect to \ndiscretionary spending than our plan because they include either too \nlarge a tax cut or they refuse to tackle absolutely essential \nentitlement reform. In both cases, critical investments in people, like \neducation and training, and important investments in technology, like \nresearch and development, are jeopardized. The cuts in discretionary \nspending included in existing budget plans should be of enormous \nconcern to\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nMembers of my own party who understand, as I do, the ability of \nGovernment to improve people's lives, indeed, who believe in its \nresponsibility of Government to invest in our people and to serve as a \ncatalyst for hope and opportunity where none exists.\n\n  Mr. President, if we do not end up with a responsible budget \nagreement, how many children will get Head Start in the year 2002? How \nmany Pell grants will go to poor children in the South? How many \nmothers will get WIC? How many Federal research dollars will go to \ncolleges? How many Federal highways will be built in our States?\n  If we fail to make these kinds of investments, we will weaken our \nNation. So how do we craft an honest budget that allows us to continue \nto invest in our Nation? The answer is tough medicine for everyone. It \nis forsaking the large tax cut and making significant, but principled, \nreductions in entitlements, and our centrist budget does both.\n  We include a more modest tax cut, even though most of us are very \nmuch opposed to any tax cut until we actually balance the budget, and \nwe make a solid start on entitlement reform. By adjusting the Consumer \nPrice Index and asking that those seniors who can afford to pay more \nfor their health coverage do so, we spread the sacrifice and protect \nour Nation's ability to provide a safety net for our most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  But we all know, Mr. President, that the 7-year budget we offer today \nis just a downpayment on our sacrifice. We are going to need to ask a \nwhole lot more of our people, even though this is an essential \ndownpayment. For if we move outside our 7-year budget window to the \nyear 2012, we see an even bleaker future with entitlements and interest \non the debt consuming every single tax dollar the Federal Government \nwill take in. And after that, it gets even worse.\n  So I urge my colleagues to give this centrist budget resolution their \ncareful and thoughtful consideration.\n  It reflects bipartisanship, moderation, compromise, and a willingness \nto tackle entitlement reform. It reflects good public policy as well. \nWith that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont. I \nbelieve I have 6 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield him 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here to speak in \nfavor of the centrist budget request. I remember so many years ago when \nI was in the House when we had a similar problem with the inability to \nget together on a budget.\n  A number of us in the middle decided we would put together the answer \nto the budget. We worked very hard on it. We did a good job. We then \nwent to the votes. There were three choices. There was the liberal, \nthere was the conservative, and there was the middle.\n  The liberal budget went down by a fair number of votes. The \nconservative budget went down by a fair number of votes. We thought, \nWow, we're right in the middle here. We're going to get all the votes. \nWe got fewer than anybody. My point is, perhaps I know we are not going \nto win tonight, but I bet the budget we end up with in the final \nanalysis is going to be very close to what we are proposing here \ntonight.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what the major problems are. First of \nall, we have accomplished quite a bit this year. We recognize there is \na problem. For the first time in my memory in this Congress for over 23 \nyears, there is a consensus that we have to have a balanced budget. The \nPresident agrees we have to have a balanced budget. The House and \nSenate do.\n  But how do you get there? You do not get there by any easy way. There \nis no easy way to a balanced budget. You have to tackle the toughest \naspects of it.\n  One of those, which I spoke about at some length on Friday, is health \ncare. One-half of the budget problem is the fact that we have not a \nhealth care system where the Federal costs are under control. That can \nbe done, but only if we have the willpower to do it and to get to \ncapitated payments on the Federal side.\n  Previously, I have spoken about the need for us to look to the \nfuture. All you have to do is buy the Atlantic Monthly if you want to \nsee how deep the trouble is that we are in. This month's Atlantic \nMonthly shows, if we do not do something about Social Security, if we \ndo not change the rate at which it is paid out, by the year 2040, I \nthink it is, they say the annual deficit in Social Security will be \n$766 billion.\n  We cannot wait until then. What is one thing we can do? We can take a \nrealistic look at that thing here that controls our entitlement \nprograms. That is the CPI. It takes courage to do that because every \ninterest group is going to be screaming at you if you do. But not too \nlong from now we will find there will be revealed to us the experts' \nanalysis of what that CPI ought to be. It will be somewhere between 0.7 \nand 2 percent.\n  No one is willing to argue that we should decrease the CPI by 2 \npercent, but we have had the courage to come forward and say we must \nmake a change in this direction. So we have done so with a 0.5 percent \ndecrease in the CPI that, because of the exponential results that you \nhave by going forward with this change, whether it be Social Security \nor all the other things which are affected by a Consumer Price Index, \nit will be lower and lower and lower as we go to the future. So if we \nare ever going to get this budget under control, first we have to get \nhealth care costs under control and, secondly, we have to reduce the \nCPI to a more realistic number. Those two things alone will do it.\n\n  I speak also because I am on the discretionary spending committee, \nthe biggest one, Labor and Human Resources. I am also on the \nAppropriations Committee and on the subcommittee that is in those \nareas. I know, as a leader of that committee, that there is no way that \nwe are going to be able to do the things that need to be done, in the \narea of education in particular, unless we get the costs of the \nentitlements and the costs of health care under control. What do we \nhave to do for education?\n  Another thing we have accomplished this year. If we do nothing else, \nwe have agreed, the House, the Senate and the President, that we should \nnot cut education. For many years now we have had the realization that \nwe have a horrendous problem of training our young people for \nemployment. That is the other thing which is so critically important, \nand that is to have a good job. If people do not have good jobs, we do \nnot have the kind of revenues that we can have, we do not have the kind \nof productivity that this Nation needs and must have in order for us to \nbalance the budget.\n  In the area of education, we have finally agreed we should not cut. \nBut there is much more that needs to be done in that. I want to say \nagain, I commend Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux for bringing us \ntogether to bring us to what we can do to bring this budget under \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, balancing the budget is a task that is long overdue, \none that we should have tackled long before the Federal debt began to \nescalate in the early 1980's. Our carelessness in financial planning is \na terrible legacy to leave our children and grandchildren.\n  When I voted in the House in 1986 against the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, I stated at the time we could not wait to \nbalance the budget the number of years required to get it approved by \nthe States. However, 10 years later the situation has become much \nworse. Now I realize that is imperative we move forward without the \namendment. Any further delay will greatly increase the damage to \nnational economic stability.\n  If we do not begin to balance the budget before the year 2002 our \nnational debt will be a staggering $6.4 trillion. The debt will double \nagain over the next 15 years and quickly redouble again within the next \n7 years.\n  The basic problem is the increasing cost of entitlement programs. \nThese are programs outside of the appropriations process. They have \nincreased well beyond the growth of revenues and population. In \naddition, it appears through generosity or otherwise they have \nincreased at a rate greater than the actual cost of living created by \ninflation. Our proposal recognizes this for the future. This will make \nadditional cuts in\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\ndiscretionary programs such as education less necessary. But it does so \nin a way which may actually protect these programs from a greater \ndecrease which will be recommended this June by a panel of experts.\n  The entitlements that have provided the greatest problems are in the \narea of health care. The increasing projected costs in Medicaid and \nMedicare represent about one-half of the increasing cost problem. We \ncannot continue to run a Federal fee for service system. Trying to \ncontrol costs without controlling utilization has not worked, there are \ntoo many ways that costs can be shifted to these programs. Progress in \nthis area will be controlled by more State responsibility. But my \ncolleagues who are on committees of relevant jurisdiction must work to \nmove to a Federal capitated system combined with utilization of private \ninsurance methodologies and Federal guidelines to get these costs under \ncontrol. It is interesting to note that in 1954 the Eisenhower \nadministration introduced legislation along these lines when it \nrecognized some Federal system was required. The purpose of the bill \nwas, ``to encourage and stimulate private initiative in making good and \ncomprehensive services generally accessible on reasonable terms through \nadequate health prepayment plans, to the maximum number of people * * * \nby making a form of reinsurance available for voluntary health service \nprepayment plans where such reinsurance is needed in order to stimulate \nthe establishment and maintenance of adequate prepayment plans in \nareas, and with respect to services and classes of persons, for which \nthey are needed.'' I believe this gives us a possible route implemented \nthrough individual choice to get us out of our present health care cost \nmess. We must find the way to control uncontrolled cost shifts and to \nspread the cost of the sick over the widest base. Hopefully the Finance \nCommittee and the Labor and Human Resource Committee will join in \nachieving this goal.\n\n  Mr. President, like my colleagues in this centrist coalition, I want \na Federal budget that is balanced in an equitable manner. In reaching a \nbalanced budget we must be careful not to cut those programs which \ncould be counterproductive to balancing the budget. In other words, \ncuts in one program can result in increased costs in other programs, \nthus making it more difficult to balance the budget.\n  This budget proposal accomplishes this goal by making the tough \ndecisions necessary to balance the budget within 7 years and still \nmaintain a strong commitment to discretionary spending. Unlike other \nbudget proposals, this plan provides for cuts to the overall \ndiscretionary spending that are both achievable and modest.\n  Mr. President, there are many important programs within the \ndiscretionary accounts that needed to be maintained. The centrist group \nrealizing the importance of discretionary spending provided modest \nincreases to the discretionary accounts, such as in education and the \nenvironment.\n  Our bipartisian plan contains some $50 million less in discretionary \ncuts than the latest President's budget, and $121 billion less than the \nRepublican plan. Our plan will leave future Congresses with the ability \nto adequately fund discretionary programs, while these other plans will \nleave future Congresses with no choice but to eliminate many important \nprograms. It is unrealistic to think that some future Congress will \nmake these tough decisions, decisions that this Congress is unwilling \nto do.\n  I would like to highlight just a few examples of the important of \nmaintaining the discretionary accounts. One example can be seen in \nFederal health research spending. We are nearing discoveries and new \ntreatments to the causes of many illnesses and diseases, such as \nAlzheimers and Parkinsons. The centrist coalition provides the \nflexibility to maintain spending on medical research. It is well known \nthat for every dollar spent on health research, several dollars are \nsaved by the Federal Government. This spending on health research could \nallow for the ptential to eliminate tens of billions of dollars in \nFederal health care costs over the next decade or more.\n  Another example of this group's commitment is in providing adequate \neducation funding. As a group we understand that this Nation faces a \ncrisis--a crisis which is costing us hundreds of billions of dollars in \nlost revenues, decreased economic productivity and increased social \ncosts, such as welfare, crime, and health care.\n  Mr. President, business leaders warn us that unless improvements are \nmade in our educational system, our futrue will be even bleaker. The \nrising costs of higher education combined with the lower income levels \nof middle-income families is causing thousands not to finish college, \nand fewer to attend grduate school in critical areas such as math, \nscience, and engineering. As chairman of the Education Subcommittee, I \nam particulalry concerned about maintaining funding for education, and \nI have worked with my colleagues in this centrist group to ensure that \nadequate funding will be protected within education programs.\n  In order to help solve the deficit problem, and as importantly, to \nprevent unnecessary hardship to individuals, this group's plan protects \nthe Federal commitment to education, health research, and many other \ndiscretionary spending areas by providing the least amount of cuts of \nany plan yet offered.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to balancing this budget, but not on \nthe backs of the poor, the elderly, and our children. This budget \nproposal is the only plan that protects the neediest Americans while \nbalancing the budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to comment more specifically on the \nrole of education in our deficit problem.\n  Today, I will talk about the need to be careful on how we cut, \nespecially in the field of education. I am the chairman of the Senate \nEducation Subcommittee and, therefore, have a particular responsibility \nto make sure that what we do from this point on does not in any way \ninhibit the ability of this Nation to be able to meet its commitments \nto its young, but most importantly its commitments to this Nation that \nwe maintain our ability to be the most competitive and the most \neconomically sound nation in the world.\n  I am afraid, as I look across the Congress to see where cuts are \nbeing made. I also recognize the future needs of our Nation, especially \nin the area of education. For without immediate attention by this \nNation on our educational system, we are facing incredible danger for \nour economic future. We cannot move forward without recognizing that \ncuts within the educational system may well prove to be \ncounterproductive--counterproductive in that they will reduce the \npotential revenues that we would otherwise have and that they will only \nincrease the social costs that we are presently experiencing.\n  So let me now, as we go into the 21st century, take a look at where \nwe are with respect to education and the need for us, a Nation, to \nplace ourselves in a more competitive position within the international \neconomic community.\n  In order for our country to remain viable in the global economy we \nmust not only be free from crippling interest payments on our debt, but \nwe must also prioritize our spending so that we maneuver ourselves to \nbe ready to face the challenges of the new millennium. If we do not act \nnow, we will destroy the dreams that we cherish--good health, a good \neducation, a good job, and a good retirement.\n  Some have proposed that we reduce the deficit simply by making \nacross-the-board cuts on all programs. Such cuts might provide a \nsolution to our financial woes in the short term, but they only \nexacerbate the deficit in the long term. Here is why. If we cut back on \nprograms for education and training, we lose our competitive edge in \nthe marketplace, resulting in a lower standard of living, fewer high \npaying jobs, less Federal revenues in taxes, and, naturally, a larger \ndeficit.\n  On the other hand, if we work to improve our education system, we not \nonly increase our national productivity, but our standard of living \nwill increase, resulting in greater Federal revenues and a decreased \nneed to invest in our social programs.\n  The deficit will not be solved unless we're willing to solve the \ncauses. Education is critical. It must be improved.\n  General Marshall stated years ago in his frustration over delays in \ndesigning the Marshall plan ``stop kicking the problem around, just \nsolve it.''\n  I believe this advice applies to the larger problem that we face \ntoday. If we solve the larger problem, then this\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\nwill solve those immediate ones that we look at with respect to our \ninability to fund the various programs we all desire to fund. For if we \ndo not improve our educational system, and if we are unable to solve \nthe deficit problem, we cannot ensure that we have the capacity to \nprovide for the programs we need. And then we will find that the \nproblem of balancing our budget is unsolvable and that this Nation will \ndisappear in the next millennium as a lesser nation.\n  The way to solve the problem of our deficit is not, as some suggest, \nmindless across-the-board cuts. Solutions to our financial woes are \nlong-term investments--specifically in our education system. By not \nsolving the problem of reduced productivity and higher costs through \neducation failures, interest payments will keep increasing, tax \nrevenues will keep decreasing, and our deficit will only grow larger. \nMore mindless cuts is not the answer. Instead, thoughtful investments \nand adequate resources are the solution to our long-term fiscal \nconcerns.\n  Consider for a moment the education spending patterns over the last \ndecade. Since the beginning of the 1980's overall Federal support for \neducation, after adjusting for inflation, has decreased by 5-percent. \nFunds for elementary and secondary education declined 15 percent, while \npostsecondary education funds declined 24 percent. Where has that led \nus? Certainly, not to the first class education system we all support. \nIn fact, using the six education goals developed by a bipartisan group \nof Governors in 1989 as our barometer, we are not close to reaching our \nmark of excellence in education.\n  Among the goals for our future is that our children come to school \nready to learn, that they come without hunger, and that they come with \nthe capacity to be able to understand the education that they are going \nto be faced with. That means they must first be fed, immunized, and, \nhopefully, have had some preschool experience. However, only 45 percent \nof young children from low-income families are enrolled in preschool \nprograms and only 55 percent of infants have been fully immunized, \nprotecting them against childhood diseases. Head Start continues to \nonly serve one-fourth of all eligible children in this Nation.\n  We also recognize that educated people who can compete in the global \nmarketplace require a mastery in challenging core subject areas--such \nas math and science--and that all adults be literate and prepared for \nlife-long learning. Unfortunately, in these basic areas, we are far \nfrom the finish line.\n  The 1993 National Assessment of Educational Progress indicates more \nthan 75 percent of students at all grade levels failed to achieve even \nthe basic level of proficiency, and over 60 percent failed to meet the \nproficiency level in English.\n  In international comparisons, American students consistently score \nbelow most other industrialized nations.\n  In the 1992 international assessment of education progress U.S. 13-\nyear-olds scored second to last among the nations in mathematics \nachievement, and similarly in science.\n  More recently, a report recently came out that investigated the \nliteracy of children that graduate from high school. The report found \nthat 51 percent of the students now graduating from our high schools \nwere functionally illiterate. That is, incapable of handling an entry-\nlevel job with their educational achievement.\n  Make no mistake about it. These disturbing statistics are not about \nsomeone else's children. They are not someone else's problem. These are \nour children. These are our problems. Our future work force and our \nfuture leaders. The quality of our public schools in America is \ndirectly related to the standard of living of each and every citizen. \nWithout a strong investment ion education, this Nation will not be able \nto maintain an adequate number of highly skilled workers. These workers \nare necessary if our country is to maintain a competitive position \nwithin the global marketplace.\n  To give you a quick idea of why curing our educational ills is \ncritical and key to our future, we will examine a yearly cost of our \nfailing educational system. The total cost of our failure in education \nto our economy has been estimated to be one-half trillion dollars each \nyear to our economy.\n  The lost revenue alone has been estimated to be about $125 billion. \nThat is, if the educational levels were where they should be, the \nincome to the Nation, relative to furnishing our budget, could be \nhigher by $125 billion, putting us a long ways toward being able to \nhave the budget balanced.\n  For example, American business spends approximately $200 billion a \nyear to perform training for employees which is necessary to provide \nthose individual minimum skills required to perform on the job, skills \nmost of which should have been taught in the schools.\n  The Department of Education estimates that 30 million Americans are \nfunctionally illiterate, another 46 million are marginally literate. \nThis creates a significant problem for our economy. ``Combating \nIlliteracy in the Workplace,'' by Robert Goddard, puts the cost of this \nilliteracy at a staggering $225 billion a year. This includes lost \nproductivity, unrealized taxes, crime, welfare, health, housing, and \nother social costs.\n  We pay for our failed educational system every time an individual \ndrops out of high school. Lack of a high school degree costs an \nindividual $440,000 in lifetime earnings. These lost earnings often \ndrive these individuals into welfare, crime, and drugs. Up to 80 \npercent of our people that are incarcerated in our State jails are \nfunctionally illiterate, school dropouts.\n  Federal expenditures for welfare were $208 billion in the fiscal year \n1992. The cost of incarceration, which I mentioned, is $25 billion per \nyear and growing, and the medical costs of violent crime is another $18 \nbillion per year. Illegal drugs cost the economy $238 billion a year, \nas estimated by Brandeis University. These difficult circumstances \nperpetuate themselves generation after generation.\n\n  I think most Americans agree, and in poll after poll people cite the \nquality of education as a paramount concern. And this view is growing \neach year. The support for education in these polls is often cited as \none of the most important roles of Government. Americans understand \nintuitively that investing wisely in education is the key to our future \nsuccess and the best possible national investment we can make for the \ncountry. The evidence is clear: Countries which spend more on education \nper pupil have higher levels of per capita GDP. Institutions like \nMotorola report corporate savings of $30 to $35 for every dollar on \ntraining. That is a 3000- to 3500-percent rate of return. But most of \nthat education, if you read the report, was to make their students \nliterate to put them in a position where they could read.\n  They found, amazingly in their study, they were having trouble with \ntheir employees answering simple math problems and they could not \nbelieve they do not have the capacity to do the math, when they found \nout the problem was they could not read the problems. Thus they had to \nteach them how to read to do simple math problems. That is the state of \nthe situation, and that is Motorola, one who can be selective in their \nemployees.\n  People, as rational consumers, also realize investing in their own \neducation leads to substantially higher lifetime earnings. A person \nwith a bachelor's degree earns over 1.5 times of the person with a high \nschool degree. A professional degree earns over 350 percent higher \nlifetime earnings than a high school diploma in itself.\n  While we recognize both intuitively and through research the economic \nrewards of education, we do not simultaneously invest the funds \nnecessary to support the position. Many of my colleagues, while \nacknowledging the importance of educational investments, argue that \nthrowing money at education is not the solution. I could not agree \nmore. Increasing educational expenditures in itself will not solve our \ncountry's educational deficiencies.\n  We have a responsibility to invest educational dollars wisely, \nincluding more active congressional oversight over Federal initiatives. \nSimultaneously, we must also reinvigorate our schools by demanding that \nstudents learn to high academic standards.\n  Why? Because the status quo in our schools has failed. Too many of \nour graduates finish school without knowing the three R's, much less \nmore rigorous academic standards. Clearly,\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\nthere is no room for federally mandated standards. We should be \nproviding incentives for States and communities to set up goals for \nstudent achievement--pupil by pupil, and school by school.\n  More importantly, they must know what standards this Nation must \nreach, if we are going to be able to continue to compete \ninternationally. It is one thing to believe that our education, as most \npeople in this country do, has improved over the time they were in \nschool, and I find that is true for myself. I am amazed that the \nstudents in high schools are taking subjects which I did not get until \ncollege.\n  What they do not realize, for instance, in a recent report on the \ncomparison of our students to other nation's students we fared poorly. \nOne example is with Taiwanese students. These students when they \ngraduate are 2 years ahead of our students in many subjects, such as in \nmath. Is it any wonder we come out last in these tests, or next to \nlast?\n  What is important is that we know and that the States know that we do \nhave a problem. That this Nation is faced with a very serious \neducational problem, and if we do not do something about it, we will \nnot be the Nation we must and should be in the next generation.\n  So we must be sure that when we begin to reduce the budget to try and \nbalance it that we do not do counterproductive cuts which will decrease \nour revenues and increase our social costs. rather than cutting the \ndeficit it will increase the deficit.\n  The dreams of good health, a good education, a good life, and a good \nretirement can only be realized by setting high priorities on education \nand educational investment. These increases are essential if our \ncountry wishes to remain viable into and throughout the next century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 1 minute \nremaining. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator need more time than that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I might like a little time, if I could, at the end for \nrebuttal. If the Senator is prepared to go now--\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right now I will yield the Senator some time, 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, I will take 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The arguments, I believe, have been very, very forcefully \nset forth this evening by the speakers on our side, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking as a bipartisan group that \nsomething has to be done about the deficit of this Nation or future \ngenerations are going to be in terrible trouble. We heard the \nstatistics from the Senator from South Dakota in connection with this, \nand others likewise who talked about what Social Security is going to \nlook like or Medicare or the other entitlement programs unless in some \nfashion we get control.\n  This budget that we are presenting does that. This budget not only \nbalances itself in the 7 years, but in the outyears, that is where the \ntremendous savings are. So I commend my colleagues to come forward and \njoin us.\n  As the Presiding Officer in his remarks pointed out, there are those \nwho are saying, ``We would be with you, but we're not sure you have \nenough votes.'' If we spent all our time going only with those who have \na majority, we would not stand for anything. We are not sent down here \nas weather vanes to go where the majority is. We are sent down here, it \nseems to me, not only to look after this generation, but future \ngenerations as well.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we put forward a tough program, but the solutions \nto the problems of this Nation are not going to be sugar candy. They \nare going to have to be by facing up to difficult decisions. Is \nreducing the CPI by 0.5 percent a difficult decision? Sure it is. The \neasy way is to do nothing, continue the reckless course we are on now \nin this Nation of ours.\n  But I want to pay tribute to every single one of those who have \njoined with us in putting forward this budget on behalf of Senator \nBreaux and myself.\n  Mr. President, I will never forget a movie I saw during the war. The \ncolonel comes before the pilots who have just graduated from pilot \nschool, and some are going into fighters and some are going into \nbombers. The colonel who was addressing them happened to be a bomber \npilot. He said, ``Here's where we separate the men from the boys.''\n  I am not taking any sides of pilots being fighter pilots or bomber \npilots. But I will say that this is a tough decision that we are facing \nvery shortly in this Congress. I hope that those colleagues who are not \nhere this evening who are still doubtful, will say that program is a \ngood one. It is not only a good one for now, but it is a good one, even \nmore importantly, for future generations. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I use. I \nunderstand Senator Exon wants to be recognized at some point. If there \nare any members of the centrist coalition, Senator Chafee and Senator \nBreaux, that have not had enough time, I will give them part of my \ntime.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, I guess I can say in all honesty that \nafter more than 20 years on the Budget Committee, tonight is indeed an \nexhilarating evening for me, because I believe if anybody listened to \nthe debate here tonight--and I regret to say, in my own way, in the \nnext 30 or 40 minutes I am going to suggest why I am not going to vote \nfor this tonight--but if anybody listened to the debate tonight and saw \nthis bipartisan array of Senators, all of them, all of them excellent \nSenators, none of them known for demagoguery, but for being problem \nsolvers--five of them are on the Budget Committee that I can recollect, \nfive are on the Finance Committee, which, in all fairness to all the \nother committees of jurisdiction, would probably have about 85 percent \nof the say in whether we get to a balance and whether we stop the kind \nof future damage that has been explained here today.\n  When we first started at budgeting, six or seven Senators understood. \nThey would think when you made a $5 billion change in one little part \nof the budget that you are really making some headway. When you look \ndown and see in 10 or 12 years--that is 10 or 12 years from then--you \nsee a Medicare Program going bankrupt. They did not go bankrupt \nyesterday. We did not know it was going to be in trouble yesterday. We \nknew it years ago, just like we know we will not be able to pay for all \nthe things we have promised Americans in just a few years.\n  It is not a question of whether you want to be mean, whether you want \nto live up to your commitment. The truth of the matter is, as \nprosperous and powerful as we are, we have set in motion programs, \ncommitments to our people that we cannot possibly live up to.\n  For those who are wondering whether the giant programs and \ncommitments of our Government can long endure, let me say they can. But \nthey cannot long endure if we wait until they are in serious trouble \nand then try to fix them.\n  Let me tell you what will happen. I quote from Robert Samuelson, who \nwrites editorial pieces. Everybody thinks he is an economist. He is not \nan economist. He knows as much as many and he speaks more forthrightly \nthan many and he makes more sense than many. Let me tell what you he \nsaid in an editorial piece. Listen carefully, if you do not think he is \ntelling us why we are here tonight listening to this debate:\n\n       At some point spending and benefits will be cut to avoid \n     costs that seem politically intolerable. The trouble is that \n     the longer the changes are delayed, the more abrupt and the \n     more unfair they will be.\n\n  The last sentence reads:\n\n       That's why silence is irresponsible.\n\n  Frankly, to the eight or nine Senators who spoke in behalf of this \nbipartisan proposal, you have chosen not to be irresponsible, for \nsilence here tonight would have been irresponsible. I only wish we \nwould have started this process and have a bipartisan budget here on \nthe floor, and I only wish the President would be in support of the \nmajor ingredient in your budget. I do not think there is a lot of doubt \nthat if he were, it would be done.\n  Now, let me tell you why I am concerned. I borrowed the chart from \nSenator Breaux. He has no idea why I borrowed it. I only borrowed it \nfor one\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nnumber, Senator, the year 1997, the change in the CPI--$7. You have \nargued that is a small amount to pay to benefit this Nation so greatly. \nI say $7 is enough to make a case to the American people that one group \nof politicians is doing the wrong thing and another is doing the right \nthing--$7.\n  Let me tell you the difference between the Republican plan to save \nMedicare, and it was not even part of the trust fund, but the \ndifference between our first proposal in June of last year and the \nPresident's was $7. It went across America as if it were a torrent, a \ntornado destroying the benefits for senior citizens. If you can do it \nonce, you can do it again.\n  I submit it will be done again. That $7 increase in the average \nmonthly check for senior citizens, if it is not destroyed here tonight \nby the opposition, it will be destroyed tomorrow if you pass it, or a \nweek from now if you pass it, by the President of the United States, \nfor he will make that as big an issue as he made the $7 in Medicare, \nthe insurance premium change that was first in the budget that you \nalluded to, Senator Gorton, earlier in the evening.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think I understand, and I appreciate the point the \nSenator is making, but does the Senator not make the point we were \ntrying to make, that the only way we will get it done is in a \nbipartisan fashion, where we both can hold hands and say, ``Yes, this \nhas to be done in a bipartisan way.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed.\n  I believe, however, in this year, 5 months before a Presidential \nelection, with all the water that has gone under the bridge, I do not \nbelieve it can be done with a bipartisan group of Senators.\n  I believe at some point--and that point may not be too distant, \nSenator, and I believe you will still be here when that point arrives, \nI hope, and Senator Chafee, because I do not think it is a long way \noff--I believe bipartisan Senators may put that budget together. I just \ndo not think it will work this year. I do not in any way want to \ndetract from the courage and hard work, from the dedicated commitment \nthat went into this budget.\n  I think, in all honesty, a Republican budget of last year and this \nyear have a lot to do with the momentum that brought you together and \nthe momentum that kept you together. I am not here trying to draw \ncomparisons between your budget and our budget and the President's. But \nI will say it would not be difficult for this Senator to put a budget \ntogether and speak with high praise for it with your number on welfare, \nyour number on Medicaid, and, yes, your number on Medicare. In fact, I \nthink we are so close that it might be decided in the Finance Committee \nand Agriculture Committee on matters of policy because I do not believe \nthe numbers would be very far apart.\n  Maybe we will hear differently tonight when the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska talks about this role. Perhaps we will. I am not here \ntonight to criticize this bipartisan group on any aspect of its budget. \nI am here tonight to congratulate them. I think I am even prepared to \nsay for those out in America that watch budgeting and watch our future \nwith grave concern, this might be a red letter day for your becoming \nbuoyant and positive about America sooner rather than later, getting a \nbalanced budget and putting its fiscal house in order.\n  The issues encapsulated in your budget are for real. Again, I say I \nam sorry I cannot support it, but I feel I have made a commitment not \nto touch Social Security in this year's budget. I believe, just as \ncertainly as you do, that I have to live up to that commitment.\n  I remind some people around here that they should not leave tonight \nthinking that the Senator from New Mexico needs to be separated, the \nmen from the boys, and that I am in the boy's department, to borrow \nyour war story. I voted for about every kind of change that we could \nmake to get this budget of the United States under control. I have had \nabout as much positive thinking as you do tonight about how wonderful \nyour plan is. I did one of those, only to find that then-President \nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, within 5 days, somewhere, somehow, \ndecided to destroy it. And it was about similar issues, I might say, \nwithout digging up a whole bunch of linen that is now soiled. It had to \ndo with the same big-ticket item we are talking about here. So I have \nbeen there.\n\n  I also want to suggest that you have approached another issue very \nrealistically--Senators Chafee, Breaux, and those 22 supporting you. \nAnd I will say this, without any hesitation: It is going to be very, \nvery tough--if, indeed, it will be possible--for the President of the \nUnited States to get a balanced budget using the assumptions he is \nmaking, because, in fact, I do not believe you can possibly reduce the \nexpenditures that come out of that $275 billion pot called the \ndiscretionary accounts, everything from the National Science Foundation \nto our little bit of education money--and it is not a lot; $23 billion \nis all we fund for kindergarten through 12th grade. But there are a \nmyriad of programs in that package. I do not believe he can get the \namount of savings in the last 2 years that the President says he will.\n  I will submit that it may be very, very difficult to get the \nRepublican savings, although they are more realistic in that they are \ngradual rather than precipitous. They do not go up only to come down--\nand, incidentally, go up in an election year only to come down in the \nnonelection years. But they will be difficult. You have decided that \nyou want to do something about that, and I understand Senator Chafee's \nexplanation. You want to be more realistic and not have as many assumed \nreductions in those accounts. I do not know if we are going to get \nthere or not. But, sooner or later, the reality of those numbers, which \nwill be looked at each year--although, sooner or later, you have to \nbind them, but the reality of it will come up.\n  I want to say one more time tonight, for a few minutes, that these 22 \nSenators, those who agreed to support my budget--those who really want \nto get a balanced budget--do not do this because they love changing \nAmerican commitments, or deciding to reform programs where people might \nget a little bit less than they expected. This is not some glorious \nkind of achievement. We do this because to continue with the kind of \nbudget we have in place flies in the face and against the reality of \nAmerica having any kind of real, sustained economic growth and our \nchildren having a better life than us.\n  That is the issue. Can an America that already owes almost $6 \ntrillion, and over $215 billion in interest payments, continue to have \na buoyant economy, with business having money to invest because they \ncan borrow it at reasonable interest rates? Do we have that or not? \nUnless and until we get this to a zero and then begin, at some \nreasonable point, to get that debt under control, all of the money \nsaved by the American people that is supposed to go into growth, \nprosperity, a better future for the next generation, the American \ndream, and all of the wonderful things we speak of, it all gets gobbled \nup by the debt instead of being invested in a plan that increases \nproductivity and brings better jobs to Louisiana, or Albuquerque, or \nNew Mexico, or Nebraska.\n  Yet, we want our economy to give us better jobs, more stable jobs, \nand we continue to rob the job creation part of this economy. The \nGovernment does not create jobs, except for the Federal employees. So \nwhen we speak of job creation, we are really talking about having a \nsituation in the marketplace in the private sector, because of well-\ntrained employees, because of money they can invest, and low interest \nrates, so that they can grow, prosper, and hire more people, and pay \nbetter salaries. That is job creation; it is not the Government. We \nstand in the way of it every time we fail to come up with a balanced \nbudget that is for real in good economic times, for we take the money \nfrom the hands of the working people and put it in the coffers of banks \nand insurance companies and other lenders that have given us their \nmoney, and we give them back a note from the U.S. Government because we \ndo not have the courage to pay our own bills. We say, let another \ngeneration pay them. Let us charge it. That is why we are here and why \nwe are encouraged tonight, because of the group of 22, under the \nleadership of Senators Chafee and Breaux, have come so very far in \nmoving in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n  I want to say to the U.S. Senate, to the President of the United \nStates, and to many of those who are going to see fit to attack the \nbudget that I put before the Senate, which is pending. I just look up \nhere on this chart and say, as far as Medicare, the most challenged of \nthe programs--and I have already suggested to you all that if you \nwondered how big the gap between the President and the Republicans was \nin June of last year, it was $7, and I showed you that on the other \nchart. But I would think if you look in the last column of the $167, \nand the first column at $154--and I understand one is a 6-year and one \nis 7. If you look at the assumptions made and where they are going, and \nwhere we are going, as I said a while ago, we could resolve our \ndifferences in a wink.\n  If you look at welfare and EITC, while there is a big difference, \nmost of that difference has to do with the earned-income tax credit--\nalmost all of it. That is an issue we can talk a while over and see if \nwe can resolve.\n\n  The important thing is that the welfare reform in this proposal is \nvery, very close to what will be recommended and, hopefully, will be \nbipartisan when it comes out of this Senate and ultimately out of the \nHouse and goes down to the President for signature. I hate to be \npartisan, but it might seem like I am going with the Wisconsin plan. \nBut as you read it, it seems like it was not. We will produce something \nlike the Wisconsin plan, and it will be close to those goals without \nthe EITC.\n  Then if you want to look at Medicaid, clearly, there are policy \ndifferences with reference to how much is guaranteed and how much is \ntotally blocked into the States. I have heard my friend, Senator \nChafee, allude and speak to that, such that I think we could write a \nMedicaid bill pretty easily that would have bipartisan support. So I \ndid this in no way to take advantage of your budget and try to enhance \nthe one I have produced--in no way.\n  What I have done is to make sure that everybody understands that my \nstatement of about 12 minutes ago, when I said this is a truly \nimportant day because it probably sends the signal that we are going to \nget this deficit fixed, and if we do not get it fixed right now, for \nthis year, because of the things I have spoken of, and a few others, it \nwill never go unnoticed that you all probably had more to do with \ngetting us there than we have, and probably more than the President has \nhad, for you will have moved us in the right direction with an awful \nlot of real courage.\n  Now, having said that, I want to make my own observation about why \nthis is an important debate for our future. I have made it with \nreference to interest rates and the legacy that we leave our children. \nIs it going to be a legacy of debt or a legacy of opportunity?\n  But I also submit that America's economy has to grow more than it has \nbeen growing. I do not think we can accept any longer from economists \nthe notion that it cannot grow any more--2.3, 2.4 percent is it. For \nthose who say it could be 6 or 8, we are not talking about that. That \nis clearly wishful thinking and dreaming. But it has to grow at more \nthan it has been growing if we are going to get rid of stagnation, if \nwe are going to get rid of the fear and anxiety about whether the jobs \nare going to be good sooner rather than later as they are now.\n\n  I add one observation. If you get the budget under control where more \nof the savings of the American people can go into building businesses \nof our country so that jobs can be improved which are higher paying and \nmore competitive, and if you add to that reforming the Tax Code which \nis antigrowth in every respect--and in a sense, those who save in \nAmerica today are kind of dumb because we have a Tax Code that says, \n``do not save'' to those who invest instead of saying, ``If you make \nsome money, you can keep it and invest in the growth of the economy.'' \nWe say, ``You cannot do that because we will tax you as if it is \nordinary income.''\n  I believe the time is right to solve them both: fix the deficit and \nfix the Tax Code--whether it is flat or just more flat than it is, \nwhether it is totally simple or more simple than it is. The most \nimportant thing is that it be a part of a twin set of halfbacks that \nhit the line traveling at 9.4 seconds per 100-yard dash and move the \nAmerican economy forward. And it will come from those two sources.\n  So it is not just talk here tonight. It is the most profound \ndiscussion of where we are going. And when you say no one is ultimately \ngoing to be precluded from some sacrifice, I believe that when it is \nfinally accomplished, this bipartisan budget will show there is \nevidence that many, many people want to sacrifice, and many Senators \nwant to be on the side of courage in behalf of our future.\n  I will wish that my comments be totally in error and that tomorrow \nmorning, or 2 days from now, we get a call from the President, and he \nwould say, ``Let us have some Democrats and Republicans come down here; \nI will accept this'' in which event, I say to Senator Chafee, not only \nwould I be speaking what I speak tonight but I believe it would be a \nbreakthrough.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the Senator 20 minutes, in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. President, to rephrase the statement that the chairman of the \ncommittee just indicated, he yielded me 15 minutes in opposition. Well, \nit puts it in a negative term that I did not want to put it in. But I \nam going to outline some of the concerns that I have here.\n  But I agree that this has been a very informative discussion tonight \nand it will be informative tomorrow. I want to join in the general \ntenor of what I have heard here on the floor tonight. I would like to \nhave one of those charts, if you could leave them here for me.\n  I was going to say, Mr. President, that most of the Members of the \ncoalition group--at least on the Democratic side--have been Senators \nthat I have been intimately involved with on fiscal matters ever since \nI have been in the U.S. Senate. I agree with Chairman Domenici that \npossibly out of these discussions tonight and the general tenor of the \nresponses on each side lead me to also agree that we can have a \nbreakthrough.\n  I would simply say that I happen to feel that the President of the \nUnited States has been trying very, very hard to have a breakthrough. \nMaybe we are sowing the seeds of that accomplishment tonight. I will be \nconsulting with the minority leader tomorrow on this. And in the next \nfew days, if we can just separate our differences for what they are--\nfirm differences of opinion--and maybe come to the realization that, \nindeed, we are closer perhaps than we think, just let me note for the \nRecord that, I think, further substantiates this. And in conversations \nthat I have had with members of the 22-member coalition, just let me \nnote that for the record the Chafee-Breaux budget is closer to the \nPresident's budget than to the Republican budget in all key areas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table demonstrating this be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               COMPARISON OF BUDGET PLANS: 6-YEAR SAVINGS               \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Chafee-            \n                                       President's   Breaux   Republican\n                                          budget     budget     budget  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpending cuts:                                                          \n  Discretionary......................        -230       -179       -296 \n  Mandatory:                                                            \n    Medicare.........................        -117       -106       -167 \n    Medicaid.........................         -54        -41        -72 \n    Other health.....................           9          0         10 \n    Welfare/EITC.....................         -43        -45        -70 \n    CPI outlays \\1\\..................           0        -56          0 \n    Spectrum auctions................         -37   ........        -19 \n    Other mandatory..................         -24        -37        -19 \n                                      ----------------------------------\n      Subtotal.......................        -265       -284       -337 \n                                      ==================================\nRevenues:                                                               \n    Tax relief and other.............          99        107        180 \n    Corporate reforms \\2\\............         -40        -20        -21 \n    CPI revenues \\1\\.................           0        -35          0 \n    Other proposals..................          -5          0  ..........\n    Expiring provisions \\2\\..........         -43         -0        -36 \n                                      ----------------------------------\n      Subtotal.......................          11         51        122 \n                                      ==================================\nPolicy savings.......................        -485       -412       -511 \nDebt service.........................         -41        -40        -56 \n                                      ----------------------------------\n      Total savings..................        -525       -452       -567 \n2002 Deficit/Surplus.................           0        -49          0 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Assumes a 0.5% reduction in CPI.                                    \n\\2\\ The Republican plan reconciles a net tax change of $122 billion over\n  6 years, but includes reserve fund language that allows for additional\n  tax cuts on a revenue neutral basis.

Mr. President, it seems to me, if I heard the leader of the \ncommittee correctly, that he has essentially all but endorsed the \nbipartisan commission with the one exception of Social Security. And if \nwe are that close maybe--just maybe--we can solve the problem. But I \nwould remind all that when we get that close there is going to have to \nbe some give and take on both sides in a compromise.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to salute my friends, Senator Chafee from \nRhode Island, Senator Breaux from Louisiana, and all of their \nassociates for their stamina in their efforts to find a middle ground \nin this very, very important debate. Yet, I must say that, while I \nthink this has been extremely helpful, I suggest that they keep on \nsearching. But since I am convinced that they are searching in the \ncrunch of numbers much closer to the President's budget than the \nRepublican budget, there is no question in my mind that they can be \nhelpful in reaching a workable compromise that I have not heard anybody \nobject to tonight. I think everybody is saying we are closer than some \npeople think. But I suggest that they keep working, and I will outline \nsome of the--only three--key points that I have some concern about, and \nI suggest that the President might have some concerns about. That does \nnot mean that we do not want to talk. That does not mean that we are \nsaying the Republican budget is impossible to work with. That does not \nmean to say that we do not think that the coalition budget is a sincere \neffort because obviously it is.\n  So there is much merit to the Breaux-Chafee budget et al. There are \nmany savings that I would simply emphasize once again are very close to \nthose contained in proposals that I have made and, indeed, close to the \nnumbers in the President's budget. But there are three areas--three \nglaring problems--that I see that I want to comment on that force me to \nsay we have to do better. That does not mean that we are not willing to \ncompromise. That does not mean we are not willing to talk.\n  The chairman of the committee said that he hoped maybe that as a \nresult of these discussions the President would call us down to the \nWhite House in the morning. Well, the President has had an invitation \nout for us to come down to the White House every day on the hour, it \nseems to me, in the past several weeks, and he has been frustrated, I \nam sure, with the fact that the Republicans will not come down. In \nfact, the chairman of the Budget Committee on the Republican majority \non the House as much as said that there is no reason to go down there \nbecause we are so far apart. But I see that there are problems in three \nareas which I want to discuss for just a little bit to show that, while \nwe are close, everything is not hunky-dory.\n  We can stand out on the floor of the Senate and pat each other on the \nback, but I, for one, am saying there are still some problems. They are \nnot insurmountable, but there are problems.\n  The first problem that I have is the change in the Consumer Price \nIndex; second, the cuts and the change in the direction of the Medicare \nProgram; and third, the tax cuts.\n  Nonetheless, this proposal is far superior, in my view, than the one \noffered out of the Budget Committee. The proposed adjustment in CPI, I \nsimply say, is no small matter, and it should be fully understood. It \namounts to $126 billion. The numbers speak for themselves.\n  Mr. President, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to \nscrap the CPI adjustments and not bring down the entire Breaux-Chafee \nbudget. I believe that was discussed in some detail in the negotiations \nthat were held between the chairman of the committee and the Breaux-\nChafee group. Therefore, the CPI and the amount of the CPI is \nabsolutely essential to make the Breaux-Chafee budget work unless--\nunless--the Breaux-Chafee group is willing to forgo most of their big \ntax cut.\n  I oppose the change in CPI for the reason that it asks the most from \nthose who have the least. A change in the CPI will not affect the \nlifestyles of Senators or the wealthiest Americans, but it could \ndeliver a devastating blow to seniors and the disabled who depend \nsolely on Social Security and supplemental security income, commonly \nknown as SSI, or those low-income families who get little relief from \nthe earned income tax credit. More than 40 percent of the dollars the \nproposal raises comes from a reduction in projected Social \nSecurity benefits. That is plain and that is simple.\n\n  Mr. President, when one says ``adjust the Consumer Price Index,'' it \nalmost sounds reasonable. Everyone is in favor of an accurate CPI. But \nlet us call this proposal for what it really is--a proposal to cut \ncost-of-living adjustments by half a percent no matter what the \naccurate CPI would be. What that means is that benefits will be cut \nbelow projected levels for Social Security, for earned income tax \ncredit and supplemental Social Security income, for veterans' \ncompensation and pensions for the elderly.\n  Is that where we as a government should be looking first for deficit \nreduction? I suggest not. Over the next 10 years, a half-percent COLA \nchange means $110 billion in less Social Security benefits, $16 billion \nless in EITC, earned-income tax credits, $11 billion less in SSI \nbenefits, and $5 billion less in veterans' compensation and veterans' \npensions.\n  Let me take a moment to talk about the chart that has been moved over \nhere behind me now. It is a very interesting chart, and it tends to \nshow the minimal differences. While they appear minimal, I suggest, to \npeople with the income of those of us in the Senate, it purports to \nshow how little one-half a percent Consumer Price Index change would \nactually cost the beneficiaries, if you do the arithmetic, Mr. \nPresident, and you add up all the cuts that are suggested on that \nchart, they come up to $1,200 per beneficiary, which is real money, \nwhich is real money for people on Social Security.\n  I am not saying that we are not willing to talk about this, but to \nminimize how small this is should be put in the context of the lowest \nincome Americans as far as the fairness test is concerned. And, oh, by \nthe way, there is something that has not been mentioned that we should \nlook into. It seems to me, if we were to proceed along this basis, it \nalso means about a $106 billion tax increase over the same period \nbecause it would bring back bracket creep that we thought we had \neliminated.\n  Mr. President, I have a table which shows the current estimates of \nthe Congressional Budget Office as to where these savings would come. I \nask unanimous consent that this table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           CHANGE IN DEFICIT DUE TO

a minus sign because they reduce the deficit.                                                                      \n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, more than a third of the savings from a CPI \nadjustment suggested here would come from families with annual incomes \nunder $30,000 per year. Ratchet it up just a little bit and 56 percent \nof the burden falls on families with incomes under $50,000 per year.\n  This proposed change in the CPI will hit most middle and lower income \nAmerican families. I suggest, for this reason, this is not shared \nsacrifice, at least in this Senator's book.\n  As I previously mentioned, the proposed change in the CPI exacts too \nmuch from another group of our citizens, the retirees. Under the \nBreaux-Chafee budget, two-thirds of the savings come from retirees \nregardless of income. Let us not forget that Social Security \ncontributes 90 percent or more of the income for about a third of our \nbeneficiaries. It is also the major source of income for two-thirds of \nall of our beneficiaries. When we come up with these easy charts that \nshow how simple and really ``no hurt'' this proposition is, I think we \nneed to look at where it is coming from and who is taking the hit.\n  In addition, the very oldest American would be hit the hardest. COLA \nreductions accumulate, so that the biggest reductions are experienced \nby the retirees at the very end of their lives. It is simply not right \nto take the bread off the table of an elderly citizen--in many cases, a \nwidow who is really now counting every penny. Yes, that is hard for \nmany of us to believe, but that is going on today with many of our \ncitizens who are certainly not well off.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EXON. I will yield at the end of my remarks, and I will be happy \nto do it at that time.\n  It is not right and it is something that I cannot do. That does not \nmean there cannot be changes in COLA's. During the Senate Budget \nCommittee markup of the budget resolution, I supported Senator Brown's \namendment to cap COLA's for upper income Federal and military retirees \nwithin the context of means testing. Some adjustments to cost of living \nmay very well be warranted, but I cannot support a broad CPI adjustment \nthat does nothing to protect the very neediest.\n  I also point my colleagues to the fact that those areas where a firm \nscientific consensus exists about CPI bias have already been \nincorporated into the budget baselines both of the Office of Management \nand Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. So the changes that \nhave been suggested by the bureau are already in place. It is being \nsuggested here that we add 0.5, a half of 1 percent, on top of that. \nThat is where I think we should take a look, take a listen and have \nmore talk. Beyond these areas, there is wide disagreement on many \nsubjects. I, for one, do not believe that we should hazard the \nlivelihoods of the elderly or the working families on such speculation \nto reach a balance. Let us let the professionals at the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics improve the CPI based on sound logic and not political \nnecessity. Indeed, research done at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nwhich produces the CPI, suggests that the elderly's cost of living may \nincrease faster than the CPI because they, the elderly, spend far more \nfor out-of-pocket medical expenses than do consumers generally.\n\n  Back to the situation in another way that I mentioned earlier, when \nyou spend every dollar you receive, these kinds of changes must be \nlooked at very carefully to make sure they are fair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the research \npaper to which I referred just a moment ago be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  That is entitled ``Experimental price index for elderly consumers.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Another thing, it seems to me we should realize and \nrecognize it is one thing to ask Social Security beneficiaries to \ncontribute more as a part of a general reform of the Social Security \nsystem, but it is another thing, another thing altogether, to get \nsavings out of Social Security to help make room for maybe a tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield myself additional time off the resolution that is \nheld in my name.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I would be willing to consider changes to the COLA's, if \nthey would be used as part of a Social Security overall reform package \nwhich we all know we are going to have to face. But I suggest we should \nnot foreclose that next option and use it in the context that it is \nbeing advanced in this area at this time.\n  Mr. President, I believe, and I hope others will believe, we will \nneed a whole lot of savings to address the needs of the baby boom \ngeneration in the next century, especially with regard to Social \nSecurity and Medicare. I believe we would be better served if we \nreserved any savings from Social Security for legislation that will \naddress that problem so that we can ensure that the burden is going to \nbe shared fairly and equitably.\n  In short, I am for honest changes in the cost-of-living adjustment. I \nam not for cuts in COLA's that are not a part of a major overhaul of \nthe Social Security fund, which everyone agrees is not the case in the \npresent legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have concerns about the Breaux-Chafee centrist \nbudget. And I also think there are some excellent things in there. I \nthink it is unnecessary, though, to go after Medicare beneficiaries for \nthe amount of savings that they have outlined. Once again, I will say \nin the spirit I started with, it seems to me the Breaux-Chafee group \nand the Democrats and the President are not far apart on those numbers. \nI think they can be worked out. Although it does shield those in the \nvery lowest income brackets, vast numbers of Americans making less than \n$50,000 would see their share of the premium costs rise, as proposed, \nrise from 25 to 31 percent. The President's budget, I might say, \nmaintains a 25-percent level and still ensures the solvency of the \ntrust fund through the year 2005. Let us not forget, too, that Medicare \nbeneficiaries already pay 21 percent of their income for health care \nexpenses. We should not add to their burden now.\n\n  In addition, by raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67 years of \nage--I am willing to look at that, but I want to look at both the \nupside and the downside. This amendment also denies Medicare benefits \nto a significant number of elderly Americans who have planned on that \ncoverage in their retirement. Remember, most of the 65 and 66-year-olds \nare by no means affluent.\n  As well, Mr. President, the tax cuts in the amendment are larger than \nthose in the President's budget. Again I say--and it has been said by \nseveral Senators here on the floor--I wish we could put off all tax \ncuts of any kind until we are better assured that we will balance the \nbudget by the year 2002.\n\n[[Page S5371]]\n\n That is the way I would like to have it. But I think it is clear that \nthere is such a drive for this, and there has been so much publicity \nabout it that, notwithstanding the concerns of this Senator, it is \nobvious, realistically, that some tax cut will be included because the \nPresident is for it as well.\n  In conclusion, I believe the amendment drafters need to keep working. \nThey do not have to start all over again but I think they have to keep \nworking with us. I simply say without the Breaux-Chafee group, or the \nChafee-Breaux group, we probably would not have much of a chance to \ncome up with a workable package. While I have some concerns about their \nproposal that I have outlined in an honest fashion tonight, I want to \njoin with them in an effort to challenge and change and bring us \naround, and we can bring them around, maybe we can bring the \nRepublicans around, to begin negotiations once again with the President \nat the White House. As we compare budgets, all of the budgets that are \non the table, I still believe--even with its warts, and I think there \nare some warts in the President's budget, and I introduced and asked us \nto use that as the mark--I think the President's budget is the best \nstanding alone of any that I have seen.\n  Having said that, I realize and recognize and want to emphasize once \nagain that the President wants to work together. He has met at the \nWhite House with the Chafee-Breaux group and he has told me that he was \nvery much interested in their presence, their attitude, and what he \ninterpreted as a very sincere effort to get something done. That is the \nbottom line.\n  I say, let us keep working. But I, like the other Members of the \nSenate who have spoken on this tonight, feel this has been a very \ninteresting, very challenging debate, and I am more optimistic than I \nwas, when we started the debate on the budget resolution, of reaching \nsome kind of compromise after the talks tonight than I was when we \nbegan this important exercise.\n  I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from Illinois.\n\n               [From the Monthly Labor Review, May 1994]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Experimental Price Index for Elderly Consumers\n\n                   (By Nathan Amble and Ken Stewart)\n\n       (An experimental consumer price index for older Americans \n     rose somewhat faster than each of two published BLS Consumer \n     Price Indexes; as might be expected, expenditures for medical \n     care accounted almost entirely for this difference)\n       The Consumer Price Index (CPI) of the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics measures the average change in prices over time \n     for a fixed market basket of goods and services for two \n     population groups. The CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) \n     represents the spending habits of about 80 percent of the \n     population of the United States. The CPI for Urban Wage \n     Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is a subset of the CPI-U \n     and represents about 32 percent of the total U.S. population.\n       The 1987 amendments to the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     directed the BLS to develop an experimental index for a third \n     population of consumers: those 62 years of age and older. In \n     its 1988 report to Congress, the BLS observed that from \n     December 1982 to December 1987, the experimental consumer \n     price index for older Americans rose slightly faster than the \n     CPI-U and CPI-W.\\1\\ (See table 1.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Charles C.

analysis of the behavior of the \n     experimental index for older Americans for the period from \n     December 1987 through December 1993. Over this 6-year period, \n     the experimental price index rose 28.7 percent, slightly more \n     than the increases of 26.3 percent for the CPI-U and 25.5 \n     percent of the CPI-W.\n\n\n                   methodology, data, and limitations\n\n       Although the study discussed in this article indicates a \n     higher overall inflation rate for older Americans compared \n     with the rates for the official CPI population groups, any \n     conclusions drawn should be used with caution because of the \n     various limitations inherent in the methodology.\n       Expenditure weights. For each CPI population group, item \n     strata are weighted according to their importance in the \n     spending patterns of the population. The population older \n     Americans used for the experimental price index was defined \n     to be all urban noninstitutionalized consumers units that \n     were either\n       1. unattached individuals who were at least 62 years of \n     age; or\n       2. members of families whose reference person (as defined \n     in the Consumer Expenditure Survey) or spouse was at least 62 \n     years of age; or\n       3. members of groups of unrelated individuals living \n     together who pool their resources to meet their living \n     expenses and whose reference person was at least 62 years of \n     age.\n       In the 1982-84 Consumer Expenditure Survey, which is used \n     as the source of expenditure weights in the current CPI. 19 \n     percent of\n\n[[Page S5373]]\n\n     the total sample of eligible urban consumer units (3.135 out \n     of 16.500) met this definition. Because the number of \n     consumer units used for determining weights in the \n     experimental index as relatively small, expenditure weights \n     used in the construction of the experimental price index have \n     a higher sampling error than those used for the large \n     populations.\n       For each population group, the base expenditure weight of \n     any component represents the actual expenditure on that \n     component in the base period. The relative importance of any \n     component is its expenditure weight (updated for changes in \n     relative prices) and represents the proportion of that weight \n     to total expenditures for the population. The relative \n     importances of selected components for each of the three \n     population groups are shown in table 2 for December 1987, the \n     first month of this study.\n\n   TABLE 2.--COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELATIVE IMPORTANCES OF SELECTED   \n           COMPONENTS OF CONSUMER PRICE INDEXES, DECEMBER 1987          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Experimental\n                                                              index for \n              Component                 CPI-U       CPI-W       older   \n                                                              Americans \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    All items.......................     100.00     100.00       100.00 \n                                     -----------------------------------\nFood and beverages..................      17.61      19.45        15.49 \n  Food at home......................       9.86      11.14         9.79 \n  Food away from home...............       6.19       6.65         4.57 \n  Alcoholic beverages...............       1.55       1.66         1.13 \nHousing.............................      42.48      39.95        48.30 \n  Owners' equivalent rent...........      19.26      16.84        25.47 \nApparel and upkeep..................       6.34       6.36         4.68 \nMedical care........................       5.83       4.95         9.47 \nTransportation......................      17.45      19.41        14.43 \n  Motor fuels.......................       3.29       4.03         2.67 \nEntertainment.......................       4.37       4.04         3.34 \nOther goods and services............       5.93       5.84         4.31 \n  College tuition...................       1.13        .84          .46 \n  Tobacco and other smoking products       1.29       1.70         1.02 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Areas and outlets priced. The experimental consumer price \n     index for older consumers is a weighted average of price \n     changes for the same set of item strata collected from the \n     same sample of urban areas as are used in calculating the \n     CPI-U and CPI-W.\n       Retail outlets are selected for pricing in the CPI based on \n     data reported in a separate survey representing all urban \n     households. The experimental index also uses the same retail \n     outlet sample. Thus, the outlets selected may not be \n     representative of the places where older persons purchase \n     their goods and services.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ The sample size of the current point-of-purchase survey \n     is not adequate to determine whether older Americans \n     typically shop in different types of outlets from those \n     frequented by the general population.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Items priced. As with retail outlets, a major limitation of \n     the experimental index is that the categories of items to be \n     priced are selected using expenditure weights calculated from \n     the expenditure surveys for the urban population. As a \n     result, the specific item classes selected for each stratum \n     may not be representative of those classes used by the older \n     population.\n       Prices collected. A final source of uncertainty about the \n     appropriateness of using the CPI-U prices for the index of \n     the older population concerns the availability of discount \n     prices for older Americans. For example, senior-citizen \n     discount rates are used in the CPI-U in proportion to their \n     use by the urban population as a whole. To the extent that \n     senior-citizen discounts take the form of a percentage \n     discount from the regular price, this may not be a problem. \n     If, however, the discount is not a fixed percentage of the \n     price, the scarcity of senior-citizen discount prices in the \n     current CPI could lead to error in the experimental index.\n       Because of the preceding limitations, any conclusions drawn \n     from the analyses presented in this article should be treated \n     as tentative.\n\n\n                   relative behavior of price indexes\n\n       Table 3 gives the annual price changes in the all-items \n     CPI-U, CPI-W, and experimental price index during the period \n     1988-93. Table 4 shows the behavior of these three indexes at \n     the major component levels during the same period.\n\n   TABLE 3.--PERCENT CHANGE IN ALTERNATIVE CONSUMER PRICE INDEXES, ALL  \n                ITEMS, 12 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER, 1988-93                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Experimental\n                                                              index for \n                Year                    CPI-U      CPI-W        older   \n                                                              Americans \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1988................................        4.4        4.4          4.5 \n1989................................        4.6        4.5          5.2 \n1990................................        6.1        6.1          6.6 \n1991................................        3.1        2.8          3.4 \n1992................................        2.9        2.9          3.0 \n1993................................        2.7        2.5          3.1 \nCumulative change, December 1987-                                       \n December 1993......................       26.3       25.5         28.7 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTABLE 4.--PERCENT CHANGE IN ALTERNATIVE CONSUMER PRICE INDEXES, BY MAJOR\n              COMPONENTS, 12 MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER, 1987-93             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Experimental\n                                                              index for \n              Component                 CPI-U      CPI-W        older   \n                                                              Americans \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    All items.......................       26.3       25.5         28.7 \n                                     -----------------------------------\nFood and beverages..................       24.8       24.8         25.0 \nHousing.............................       23.1       22.4         25.1 \nApparel and upkeep..................       17.7       16.6         16.6 \nTransportation......................       22.8       21.9         25.0 \nMedical care........................       54.2       53.3         59.4 \nEntertainment.......................       25.9       25.0         28.2 \nOther goods and services............       47.0       46.2         41.8 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Over the 6-year period from December 1987 through December \n     1993, the reweighted experimental price index for older \n     Americans rose 28.7 percent. This compares with increases of \n     26.3 percent for the CPI-U and 25.5 percent for the CPI-W.\n       Examining the indexes in more detail, we see that medical \n     care prices during the period rose slightly more than twice \n     as fast as the average for all items in each population \n     group. Because the elderly typically spend more on medical \n     care than does the population as a whole (see table 2), the \n     medical care component accounted for most of the difference \n     between the experimental index and either of CPI-U and CPI-W. \n     In the experimental index, this component increase 59.4 \n     percent during the period 1988-93. By contrast, inflation for \n     the medical care component of the CPI-U was 54.2 percent and \n     that for the CPI-W was 53.3 percent.\n       The price change for each major expenditure component \n     varied by population because the expenditure weights of the \n     items that comprised the major components varied among the \n     three population groups the indexes served. The expenditure \n     weight that an item had in a particular population reflected \n     the importance of that item as a proportion of the total \n     expenditures of that population. For example, the relatively \n     high expenditure weights of the medical care component of the \n     experimental index may largely be attributed to the \n     differences in the nature of the demand for medical care \n     services by the elderly, compared with the demand for such \n     services by all urban consumers or by urban wage earners and \n     clerical workers. Within the medical care component, the \n     elderly had larger out-of-pocket costs relative to both of \n     the other groups chiefly because those groups had employer-\n     provided health care benefits more readily available to them. \n     An analysis of the relative importance of the various \n     subcomponents making up the medical care component for the \n     elderly and for all urban consumers indicates that older \n     Americans devote a substantially larger share of their \n     medical care budget to physicians' services, followed by \n     hospital room stays and commercial health insurance coverage.\n       Of the seven major expenditure components, the apparel \n     category registered the smallest price change for all three \n     population groups over the 1988-93 period.\n       Within the transaportation component, public transportation \n     items such as airline fare, intercity bus fare, intercity \n     train fare, and taxi fare had higher relative importance for \n     the elderly than for all urban consumers. These items \n     contributed to the observed overall higher inflation rates in \n     the transportation component of the experimental index.\n       Like medical care, another expenditure component that rose \n     significantly in all three indexes during the study period \n     was the ``other goods and services'' category. However, \n     unlike medical care, this component recorded the smallest \n     increase in the experimental price index (41.8 percent), \n     compared with the cpi-u (47.0 percent) and the cpi-w(46.2 \n     percent). The reason for the lesser rise could be found in \n     differences in the composition of the three populations. For \n     instance, the cpi-u and cpi-w, with their relatively larger \n     concentration of younger people,had a significantly higher \n     relative importance for college tuition, which increased \n     faster than the average of all items in each year of the \n     study. In addition, the populations of all urban consumers \n     and urban wage earners and clerical workers spend \n     proportionately more for tobacco and other smoking products, \n     which have also typically increased faster in price than the \n     ``other goods and services'' component, of which they are a \n     subcomponent. These items have thus contributed to the faster \n     rise in the ``other goods and services'' component of the \n     cpi-u and cpi-w relative to the experimental price index for \n     older Americans.\n\n\n                       Cost-of-living adjustments\n\n       Adjustments to Social Security benefits are currently based \n     on the percentage change in the cpi-w, measured from the \n     average of the third quarter of one year to the third quarter \n     of the succeeding year.\n       While the Senate Special Committee on Aging stipulated that \n     the current study covers persons 62 years of age and older, \n     this population is not likely to be the most appropriate one \n     for defining and developing an index for use in indexing \n     Social Security benefits. The reason is two-fold. First, many \n     Social Security beneficiaries are younger than 62 years and \n     receive benefits because they are surviving spouses or minor \n     children of covered workers or because they are disabled. The \n     spending patterns of this younger group are excluded in the \n     weights for the experimental index for older Americans. \n     Second, a substantial number of persons 62 years of age and \n     older--especially those 62 to 64 years--do not receive Social \n     Security benefits at all. Although these older consumers are \n     included in the population covered by the reweighted \n     experimental index, they presumably should be excluded from \n     an index designed to reflect the experience of Social \n     Security pensioners. In short, an index designed specifically \n     to measure price changes for Social Security beneficiaries--\n     that is, one that excludes older persons who do not receive \n     benefits, but include younger persons who receive survival \n     and disability benefits--might well show price movements that \n     differ significantly from those of the experimental index set \n     out in this article.\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       This article examined changes in three distinct Consumer \n     Price Indexes--the Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), \n     Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), \n     and experimental index for Americans 62 years of age and \n     older--for the period December 1987 through December 1993. \n     Analysis of the relative behavior of the three indexes at the \n     all-items level reveals that the experimental index rose \n     slightly faster than the two published indexes.\n       The experimental price index, reweighted to incorporate the \n     spending patterns of older consumers, behaves more like the \n     CPI-U than the CPI-W. This is to be expected, because the \n     CPI-U comprises the expenditures of all urban consumers, \n     including those 62 years of age and over. The CPI-W, on the \n     other hand, is limited to the spending patterns of families \n     of wage earners and of clerical workers and, therefore, \n     specifically excludes the experience of families whose \n     primary source of income is from retirement pensions.\n       As an estimate of the inflation rate experienced by older \n     Americans, the experimental index has several limitations. \n     One of these is that the samples from which expenditure \n     weights for the index were calculated are substantially \n     smaller than those used in either the CPI-U or the CPI-W. \n     This means that the experimental price index is subject to \n     larger sampling errors than either of the two official \n     indexes.\n       To produce a more precise CPI for older Americans, sample \n     sizes would need to be strengthened for the Consumer \n     Expenditure Survey to reflect the spending habits of the \n     elderly more accurately. In addition, the point-of-purchase \n     survey and the pricing surveys would need to be improved to \n     reflect which retail outlets and items should be sampled for \n     older Americans. These improvements in the sample design \n     could yield altogether different results from those obtained \n     in the study described in this article. Finally, it should be \n     noted that the medical care component of the CPI has a \n     substantially larger relative weight in the experimental \n     index than in the CPI-U or CPI-W. As a result, this component \n     of the experimental index tends to have a larger impact on \n     the elderly than it does on either all urban consumers or \n     urban wage earners and clerical workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nebraska. There \nis much that is good in this amendment. First of all, I applaud the \nbipartisan effort. We have had excessive partisanship in this body. So \nI like that, No. 1.\n  No. 2, I do differ with my friend from Nebraska in that you do not \ntackle the CPI. I think that has to be done. We cannot play games \nanymore with the American public. We cannot pander, and that is what we \nhave been doing too much of.\n  But I say to my friends from Louisiana and Rhode Island, and they are \nmy friends for whom I have a high regard, what you do in here--and I \nhave talked to both of them about this--you limit direct lending for \nstudent aid to 40 percent.\n  It is very interesting that we finally passed an appropriations bill \nthat knocked out that limit, and today, a committee made up by the Ford \nFoundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and groups from the Business \nRoundtable picked--and I would like the attention of my colleagues from \nRhode Island and Louisiana, because I am going to be asking them a \nquestion. Today, they made their annual clearance for finals in a \ngovernmental award that is given annually for innovation in Government \nthat saves paperwork and saves money.\n  Mr. President, there were 1,656 nominations for various things that \nhappened in the Federal Government. They have narrowed the list to 25. \nAnd guess what? Direct lending is 1 of the 25 that saves money and \nsaves paperwork.\n  The State auditor of Colorado says the University of Colorado alone \nsaves $191,000 a year on direct lending. The Department of Education, \nas a result of the appropriations bill, has increased the number of \nschools, colleges, and universities that can have direct lending from \n1,350 to 1,800, about 45 percent of the colleges and universities of \nthis Nation. Not a single 1 of the 1,350 who are on new direct lending \nwant to go back to the old system. Not a single one. Now we have gone \nfrom 1,350 to 1,800.\n  I ask my friends from Louisiana and Rhode Island, which schools in \nRhode Island and Louisiana do you want to tell you have to go back to \nthe old system, you have to have more paperwork, more costs, and you \ncannot help your students as much?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his comment. I \nparticularly appreciate the comment on probably the most difficult \npoint of our recommendation in our budget resolution, and that is the \nadjustment of the Consumer Price Index, which I think is critically \nimportant.\n  In order to specifically answer the Senator's question, we do not in \nthis resolution make a decision at all on direct lending. We have a \nnumber for the committees. Your committee, the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, will actually have to enact the legislative \nchanges to reach the number we have suggested. They could do that by \nmandating 100 percent of the money be directly loaned or they can do a \ncombination. We have suggested there be a cap to 40 percent, but that \ndecision is going to be left uniquely to the committee of jurisdiction. \nI think the Senator from Illinois serves on that committee.\n  So this budget resolution is totally silent on whether there is a cap \nor whether there is not a cap on direct lending. That would be a \nlegislative decision under the budget reconciliation of the Senator's \ncommittee as to whether that is a good thing to do or not.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. But my staff tells me that if this amendment is adopted, \nwe have a 40 percent cap.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will respond to the Senator, if he will yield further, \nthat really is not correct. The only thing our budget resolution does \nis have a figure for the amount of money that can be spent on \neducation. Your committee, when you get that resolution, will make a \ndecision as to whether there is a cap on direct lending or whether \nthere is no cap at all, as long as you can meet the budget \nreconciliation numbers.\n  Mr. SIMON. I think we can meet the numbers, frankly. I am going to \ncheck with my staff again. I have been told you have this 40 percent \ncap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I yield some time to Senator Simon? I would like to \nmake an observation to you and have an exchange with you on this. In my \nopinion, it is not the prerogative of a budget resolution, nor can it \nset the level of funding between those two programs.\n  If there is some assumption here, that is nothing more than an \nassumption. If there is a dollar number, that means that the committees \nof jurisdiction can proceed to do whatever they see fit within that \ndollar number. You cannot have something binding in that regard. You \nmay have such a low number that you might conclude something is going \nto happen to my favorite program, but I do not believe there can be \nanything in the resolution that says that.\n  Mr. SIMON. The reality is, of course--if I may ask for an additional \n60 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have 1 minute.\n  Mr. SIMON. The reality is direct lending under balanced scorekeeping, \nand we are trying to work that out with your staff right now. Direct \nlending saves money by any normal procedure, as the awards today have \nindicated. I will check this out with my staff. But if there is any \nkind of 40-percent limitation, frankly, I am going to have to oppose \nthis, because I think it just tries to move us in the wrong direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4002\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment 4002 \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott. \nWhile its intent is surely positive, the effect would be to badly \nundermine United States interests with regard to Iraq.\n  First of all, it calls on the President to do something that is \nbeyond is authority. The President does not have the power to \nunilaterally renegotiate the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution \n986, which the United States voted for.\n  Resolution 986 was passed in 1995 to provide humanitarian assistance \nto the Iraqi people, whose suffering Saddam Hussein was cynically \nexploiting to fracture the anti-Iraq coalition.\n  At that time, calls for sanctions to be lifted were increasing in the \nArab world, and even from U.N. Security\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\nCouncil members France and Russia. The consensus on maintaining \nsanctions was eroding.\n  Resolution 986 was a way of demonstrating to the world that our \nquarrel is with Saddam, not the Iraqi people, and to try to relieve \nsome of their suffering, about which Saddam clearly does not care one \nbit.\n  The resolution requires an iron-clad U.N. monitoring program to \nensure that the proceeds from up to $2 billion of oil sales over 6 \nmonths are deposited in a U.N. escrow account, which Saddam cannot \ntouch. They would then be used primarily for humanitarian relief.\n  This morning, Iraq and the United Nations reached an agreement on \nimplementing Resolution 986. Iraq will begin selling its oil within a \nfew weeks. At that time, U.N. monitors will move in to ensure that the \nfood and medicine is used properly and distributed equitably.\n  In addition to humanitarian relief, the funds will be used for two \nother important purposes: To support the U.N. Special Commission on \nIraq, or UNSCOM, which is responsible for finding and dismantling \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction, and which is badly in need of \nfunds; and to support the U.N. Compensation Commission, which settles \ninternational claims against Iraq, for Kuwait, but also for U.S. \ncompanies and individuals harmed by the Iraqi invasion.\n  If we attempt to divert money from these causes, we will send a \nmessage that we don't care about the suffering of the Iraqi people. I \ncannot think of a better way for us to strengthen Saddam's standing \ninside Iraq. He would be able to blame the United States for his \npeople's suffering.\n  Diverting money from humanitarian aid would also threaten to split \nthe coalition. There would be renewed calls for lifting sanctions \noutright, especially in the Arab world. Resolution 986 maintains all \nsanctions on Iraq.\n  We would also undermine UNSCOM's crucial mission to ensure that \nIraq's nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile programs are dead and \nburied. And we would send a message that we do not care about Kuwait, \nor even U.S. citizens, being compensated for losses suffered on account \nof Saddam's invasion.\n  It is certainly reasonable for the United States to seek compensation \nwhenever possible for U.S. operations that support U.N. missions. But \nwhen those operations are in our interest, we need to be prepared to \nshoulder the burden.\n  Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch both serve \nU.S. interests by containing Saddam's military and protecting the Kurds \nand Shiites (not the Sunnis, as erroneously stated in the amendment) of \nIraq. That is why President Bush started both these operations after \nthe Gulf War and why President Clinton has continued them.\n  In 1996, $646 million was authorized for Operation Provide Comfort \nand Operation Southern Watch, out of a total defense budget of $264.7 \nbillion. Do you know what percentage of our defense budget that is? It \nis two-tenths of one percent of our total defense budget.\n  That's right. For two-tenths of one percent of our defense budget, we \nare containing Saddam Hussein's military, preventing him from flying \nhis aircraft or threatening Kuwait, and providing crucial protection to \nthe Kurds and Shiites of Iraq.\n  By any standard, that is a bargain. If we are not prepared to spend \ntwo-tenths of one percent of our defense budget to contain one of our \nmost dangerous adversaries in a crucial part of the world, then why do \nwe even have a defense budget?\n  We shouldn't jeopardize our interests in Iraq by insisting on \ncompensation for conducting operations that are so clearly in our \nNation's national interests. Britain, France, and Turkey also \nparticipate in these operations without compensation.\n  Although conducted with our allies, these operations are primarily \nU.S. operations, which means that we make decisions on how they are \nconducted. If we demand U.N. compensation for these operations, it is \nonly a short leap to granting the United Nations greater say about the \nconduct of the mission.\n  I doubt that the sponsors of the amendment would advocate giving the \nUnited Nations greater control over U.S. troops conducting Operation \nProvide Comfort and Operation Southern Watch, but it seems to be the \ninevitable outcome of demanding compensation.\n  In short, this amendment urges the President to do something that (a) \nhe cannot do, and (b) would badly undermine U.S. interests in Iraq. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n\n\n                        military infrastructure\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to \ndiscuss our nation's security and the importance of adequate support \nfor our military infrastructure.\n  I have long supported maintaining the level of military funding \nnecessary to advance American interests, to honor our commitments \nabroad, and to continue to be an effective advocate for democracy and \nfreedom throughout the world. In my view, we simply cannot expect to \nmaintain our position of world leadership if we do not also maintain \nthe strong military capabilities we have developed in recent years.\n  It was for these reasons that I voted against the amendment recently \noffered on the floor by my good friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley. In my view, the cuts proposed in that amendment are simply \ntoo deep, and could jeopardize vital programs that are instrumental to \nprotecting our national security.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to make clear my views on this \nissue. In committee, I voted for a similar amendment offered by Senator \nGrassley, and I must say in all candor that I was under the wrong \nimpression at that time, Mr. President. My vote in committee was \ninadvertent.\n  I do not mean to say that efforts to achieve more moderate savings \nare not worthwhile. Defense spending without limits, and without regard \nto the recommendations that the Defense Department itself has made, is \nirresponsible. We must continue to balance the very important priority \nsuch as education and the environment.\n  Mr. President, some say that the real threats to our Nation's \nsecurity are not as great as they once were. I would only respond by \nsaying that the potential threats are greater than ever. The advances \nin defense technology we have seen in recent years make possible wholly \nnew capabilities for our military forces, but also require even greater \neffort to avoid losing our edge. Savings are possible, but we must not \nignore the necessity of protecting our Nation's interests. For these \nreasons, I continue to support a level of military spending that \nmaintains the effectiveness of the American fighting force.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senators on the \nfloor, how much time do they want to wrap up the evening? Are there \nsome on your side?\n  Mr. EXON. I have not been advised, but I see the Senator from \nWisconsin seeking recognition. Can he tell us about how much time he \nwould like to have?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Fifteen minutes to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. We knew about that. There is one amendment over here; is \nthat not right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. We have two amendments to dispose of. I hope the people \noffering those amendments will recognize we hope to leave by 10. So \nother than the Senator from Wisconsin on our side, who we agreed will \noffer an amendment, I have no further requests here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I just ask, how long did you say you might speak?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have no further discussion on our \namendment tonight. As I understand it, we have 1 hour equally divided \ntomorrow morning. The plan, as I understand it, is for us to start on \nour hour at 9:30. That is equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. Is that the plan, to go on that at 9:30 in the morning?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe we have reached an accommodation. They will \nbe glad to be here at 9:30. They will take the first hour. That goes \nright up to departure time. There will be some Senators staying here \nduring that hour and a half.\n  Mr. EXON. Oh, we are going to keep the Senate open?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We plan to.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a \ngreat tradition in the law enforcement community in my home State of \nSouth Dakota. On November 15, 1995, for the 14th year in a row, South \nDakota held its Law Enforcement Appreciation Dinner and Charity \nFundraiser. Under the leadership of a great South Dakotan, Gene \nAbdallah, the law enforcement appreciation dinner has grown from a \nsmall, informal gathering to one of the largest annual events in South \nDakota.\n  The Law Enforcement Appreciation Dinner and Charity Fundraiser began \nin 1982. It has raised more than a quarter of a million dollars for \nSouth Dakota charities. The purpose of this annual event is to \nrecognize law enforcement agencies and officers for their dedication \nand service to the public. It also gives South Dakota law enforcement \nthe unique opportunity to gather together.\n  Widely known in South Dakota as ``Gene's Annual Game Feed,'' this \nevent originally was the idea of former United States Marshal Gene \nAbdallah, who served South Dakota pheasant and other wild game to show \nhis appreciation to his fellow law enforcement officers. At that first \ngathering, there were 53 people in attendance. Through the years, this \nevent has grown to a remarkable size today. In 1994, more than 600 \nbusiness and civic leaders attended as special guests, along with more \nthan 800 law enforcement personnel. This event has become one of the \nlargest gatherings of Federal, State, and local law enforcement \npersonnel in the Nation.\n  The appreciation dinner also is dedicated to raising funds for needy \norganizations. In 1994, contributions from the event went to the Ronald \nMcDonald House of Sioux Falls, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the \nChildren's Miracle Network, the South Dakota Special Olympics Torch \nRun, and $10,000 for food baskets for the less fortunate. Funds in 1995 \nwere designated to the young victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, Food \nfor the Less Fortunate of South Dakota, the Muscular Dystrophy Summer \nCamp, and the Spurs Therapeutic Academy.\n  This event would not be possible without the generous support of many \nSouth Dakotans who contribute through the purchase of VIP tables and \nsponsorship donations.\n  Mr. President, with great pride I salute all my friends in South \nDakota who work so hard to make this tremendous event possible. I look \nforward to helping make this year's Law Enforcement Appreciation Dinner \nand Charity Fundraiser the most successful one ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5376-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TIM DOVE, MASTER TEACHER\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I rise today to praise our colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Pressler, for the very important leadership he \nhas provided to open new international air service\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\nmarkets for U.S. passenger and cargo carriers. Senator Pressler's \noutstanding work in this regard has rewarded our economy with enormous \nnew tourism and export opportunities.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, Senator Pressler's outstanding leadership on numerous \ninitiatives this Congress has been deservedly recognized on the Senate \nfloor by Senators from both sides of the aisle. These significant \naccomplishments include passage of the landmark telecommunications law \nand commonsense product liability reform as well as the elimination of \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission.\n  Today, I want to acknowledge another area in which Senator Pressler's \nleadership is paying enormous dividends for consumers and our economy. \nI speak about his bipartisan leadership in the area of creating new \ninternational air service opportunities for our passenger and cargo \ncarriers. Let me add these efforts are in addition to the tremendously \nimportant and longstanding leadership Senator Pressler continues to \nprovide in the areas of air service to small communities and aviation \nsafety--two areas of great importance to me.\n  For instance, just 2 months ago, Senator Pressler's steadfast \nleadership was instrumental in securing a truly historic open skies \nagreement with the Federal Republic of Germany. The potential long-term \neconomic benefits of this open skies agreement are enormous. In fact, \nconsumers traveling to Germany this summer will immediately feel the \nimpact of this agreement. As Senator Pressler has predicted, the United \nStates/German open skies agreement will be a catalyst for further \nliberalization of the very lucrative United States/European Union air \nservice market.\n  Mr. President, I wish to bring my colleagues' attention to two recent \nletters further acknowledging the critical role Senator Pressler played \nin obtaining the United States/German open skies agreement.\n  First, Secretary of Transportation, Federico Pena, recently wrote \nSenator Pressler ``[y]our strong support of the open-skies concept has \nbeen instrumental in making it possible for us to achieve this historic \nmilestone [the U.S./German open skies agreement] in aviation. I applaud \nand greatly appreciate your bipartisan leadership role in the issue of \ngreat importance to all Americans.'' I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of Secretary Pena's letter be inserted in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Second, German Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann recently wrote \nSenator Pressler to ``express my sincere gratitude for your steadfast \nleadership and unwavering commitment to the goal of a fully liberalized \naviation relationship between the United States and Germany. You were a \ncornerstone in the political process in this development.'' I ask \nunanimous consent a copy of Minister Wissman's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I am very pleased to call \nthe Senate's attention to the very important work Senator Pressler is \ndoing in the area of international aviation. His efforts have been \nenormously beneficial to our economy, consumers, and the airline \nindustry.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for letter offering \n     congratulations on the initialling of the U.S.-German open-\n     skies aviation agreement.\n       Your strong support of the open-skies concept has been \n     instrumental in making it possible for us to achieve this \n     historic milestone in aviation. I applaud and greatly \n     appreciate your bipartisan leadership role on this issue of \n     great importance to all Americans.\n       The U.S.-German aviation agreement coupled with the other \n     eleven open-skies agreements in Europe provide the critical \n     mass that guarantees a new era in global aviation--one that \n     relies on the marketplace to determine the kind and quality \n     of air services that are offered to consumers and begins a \n     process that will remove governments from a role in air \n     service decisions. This achievement means that U.S. consumers \n     will benefit from a much greater array of service and price \n     options that will be tailored to their specific needs.\n       I, as you, appreciate the outstanding work of DAS Mark \n     Gerchick in providing the pivotal leadership that made it \n     possible to achieve the agreement with Germany in one round \n     of formal talks. Mark's efforts assured that a difficult \n     negotiation was concluded with amazing speed while achieving \n     all of our open-skies goals.\n       I look forward to continuing our collaboration on this and \n     other issues as we work hard to build a better transportation \n     future for our country. If we can be of further assistance, \n     please contact me or Steven Palmer, Assistant Secretary for \n     Governmental Affairs, at (202) 366-4573.\n           Sincerely,\n     Federico Pena.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   Bundesminister Fur Verkehr,\n\n                                          Bonn, den 12, Marz 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: Thank you for your letter of January \n     1996.\n       I want to express my sincere gratitude for your steadfast \n     leadership and unwavering commitment to the goal of a fully \n     liberalized aviation relationship between the United States \n     and Germany. You were a cornerstone in the political process \n     in this development.\n       Looking back to our meeting in July 1995, I have the strong \n     feeling that at that time together we started to tread the \n     path which finally led to this fine agreement.\n       Your articulate advocacy of the mutual benefits of such a \n     relationship, especially for consumers in both of our \n     countries, continues to be critical in making our open skies \n     accord a reality. I also appreciate your kind words \n     recognizing the special challenge we Germans face in Europe. \n     By working together armed with that understanding, we can \n     convert those challenges to opportunities and, as you have \n     noted yourself, our U.S.-German accord will be the catalyst \n     for expanding the benefits of open skies to Europe as a \n     whole.\n       In this context I also want to commend the admirable \n     endeavors of your collaborator Mike Korens, whose work for \n     this agreement is outstanding. His great personal commitment \n     and constant monitoring since the very beginning of the \n     process has been rewarded with our final success.\n       I want to make use of this opportunity, dear Senator \n     Pressler, to also congratulate you on the telecommunications \n     Law which you authored.\n       I was very sorry to hear that you had to postpone your \n     visit to Germany. Of course I would be delighted to re-\n     schedule your trip in the near future at a time convenient to \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Matthias Wissmann.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5376-6", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5377-S5378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2662.

A bill to revise the boundary of the North Platte National \nWildlife Refuge, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                north platte wildlife refuge legislation\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation along \nwith Senator Kerrey to revise the boundary of the North Platte National \nWildlife Refuge in western Nebraska. This bill, which passed the House \non April 23 of this year, would remove 2,470 acres of land from the \nNorth Platte National Wildlife Refuge.\n  This bill was created through the joint efforts of the community \nleaders of western Nebraska and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It \nis indeed a great example of how government works best when Federal, \nState and local governments work together.\n  The refuge, located just outside Scottsbluff, NE, was established in \nthe early part of this century as a preserve and breeding ground for \nnative waterfowl. The refuge is also home to a Bureau of Reclamation \nirrigation project. Over the years the refuge has been managed jointly \nby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Reclamation. \nThe Fish and Wildlife Service managed the wildlife aspects of the \nrefuge and the Bureau managed the recreation. In 1986, the Bureau \nturned over management of the recreational aspects to the Fish and \nWildlife Service.\n  In 1990, a directive was issued that required the Fish and Wildlife \nService to bring all areas of the refuge, including Lake Minatare, into \ncompliance with Federal regulations. It soon became apparent to local \nresidents that this directive essentially would prohibit all \nrecreational and residential use of Lake Minatare, uses that had been \ncommonplace under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  There was no doubt that this directive would have a significant \nimpact on local tourism and the economy of the Scottsbluff area. \nLikewise, interest in maintaining the recreational use of the lake was \nvery strong among local citizens. At the urging of local leaders, the \nFish and Wildlife Service agreed to perform an environmental assessment \nof the refuge. At the end of their assessment, the Fish and Wildlife \nService concluded that the best course of action would be to end their \njurisdiction over portions of the refuge that were no longer as \neffective as wildlife habitat as they once were and were really better \nsuited for recreational use.\n  I am pleased to report, Mr. President, that this bill has the \noverwhelming support of the Department of the Interior and the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n  I might also mention that my district office in Scottsbluff received \nnumerous letters from local citizens in support of this effort. I am \nproud of the work of the citizens of western Nebraska on this issue and \nof the cooperation they received from the Fish and Wildlife Service. \nThis effort is indeed a fine example of how the Federal Government and \nlocal citizens can and should work together to manage our Nation's \nwildlife areas to the benefit of everyone involved.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to quickly support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Press Release\n\n       Washington, DC--U.S. Senators Jim Exon (D-NE) and Bob \n     Kerrey (D-NE) today introduced a bill that will allow \n     continued recreational use of Lake Minatare near Scottsbluff. \n     The bill would revise the boundary of the North Platte \n     National Wildlife Refuge in western Nebraska so that the lake \n     can continue to be used by boaters, campers, and fishermen.\n       The legislation is needed because of a directive issued in \n     1990 that requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     bring 2,500 acres of the lake and surrounding area into \n     compliance with Federal rules governing the use of wildlife \n     refuges. The directive would declare motorized boats off \n     limits and prohibit the use of cabins near the lake.\n       ``This is an example of how we can work together to change \n     a federal rule that doesn't make any sense,'' Exon and Kerrey \n     said. ``There is no doubt that the original directive would \n     have endangered local tourism and damaged the economy of the \n     Panhandle. This bill will ensure both the protection of \n     wildlife in the refuge and the continued use of Lake Minatare \n     as an important recreation area for Nebraska residents and \n     visitors.''\n       The legislation was created through the joint efforts of \n     community leaders, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \n     state's congressional delegation. Exon and Kerrey said many \n     residents have called their western Nebraska senate office in \n     support of the bill. Representative Bill Barrett introduced \n     identical legislation in the House that passed last month. It \n     is supported by both the U.S. Department of the Interior and \n     the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to the floor today to support the \nNorth Platte National Wildlife Refuge boundary revision. The proposed \nbill would remove about 2,470 acres of land from the refuge and \ntransfer it to the Bureau of Reclamation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService reports that the land, establish as a refuge early in this \ncentury, no longer serves the goals of the national refuge system. \nAlthough the area is no longer suitable as a wildlife refuge, it does \noffer citizens of Nebraska a valuable recreation area. Thousands of \nNebraska's citizens enjoy both water and land recreation in the area. \nThe transfer of the land to the Bureau of Reclamation will allow the \nBureau to lease the land to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission who \nwill manage the property. The Department of the Interior strongly \nsupports this legislation.\n  I commend both Federal and State officials for working closely with \nthe local community to achieve this coordinated agreement. It is a fine \nexample of the Federal Government, the State government, and the local \ncommunity working together to improve the quality and accessibility \npublic areas.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1784. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n     the small business investment company improvement act of 1996\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I introduce the Small Business \nInvestment Company Improvement Act of 1996. Since 1958, firms licensed \nunder the Small Business Investment Company Program have made venture \ncapital investment funds available to small businesses when traditional \nlending sources, such as banks and Wall Street investment firms, would \nnot meet their funding needs.\n  The Small Business Investment Company Improvement Act of 1996 would \ntake some significant strides to enhance the safety and soundness of \nthe SBIC program. For the past year, the Committee on Small Business \nhas conducted a series of hearings on the SBIC program. Government and \nprivate sector witnesses have testified on ways to improve the program \nand build on the legislation passed by the Congress in 1992 that \ncreated the Participating Security Program.\n  This bill incorporates portions of the recommendations from the SBIC \nReinvention Council, operating SBIC's and Specialized SBIC's, and the \nPresident's fiscal year 1997 budget request. The bill would reduce the \nrisk of SBIC defaults by putting in place statutory standards governing \nthe licensing and leveraging of SBIC's. In addition, it imposes \nimportant safeguards governing the operating practices of SBIC's by \nrequiring frequent and meaningful examinations of SBIC licensees and \ntheir investments. This bill would also require that all SBIC's invest \nin smaller enterprises, which are small businesses at the lower end of \nthe eligible size standards. Lastly, the bill would increase fees paid \nby SBIC's to help lower\n\n[[Page S5380]]\n\nthe cost of the program to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the press in Washington likes to \nhighlight conflict and acrimony. In their quest to report the latest \nconflict between Congress and the President, Democrats and Republicans, \nor the House and the Senate, the media generally misses the story of \nRepublicans and Democrats quietly sitting down together to work out \nvery complex and difficult problems.\n  This is a shame, because it leads people outside Washington to think \nthat all we do around here is posture and fight--and that's just not \ntrue.\n  Quite often, Congress and the Administration, the House and the \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans, labor and management, producers and \nconsumers all sit down and work out difficult problems to everyone's \nmutual benefit. It often goes unnoticed. The press never writes a \nstory. The public outside the beltway never hears about it. Such was \nthe case with recent legislation to assist with the privatization of \nthe U.S. Enrichment Corporation.\n  Mr. President, this nation has a uranium enrichment enterprise dating \nback to the end of World War II. Most of the uranium that has powered \nreactors in North America, Europe, and Japan was enriched at plants in \nthe United States, by U.S. workers. This enterprise has suffered under \nthe yoke of government control, and it has steadily lost market share \nto competitors around the world. As a result, the maintenance of a \nsecure, economical domestic enrichment capability was at stake.\n  Certain members of the Senate recognized this problem early on. \nSenators Domenici, Ford and Johnston, in particular, worked to put the \nU.S. Enrichment Corporation, or USEC, on the path toward privatization \nyears ago.\n\n[[Page S5392]]\n\n  I must confess, Mr. President, when I first became familiar with this \nissue as Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I was \nvery concerned that a consensus might not be achievable.\n  We had conflicts between the desire to implement a Russian enriched \nuranium purchase agreement and the legitimate interests of enrichment \nplant workers and uranium producers. We had conflicts between plant \nworkers and plant management. We had conflicts between USEC and other \nentities that desired to get into the enrichment business. We had tough \nissues to resolve that impacted every player in the front end of the \nnuclear fuel cycle, including uranium producers, converters, enrichers, \nfuel fabricators, and utilities.\n  To complicate the picture, we had to address all these thorny issues \nin a manner that would maximize USEC's value without inhibiting \ncompetition in the enrichment market.\n  After hearings, a markup, and many months of work and negotiation \nbetween Senators, Senate staff, Members of the House, House staff, \nrepresentatives of the Administration, uranium producers, labor unions, \nindustry and many others, a bipartisan, bicameral bill slowly began to \nemerge. This was not always an easy negotiation, but those involved \nstuck with it to reach the best consensus achievable.\n  Like any successful negotiation, all sides had to give a little. \nNobody was completely happy. But we got it done and achieved a broad \nconsensus.\n  The USEC privatization bill was included in the reconciliation \npackage which was vetoed for reasons having nothing to do with the USEC \nlanguage. The USEC privatization bill was then presented as a stand-\nalone bill that was placed on the Senate calendar, and the language \nemerging from our consensus was finally included in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill that was recently signed by the President and \nenacted into law.\n  I am pleased that the adoption of this measure will result in the \nlong term viability of a secure, economical, domestic source of uranium \nproduction and enrichment while providing revenues exceeding a billion \ndollars for the U.S. Treasury.\n  Mr. President, I want to publicly thank some of my colleagues who \nwere so instrumental in making this bill a reality. Senators Domenici, \nFord, Johnston, Thomas, and Campbell played key roles in the \nCommittee's deliberations. Although they weren't on our Committee, \nSenators McConnell and DeWine worked behind the scenes, each bringing \nissues to my attention during difficult periods of the negotiation.\n  In particular, I want to mention and praise the efforts of Senator \nDomenici and Alex Flint of his staff. Senator Domenici and Alex were \nworking this measure on a daily basis throughout its formulation, \nintroduction, hearings, markup, the budget reconciliation process, and \nthe omnibus appropriations process. Senators Ford and Johnston, ably \nserved by Sam Fowler, the Minority Chief Counsel of the Energy \nCommittee, were instrumental and absolutely indispensable in the \neventual success of the measure.\n  At the Department of Energy, the personal and intense interest of \nDeputy Secretary Charles Curtis was a key to success. With Charlie's \nhelp we were able to break through some of the customary obstacles that \narise in a protracted negotiation such as this.\n  The consideration of this bill also brought to light a former Energy \nCommittee staff member, Mr. Russ Brown, who now works for USEC in a \nGovernmental Affairs capacity. Russ worked for me on the old Water and \nPower Subcommittee when I was first a subcommittee chairman. Russ got \nto walk the halls of the Senate once again during the consideration of \nthis bill. If there is a bad outcome arising from this bill's passage, \nit's the fact that Russ can't hand around his beloved Senate anymore \nand must return to work at USEC's offices in Bethesda.\n  Let me simply say that there are others I haven't specifically \nmentioned who deserve our thanks and recognition as well. They know who \nthey are, and we are all indebted to their professionalism and \nperseverance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5391-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5392-S5393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE MOST REVEREND DAVID B. THOMPSON; A TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to a revered and respected community figure, a gifted \nteacher and a good friend. This week, Bishop David B. Thompson \ncelebrates three anniversaries at once: that of his birth, May 29, \n1923; his priestly ordination May 27, 1950, and his episcopal \nordination May 24, 1989. It is a truly significant week of the year for \nhim, the Diocese of Charleston, his family and friends.\n  Bishop Thompson was born in Philadelphia to David B. and Catharine A. \nThompson. He has two siblings: a sister, Elizabeth Jane Hutton and a \ntwin brother, also a priest, The Reverend Monsignor Edward J. Thompson, \nwho is retired. The Bishop's studies for the priesthood began \nimmediately after he graduated from High School. He attended St. \nCharles Borromeo Seminary, Overbrook, PA, where he earned a bachelor of \narts and a master of arts degree in history.\n  He earned a licentiate in canon law (J.C.L.) from the Catholic \nUniversity of America while serving as an assistant pastor at Our Lady \nof Pompeii over the summers of 1951 and 1952. In September 1952 he was \nappointed a professor at St. Thomas Moore High School in Philadelphia. \nHe continued to take courses through Villanova University. The Bishop \nalso served the school as a guidance counselor.\n  In 1957, Monsignor Thompson was named the founding principal of Notre \nDame High School in Easton, PA, where he served for 4 years. During \nthat time, he made a name for himself, or rather, the students made a \nname for him. The students had expressed to Bishop Thompson the need \nfor a similar social outlet to American Bandstand. He responded by \nestablishing a Notre Dame Bandstand and hiring Gene Kaye, a disc jockey \nfrom Allentown. Mr. Kaye helped to make it a nationally known event; he \nalso gave Bishop Thompson the name ``Father Bandstand.'' Among the \npeople to appear on stage at Notre Dame were Frankie Avalon, Chubby \nChecker, Connie Frances, Fabian, Annette Funicello, and Brenda Lee. \nWhen Paul Anka performed in the summer of 1960, more than 2,300 \nteenagers were there to hear him.\n  In January 1961, the Diocese of Allentown was created by Pope John \nXXIII. Monsignor Thompson was named the first chancellor of the new \ndiocese and served as the moderator of an $11 million educational \nbuilding campaign. For 22 years, he would serve in the capacity of \nVicar General. In 1967 he was named the pastor of Immaculate Conception \nChurch, the oldest Catholic Church in Allentown. Over the years, he was \ngiven tremendous and varied responsibilities within the diocese, and he \nbrought to each new challenge the wisdom and energy which has become \nhis trademark. He served as the pastor of the Allentown Cathedral \nChurch of St. Catherine of Siena from 1975 to 1989.\n  In 1989, Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop Thompson the 11th Bishop \nof Charleston. He succeeded Bishop Ernest L. Unterkoefler upon his \nretirement in February 1990. Of the numerous accomplishments in Bishop \nThompson's life, from his educational achievements to his high honors \nwithin the church, it is the effect he has on individuals as he carries \nout his life's work that truly sets him apart. During the years of his \nincumbency, Bishop Thompson has traveled thousands of miles to visit \nevery parish and mission in his diocese, which encompasses the entire \nState of South Carolina. He has reinvigorated the Diocese of \nCharleston, vocations have increased 400 percent, and in 1994 alone \nthere were over 30 building projects in the 114 parishes and missions. \nHe has set parochial education standards that have improved the quality \nof diocesan schools throughout South Carolina, and he has encouraged \nyouth participation in the life of the church. He has given so much of \nhimself to the State, being active in local events, and a constant \npresence.\n  On every level, from local to national, Bishop Thompson has been a \ntireless champion of Christian values and humanism. He has been awarded \nthe Tree of Life Award, the Jewish National Fund's highest honor, for \nhis efforts on behalf of interfaith harmony. Under his leadership, the \ndiocese sponsored the Palmetto Project Community\n\n[[Page S5393]]\n\nRelations Forum, an effort to erase racism through friendship. And he \ncontinues to inspire every individual and group with whom he comes into \ncontact.\n  I am truly honored to know this man, and, along with my wife Peatsy, \nI wish him a joyous anniversary celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5392-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5393-S5394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, INC., THE NF SUPPORT GROUP OF WEST MICHIGAN, AND \n                     ROSEMARY AND GILLIAN ANDERSON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on Friday, May 3, 1996, I had the \nhonor and pleasure of hosting a luncheon here in the U.S. Senate on \nbehalf of furthering awareness and understanding of the neurological \ndisorder neurofibroma- tosis. The luncheon, held in the Russell Caucus \nRoom, was sponsored by Neurofibromatosis, Inc., a national nonprofit \norganization with chapters around the country which provides support \nfor individuals and families affected by NF. NF, Inc., also promotes \ngreater education and awareness of NF and helps spur further research \ninto its causes and treatment.\n  Neurofibromatosis is one of the most common genetic conditions of the \nnervous system. NF can strike any family, and there is no known cure. \nNF is a progressive disorder that causes tumors to form on nerves \nthroughout the body. It manifests itself in two genetically distinct \nforms, the most common of which strikes approximately 1 in 4,000 \nindividuals. Although unpredictable, NF can cause hearing loss, vision \nimpairment, seizures, bone deformities, learning disabilities, and \ncancer. Congress has consistently supported aggressive research into NF \nand has encouraged the National Institutes of Health to coordinate \ntheir activities in order to intensify research into NF's link to \nlearning disabilities and its connection to other serious tumor \ndiseases, including cancer.\n  In addition to providing Members and their staff with the opportunity \nto learn more about NF, the luncheon gave the organization's membership \nan opportunity to present awards to several individuals who have made \noutstanding contributions to the cause of finding a cure for and \neffective treatment of NF.\n  Our colleague Senator Nancy Kassebaum was recognized for her work on \nbehalf of NF and other genetic conditions as a member--and now as \nchairman--of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. Dr. \nFrancis S. Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health's \nNational Center for Human Genome Research, also received an award for \nhis work in this area. Much of what is now known about the link between \nNF and human genetics is the result of research conducted by Dr. \nCollins while he was a professor and researcher at the University of \nMichigan at Ann Arbor from 1984 until his selection in 1993 to head the \nhuman genome project. And Dr. Martha Bridge Denckla, director of the \ndevelopmental cognitive neurology division of the Kennedy-Krieger \nInstitute in Baltimore, was named the 1996 NF, Inc., scholar, \nrecognition for the significant contribution she has made to the \nunderstanding of NF and learning disabilities.\n  However, the highlight of this event for me was meeting and talking \nto two other individuals who played prominent roles in the luncheon's \nprogram and who happen to hail from my State of Michigan.\n  The first person, Mrs. Rosemary Anderson, has a long record of \nactivism on behalf of individuals with NF and their families. Rosemary \nAnderson currently resides in Grand Rapids and is co-president of the \nNF Support Group of West Michigan. Rosemary joined a fledgling NF \nsupport group back in the mid-1980's and, shortly thereafter, took over \nrunning it along with another colleague, Bette Contreras. Since then \nshe and Bette have turned this group into an instrument of information, \neducation, and emotional support that has become indispensable to the \npeople of west Michigan with NF and their families. Through Rosemary's \nwork at the NF Support Group of West Michigan, she came to know and \nwork with Dr. Francis Collins during his tenure at the University of \nMichigan. They have continued to stay in touch and remain good friends, \nand therefore, it was quite fitting that Rosemary was chosen to \nformally introduce Dr. Collins at the luncheon.\n  The other person is Rosemary's daughter, Ms. Gillian Anderson. \nGillian, who grew up in Grand Rapids and now lives in Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia, is the star of the hit Fox Network television series, \n``The X Files.'' Gillian was kind enough to appear at the luncheon \nwhich introduced her to Capitol Hill and drew public attention to the \nNF cause. While in Washington, DC, she took other steps to promote \ngreater awareness of NF and to seek increased funding for NF research. \nShe and Rosemary appeared on the local ``Fox Morning News'' show, and \nGillian taped a public service announcement on NF which is to be aired \nnationally over the Fox Network.\n  Mr. President, it was truly wonderful to see how much that crowd \nadmired Gillian Anderson. I think every person who attended that \nluncheon stayed afterward to have their picture taken with her and have \nher sign an autograph for them--either on the NF, Inc. newsletter or on \nmagazine covers which contained her picture.\n  However, I was moved even more by the poignant and compelling remarks \nthat Gillian made as the luncheon ended. Her touching comments, \nrevealing her own experience and perspective regarding NF, captivated \nthe audience. I would like to share her comments with my colleagues \nbecause I think, in many ways, they transcended the issue, \nneurofibromatosis, that brought so many people to that event in the \nfirst place. Her remarks really conveyed the despair and the hope that \nsurround every disease or condition for which there is no cure or \neffective treatment. As intimate and personal as her observations were, \nI believe they warrant expression to a wider audience than was able to \nhear and learn from them that afternoon.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask that a transcript of Ms. Gillian \nAnderson's remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The transcript follows:\n\n\n   REMARKS OF GILLIAN ANDERSON AT NEUROFIBROMATOSIS, INC. LUNCHEON, \n                          FRIDAY, MAY 3, 1996\n\n       Thank you. I am just listening to the very small list of my \n     accomplishments. They seem so insignificant in the presence \n     of such gurus as Dr. Collins and Senator Kassebaum. I'm very \n     honored to be here. But I will say, this is much scarier than \n     any ``X-File'' I've ever encountered.\n       I'm going to read what I've written. I may be able to look \n     you in the eye, but at this point it's written down and \n     hopefully I can make some sense.\n       My first lesson with neurofibromatosis came when I was 16, \n     after we learned that my three and a half year old brother \n     Aaron had it. My mother took me to the first meeting of what \n     was to become the Neurofibromatosis Support Group of West \n     Michigan.\n       I remember the social worker there talking to the 40 or so \n     people who had shown up. There were many who were too \n     intimidated to speak, and there were many who were so excited \n     about the prospect of communicating with people who for the \n     first time understood what they had been going through, and \n     also communicating the fears that they had experienced in \n     their lives, that they couldn't stop talking.\n       I remember in particular one young mother who had just lost \n     her 6-year-old daughter to an NF related brain tumor, and I \n     remember a 60 year old woman who was trying somewhat \n     heroically not to hide the many disfiguring tumors on her \n     face. It was a very broad spectrum.\n       My Mother tells me that some people never actually came \n     back to that support group. I think for the many who remained \n     over the past 11 and some years, that the support group has \n     been there, they have shared in the comfort of unbiased \n     friends and fellow sufferers, and in the slow but gradual \n     understanding of NF and its unpredictable complications.\n       I have watched my brother grow into a sturdy 15-year-old \n     boy. We are among the most fortunate of NF families. My \n     brother is mildly affected; so far so good. But as we learned \n     here today, if we didn't already know, with NF, it is never \n     over. He has a couple of visible tumors, skin tumors, right \n     now. He may have no more; he may have so many more that they \n     are uncountable. We don't know at this point. And then \n     there's always the threat of the more serious tumors which \n     can come about at any time.\n       And I guess my one hope, regardless of what happens in the \n     future for him, is that the ``Joke-meister,'' as we call him, \n     maintains his wonderful sense of humor throughout.\n       But it is not just Aaron and the West Michigan NF \n     community. NF is worldwide, and it can happen in any family. \n     And I must say that if the horror of this disease isn't \n     enough to promote its financial support, something that has--\n     that is just as important, and something you might want to \n     consider as an added bonus, is that the study of\n\n[[Page S5394]]\n\n     NF and neurofibromatosis research is already providing \n     breakthroughs in understanding more about cancer. And we all \n     know how to pronounce that.\n       I want to thank you for having me here, for joining me in \n     an effort to raise awareness of a disease that is in dire \n     need of acknowledgement, community education, and extensive \n     research if we are going to find a cure.\n       Thank you very much.\n       [Applause.]\n       [Small girl hands her flowers.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5393-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       The Senate finds that:\n       Drugs use is devastating to the nation, particularly among \n     juveniles, and has led juveniles to become involved in \n     interstate gangs and to participate in violent crime;\n       Drug use has experienced a dramatic resurgence among our \n     youth;\n       The number of youths aged 12-17 using marijuana has \n     increased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994, \n     and the category of ``recent marijuana use'' increased a \n     staggering 200% among 14 to 15-year-olds over the same \n     period.\n       The Senate finds that:\n       Since 1992, there has been a 52% jump in the number of high \n     school seniors using drugs on a monthly basis, even as \n     worrisome declines are noted in peer disapproval of drug use;\n       1 in 3 high school students uses marijuana;\n       12 to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85% more likely to \n     graduate to cocaine than those who abstain from marijuana;\n       Juveniles who reach 21 without ever having used drugs \n     almost never try them later in life;\n       The latest results from the Drug Abuse Warning Network show \n     that marijuana-related episodes jumped 39% and are running at \n     155% above the 1990 level, and that methamphetamine cases \n     have risen 256% over the 1991 level;\n       Between February 1993 and February 1995 the retail price of \n     a gram of cocaine fell from $172 to $137, and that of a gram \n     of heroin also fell from $2,032 to $1,278;\n       It has been reported that the Department of Justice, \n     through the United States Attorney for the Southern District \n     of California, has adopted a policy of allowing certain \n     foreign drug smugglers to avoid prosecution altogether by \n     being released to Mexico;\n       It has been reported that in the past year approximately \n     2,300 suspected narcotics traffickers were taken into custody \n     for bringing illegal drugs across the border, but \n     approximately one in four were returned to their country of \n     origin without being prosecuted;\n       It has been reported that the U.S. Customs Service is \n     operating under guidelines limiting any prosecution in \n     marijuana cases to cases involving 125 pounds of marijuana or \n     more;\n       It has been reported that suspects possessing as much as 32 \n     pounds of methamphetamine and 37,000 Quaalude tables, were \n     not prosecuted but were, instead, allowed to return to their \n     countries of origin after their drugs and vehicles were \n     confiscated;\n       It has been reported that after a seizure of 158 pounds of \n     cocaine, one defendant was cited and released because there \n     was no room at the federal jail and charges against her were \n     dropped;\n       It has been reported that some smugglers have been caught \n     two or more times--even in the same week--yet still were not \n     prosecuted;\n       The number of defendants prosecuted for violations of the \n     federal drug laws has dropped from 25,033 in 1992 to 22,926 \n     in 1995;\n       The efforts of law enforcement officers deployed against \n     drug smugglers are severely undermined by insufficiently \n     vigorous prosecution policies of federal prosecutors;\n       This Congress has increased the funding of the Federal \n     Bureau of Prisons by 11.7% over the 1995 appropriations \n     level;\n       This Congress has increased the funding of the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service by 23.5% over the 1995 \n     appropriations level;\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     underlying this resolution assume that the Attorney General \n     promptly\n\n[[Page S5395]]\n\n     should investigate this matter and report, within 30 days, to \n     the Chair of the Senate and House Committees on the \n     Judiciary.\n       That the Attorney General should change the policy of the \n     United States Attorney for the Southern District of \n     California in order to ensure that cases involving the \n     smuggling of drugs into the United States are vigorously \n     prosecuted; and\n       That the Attorney General should direct all United States \n     Attorneys vigorously to prosecute persons involved in the \n     importation of illegal drugs into the United States.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This amendment, Mr. President, is a sense of the Senate \nthat says funding in the resolution assumes that the Attorney General \nshould conduct an investigation promptly into a number of areas and \nreport to them. If the reports that have been made are correct about \nthe administration's prosecution of drug smugglers, they are \ndisturbing. This asks for certain reports. I have nothing further on \nthe amendment.\n  Now, if Senator Feingold can proceed, we will follow the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I very much thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for their courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside temporarily so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3969\n\n                  (Purpose: To eliminate the tax cut)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. \n3969, and I call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Simon, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Robb proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3969.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  After the debate of the past year, a casual observer might believe \nthat we have finally achieved a broad political consensus that we must \nbalance the budget. Republicans and Democrats and bipartisan groups \nhave all offered plans to balance the budget over the next 6 years. The \nPresident has submitted a budget that reaches balance in 6 years, and 5 \nyears if you use the assumptions and numbers of the OMB. This budget \nresolution provides for a balanced budget by 2002, as do several \nalternatives that we have been debating in the process of looking at \nthat budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, one might think that it is only a matter of moving \nahead with these various plans until a proposal that can be enacted \nsimply evolves from the political process. Mr. President, the balanced \nbudget veneer of many of these proposals and of this budget resolution \nin particular obscures a flaw that will make it difficult and maybe \nimpossible to eliminate the deficit and reach balance despite this \napparent consensus.\n  Mr. President, that flaw is the massive tax cut that has been \nproposed and is still being proposed.\n  Let me quickly add that this problem is certainly not unique to the \nbudget resolution before us. The plan that was discussed extensively \ntonight, the Chafee-Breaux plan, has this defect, and to a lesser \nextent, the President's plan has this flaw as well.\n  In fact, of course, I was pleased to hear all the bipartisan \ncooperation on the Chafee-Breaux plan, but as the distinguished ranking \nmember has pointed out just a few moments ago, the money that is raised \nfrom the changes in the Consumer Price Index, in the CPI, are not under \nthe Chafee-Breaux plan going to be used to reduce the deficit. They are \ngoing to be used to fund a tax cut. That is not pleasant, but it is the \ncold, hard fact. In their plan, the Chafee-Breaux plan, there is $126 \nbillion in changes in the CPI, and lo and behold, $130 billion in tax \ncuts. It is almost a dollar-for-dollar transfer from CPI to tax cuts. \nIt is not a dollar-for-dollar transfer from CPI to deficit reduction.\n\n  So it is not being used for deficit reduction. As the distinguished \nranking member points out, those funds from the CPI are not even being \nused for purposes of bolstering the Social Security trust fund. These \nare two purposes that I think rank much higher than a tax cut at this \ntime.\n  So the question is whether this flaw of including a tax cut is a \nfatal flaw. It is debatable. But I think it may well be a fatal flaw of \nthe plans before us.\n  I think these tax cuts being included are certainly irresponsible \nbudgeting. It is a risk not worth taking when we have the central and \ncritical goal being to actually eliminate the Federal deficit over the \nvery few next years.\n  Mr. President, I have opposed major tax cut plans of both parties for \nsome time now. I was the first Member of either body to do so. I can \nattest that it is not very much fun to oppose tax cuts or to oppose a \nPresident of your own party on such an issue.\n  I am proud to say, though, we have had some good company. Three of \nthe Senate's most ardent champions of deficit reduction, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, and my \nneighbor and good friend, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Simon, have \nconsistently opposed these reckless tax cuts. I am pleased that they \nare cosponsors of the amendment that I have just offered.\n  I am also very pleased, Mr. President, to tell you that we have the \nsupport for this amendment of the Concord Coalition, which does believe \nthat tax cuts are not the top priority but that deficit reduction is.\n  Mr. President, in many ways the concerns of those of us who have \nfought these fiscally irresponsible tax cuts have been realized. The \ninitial call for major tax cuts in the Contract With America, followed \nby the President's own proposals, has in fact, as we feared, led to a \nbidding war on tax cuts. We have too easily moved away from the deficit \nreduction track. We are still consumed with enacting tax cuts no matter \nwhat cost that has for the integrity of the budget process.\n  Mr. President, every time you turn around, we are bumping into \nanother proposal for some other kind of tax cut, whether well disguised \nor not.\n\n[[Page S5396]]\n\n They come in all shapes and sizes. Some come clothed as tax reform. \nThe so-called flat tax plans we saw offered during the Presidential \nprimaries were really nothing more than plans to cut certain taxes. You \ndid not see anyone calling for a flat tax that raised taxes for anyone. \nAll the plans that were put forward touted tax cuts. In fact, the \ndebate on the flat tax really amounted to which flat tax plan cuts \ntaxes the most.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a trendier tax cut \nplan is a 15 percent across-the-board cut in income tax rates, phased \nin over 3 years. I am sure we will be hearing a lot more about that \nbefore the summer is out. Let me add to this display of a trend on tax \ncuts, especially in recent weeks.\n  We have just spent 2 weeks debating on and off the issue of a 4.3-\ncent gas tax cut, and the other body has sent us a $1.7 billion special \nadoption tax credit and is working on another $7 billion tax cut for \nsmall businesses. This is beginning to look, Mr. President, like a \nstampede for tax cuts. As I said, unfortunately, even the bipartisan \nbudget alternative includes major tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, let me say again, and I know you have been a very \nvalued participant in this process. I have enormous respect for those \nwho participated in putting together the bipartisan plan. I think a \nmajority of that group is committed to a balanced budget plan, and I \nthink they would have supported the plan without including the tax \ncuts. I regret the views of a few in the group who actually prevailed \non the tax cut issue. Rather than broadening the appeal for the plan, \nas I think some of the group hoped the tax cuts undermined the long \nterm fiscal and political integrity of the budget plan, and I believe \nit cost the plan some significant support both within the Congress and \namong the American people who know very well you can only spend a \ndollar once--either for tax cuts or you can spend it to balance the \nbudget--but you cannot spend it for both.\n  Mr. President, even discounting the short-term effect of election-\nyear politics, we have again really strayed from the course of reducing \nthe deficit. For those whose highest economic priority is a balanced \nbudget, our worst fears may be realized. A tax cut bidding war still \ndominates the policy debate. Tax cuts, tax cuts--not the need to \nbalance the budget--are the driving force behind many of the policy \ndecisions in this resolution.\n  Mr. President, those who doubt this need only look to the highly \nunusual, almost unprecedented, unprecedented special tax cut \nreconciliation measure envisioned in this resolution. In this ``bucket \nbrigade'' construction of three successive reconciliation bills, it is \nthe tax cut legislation that is the end game. That is the end goal of \nthis technique.\n  I am told that the parliamentary skids have been greased for that tax \ncut reconciliation bill and that there may have been some precedent for \nit in the past. Nevertheless, it is, at best, ironic and, at worst, \noffensive to grant a tax cut bill the special procedures normally \nreserved for legislation to reduce the deficit.\n  Mr. President, let me just close by suggesting this vote is more than \njust a good vote for the Concord Coalition scorecard, though it \ncertainly is that. It is a vote against this insane tax cut bidding \nwar. It is a vote to get us back on track, to reducing the deficit and \nbalancing the budget. Mr. President, I believe it is a vote for a \nsensible and sound budgeting process.\n  Mr. President, I urge the body to consider this alternative. If you \ntake a look at the plan offered by the bipartisan group, all you have \nto do is eliminate the tax cuts and the whole issue of the CPI would be \nalso eliminated and you would have a balanced budget. It is as simple \nas that.\n  I hope as the negotiations and discussions continue people realize we \nhave an even simpler solution before us, and that is to forego the tax \ncuts, balance the budget first, and then I think all of us will be \neager to find the opportunity to reduce taxes for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/20/senate-section/article/S5394-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
